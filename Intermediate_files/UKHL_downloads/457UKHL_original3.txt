<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;37. When the prosecuting authority notifies a court administration officer of a prospective court-martial, that officer must by order convene a court-martial of the required description (section 84C(1)).  The order will specify which officers are to be members of the court-martial and which officer is to be president.  It will also state that a judge advocate appointed by or on behalf of the Judge Advocate General is to be a member of the court-martial.  The legislation prevents various people from sitting on the court-martial because their previous involvement might prejudice their independence or impartiality (section 84C(4)).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;38. The composition of both a general and a district court-martial must include a judge advocate in addition to the prescribed number of officers:  section 84D(1) and (2).  The judge advocate to sit on a particular court-martial is appointed by the Judge Advocate General under section 84B(1).  No one can be appointed as a judge advocate unless he has had rights of audience in the higher courts of the United Kingdom for at least five years (section 84B(2)).  At the court-martial the judge advocate is robed and sits in the centre with the president of the court-martial and one of the officers to his left and with the other officer to his right.  All rulings and directions on questions of law (including questions of procedure and practice) are given by the judge advocate and are binding on the court:  section 84B(3) and (4).  In these respects the judge advocate's relationship with the other members of the court is similar to the relationship between a Crown Court judge and the members of the jury.  Indeed counsel explained that the judge advocates have available to them the same model directions prepared by the Judicial Studies Board as are available to Crown Court judges and that, when the members of a court-martial are to consider their verdict, the judge advocate directs them in just the same way as a Crown Court judge would direct the members of a jury.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;39. At the start of the proceedings the accused has the right to object, on any reasonable grounds, to any member of the court (section 92(1)).  The officers sitting on the court-martial who are to try the case take an oath, recorded in the judgment in <i>Morris v United Kingdom</i> 34 EHRR 1253, 1265, para 27:</p>
<p></p><ul>"I swear by almighty God that I will well and truly try the accused before the court according to the evidence, and that I will duly administer justice according to the Army Act 1955 without partiality, favour or affection, and I do further swear that I will not on any account at any time whatsoever disclose or discover the vote or opinion of the president or any member of this court-martial, unless thereunto required in the due course of law."<p></p></ul>
<p>The decision of a district court-martial on the accused's guilt or innocence is taken by the president and the two other officers applying the directions on law which the judge advocate has given them.  They deliberate in private, without the judge advocate (section 94(6)).  They reach their verdict by a vote and, unlike the position in a jury trial in England and Wales but like the position in Scotland, the accused may be convicted by a simple majority (section 96).  In terms of their oath, the members of the court-martial are forbidden to reveal the vote or opinion of any member.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;40. The decision on sentence is reached by vote of all the members of the court-martial, including the judge advocate who may, in addition, give the other members guidance on the appropriate sentence to be imposed.  Moreover, in terms of rule 80(2) of the Rules the reasons for the sentence must be given by the judge advocate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;41. Lord Thomas's submission that the appellants' rights under article 6(1) had been infringed did not depend on any specific circumstances relating to their trials or to the individuals who had made up the courts-martial:  rather, his was a general challenge to the system of trial of civil offences allegedly committed in the United Kingdom by courts-martial duly set up in accordance with the legislation.  In such cases courts-martial did not constitute an independent and impartial tribunal.  In support, Lord Thomas cited the dissenting opinion of Laskin CJC in <i>MacKay v The Queen</i> 114 DLR (3d) 393, 401-402 where he was considering the case of a serviceman who had been tried by court-martial for various drugs offences under the Narcotic Control Act 1970.  The Chief Justice said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In the present case, the charges against the accused were laid by the accused's commanding officer.  The standing court martial was ordered by a senior commander and a member of the armed forces, a lieutenant-colonel, was appointed from an approved list as the standing court martial pursuant to section 154 [of the National Defence Act 1970].  Both the officer constituting the standing court martial and the prosecutor were part of the office of the Judge Advocate-General.  In short, the accused, who was tried on charges under a general federal statute, the Narcotic Control Act, was in the hands of his military superiors in respect of the charges, the prosecution and the tribunal by which he was tried.  It is true that the Court Martial Appeal Court, consisting under section 201 … of the National Defence Act, of judges of the Federal Court of Canada and additional superior court judges appointed by the Governor in Council, exhibits independence and the appearance of independence in its composition but the same cannot be said of the constitution of a standing court martial when trying an accused for breach of the ordinary criminal law.  Needless to say, there is no impugning of the integrity of the presiding officer;  it is just that he is not suited, by virtue of his close involvement with the prosecution and with the entire military establishment, to conduct a trial on charges of a breach of the ordinary criminal law.  It would be different if he were concerned with a charge of breach of military discipline, something that was particularly associated with an accused's membership in the armed forces.  The fact that 'service offences' are so broadly defined as to include breaches of the ordinary law does not, in my opinion, make a standing court martial the equivalent of an independently appointed judicial officer or other than an ad hoc appointee, having no tenure and coming from the very special society of which both the accused, his prosecutor and his 'Judge' are members:  cf<i>  Committee for Justice and Liberty et al v National Energy Board et al </i>(1976) 68 DLR (3d) 716, [1978] 1 SCR 369, 9 NR 115.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>In my opinion, it is fundamental that when a person, any person, whatever his or her status or occupation, is charged with an offence under the ordinary criminal law and is to be tried under that law and in accordance with its prescriptions, he or she is entitled to be tried before a court of justice, separate from the prosecution and free from any suspicion of influence of or dependency on others. There is nothing in such a case, where the person charged is in the armed forces, that calls for any special knowledge or special skill of a superior officer, as would be the case if a strictly service or discipline offence, relating to military activity was involved."<p></p></ul>
<p>The Chief Justice went on to conclude that the trial of the appellant for a contravention of section 3 of the Narcotic Control Act offended section 2(f) of the Canadian Bill of Rights 1960 in that he was not tried by an independent and impartial tribunal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;42. Lord Thomas also referred to the opinion of Lamer CJC in the later case of <i>R v Généreux</i> [1992] SCR 259, 294 - 295 where he accepted that a military code of discipline would be less effective if the military did not have its own courts to enforce its terms, but continued:</p>
<p></p><ul>"However, I share the concerns expressed by Laskin CJC and McIntyre J in <i>R v MacKay</i> with the problems of independence and impartiality which are inherent in the very nature of military tribunals.  In my opinion, the necessary association between the military hierarchy and military tribunals - and the fact that members of the military serve on the tribunals - detracts from the absolute independence and impartiality of such tribunals.  As I shall elaborate in greater detail below, the members of a court martial, who are the triers of fact, and the judge advocate, who presides over the proceedings much like a judge, are chosen from the ranks of the military.  The members of the court martial will also be at or higher in rank than captain.  Their training is designed to insure that they are sensitive to the need for discipline, obedience and duty on the part of the members of the military and also to the requirement for military efficiency.  Inevitably, the court martial represents to an extent the concerns of those persons who are responsible for the discipline and morale of the military.  In my opinion, a reasonable person might well consider that the military status of a court martial's members would affect its approach to the matters that come before it for decision."<p></p></ul>
<p>The Chief Justice went on ([1992] SCR 259, 301 - 310) to identify and analyse a number of aspects of the Canadian system of courts-martial at the time which, in his view, gave rise to concern as to their independence.  Some of these related to the position of the judge advocate, about which there is no issue in the present appeals.  Others arose out of the possibility that the performance of the officer members of courts-martial would be taken into account in determining their pay - not, as such, a possibility raised in the present cases.  The Chief Justice also criticised the role of the convening officer who not only convened the court-martial and decided who would sit, but also, with the consent of the judge advocate, appointed the prosecutor.  It would thus be fair to say that some, at least, of the features of the system described and criticised by the two Chief Justices in <i>R v MacKay</i> and <i>R v Généreux</i> resemble features of the British system of courts-martial as it was in <i>Findlay v United Kingdom</i> before the reforms introduced by the 1996 Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;43. In both these passages on which Lord Thomas relied, a distinction is drawn between courts-martial trying military offences and courts-martial trying civil offences.  Lord Thomas adopted the same distinction, limiting his challenge to trial of civil offences by court-martial in this country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;44. Despite the apparent support for it in the passages which I have quoted from the Canadian cases, I am unable to accept such a distinction.  In principle, either a tribunal is independent and impartial or it is not.  If it is, then it is independent and impartial whatever the offence it is trying, wherever the offence may have been committed and wherever the tribunal may be sitting;  equally, if it is not, then it is not independent or impartial whatever the offence it is trying, wherever the offence may have been committed and wherever the tribunal may be sitting.  So far as military offences are concerned, members of courts-martial may have a particular familiarity with the issues and values that underlie them.  That familiarity cannot, however, justify the members in reaching a decision on conviction or sentence that is anything other than the decision of an independent and impartial tribunal.  The article 6 guarantee applies in the trial of such purely military offences, just as it does in the trial of civil offences.  And this is indeed plain from the decision of the European Court in <i>Morris v United Kingdom</i> 34 EHRR 1253 where article 6 was held to apply in the case of an applicant who had pled guilty to the military offence of being absent without leave.  Indeed it would be astonishing if the standards of independence and impartiality required of a court-martial trying, for instance, the purely military offence of mutiny, which may attract the most severe punishment, were one whit less strict than those required of a court-martial trying the civil offence of assault.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;45. So far as courts-martial held abroad for offences committed abroad are concerned, as McIntyre J pointed out in a passage in his judgment in <i>MacKay v The Queen </i>114 DLR (3d) 393, 421 which I quote in paragraph [52] below, the character of the members of the court-martial for independence and impartiality can hardly vary, depending on where they happen to be called on to sit.  Lord Thomas eventually contended, however, under reference to <i>Golder v United Kingdom</i> (1975) 1 EHRR 524, that article 6 might be subject to an inherent limitation that would make it inapplicable to overseas courts-martial.  I did not find the submission compelling.  But, even if any such limitation could apply, it could do so only in the most extreme circumstances, such perhaps as required the convening of a field general court-martial;  it could certainly not apply in the case of a court-martial held in peacetime in a country such as Germany with a sophisticated local criminal justice system.  Indeed Lord Thomas himself really accepted this since he was representing the appellants in <i>R v Spear</i> whose contention is that their article 6(1) rights were infringed in the case of a court-martial held in Osnabrück in Lower Saxony in respect of an assault in Army barracks in Münster in Westphalia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;46. For these reasons, while the certified question in <i>R v Saunby</i> concerns only courts-martial trying civil offences, in my view the issue of principle is whether, in any case where it is permitted, trial by court-martial infringes the accused's article 6 rights.  Indeed the only justiciable issue for your Lordships' House is whether the appellants' article 6 rights have been infringed by reason of their trial by court-martial.  Even though the logic of his position was that most of the appellants should have been tried by jury, Lord Thomas, of course, acknowledged that article 6 conferred on them no right to jury trial.  Hence they could not base their case against trial by court-martial on the simple fact that it was not trial by jury.  Nor, in its judicial capacity, is this House concerned with whether, as a matter of policy, trial of civil offences by the civil courts might be preferable to trial by court-martial.  But certain of the submissions advanced by Lord Thomas verged at least on policy arguments in favour of reforming the present system.  For instance, he argued that the continued existence of a parallel system of trial by court-martial of civil offences ran counter to general developments over the last 40 years.  Courts-martial were redolent of out-of-date attitudes of deference to rank.  The formality of the proceedings, with the accused being marched into court under escort and with special rules, for instance, about wearing and removing head-dress, made them intimidating to both the accused and witnesses.  All these undesirable features could be remedied by trying civil offences in civil courts.  Lord Thomas had to accept, of course, that in certain respects trial in a civil court might even seem to be more intimidating:  for instance, in a civil court the accused would sit in the dock, while in a court-martial he sits beside his defending counsel.  Mr Havers indicated that the formality of court-martial proceedings had been considerably relaxed in recent years.  The briefing notes provided to members of courts-martial certainly envisage that there can be some reduction of formality at times.  The members are told that, if a plea of guilty is tendered, the accused and escort can be instructed to sit and the accused can be told to remove his head-dress.  They are also told that, if the accused is unrepresented and has to be asked questions by the judge advocate, to make sure, in terms of rule 46(1) of the Rules, that he understands the nature of the charges and the general effect of his plea, there is no reason why the accused and his escort should not sit for that part of the proceedings.  There may indeed be some further room for relaxation and, doubtless, those who are familiar with Service life and with the conduct of courts-martial today will continue to keep the remaining formalities under review.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;47. None of these matters highlighted by Lord Thomas is for the judgment of the House except in so far as it might have a bearing on whether trial by court-martial infringes the accused's article 6 rights.  In the end Lord Thomas did not contend that they were, whether individually or cumulatively, of critical significance for that core issue.  When the core issue before the House is formulated in this way, then at one level the answer is straightforward.  The case law of the European Court shows that, in principle, trial by court-martial does not infringe an accused's right to a fair trial under article 6.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;48. In <i>Engel v The Netherlands</i> <i>(No 1)</i> 1 EHRR 647 five members of the Netherlands armed forces were punished by their commanding officers for offences against military discipline.  They appealed to the Supreme Military Court which confirmed their commanding officers' decisions.  The applicants brought proceedings in Strasbourg alleging breach of their rights under various articles of the Convention, including article 6.  In this connection the European Court, at pp 657-658, para 30, considered the composition of the Supreme Military Court.  It comprised six members:  two civilian jurists, one acting as the court's president, and four military officers.  The civilian jurists had to be justices of the Dutch Supreme Court of Judges of the Court of Appeal and they were appointed by the Crown on the joint advice of the ministers of justice and defence for a term of office that was similar to their judicial term.  The military members were also appointed by the Crown on the recommendation of the ministers of justice and of defence but they could be dismissed by the Crown on the recommendation of the same ministers.  The military members could therefore, in theory, be removed without observance of the strict requirements and legal safeguards that applied to the civilian members.  On the other hand, their appointment as military members of the court was normally the last in their service career and, in their functions as judges on the court, they were not under the command of any higher authority and they were not under a duty to account for their acts to the service establishment.  On assuming office, all members of the court swore an oath to be just, honest and impartial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;49. The European Court held, at pp 679-680, para 85, that in the case of three of the applicants the charges against them fell within the criminal sphere and that the Convention therefore obliged the authorities to afford them the guarantees under article 6.  The court went on to hold, at p 680, para 89, that the Supreme Military Court constituted an independent and impartial tribunal established by law and that there was nothing to indicate that it had failed to give the three applicants a fair hearing.  There was therefore no breach of article 6 in this respect, although the European Court did go on to find, at p 681, para 89, that the applicants' rights under article 6(1) had been infringed because the proceedings in the Supreme Military Court had taken place in camera.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50. In <i>Morris v United Kingdom</i> 34 EHRR 1253, 1274, para 59 the European Court said this:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The court notes that the practice of using courts staffed in whole or in part by the military to try members of the armed forces is deeply entrenched in the legal systems of many member states.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>It recalls its own case law which illustrates that a military court can, in principle, constitute an 'independent and impartial tribunal' for the purposes of article 6(1) of the Convention.  For example, in the above-mentioned <i>Engel [v The Netherlands (No 1)] </i>case, the court found that the Dutch Supreme Military Court, composed of two civilian justices of the Supreme Court and four military officers, was such a tribunal.  However, the Convention will only tolerate such courts as long as sufficient safeguards are in place to guarantee their independence and impartiality."<p></p></ul>
<p>While it is perhaps possible to detect some lack of enthusiasm in the use of the term "tolerate", the passage shows clearly that, in principle, a military court can constitute an independent and impartial tribunal in terms of article 6(1).  What is required is that there should be sufficient safeguards of the independence and impartiality of its members.  Applying that approach, I would reject Lord Thomas's submission that, of its very nature, trial of civil offences by court-martial is incompatible with article 6(1).  In principle such a trial can fully satisfy the requirements of article 6 that the tribunal should be independent and impartial and that the accused should have a fair trial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;51. That being so, it is not necessary to "justify" trial by court-martial, whether by reference to the history of the system here and in many other countries or by reference to the situation of the Services today.  Lord Thomas suggested that the Government and the armed forces wished to retain courts-martial for civil offences for no other reason than that the system exists and the staff are there to run it.  I should therefore not wish to leave unmentioned the substantial arguments that can be advanced in favour of a system of trial by court-martial that covers both military and civil offences.  The case is put forcefully in the witness statement dated 12 July 2001 of Air Chief Marshal Sir Anthony Bagnall, the Vice Chief of the Defence Staff.  Before making the statement Sir Anthony had consulted senior members of all three Services.  Describing what he regarded as the special circumstances underpinning section 70 of the Acts and section 42 of the Naval Discipline Act 1957, he said inter alia:</p>
<p></p><ul>"4.&nbsp;&nbsp;First and foremost of the special circumstances of the armed forces is that the willingness and readiness of every member and unit of the armed forces to act with the greatest possible speed and efficiency is essential for the defence of the realm from outside attack, for acting in operations outside the United Kingdom and sometimes for acting in aid of the civil power (as in Northern Ireland).  It is essential that this readiness be maintained at all times, not only in times when a threat is immediate.  It applies with equal importance wherever a unit is based.  The RAF, for example, must be ready to act anywhere from its bases within the United Kingdom.  Success in operations depends on the ability of all members of a unit to act together as a single fighting force, in other words on operational efficiency.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the requirements of Service discipline reflect the fact that their fundamental purpose is essentially to fight.  The Services are armed organisations, required to train and fight in circumstances of extreme hardship, as has most recently been demonstrated in Northern Ireland, the Gulf, Kosovo and Sierra Leone.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance of their functions involves, not merely working together, but living together, often in conditions - whether in Northern Ireland, the Falkland Islands or Kosovo - of hardship, stress and danger.  Yet, in carrying out these functions it is of the greatest importance that they retain respect for the civilians among whom they operate, civilians who, whether in Northern Ireland or abroad, may be unsympathetic or even hostile.  The fundamental purpose of a military justice system is to foster and promote the discipline and self-control required for the maintenance of the capability to act as an efficient fighting force, that is to say, operational effectiveness.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the combination of the need for utmost readiness, unit solidarity and deeply imbued self-control over long periods and often in most difficult situations which necessitate a comprehensive system of command and discipline, and require that this system should be capable of dealing fairly and, where possible, promptly with misconduct involving a criminal offence.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;These factors make Service life unique, but, while they are all important, I should make a further point about one of them.  Members of the regular armed forces do not simply do a job.  They are at all times members of the armed forces, very often sharing accommodation, whether barracks or temporary accommodation, even in peacetime.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;The special status of members of the armed forces means that an act which may be a criminal offence under civilian criminal law also has a disciplinary aspect when committed in a Service environment.  The commanding officer is at the centre of the system of discipline.  He is responsible for the behaviour of those under his command, both among themselves and in relation to the local community.  As a result of the circumstances I have already referred to, the CO's powers of discipline are necessarily wide.  He is able to deal summarily with a wide range of misconduct, including both criminal and purely Service offences.  His powers include limited powers of detention (basically a maximum of 28 days but up to 60 days with the permission of higher authority).  A CO may typically deal with cases of minor theft or assault.  These cases are often nonetheless of importance to discipline and morale.  A minor theft, which might be insignificant in some civilian contexts, can erode trust between members of a unit and undermine the effectiveness of what should be a close-knit team.  More serious cases are likely to go [to] court-martial.  The CO and the Service courts are uniquely placed to understand the circumstances of Service life and the significance of misconduct by Service personnel, especially where misconduct occurs in a Service context.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;A requirement for all criminal offences in the United Kingdom to be dealt with by civilian courts would seriously undermine the CO's authority.  Moreover it seems to me that the exclusion of courts-martial from dealing with criminal cases in the United Kingdom would inevitably bring with it the exclusion of the COs from dealing with such criminal offences on a summary basis.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to a point which I shall deal with at paragraph 18 and following below [as to the exclusion of certain serious offences], section 70 broadly makes no distinction between criminal offences committed in the United Kingdom and those committed abroad.  The fundamental reasons for this are the circumstances of Service life which, as explained above, require a distinct system of command and discipline.  Moreover the circumstances of Service life, and Service needs, would render artificial an exclusion of Service courts for crimes in the United Kingdom.  If, for example, a serviceman stole from another serviceman abroad, he could be dealt with by Service discipline; but, if the theft occurred in England and the thief was identified only after the unit had gone abroad, the case could only be dealt with by a court in the United Kingdom.  If section 70 did not apply to an offence committed in England, no disciplinary action could be taken against the guilty person; nor could the Service police arrest him.  He would not have committed a disciplinary offence.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;A distinction between criminal and Service offences is also in my view artificial.  The same facts may amount both to a criminal and a purely Service offence.  A theft may sometimes be looting;  the circumstances of an assault may amount to mutiny.  It would be anomalous if criminal misconduct could be dealt with, but only where the circumstances also amounted to a Service offence.  Nor is there a simple distinction in terms of seriousness.  Looting, mutiny and desertion may be as serious as theft or even murder."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;52. This authoritative and up-to-date statement of the reasons why the armed forces wish to maintain the jurisdiction of courts-martial in civil offences complements passages in certain of the authorities where judges have recognised that a distinct system of justice for the armed forces can be justified by their peculiar position.  For instance, in <i>MacKay v The Queen</i> 114 DLR (3d) 393, 426 McIntyre J would have confined the jurisdiction of courts-martial to civil offences connected with the accused's military service and therefore found that there had been a breach of the guarantee of equality before the law under sections 1(b) and 2 of the Canadian Bill of Rights.  Nonetheless he was clear that trial by court-martial did not infringe the serviceman's, separate, right to a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal under section 2(f) of the Bill of Rights.  He said, at pp 420-421:</p>
<p></p><ul>"With the greatest deference for those who hold opposing views, I am unable to conclude that a trial by court martial under the provisions of the National Defence Act of criminal offences, which are also offences at civil law, deprives the defendant of a fair hearing by an independent tribunal.  From the earliest times, officers of the armed forces in this and, I suggest, all civilized countries have had this judicial function.  It arose from practical necessity and, in my view, must continue for the same reason.  It is said that by the nature of his close association with the military community and his identification with the military society, the officer is unsuited to exercise this judicial office.  It would be impossible to deny that an officer is to some extent the representative of the class in the military hierarchy from which he comes;  he would be less than human if he were not.  But the same argument, with equal fairness, can be raised against those who are appointed to judicial office in the civilian society.  We are all products of our separate backgrounds and we must all in the exercise of the judicial office ensure that no injustice results from that fact.  I am unable to say that service officers, trained in the ways of service life and concerned to maintain the required standards of efficiency and discipline - which includes the welfare of their men - are less able to adjust their attitudes to meet the duty of impartiality required of them in this task than are others.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Furthermore, the problems and the needs of the armed services, being in many respects special to the military, may well from time to time require the special knowledge possessed by officers of experience who, in this respect, may be better suited for the exercise of judicial duty in military courts than their civilian counterparts.  It has been recognized that wide powers of discipline may be safely accorded in professional associations to senior members of such professions.  The controlling bodies of most professions such as those of law, medicine, accountancy, engineering, among others, are given this power.  I am unable to say that the close identification of such disciplinary bodies with the profession concerned, taken with the seniority enjoyed by such officers within their professional group, has ever been recognised as a disqualifying factor on grounds of bias or otherwise.  Rather it seems that the need for special knowledge and experience in professional matters has been recognized as a reason for the creation of disciplinary tribunals within the separate professions.  It must also be remembered that while this appeal concerned only the armed services serving in Canada, the position of forces serving abroad not being in issue, it must be recognized that in service abroad the officers must assume the judicial role by reason of the absence of any civil legal processes.  The character of the officer for independence and impartiality will surely not vary because he is serving overseas.  The practical necessities of the service require the performance of this function by officers of the service and I find no offence to the Canadian Bill of Rights in this respect.  I would add that there now exists a Court Martial Appeal Court, a professional Court of Appeal with a general appellate jurisdiction over the courts martial.  This is, in my view, a significant safeguard and its creation is a realistic and practical step toward the provision of that protection which is required in the circumstances."<p></p></ul>
