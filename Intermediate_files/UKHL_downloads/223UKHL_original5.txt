<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113.&nbsp;&nbsp;True it is, as observed by the Law Commission in their 1976 Report (paragraph 1.22) that not all the parties to the agreement need to have evinced their consent at the same time or on the same occasion, nor indeed need each have been in communication with every other or be aware of each other's identity.  But each conspirator must entertain a common purpose in relation to the specific offence or offences which are its object.  As the Court of Appeal said in <i>R v Ardalan </i> [1972]  1 WLR 463, 469-470:</p>

<p></p><ul>"The essential point in dealing with this type of conspiracy charge [i.e. 'cartwheel' or 'chain' conspiracies], where the prosecution have brought one, and only one, charge against the alleged conspirators, is to bring home to the minds of the jury that before they can convict anybody upon that conspiracy charge, they have got to be convinced in relation to each person charged that that person has conspired with another guilty person in relation to that single conspiracy . . . there must not be wrapped up in one conspiracy charge what is in fact a charge involving two or more conspiracies."<p></p></ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114.&nbsp;&nbsp;I pause at this juncture to wonder how easily the conspiracy count in the present case, set out together with its particulars at paragraph 43 of Lord Hope's opinion, fits with that approach.  When precisely, one may ask, did the appellant enter into this conspiracy?  The conspiracy is alleged to have taken place over a ten month period between 1 May 2001 and 1 March 2002 during which the appellant for his part "only became suspicious from about December 2001."  Put that possible difficulty aside, however, and consider the case on the simple factual basis summarised by Lord Hope at paragraph 77: Lemos, one of the appellant's alleged co-conspirators, knew that the property which he handed over to the appellant for laundering was hot; the appellant himself merely suspected it to be so.  Their agreement was simply that Lemos would hand it over to the appellant and the appellant would in turn then launder it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115.&nbsp;&nbsp;But for <i>R v Montila</i> [2004] 1 WLR 3141, the substantive offence under section 93C (2) would be committed by anyone who laundered property (with the illicit purpose) suspecting it to be hot, irrespective of whether in fact it was.  (It is in no way to criticise <i>Montila</i> to point out that it would be perfectly rational to criminalise such conduct without more—as indeed it now seems to have been criminalised by the 2002 Act.)  On that basis, a conspiracy charge under section 1(1) of the 1977 Act would present no difficulty:  the laundering of the money (the carrying out of the agreement between Lemos and the appellant in accordance with their intentions) would "necessarily amount to or involve the commission of [an] offence" under section 93C(2).  And section 1(2) would simply have no application.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116.&nbsp;&nbsp;If, of course, Lemos had known (or even merely suspected) that the property was hot but the appellant himself had no thought whatever of that, then the appellant would have needed to rely on section 1(2) to escape liability for conspiracy. Lemos himself would still have committed a substantive offence under section 93C(2) but only he would have intended or known that a "particular fact or circumstance necessary for the commission of the offence" would exist, namely knowledge or suspicion on the part of one of those agreeing to its laundering that the property was hot.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Montila</i>, however, changes the position entirely.  For the launderer now to be liable under section 93C(2) it is not sufficient that he suspects the property to be hot; the prosecution must prove it to be so.  If, therefore, as here, one of the conspirators, the appellant, does not know but only suspects that the property is hot, section 1(2) becomes all-important. (Section 1(1) still presents no difficulty for the prosecution where, as here, one of the conspirators, Lemos, actually knows that the property is hot)<i>.</i>  How then does section 1(2) apply on the facts of this case?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118.&nbsp;&nbsp;A "particular fact or circumstance necessary for the commission of [a section 93C(2)] offence" here is that the property to be laundered shall indeed be hot.  Where, as here, the appellant, one of the alleged conspirators, merely suspects but does not know that to be so it follows that "liability for [the] offence may be incurred without knowledge on the part of the person committing it of any particular fact or circumstance necessary for the commission of the offence" so that he is not after all to be found guilty of a conspiracy "unless he and at least one other party to the agreement intend or know that that fact or circumstance shall or will exist at the time when the conduct constituting the offence is to take place."  Does someone in the appellant's position, suspecting the property they are about to launder to be hot, "intend or know" that in fact it <i>is</i> hot?  Clearly they do not "know" it—at any rate on the facts of this case where the substantive offence expressly differentiates between the two states of mind, knowledge and suspicion, and the guilty plea is tendered and accepted explicitly on the basis of suspicion only. But did the appellant <i>intend</i> the property to be hot?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119.&nbsp;&nbsp;I should say at this stage that the problem arising here is not one that arises in the context of handling offences.  Handling is committed by those who know or believe that the goods are stolen.  True, the offence is not committed if the goods, albeit believed stolen, in fact prove not to be.  But if an agreement is made to handle goods believed to be stolen I for my part would have little difficulty in concluding for the purposes of section 1(2) of the 1977 Act that the conspirators intended or knew that they would be stolen.  Section 1(2) looks to the future so that the putative conspirator's state of mind is in any event better described as belief than as knowledge—a point well made by Hooper LJ in <i>R v Liaquat Ali and others</i> [2005]  EWCA Crim 87, [2005] 2 Cr App R 864 (at para 98).  One can never be certain that goods that are to come into one's possession at a future time will be stolen but a firm belief can be held and that is sufficient.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120.&nbsp;&nbsp;The present case, however, is different.  To suspect something to be so is by no means to believe it to be so: it is to believe only that it may be so.  I repeat, the Crown's principal argument is not that the appellant here <i>knew</i> that the property would be hot but rather that, whilst only suspecting it, he nevertheless intended it to be so.  The argument is advanced essentially in terms of a conditional intention: the appellant suspected the property would be hot and agreed to launder it irrespective of whether it was or was not.  This, it is contended, is a sufficient intent for section 1 (2) purposes: it is an agreement to launder hot property (and thus commit an offence) if it proves to be hot; innocent property (and thus no offence) if the property in fact has a lawful provenance.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Lordships were shown an abundance of academic writing down the years which treats of the concept of conditional intention in the context of conspiracy law.  Many examples have been discussed.  If two men agree to burgle a house but only if it is unoccupied or not alarmed they are clearly guilty of conspiracy to burgle notwithstanding that their intention may be thwarted.  And if they take a weapon albeit to be used only if strictly necessary they are, the better view suggests, guilty also of conspiracy to wound.  Consistently with this approach convictions were upheld (a) of conspiracy to aid and abet suicide where it was agreed that the accused would visit individuals contemplating suicide and either seek to discourage them or actively help them commit suicide depending on his assessment of the appropriate course of action (<i>R v Reed</i> [1982] Crim LR 819); (b) of conspiracy to pervert the course of public justice where three men agreed that a fourth man, under trial for burglary, should be shot in the leg so as to provide him with mitigation in the event he were convicted (<i>R v Jackson </i> [1985]  Crim LR 442); and (c) of conspiracy to cause explosions where members of the IRA during the IRA ceasefire agreed to make bombs for use only if the ceasefire came to an end (<i>R v O'Hadhmaill</i> [1996]  Crim LR 509).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Crown submits that the same approach supports the legitimacy of the appellant's conviction upon his own plea in the present case.  True, there was no certainty that the property he agreed to launder would prove to be hot so that the commission of an offence pursuant to the agreement depended on a contingency which might not occur.  But that, on the authorities, provides no defence to a conspiracy charge.  Beguiling though for a time I confess to have found this argument, I have finally come to reject it.  If someone launders property he suspects to be hot, he takes the risk that it <i>is </i>hot (and can be proved to be so) and in that event commits the substantive offence under section 93C(2).  But he commits it by actually laundering the property and not merely by agreeing to do so.  Assume that A and B one morning agree to launder a bundle of £50 notes which C is to bring in that afternoon, suspecting but not knowing the notes will be hot.  They are arrested before the money arrives.  Are they guilty of conspiracy to launder notwithstanding that, had they received and laundered the money, they might well have had a defence based on <i>Montila</i>?  With, I confess, some reluctance, I would hold not.</p>
