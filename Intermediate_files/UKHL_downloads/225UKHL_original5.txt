<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111.&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate that Ms Monaghan did not emphasise this aspect of her case in the course of argument. She was understandably concerned to emphasise the impact of the scheme upon the mother's right to respect for her private and family life with her partner. For the state to disregard their relationship and treat it as non-existent is to demonstrate a lack of respect for this most intimate and important part of their lives and personalities. The state no longer prevents or punishes their relationship, as it did the relationships of gay men in the days before the Sexual Offences Act 1967. I do not think that the state (as opposed to the customs of society or religion) has ever prevented or punished lesbian relationships. The contempt shown for the mother's relationship by the child support scheme is not on the same level as the contempt shown for gay relationships in the past. But we are not here concerned with whether or not there has been a breach of article 8, merely with whether it is within the reach of the right which it protects. As is already apparent, I do not accept that a lack of respect has to reach such a level of severity as to constitute a breach of article 8 for article 14 to be engaged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112.&nbsp;&nbsp;The European Court of Human Rights has not yet recognised that the relationship between two adult homosexuals amounts to family life.  But then I know of no case in which it has recognised that the relationship between two unmarried adult heterosexuals amounts to family life. Family life has so far been confined to the relationships between married couples and between parents or other relatives and carers and their children. This includes the relationship between a same sex parent and his children and between a same sex couple and the children of their family. This mother and her partner were clearly enjoying their right to respect for the family life which they had with their children while those children were with them. And family life continues even when parents and children are apart. The assessment and enforcement of child support clearly affects that family life, whether for better or for worse. This is another reason for holding that article 14 is engaged. Furthermore, if the discriminatory treatment in <i>Frette v France</i> (2004) 38 EHRR 438 fell within the ambit of the right to respect for private life, I do not see why the discriminatory treatment in this case does not do so. I do not therefore find it necessary to inquire whether article 14 is also engaged by virtue of article 1 of the First Protocol.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the difference in the treatment of homosexual and heterosexual relationships by the child support scheme in relation to the family lives of the parents and their children has to be justified if it is not to fall foul of article 14. The only justification which is offered is the historical discrimination between the two types of relationship in both the welfare benefit and child support schemes. Although it is now recognised that there is no objective justification for such discrimination, it is said that the law must be given time to catch up. The realisation that there is no justification is remarkably recent. It used to be taken for granted that discriminating against extra-marital relationships of any sort was a way of protecting and supporting the preferred relationship of marriage. The European Court of Human Rights acknowledges that 'the protection of the family in the traditional sense', by which it means the marital family, is in principle capable of being weighty justification for a difference in treatment: see <i>Karner v Austria</i> (2003) 38 EHRR 528, para 40. But it has still to be shown that the exclusion of same sex couples is necessary to achieve that aim. No one has yet explained how failing to recognise the relationships of people whose sexual orientation means that they are unable or strongly unwilling to marry is necessary for the purpose of protecting or encouraging the marriage of people who are quite capable of marrying of they wish to do so. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hugely to the credit of the United Kingdom Government and Parliament that they have recognised this. They are ahead of much of Europe, although parts of Europe are ahead of them. But can this be an objective justification for not having recognised it sooner? I do not see how it can be. Race discrimination was always wrong, long before the world woke up to that fact. Sex discrimination was always wrong, long before the world woke up to that fact. But there may on occasions still be good and objective reasons for distinguishing between the sexes. One such reason may be the persistence of historical disadvantage and exclusion. Until remarkably recently, married women were excluded from parts of the labour market. Until remarkably recently, overt sex discrimination in the pay and conditions of women workers at all levels was not only lawful but common. Even though such discrimination is now unlawful, the reality is that there is still a 'gender gap' between men and women in life time earnings and an even larger 'mother gap' between mothers and others. Discriminatory treatment of pregnant women is still common. While such systemic discrimination against women persisted, it may have been justified for the benefits system to make some small adjustment in their favour. It may well be a matter of judgment when the effects of that exclusion have been so far overcome that the compensation is no longer justified: see <i>R (Hooper) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions</i> [2005] UKHL 29, [2005] 1 WLR 1681.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is one thing to use historical disadvantage and exclusion to justify some compensatory treatment for the excluded group which is denied to others. It may then be fair to give the system some time to catch up. This is in effect what happened in <i>Petrovic v Austria</i> (2001) 33 EHRR 307. Mothers had been given an allowance because they were traditionally expected to give up work to care for their children whereas fathers were not. It is another thing entirely to use historical disadvantage and exclusion to justify continued disadvantage and exclusion <i>of the excluded group</i>. No one has suggested any legitimate aim that this difference in treatment pursues. By contrast, in <i>Frette v France</i> (2004) 38 EHRR 438, there was the legitimate aim of protecting the interests of children at a time when child psychiatrists and psychologists were divided in their opinions of the effects of being adopted by homosexual parents. Even so, the discrimination was held justified by the narrow margin of four votes to three.  The partly dissenting opinion of Sir Nicholas Bratza and Judges Fuhrmann and Tulkens says this (at pp 471 - 472) of the margin of appreciation:</p>
<p></p><ul>" … we might conceivably accept the Government's view that some margin of appreciation should be afforded to States in the sensitive area of adoption by homosexuals. … On the other hand, the reference in the present judgment to the 'lack of common ground' in the contracting States or 'uniform principles' on adoption by homosexuals, which paves the way for States to be given total discretion, seems to us to be irrelevant, at variance with the Court's case law relating to article 14 of the Convention, and when couched in such general terms, liable to take the protection of fundamental rights backwards. It is the Court's task to secure the rights guaranteed by the Convention. It must supervise the conditions in which article 14 of the Convention is applied and consider therefore whether there was a reasonable, proportionate relationship in the instant case between the methods used - the total prohibition of adoption by homosexual parents - and the aim pursued - to protect children. … [The absolute position taken by the French court] fundamentally precludes any real consideration of the interests at stake and the possibility of finding any practical way of reconciling them. At a time when all the countries of the Council of Europe are engaged in a determined attempt to counter all forms of prejudice and discrimination, we regret that we cannot agree with the majority."<p></p></ul>
<p>In that case, there was a legitimate aim, so the point at issue was the application of the margin of appreciation to the question of proportionality. In this case, no-one has suggested a legitimate aim. No one has suggested, for example, that the religious or moral views of sections of the community might constitute such a justification (as opposed to an explanation). This is much closer to the position in <i>Karner v Austria</i> (2003) 38 EHRR 528, where the court was unanimous in finding a violation of article 14, than it is to the position in <i>Frette v France</i> (2004) 38 EHRR 438,decided more than a year earlier, where the court was so narrowly divided.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that Parliament has now legislated is very welcome but it does not make right what was done before. These facts arose before the Civil Partnership Bill was introduced. Had the Bill not been introduced, the same questions would have arisen. In my view, they should have received the same answers, just as they did in <i>Ghaidan v Godin-Mendoza</i> [2004] UKHL 29, [2004] 2 AC 557. In that case, the Government supported the surviving partner's claim to succeed to the tenancy on the same terms as the survivor of a heterosexual relationship. Mr Sales did not argue that we should wait for Parliament to remedy the historical discrimination between heterosexual and homosexual partnerships in respect of the home they had shared.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, therefore, this is a case of unjustified discrimination in the enjoyment of the Convention right to respect for private and family life. It is our duty to remedy that, if possible, by interpreting the legislation so as to comply with the Convention rights: see Human Rights Act 1998, section 3(1). The relevant legislation is the definition of an 'unmarried couple' in regulation 1(2) of the Child Support (Maintenance Assessments and Special Cases) Regulations 1992 SI 1992/185 as amended. As this is delegated legislation, the majority of the Court of Appeal simply deleted the provision, thus leaving it to the Agency and appellate authorities to supply their own non-discriminatory definition of the equivalent relationship. The tribunal, presided over by Mrs Priest, invoked the Interpretation Act 1978 to interpret 'a man and a woman … living together as husband and wife' as 'a man or a woman and a woman or a man … living together as husband and wife'. My present inclination is to prefer the latter approach. There is still a need to define the type of couple relationship with which the legislation is concerned. This approach does that. This House in <i>Ghaidan v Godin-Mendoza</i> [2004] UKHL 40, [2004] 2 AC 557 emphasised the scope of what was 'possible' under section 3. This approach does not offend against any 'cardinal feature' of the legislation. It also avoids the arbitrary effect of interpreting 'two persons' to include homosexual partners but 'a man and a woman' to exclude them. The original version of this definition in the Supplementary Benefits Act 1972 referred to 'two persons' cohabiting as man and wife. It was only in the Social Security Act 1980 that the alternative expression 'a man and a woman' was chosen. The operative words were undoubtedly 'living together as husband and wife' rather than the description of the two people involved. This House has already held, in <i>Ghaidan v Godin-Mendoza</i>, that these words are apt to cover both homosexual and heterosexual relationships.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, which are essentially the same as those of the tribunal chaired by Mrs Priest, and in common not only with the tribunal, but also with the Child Support Commissioner and the majority of the Court of Appeal, I would dismiss this appeal. </p>
<p><b>LORD MANCE</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119.&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue in these proceedings is the compatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights of the child support regime which applied in the period from 13th August 2001 to 18th February 2002 under the Child Support Act 1991 and the Child Support (Maintenance Assessments and Special Cases) Regulations 1992 (1992 SI No. 1815) (the "MASC" Regulations).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs M lived during that period with a same sex partner, and was obliged under the Act and Regulations to make pay child support maintenance in respect of her two sons who lived with her former partner (although they spent two and a half days a week with her).  The computation of maintenance required under the Regulations took account of the level of her housing costs, as well as her disposable and protected income. In this respect, regulation 15 provided:</p>
<p></p><ul>"(1) Subject to the provisions of this regulation …, a parent's housing costs shall be the aggregate of the eligible housing costs payable in respect of his home.<p></p></ul>
…
<p></p><ul>(3) Where a parent has eligible housing costs and another person who is not a member of his family is also liable to make payments in respect of the home, the amount of the parent's housing costs shall be his share of those costs".<p></p></ul>
<p>Regulation 1(2) defines a "family" as follows:</p>
<p></p><ul>"1(2) In these Regulations unless the context otherwise requires -<p></p></ul>
…
<p></p><ul>'family' means - …<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;a married or unmarried couple … and any child or children living with them for whom at least one member of that couple has day to day care</p>
…
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'partner' means </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;in relation to a member of a married or unmarried couple who are living together, the other member of that couple;</p>
…
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'married couple' means a man and a woman who are married to each other and are members of the same household.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'unmarried couple' means a man and a woman who are not married to each other but are living together as husband and wife. …"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121.&nbsp;&nbsp;Living with a same sex partner, Mrs M was only allowed her half share in the calculation of her housing costs. She was also treated as having no partner for the purposes of the calculation of her disposable and protected income under other MASC Regulations. But the overall effect in her case was that the maintenance that she was called upon to pay was higher than it would have been had her new partner been of the opposite sex. In other cases the effect would be the opposite. As Sedley LJ said in paras 88-89 of his judgment, "Other provisions in the material regulations can work either way, depending on the facts of each case. ... there will be some same-sex couples who will not thank M for succeeding". Further, the child benefit regime is, like many aspects of social legislation, a package. The distinction between the treatment of heterosexual partners as a couple and the treatment of same-sex partners as two individuals on a "stand-alone" basis extended, prior to 5 December 2005, across the whole social security system; it affected therefore not merely the calculation of child support benefit but also for example income support, job-seekers' allowance, housing benefit and council tax benefit; and it was, the Secretary of State has informed your Lordships, one which was "in general" to the (financial) benefit of same-sex couples.  But that does not address the issue whether it was discriminatory in a sense and manner falling within and contrary to article 8 read with article 14.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs M took this issue to the Appeals Tribunal for Child Support, which on 11 November 2002 determined that her housing costs and her disposable and protected income should all be calculated on the basis that she had a partner who was a member of her family within the meaning of the Regulations. The Tribunal concluded that any other result would be discriminatory both under article 8 and under article 1 of Protocol 1, read in each case with article 14 of the Convention on Human Rights, and that it was possible to avoid a discriminatory result under section 6 of the Interpretation Act 1978 by reading 'man' to include 'woman' and 'woman' to include 'man' in the definitions in paragraph 1 of the MASC Regulations. Mr Edward Jacobs, as Child Support Commissioner, upheld this result on 1 October 2002, but found the Interpretation Act route "unnecessarily inventive". In his view, the definitions did not apply, because, in accordance with their opening words, the context consisting in a need to read the legislation compatibly with the Convention 'otherwise required'. The Court of Appeal, by a majority, dismissed the appeal, but took the view that a result compatible with the Convention was "better accomplished ... by simply disapplying - in effect deleting - the definition of 'unmarried couple' in regulation 1(2)": per Sedley LJ at para 86.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 5 December 2005, the same issues could not arise. The regime has been re-structured by the Civil Partnerships Act 2004, giving same sex couples expressly the same rights as opposite sex couples.  The law relating to social security and tax credits were also embraced within a general restructuring of the law, to the same end. The legislative story goes back at least to late 2001. In October 2001, Jane Griffiths' Relationships (Civil Registration) Bill was introduced in the House of Commons, in November 2001 a major cross-departmental review of the policy and cost implications of a civil partnership registration scheme was initiated, supported by the Women and Equality Unit of the Department of Trade and Industry. In January 2002 Lord Lester of Herne Hill introduced a Civil Partnerships Bill in the House of Lords but withdrew it on 11 February 2002 to allow completion of the cross-departmental review. At the conclusion of the review, in December 2002 it was announced that a strong case was seen for a civil partnership scheme and that a consultation paper would be published in the summer of 2003, as it was on 30 June 2003. There followed a three month consultation period, which showed strong public support for such a scheme. In the DTI report "Responses to Civil Partnership" dated November 2003, the government undertook to introduce legislation as soon as parliamentary time allowed. The first draft of the Civil Partnership Bill was dated 22 April 2004, and ensuing Parliamentary process led to the Civil Partnership Act 2004 receiving the Royal assent on 18 November 2004. The Act is an extremely comprehensive piece of legislation, covering not merely the creation and regulation of civil partnerships, but many other subjects, some-interrelated, including social security, pensions, tax credits and the present, with the aim of achieving equality of treatment between opposite sex and same-sex couples. The implementation of the legislation required time, and took place just over a year later.</p>
<i><p>Mrs M's case</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;124.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs M's case under article 8 read with article 14 of the Convention is that the regime fell "within the ambit" or "scope", or was "one of the modalities of the exercise", of her right to respect for (a) her family life with her children and former partner, (b) her family life with her new same sex partner and (c) her private life She does not have to show an actual breach of the United Kingdom's obligation to afford such respect under article 8, taken by itself. See the <i>Belgian Linguistics Case (No 2) </i>(1968) 1 EHRR 252, 283 and<i> Petrovic v. Austria </i>(2001) 33 EHRR 14, considered in paras 141-142 below. But the circumstances must fall within the ambit of article 8, in order for article 14 to be relevant. In this connection, I have had the benefit of reading in draft the opinion of my noble and learned friend, Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe, and I am in agreement with his analysis of the authorities and the reasoning leading him to the conclusion that a tenuous link between the child support regime and her family or private life is insufficient.</p>
<i><p>Mrs M's relationship with her children and former partner</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, Mrs M was entitled to respect for such continuing family life as she had with her children as well as, possibly, with her former partner.  But the regime as a whole was directed at supporting her children in the new family in which her children lived; while the particular aspects of the regime about which she complains were directed at any new relationship she formed. If these aspects (or indeed the whole regime) had any bearing at all on her continuing family life with her children or former partner, the link could only be of the most indirect and tenuous nature. I agree with the Court of Appeal's unanimous rejection of the case based on her family life with her children and former partner.</p>
<i>Mrs M's relationship with her new same-sex partner
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;126.&nbsp;&nbsp;The crux of the present case lies in my view in the submission, accepted by the majority in the Court of Appeal, that the regime fell within the ambit of family life which Mrs M shared with her new same sex partner. That involves two issues, first, whether Mrs M's same sex relationship during the period from 13 August 2001 to 18 February 2002 was to be regarded as involving family life, and whether, if so, the child support regime impinged sufficiently on that family life for it to be said to fall within its ambit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;127.&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the second issue, if Mrs M's relationship with her same-sex partner in the relevant period falls to be regarded as having involved family life within the meaning of article 8(1), I would regard the regime about which, or certain aspects of which, she complains as falling, though only just, within the ambit of her right to respect for such family life under article 8, or as one of the "modalities" by which the State exercised respect for that right in relation to any new family relationship that she might form. The aim of the MASC Regulations was to reflect and give effect to Mrs M's obligations as an absent parent to contribute to the living costs of her children. But they calculated housing costs and protected income by taking account of any new opposite sex partner. They did this, no doubt, in a manner which was designed to avoid any unduly adverse impact on that new relationship and to achieve a fair balance between it and the children's needs. The Commissioner specifically mentioned that the computation of protected income was "put crudely, to ensure that the [absent] parent's family had enough to live on after the child support maintenance has been paid". The full allowance made for housing costs in the case of any new opposite sex relationship must be taken to have been designed to respect the perceived needs or status of those in such a relationship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;128.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would regard the first issue as critical. It opens a number of questions. The relevant articles of the Convention on Human Rights are, under section 1(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998, 'Convention rights' and, under section 1(2), have effect for the purposes of the Act. Under section 2(1) a court or tribunal determining a question which has arisen in connection with a Convention right "must take into account" any judgment, decision, declaration or advisory opinion of the European Court of Human Rights "whenever made or given, so far as, in the opinion of the court or tribunal, it is relevant to the proceedings in which that question has arisen". Under section 3(1) primary and subordinate legislation must, so far as possible, be read and given effect compatibly with the Convention rights, while section 4(1) provides for a declaration of incompatibility in any proceedings in which a court determines that a provision of primary legislation is incompatible with a Convention right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;129.&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of section 2(1) was authoritatively expounded by my noble and learned friend, Lord Bingham of Cornhill, in reasoning with which all other members of the House agreed in <i>R (Ullah) v. Special Adjudicator </i>[2004] UKHL 26; 2 AC 323 para 20:</p>
<p></p><ul>"20.&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining the present question, the House is required by section 2(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998 to take into account any relevant Strasbourg case law. While such case law is not strictly binding, it has been held that courts should, in the absence of some special circumstances, follow any clear and constant jurisprudence of the Strasbourg court: <i>R (Alconbury Developments Ltd) v Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions</i> [2001] UKHL 23, [2003] 2 AC 295, para 26. This reflects the fact that the Convention is an international instrument, the correct interpretation of which can be authoritatively expounded only by the Strasbourg court. From this it follows that a national court subject to a duty such as that imposed by section 2 should not without strong reason dilute or weaken the effect of the Strasbourg case law. It is indeed unlawful under section 6 of the 1998 Act for a public authority, including a court, to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right. It is of course open to member states to provide for rights more generous than those guaranteed by the Convention, but such provision should not be the product of interpretation of the Convention by national courts, since the meaning of the Convention should be uniform throughout the states party to it. The duty of national courts is to keep pace with the Strasbourg jurisprudence as it evolves over time: no more, but certainly no less."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;130.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>R (S) v. Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police </i>[2004] UKHL 39; 1 WLR 2196, para 27, Lord Steyn cited this paragraph with approval in relation to article 8, distinguishing between article 8(1), which had, he said, to "receive a uniform interpretation throughout member states, unaffected by different cultural traditions" and article 8(2), in relation to which differing cultural traditions in different states could be material to the question of objective justification. The observation was made by way of qualification of a statement by Lord Woolf CJ in the Court of Appeal, [2002] 1 WLR 3223, 3233, that</p>
<p></p><ul>"just as in the appropriate circumstances a margin of appreciation has to be extended for any shortcomings in this jurisdiction in relation to observing the Convention, so there can be situations where the standards of respect for the rights of the individual in this jurisdiction are higher than those required by the Convention. There is nothing in the Convention setting a ceiling on the level of respect which a jurisdiction is entitled to extend to personal rights".<p></p></ul>
<p>Lord Steyn's reasoning was agreed by all other members of the House (save in the case of my noble and learned friend, Baroness Hale of Richmond, on the one question whether there was on the facts an interference with private life under article 8(1)). Baroness Hale also said in para 78:</p>
<p></p><ul>"I accept that we must interpret the Convention rights in a way which keeps pace with rather than leaps ahead of the Strasbourg jurisprudence as it evolves over time."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;131.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>R (Ullah) v. Special Adjudicator</i>, [2004] 2 AC 323, 350, para 20, Lord Bingham referred to "clear and constant jurisprudence of the Strasbourg court", and a domestic court may have to consider whether this criterion is met. In an evolving area, a domestic court may perhaps also have to consider whether relatively elderly jurisprudence reflects the result that the court would still reach. The Strasbourg Court itself said in <i>Goodwin v. United Kingdom </i>(2002) 35 EHRR 18, para 74, that, whilst it will not depart without good reason from prior precedents:</p>
<p></p><ul>"the Court must have regard to the changing conditions within the respondent State and within Contracting States generally and respond, for example, to any evolving convergence as to the standards to be achieved".<p></p></ul>
<p>It is relevant that it is in the first instance for the domestic courts of this country to consider and, so far as possible, give effect to Convention rights (or, if this is not possible in the case of primary legislation, to make a declaration of incompatibility).</p>
