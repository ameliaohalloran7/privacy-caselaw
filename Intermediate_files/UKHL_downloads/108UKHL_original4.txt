<p align="right"><a href="well-3.htm">(back to preceding text)</a></p>

<p class="para">76.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of this case law it seems to me that essentially four questions arise:</p>
<p class="para">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;In what circumstances will a life sentence in fact be found “<i>de jure</i> and <i>de facto</i> irreducible"?</p>
<p class="para">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;In what circumstances will an irreducible life sentence be found to violate article 3?</p>
<p class="para">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;When a life sentence <i>is</i> so found, at what point does it violate article 3? Is it when the sentence is passed or is it rather when the prisoner has served a longer term than could properly be justified?</p>
<p class="para">(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;What (if any) relevance attaches to the fact that the above questions arise in the context of a “foreign", as opposed to a “domestic", case?</p>
<p class="hditl">Q1 In what circumstances will a life sentence be found irreducible?</p>
<p class="para">77.&nbsp;&nbsp;As Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers CJ observed in giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) in <i>R v Bieber</i> [2008] EWCA Crim 1601 (para 44), the test for deciding whether a life sentence is reducible “does not emerge with any degree of clarity from <i>Kafkaris</i>“. He noted, however, the Government of Cyprus’s statement that, in exercising the discretionary power to release life sentence prisoners, the President took into account:</p>
<p class="qt">“the nature of the offence, the amount of time a prisoner had already served and any exceptional or compassionate grounds for early release. In this connection, the Government noted that an expression of genuine remorse on the part of a lifer would be an important consideration though not decisive. The President further determined whether the continued detention of the prisoner was necessary for the purposes of retribution and deterrence or for protecting the public from risk of serious harm.”</p>
<p class="para">It is apparent from this that in exercising his discretion the President has regard to essentially the same considerations as under UK domestic law (i) determine the penal tariff, (ii) determine in the post-tariff period (assuming no whole life penal tariff has been fixed) whether the prisoner can safely be released, and (iii) determine whether exceptional circumstances exist justifying the prisoner’s release on compassionate grounds. Under our domestic law, of course, both the tariff period and the question of release in the post-tariff period are decided upon by judicial bodies—respectively the trial judge (or, on appeal, the Court of Appeal) and the Parole Board. Only the question of release on compassionate grounds is decided by the Secretary of State—under section 30 of the Crimes (Sentences) Act 1997. That all these questions are (or at any rate were at the time under consideration in <i>Kafkaris</i>) decided in Cyprus by the executive necessarily to my mind involved violations of article 5(4) (and probably also article 6 since tariff fixing is part of the sentencing process)—see, for example, <i>Stafford v United Kingdom</i> (2002) 35 EHRR 32. But, as Judge Bratza noted, the article 5(4) complaint in <i>Kafkaris </i>was<i> </i>lodged too late.</p>
<p class="para">78.&nbsp;&nbsp;What I deduce from all this is that in reality the Strasbourg Court does not consider the question of irreducibility as a matter wholly distinct from the question whether some body (judicial or not) will one day take account of the individual circumstances of the prisoner’s case. The potential vice of a mandatory life sentence is that no one may ever consider the defendant’s individual circumstances with a view to deciding whether in fact he should remain in prison forever. Providing that at some point during the sentence this <i>will </i>be properly considered, then the sentence is not to be regarded as irreducible. It will, if appropriate, be reduced when the individual facts come to be considered. The majority of the Grand Chamber in <i>Kafkaris</i> found this to be so with regard to mandatory life sentences generally in Cyprus. In <i>Bieber</i> the Court of Appeal found it to be so with regard to life sentence prisoners subject to whole life tariffs in the UK. In so holding the Court of Appeal relied heavily on the Secretary of State’s power of compassionate release under section 30 of the 1997 Act. Given, however, that this power is used only sparingly (where, for example, the prisoner is suffering from a terminal illness or is bedridden or similarly incapacitated), to my mind the altogether more important factor compelling the conclusion that such sentences are not to be regarded as irreducible (or at any rate not objectionably so) is that, when originally  the whole life term was fixed, the prisoner’s individual circumstances (including naturally the circumstances of his particular offending) <i>will</i> have been considered and will have been thought by the judge (or the Court of Appeal) to merit that degree of punishment, draconian though undoubtedly it is.  </p>
<p class="para">79.&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether the present appellant’s sentence must be regarded as irreducible I find it hard to say. The position in Missouri <i>de jure</i> would appear to be substantially indistinguishable from that in Cyprus (considered in <i>Kafkaris</i>) and that in Pennsylvania (considered in <i>Einhorn</i>). Yet on the facts it appears that infinitely few adult males convicted in Missouri of first degree murder ever get released, leading one to fear that their individual circumstances may never properly be considered.   </p>
<i></i><p class="paraleft"><i>Q2</i> <i>In what circumstances will an irreducible life sentence be found to violate article 3?</i></p>
<p class="para">80.&nbsp;&nbsp;I raise this question only because the majority of the Grand Chamber in <i>Kafkaris</i>—consistently, as I have endeavoured to show, with earlier Strasbourg case-law—specifically concluded only that an irreducible life sentence <i>may raise an issue</i> under article 3, not that in principle it will violate article 3.</p>
<p class="para">81.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having puzzled long over this question, I have finally concluded that the majority of the Grand Chamber would not regard even an irreducible life sentence—by which, as explained, I understand the majority to mean a mandatory life sentence to be served in full without there ever being proper consideration of the individual circumstances of the defendant’s case—as violating article 3 unless and until the time comes when further imprisonment would no longer be justified on any ground—whether for reasons of punishment, deterrence or public protection. It is for that reason that the majority say only that article 3 <i>may</i> be engaged.</p>
<p class="hditl">Q3 When a sentence violates article 3, at what point does it do so?</p>
<p class="para">82.&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer I have just suggested to Q2 obviously answers this question also. Article 3 is violated only when the prisoner’s further imprisonment can no longer be justified. In this I agree entirely with the view expressed by Lord Phillips in <i>Bieber</i> at para 43:</p>
<p class="qt">“Can the imposition of an irreducible life sentence itself constitute a violation of article 3, or will the potential violation only occur once the offender has been detained beyond the period that can be justified on the ground of punishment and deterrence? In other words, is it the sentence or the consequent detention that is capable of violating article 3? We believe it is the latter. We think that this is implicit from the passage of the judgment [in <i>Kafkaris</i> at para 107, cited at para 70 above]. As we have recorded it was the detention itself that the applicant in <i>Kafkaris</i> contended amounted to a violation of article 3.”</p>
<p class="para">In my judgment it cannot be contended that the mere passing of a mandatory life sentence, even in circumstances where no satisfactory laws or procedures exist for thereafter reviewing the case on an individual basis to determine the actual period to be served, violates article 3.</p>
<p class="para">83.&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite what was suggested in <i>de Boucherville</i>, there are surely real differences of principle between mandatory life sentences and mandatory death sentences. As, indeed, was said by Stuart J in <i>Woodson v North Carolina </i>428 US 280, 305 shortly after the passage cited by Lord Bingham in <i>Reyes</i> (see para 63 above): </p>
<p class="qt">“Death, in its finality, differs more from life imprisonment than a 100-year prison term differs from one of only a year or two. Because of that qualitative difference, there is a corresponding difference in the need for reliability in the determination that death is the appropriate punishment in a specific case.”</p>
<p class="para">Similarly I find myself in respectful agreement with what Lord Hoffmann says at paragraph 7 of his opinion. It is perhaps worth noting in addition that it was not until 2003—after the House of Lords in <i>R (Anderson) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</i> [2003] 1 AC 837 (following the Strasbourg Court’s decision in <i>Stafford</i>) declared the UK’s previous legislation incompatible with the Convention—that in mandatory life sentence cases the Secretary of State ceased to have the last word both in fixing the tariff—part of the sentencing exercise and thus part of the trial process requiring determination by an independent and impartial tribunal under article 6(1)—and also as to when the prisoner can safely be released back into the community—a decision required by article 5(4) to be taken by “a court” and now made by the Parole Board itself (rather than as previously in the discretion of the Home Secretary following the Board’s recommendation). Yet no one suggests that pre-2003 mandatory life sentences passed here constituted inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and, indeed, the actual decision in <i>Lichniak</i> is surely inconsistent with any such view.</p>
<p class="para">84.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore reject the appellant’s argument as to it being no more relevant in a mandatory life sentence case that the defendant might well justifiably have been sentenced to a discretionary whole life term than that in a mandatory death sentence case the defendant might justifiably have been subjected to a discretionary death sentence. It hardly needs pointing out that mandatory death sentences are not only intrinsically more shocking but also by their very nature afford an altogether shorter time within which they can be corrected (and, of course, the longer the time spent on death row, the more inhuman the sentence on that ground also).</p>
<p class="hditl">Q4 What is the relevance of this being a “foreign” case?</p>
<p class="para">85.&nbsp;&nbsp;In and insofar as Lord Hoffmann would hold that where, as here, it is obviously desirable that the appellant be extradited and tried for his alleged crimes rather than be able to invoke article 3 to secure safe haven here, the threshold of what amounts to inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment is heightened, I would respectfully disagree.  Rather it seems to me that the Strasbourg Court in <i>Chahal v United Kingdom</i> (1996) 23 EHRR 413 (a decision strongly reaffirmed by the Grand Chamber’s recent unanimous judgment in <i>Saadi v Italy</i> (Application No 37201/96, 28 February 2008)) was indeed departing from what Lord Hoffmann at para 31 calls </p>
<p class="qt">“the relativist approach to what counted as inhuman and degrading treatment which was laid down in <i>Soering</i> and which is paralleled in the cases on other articles of the Convention in a foreign context.” </p>
<p class="para">86.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, I conclude, no room in the Strasbourg jurisprudence for a concept such as the risk of a flagrant violation of article 3’s absolute prohibition against inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (akin to that of the risk of a “flagrant denial of justice”). By the same token that no one can be expelled if he would then face the risk of torture, so too no one can be expelled if he would then face the risk of treatment or punishment which is properly to be characterised as inhuman or degrading. That, of course, is not to say that, assuming for example  “slopping out” is degrading treatment in Scotland, so too it must necessarily be regarded in all countries (see para 27 of Lord Hoffmann’s opinion); or that leaving asylum-seekers totally destitute would necessarily constitute article 3 ill-treatment in, say, a poor (warm) country as the House held it to be here in <i>R (Limbuela) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</i> [2006] AC 396—where we pointed out that the motivation for any particular treatment (whether, for example, it was intended to humiliate or debase) may well be relevant to whether it is inhuman or degrading; or, indeed, that a particular punishment (or the particular conditions in which any term of imprisonment would be served) that might be regarded as inhuman or degrading in a Convention state is necessarily to be so regarded in a state not party to the Convention—the Strasbourg Court has repeatedly said that the Convention does not “purport to be a means of requiring the contracting states to impose Convention standards on other states” (<i>Soering,</i> para 86) and article 3 does not bar removal to non-Convention states (whether by way of extradition or simply for the purposes of immigration control) merely because they choose to impose higher levels or harsher measures of criminal punishment. </p>
<p class="para">87.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor is it to say that a risk of article 3 ill-treatment, the necessary pre-condition of an article 3 bar upon extradition, will readily be established. On the contrary, as the Grand Chamber reaffirmed in <i>Saadi</i> at para 142:</p>
<p class="qt">“[T]he Court has frequently indicated that it applies rigorous criteria and exercises close scrutiny when assessing the existence of a real risk of ill-treatment . . . in the event of a person being removed from the territory of the respondent State by extradition, expulsion or any other measure pursuing that aim.  Although assessment of that risk is to some degree speculative, the Court has always been very cautious, examining carefully the material placed before it in the light of the requisite standard of proof . . . before . . . finding that the enforcement of removal from the territory would be contrary to article 3 of the Convention. As a result, since adopting the <i>Chahal</i> judgment it has only rarely reached such a conclusion.”</p>
<p class="para">Whilst, however, I readily accept that there is a good deal of flexibility in the concept of inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment with many factors in play in determining whether it attains the minimum standard required and whether the risk of such ill-treatment is satisfied, I cannot accept that the expelling state’s desire to extradite the person concerned (legitimate though clearly it is) can itself properly be one such factor.</p>
<p class="para">88.&nbsp;&nbsp;How, then, do these principles apply in the present context? If a mandatory life sentence would properly be regarded as violating article 3 in a domestic case, so too, in my view, would the risk of it preclude expulsion of the defendant from this country in a foreign case. And this, indeed, appears to follow from the passage in the Court’s judgment in <i>Einhorn</i> cited at para 75 above. But how can that assist the appellant in the present case given, as I would hold, that there could be no question of the mandatory life sentence anticipated here constituting inhuman or degrading punishment until (if ever) the time came when his further detention in prison would be incapable of justification on any ground?  The position could hardly be more different from that which would arise had the defendant, say, after years of loving care for a progressively ill wife, deliberately then smothered her to end all further suffering. Were that to be the defendant’s position and yet he still be facing on return to Missouri a mandatory life sentence without possibility of parole and realistically no prospect of release at any time (i.e. a real risk of imprisonment continued beyond any justifiable period) the Court might well judge the risk of ill-treatment to be sufficiently real, clear and imminent to conclude that extradition must indeed be barred on article 3 grounds. </p>
<p class="para">89.&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognising the difficulty in contending on the particular facts of this case that the appellant, if convicted, will <i>ever</i> be able to suggest that he could no longer properly be detained as punishment—the circumstances of these killings being such that, had they occurred here, could well have justified the imposition of “a whole life order” pursuant to section 269 (4) of, and schedule 24(1) to the Criminal Justice Act 2003—Ms Montgomery submits that, on any view of Missouri law, the determination of the actual length of the appellant’s detention in prison will involve procedures which, in the UK or any other Council of Europe state, would themselves clearly breach article 5(4) (and probably article 6 also) of the Convention. With this I agree. What, however, I cannot accept is that on <i>this</i> account (ie putting article 3 aside) the appellant is likewise immune from extradition. Who knows what developments may occur in Missouri in the years to come which may soften that State’s approach to life imprisonment or introduce a greater element of judicial control? That consideration apart, moreover, I for my part would hold that altogether more flagrant and fundamental putative violations of articles 5 or 6 than are contemplated here would need to be established before extradition (or, indeed, expulsion from the UK for any other reason) were to be found barred on these grounds. As the ECtHR said in <i>Saadi</i>, a real risk of article 3 ill-treatment is “only rarely” established. Never yet has the Court held extradition to be barred by reference to any other article. I cannot believe that it would do so here.</p>
