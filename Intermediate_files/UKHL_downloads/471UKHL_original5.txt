<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122. I want to add a few words on the implications of the original asylum proceedings in Germany.  One of the purposes of the Dublin Convention, as it will be a purpose of the Dublin Regulation when it replaces the Convention, is to identify the Member State that should take responsibility for dealing with an asylum application, and thereby avoid multiple successive applications in different Member States.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123. In Mr Yogathas' case Germany was the responsible state under the Dublin criteria.  He made his initial application in Germany but it was refused.  There is no indication that he appealed. In these circumstances it was, in my opinion, <i>prima facie</i>, an abuse of the asylum application procedure for him to come to the United Kingdom and try again.  If there had been a change of circumstances after the refusal of the application in Germany and before the application in this country, or if new evidence had become available after the refusal of the first application, a new application might have been justifiable.  But in the absence of any such justification, and in the absence of any appeal in Germany, the new application in the United Kingdom was, in my opinion, as much an abuse of procedure as it would have been if made in Germany after the initial application had been refused.  The indications of abuse are reinforced by the circumstance that Mr Yogathas has refused to allow details of his German application to be disclosed to the UK Immigration authorities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;124. In Mr Thangarasa's case, his application for asylum in the United Kingdom was made more or less immediately after his appeal against the German authorities' decision to withdraw his refugee status had failed.  Germany was the responsible state under the Dublin Convention criteria and no details of the proceedings have been given so as to support an allegation that in withdrawing his refugee status and deciding that he should return to Colombo the German authorities acted in breach of Mr Thangarasa's human rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125. In my opinion there would be much to be said for the introduction of a practice under which an asylum applicant whose asylum application had been refused by the state responsible under the Dublin criteria and who then made a second application in another Member State would be required</p>
<p>(1) to disclose, or authorise disclosure of, the papers relating to the original application;  and</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;to provide reasons why a second application should be entertained.</p>
<p>The reasons might be a change of circumstances, or the emergence of new evidence, or some Geneva Convention or ECHR objection to the manner in which the first application was dealt with.  In the absence of any of these things, the second application would, in my opinion, be as much an abuse of process as a second action started by any other disappointed litigant.</p>
