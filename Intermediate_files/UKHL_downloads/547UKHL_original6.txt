<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;126. Mr Stadlen QC, for the Bank, submitted that the pleadings were defective because they did not allege that identified or identifiable bank officials took conscious decisions to do acts or to refrain from doing acts with the requisite guilty state of mind.  I do not accept that submission.  It is clear from the authorities that a plaintiff can allege misfeasance in public office against a body such as a local authority or a government ministry (see <i>Dunlop v Woollahra Municipal Council</i> [1982]  AC 158 and <i>Bourgoin SA v Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</i> [1986]  QB 716).  Therefore I consider that the plaintiffs are entitled in their pleadings to allege in the manner they have done misfeasance in public office against the Bank without having to give particulars of the individual officials whose decisions and actions they claim combined to bring about the misfeasance alleged.</p>
	
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;127. The fourth element which the plaintiff must prove to establish the tort is that the public officer knew that his act or omission would probably injure the plaintiff or was reckless as to the risk of injury to the plaintiff.  Mr Stadlen submitted that the judgments of the House after the earlier hearing established that to prove recklessness the plaintiff must not merely establish that the officer was aware that there was a risk of injury to the plaintiff but that he believed or suspected that his act or omission would probably injure the plaintiff and was recklessly indifferent to that probable injury.  Mr Stadlen further submitted that in pleading recklessness in a number of places in the particulars of claim the plaintiffs had failed to plead that the Bank believed or suspected that its act or omissions would probably damage the plaintiffs and was recklessly indifferent to that injury and merely pleaded that the Bank "wilfully disregarded the risk of the consequences or was recklessly indifferent to the consequences":  see for example the last four lines of paragraph 33.1 which I have set out above.  	</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;128. Having expressly pleaded that "the Bank further knew that the likely consequences were that depositors and potential depositors would suffer losses" the plaintiff then pleaded "or the Bank wilfully disregarded the risk of the consequences or was recklessly indifferent to the consequences", and in my opinion the distinction between so pleading and pleading that the Bank believed or suspected that its acts or omissions would probably damage the plaintiffs and was recklessly indifferent to that probable injury is such a fine one that an argument based on the distinction cannot constitute a ground for a strike-out under rule 3.4(2)(a).  In <i>British Airways Pension Trustees Ltd v Sir Robert McAlpine &amp; Sons Ltd </i>(1994) 72 BLR 26 the plaintiffs' statement of claim alleged that defects in a development constructed by McAlpine and designed by Project Design Partnership had diminished its value.  The defendants applied to strike out the statement of claim on the ground (inter alia) that it failed to identify which of the alleged defects had caused which part of the alleged diminution in value.  In the Court of Appeal Saville LJ stated, at pp 33C-34C:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The various defects alleged by the plaintiffs might not all be attributable to all the defendants, the cost of remedying the individual defects was not given and no attempt was made to ascribe to each defect the amount by which it contributed to the alleged diminution in value.  At the same time I have some difficulty in seeing how the defendants could fairly be said to be seriously prejudiced by these omissions.  The pleading alleges that the defects respectively attributable to McAlpine and PDP each caused the alleged diminution in value.  The alleged defects themselves were set out in some detail, McAlpine and PDP had been on site for a considerable time after practical completion and so had their own means of knowledge of the alleged defects.  Thus it seems to me that it can hardly be said that these defendants were in any real fashion placed in a position where they were unable to know what case they had to meet or were facing an unfair hearing. â€¦.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"The basic purpose of pleadings is to enable the opposing party to know what case is being made in sufficient detail to enable that party properly to prepare to answer it.  To my mind it seems that in recent years there has been a tendency to forget this basic purpose and to seek particularisation even when it is not really required.  This is not only costly in itself, but is calculated to lead to delay and to interlocutory battles in which the parties and the court pore over endless pages of pleadings to see whether or not some particular point has or has not been raised or answered, when in truth each party knows perfectly well what case is made by the other and is able properly to prepare to deal with it.  Pleadings are not a game to be played at the expense of the litigants, nor an end in themselves, but a means to the end, and that end is to give each party a fair hearing."<p></p></ul>
<p>And in considering the purpose of pleadings under the Civil Procedure Rules in <i>McPhilemy v Times Newspapers Ltd </i> [1999] 3 All ER 775, 793B Lord Woolf MR stated:</p>
<p></p><ul>"What is important is that the pleadings should make clear the general nature of the case of the pleader.  This is true both under the old rules and the new rules."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;129. In the present case where the plaintiffs plead that the Bank knew that the likely consequences were that depositors and potential depositors would suffer loss and then, in the alternative, plead recklessness, I do not consider that the omission to plead in the context of recklessness that the Bank believed or suspected that injury was likely could prejudice the Bank; and if the ultimate outcome of the trial were to depend on the precise elements necessary to constitute recklessness, I do not consider that the state of the pleadings would prejudice the Bank in advancing any arguments available to it.</p>
<i><p><i>The no real prospect of success point</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;130. The decision by Clarke J, upheld by the majority of the Court of Appeal, that the action was bound to fail and therefore should be struck out was based on two principal conclusions.  One was that there was before him all the evidence which was at that time available to the plaintiffs and that there was no reasonable possibility of the plaintiffs obtaining more evidence in the future, whether by further investigation, discovery, cross-examination of the Bank's witnesses or otherwise which might enable them to succeed.  The second conclusion was that on the basis of the evidence before him the plaintiff's claim was bound to fail (see pp 171-172 of Clarke J's third judgment).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;131. It is apparent from the judgments of Clarke J and the majority of the Court of Appeal that in ruling that the plaintiff's claim was bound to fail they took into account the findings and conclusions of Bingham LJ set out in his report.  Thus at pp 37-38 of his third judgment Clarke J stated:</p>
	
<p></p><ul>"Mr Stadlen submits that there is no support anywhere in the Bingham report for the conclusion that the Bank acted dishonestly, or that it knew that it was acting unlawfully or that it suspected that its acts or omissions would probably cause loss to depositors or potential depositors.  For the reasons already stated I shall focus only on the last of these, but I accept the submission that there is no statement in the report which gives any support for the conclusion that at any stage the Bank suspected that depositors and potential depositors would probably suffer loss as a result of the Bank's action or inaction.  Yet, as stated on page iii of the covering letter to which I have already referred, it is clear that Bingham LJ was considering the Bank's state of mind at every stage.  In my judgment, if Bingham LJ had formed the view that at any stage the Bank suspected that its action or inaction would probably injure depositors or potential depositors he would have said so.  Thus, if he had thought that the Bank suspected that BCCI would probably collapse so that new depositors would probably lose their money at any stage of the story from 1979 to 1991 he would have said so.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Yet, not only did he not say so, but his observations on the evidence are inconsistent with any such conclusion."<p></p></ul>
<p>There are other passages in his judgment where it is clear that Clarke J was influenced by findings or conclusions arrived at by Bingham LJ, and these have been referred to by my noble and learned friend Lord Hope of Craighead in his speech.</p>
	
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;132. Bingham LJ is a judge of the greatest eminence and distinction and his report sets out the entire history of BCCI from its establishment in the United Kingdom until its liquidation and the Bank's relationship to it with the greatest clarity and with much detail.  It was therefore inevitable that the plaintiffs would make use of the information contained in the report in drafting their statement of claim.  However, notwithstanding the distinction of its author, it is clear that under well established principles the findings and conclusions of Bingham LJ as to the actions and motives of the Bank would be inadmissible on the hearing of the action:  it would be the duty and responsibility of the trial judge to decide for himself, on the evidence which he heard, what were the actions and motives of the Bank.  And notwithstanding that it appears that both before Clarke J and the Court of Appeal the plaintiffs themselves sought to rely on certain passages of the Bingham report which they thought supported their case, I consider that it was also impermissible for the judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal in deciding at this interlocutory stage whether there was no real prospect of the action succeeding to be influenced by the findings and conclusions of Bingham LJ.  Therefore I am in respectful agreement with the observation of Auld LJ in his dissenting judgment [2000] 2 WLR 15, 180D:	</p>
<p></p><ul>"In the circumstances, I am of the view that Clarke J was not entitled to treat Bingham LJ's report effectively as conclusive on the questions he, the judge, had to answer in this litigation â€¦"<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;133. Therefore I am of the opinion that by taking into account the findings and conclusions of Bingham LJ, Clarke J and the majority of the Court of Appeal erred in considering the issue whether the plaintiffs' claim was bound to fail and that accordingly the House must itself address its mind to the issue (using the terminology of rule 24.2(a)(i)) whether the plaintiffs have no real prospect of succeeding in their claim.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;134. In <i>Swain v Hillman </i>[2000] 1All ER 91, 92 Lord Woolf MR said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The words 'no real prospect of being successful or succeeding' do not need any amplification, they speak for themselves.  The word 'real' distinguishes fanciful prospects of success or, as Mr Bidder QC submits, they direct the court to the need to see whether there is a 'realistic' as opposed to a 'fanciful' prospect of success."<p></p></ul>
<p>And at p 95:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Useful though the power is under Part 24, it is important that it is kept to its proper role.  It is not meant to dispense with the need for a trial where there are issues which should be investigated at the trial.  As Mr Bidder put it in his submissions, the proper disposal of an issue under Part 24 does not involve the judge conducting a mini trial, that is not the object of the provisions; it is to enable cases, where there is no real prospect of success either way, to be disposed of summarily."<p></p></ul>
	
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;135. Mr Stadlen submitted that an action should be struck out if it was apparent that at the trial the plaintiff could adduce no evidence to establish the case which he pleaded and he relied on the judgment of Neill LJ in <i>McDonald's Corporation v Steel</i> [1995] 3 All ER 615, 621E: </p>
<p></p><ul>"It is true that a pleader must not put a plea of justification (or indeed a plea of fraud) on the record lightly or without careful consideration of the evidence available or likely to become available.  But, as counsel for the plaintiffs recognised in the course of the argument, there will be cases where, provided a plea of justification is properly particularised, a defendant will be entitled to seek support for his case from documents revealed in the course of discovery or from answers to interrogatories.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>In recent times there has been what I regard as a sensible development whereby pleadings in libel actions are treated in the same way as pleadings in other types of litigation.  It is therefore instructive to refer to a short passage in the judgment of May LJ in <i> Steamship Mutual Underwriting Association Ltd v Trollope &amp; Colls Ltd</i> (1986) 6 Con LR 11, 27, where, on an application by a firm of structural engineers that the claim against them should be struck out, he said:<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>'In my opinion, to issue a writ against a party â€¦ when it is not intended to serve a statement of claim, and where one has no reasonable evidence or grounds on which to serve a statement of claim against that particular party, is an abuse of the process of the court.'<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Actions for defamation take many forms.  The allegations complained about may vary from the moderately serious to the very grave.  It may therefore be unwise to put forward a formula which will match all occasions.  Nevertheless I am satisfied that before a plea of justification is included in a defence the following criteria should normally be satisfied:  (a) the defendant should believe the words complained of to be true;  (b) the defendant should intend to support the defence of justification at the trial;  and (c) the defendant should have reasonable evidence to support the plea or reasonable grounds for supposing that sufficient evidence to prove the allegations will be available at the trial."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;136. Mr Stadlen submitted that in this case the plaintiffs have no reasonable evidence to support their allegations of deliberate abuse of power in bad faith with knowledge of probable loss to the depositors or potential depositors, and he further submitted that the plaintiffs have no reasonable grounds for supposing that sufficient evidence to prove the allegations would be available at the trial.  However in considering this submission it is necessary to take into account a later passage in the judgment of Neill LJ, at pp 622H-623A:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is to be remembered, however, that the evidence on which a defendant may be entitled to rely at trial may take a number of different forms.  It may include:  (a) his own evidence and the evidence of witnesses called on his behalf, (b) evidence contained in Civil Evidence Act statements, (c) evidence contained in his own documents or in documents produced by third parties on subpoena, (d) evidence elicited from the plaintiff or the plaintiff's witnesses in the course of cross-examination, (e) answers to interrogatories and (f) evidence contained in documents disclosed by the plaintiff on discovery.<p></p></ul>
<i><p></p><ul>"At the outset of the trial<p></p></ul>
</i>
<p></p><ul>"I understand that it has become the practice in actions for defamation to consider at the outset of the trial whether some parts of the defence should be struck out on the basis that it has become apparent that some of the matters pleaded are not going to be supported by evidence.  I can understand that in an appropriate case this is a sensible course which is likely to shorten the trial.  On the other hand there may be cases where a defendant pleads some matter which he believes to be true but which he may still be unable to prove by admissible evidence otherwise than by eliciting an answer in cross-examination.  Each case will have to be considered on its own facts."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;137. Clarke J and the majority of the Court of Appeal were of the opinion that Bingham LJ had conducted such a thorough examination of the Bank's dealings with BCCI that it was unrealistic to think that any further material of relevance would emerge and that accordingly the question whether there was reasonable evidence to support the plaintiff's case was to be determined on the basis of the evidence referred to in the Bingham report.  Mr Stadlen submitted that Clarke J and the majority of the Court for Appeal were right to hold that that evidence provided no support for an allegation that the Bank had acted dishonestly or in bad faith or with knowledge of probable loss to depositors.  I am unable to accept that submission.  Both Clarke J and the majority of the Court of Appeal found that by April 1990 the Bank knew that BCCI would probably collapse with consequential loss to depositors and potential depositors in the absence of a rescue package.  Clarke J, referring to April 1990, said at pp 116-117 of his third judgment:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Bingham LJ concludes that he did not think that any informed reader of the report could have failed to read it as seriously impugning the honesty with which the group had been run.  However, according to paragraph 2.186, with the possible exception of Mr Beverly, no-one did.  Indeed in paragraph 2.187 Bingham LJ concludes that in April 1990 and for a number of months afterwards the Governors, the Board of Banking Supervision, Mr Quinn and Mr Barnes were unaware of the serious doubts thrown by Price Waterhouse on the integrity of the [b]ank's most senior management.  Sir Patrick submits that that conclusion is incredible.  He submits that senior representatives of the Bank must have appreciated that that was the position.  I see the force of that submission, but, for present purposes, the question is not whether the Bank appreciated that there had been fraud within BCCI but whether it suspected that BCCI would probably not be rescued and nevertheless dishonestly failed to revoke its authorisation.  It is plain that the Bank appreciated that in the absence of remedial steps BCCI would indeed probably collapse."<p></p></ul>
<p>And in the judgment of the majority of the Court of Appeal Hirst LJ said at p 99G:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The report of 18 April 1990 was not therefore a totally unheralded shock for the Bank.  Nevertheless it is highly significant as marking a date after which it would be impossible, in our judgment, to contend that there was no arguable case that the Bank was aware of a very serious and very immediate threat to depositors of BCCI SA.  At this point, therefore, the prospect of a rescue operation being promoted by the Abu Dhabi ruling house, and the Bank's perception of the various possible outcomes, assumes central importance."<p></p></ul>
<p>And, at p 101H:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Throughout the preceding four sections we have adopted the same approach as that taken by the judge, and asked ourselves whether the plaintiffs have an arguable case that the Bank actually foresaw BCCI's imminent collapse at each relevant stage.  We have agreed with the judge's conclusion that all the evidence indicates that up to April 1990 it did not, and that thereafter it did, but properly relied on the prospect of a rescue.  That is sufficient to dispose of the case in the Bank's favour."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;138. In my opinion the Bank cannot validly contend that on the documentary evidence available to them the plaintiffs have no real prospect of succeeding in establishing that the Bank knowingly and in a deliberate way abused its statutory powers in failing to revoke BCCI's licence after it had been granted.  A memorandum dated 19 October 1983 from an official in the Bank's Banking Supervision Division to a number of senior officials of the Bank states:</p>
<p></p><ul>"This note reviews our approach to the supervision of BCCI, arguing that our present approach fails to satisfy the requirements of the Banking Act and recommending that we should press BCCI for local incorporation of UK operations. â€¦<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"However, these problems are less serious than the present deficiencies in our supervisory approach in the light of the Banking Act's requirements.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"The problem with regard to the section 36 contraventions is more difficult, particularly with regard to the branches of BCCI SA, to which there seems no practicable alternative to turning a blind eye."   <p></p></ul>
<p>And in a note of a meeting of Bank officials dated 17 December 1985 after a team from the Bank had visited the BCCI offices in Leadenhall Street the following comment by an official is noted:</p>
<p></p><ul>"There is no doubt in my mind that BCCI has centralised its management, control and operations in the City.  This is a UK-based bank, with its White House encompassing two buildings fronting Leadenhall Street and three at the rear.  There is absolutely no way that we should continue the pretence that Luxembourg are the prime supervisors.  Luxembourg is prehistoric;  Grand Cayman is a tax haven;  and it is the Bank of England who are the lender of last resort.  If UK incorporation of the UK branch network means the movement of the Treasury Support Organisation from London to Abu Dhabi, the Bank must encourage Abedi all the way.  This surely is the only route to effective supervision."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;139. I observed in my speech after the earlier hearing [2000] 2 WLR 1220, 1266F-H that I considered that, in the context of misfeasance, "in bad faith" is a preferable term to "dishonesty".  In relation to the element of bad faith the plaintiffs plead in paragraph 37 of the particulars of claim that the Bank's motives set out in that paragraph constitute bad faith.  Lord Neill QC, for the plaintiffs, submitted that an inference can be drawn from a number of the Bank's documents that it was reluctant to face up to the difficulties and responsibilities involved in an adequate supervision of BCCI and that it placed its own interests before the discharge of its duty to protect depositors and that this constituted bad faith on its part.  It is relevant to emphasise that this is the case made by the plaintiffs.  They do not make the case that the officials of the Bank were dishonest, in the sense that they acted improperly for their own financial gain.  Therefore I consider, with respect, that the point that it is inherently improbable that in the absence of some financial incentive bank officials would act dishonestly, does not assist the Bank's case.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;140. Lord Neill referred (inter alia) to a letter dated 8 April 1987 from a senior official of the Bank to a senior official of the Commissariat au Controle des Banques in Luxembourg written after the Bank had been informed that it was no longer possible for Luxembourg to carry out the consolidated supervisory role which it had accepted in the last few years.  In the letter the official said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The precise formulation set out in your letter poses a particular problem for us.  This is that having decided not to take a leading supervisory role, we believe that the incorporation of the 45 UK branches here, combined with the presence in London of a large part of BCCI's overall administration, is likely to draw us in practice into the position of lead supervisor which we seek to avoid.  In those circumstances, our ability to do the job effectively would be even more restricted than if we had assumed the role officially from the outset.  In any case we are not at all certain that we would feel able to grant a licence by applying the criteria under the UK Banking Act, to any part of the operation at this stage.  This is because we have to be satisfied under our new legislation not only that an institution will be prudently run but that it will be run with integrity - and our experience with BCCI in the past make such a judgment difficult."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;141. In respect of the need for the plaintiffs to show material to support their allegation that the Bank knew of probable loss to depositors or was reckless as to whether there would be loss to depositors, Lord Neill referred to certain paragraphs in the affidavit of a senior Bank official sworn in July 1991 in support of the Bank's petition to wind up BCCI.  The official stated: </p>
<p></p><ul>"20.	The Bank is seriously concerned that BCCI has been managed and may still be being managed in a dishonest and fraudulent manner.  The Bank is and continues to be concerned that the true financial position of BCCI has been and continues to be concealed by BCCI from the Bank and other regulatory authorities which are part of the  'college'..  It appears from the Price Waterhouse report that the accounting records have completely failed and continue to fail to meet the standards required of institutions authorised under the Banking Act.  It further appears that there is no proper or adequate system or controls for managing the business of BCCI.  The management of BCCI have acted without integrity and with a lack of skill.  Notwithstanding the fact that it might be said of some of the senior managers that they were not directly involved in the fraudulent activity described in the Price Waterhouse report, management have as a whole been involved in keeping that activity and its consequences concealed from the Bank and other regulatory authorities.  As a result of the  information provided to it, the Bank has no trust or confidence in the senior management of BCCI which is essential to the relationship between the regulator and the regulated bank.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"21.	As a supervisor of BCCI the Bank is concerned that the interest of depositors will be jeopardised if the affairs of BCCI are left in the hands of its managers and it has formed the view that the interest of depositors will be best served by the winding-up of BCCI.  In these circumstances the Bank believes that it would be just and equitable to wind up BCCI. â€¦<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"24.	In April 1990 it became apparent that BCCI had a substantial portfolio of US $4 billion of problem loans.  In the 1989 year-end accounts substantial provisions were first raised against a US $4 billion portfolio of problem loans in the group, many of which were booked in BCCI.  On 22 May 1991 a financial support arrangement was entered into by BCCI whereby these problem loans were transferred to new companies which were either owned directly by the Government of Abu Dhabi, or if not, largely guaranteed by the Government of Abu Dhabi.  In return for the loan assets BCCI received promissory notes in US$ and UAE Dhirams equivalent in face value to US $3,061 million.  However, from the report it appears that the loan assets can be reassigned to BCCI in the event of any breach of warranty that the loan assets do not involve any activity which is criminal or illegal and which, if revealed might be expected to damage the international reputation of the Abu Dhabi Government.  At a meeting held on 5 October 1990 the Abu Dhabi Government said that if fraud was detected there could be a serious problem about the continuation of the support of the Abu Dhabi Government.  Whilst the Abu Dhabi Government has said that it has no present intention to reassign the loan assets, there must be a risk that it will do so.  If it does, the problem portfolio will revert to BCCI.  In July 1991 the Abu Dhabi Government indicated to Price Waterhouse that it was not prepared to commit itself to providing further funds for BCCI to m[e]et all its liabilities on an unqualified basis. Given the present uncertainty surrounding BCCI's liabilities it is fair to conclude that there is no real prospect of sufficient funds being made available within such time as the relevant regulators might require."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;142. Lord Neill submitted that the concerns of the Bank set out in paragraphs 20 and 21 had been known to the Bank for a number of years, as evidenced by the letter dated 8 April 1987 to the official in Luxembourg in which the senior official of the Bank stated that the Bank had to be satisfied that BCCI would be run with integrity, "and our experiences with BCCI in the past make such a judgment difficult."   Lord Neill also referred to a memorandum  to the Governors of the Bank dated 15 July 1983 from a senior official of the Bank in which he said that the Bank's officials had become increasingly concerned about the ineffectiveness of the present arrangements for the overall supervision of BCCI and that he attached a note setting out possible ways of dealing with "what has now become, in our view, an unacceptable position."  The note, which was headed "WHY HAS BCCI BECOME A PROBLEM?  WHY IS ACTION NOW URGENTLY REQUIRED?", stated that it was clear that the principal place of BCCI was not Luxembourg but was, administratively, the United Kingdom and that being so, and in the light of the Luxembourg authorities' admission that their resources were no longer up to the task of supervising BCCI's operations, the Bank was in "a vulnerable position".  The note further stated that the Bank's knowledge of the activities of BCCI in the United Kingdom and its limited knowledge of the BCCI group as a whole did not inspire confidence in the soundness of BCCI's worldwide operations.  The note went on to state:</p>
<p></p><ul>"As noted, the present arrangements are wholly unsatisfactory and it is not therefore considered an option to sit back and do nothing.  This leaves two basic choices:<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a) to try to have BCCI closed down, either worldwide or just the UK region;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b) to arrange for its supervision on a satisfactory basis."<p></p></ul>
<p>Lord Neill further referred to a paper of the Board of Banking Supervision dated 3 September 1987 which stated that at their last meeting they had expressed concern about whether the UK depositors with BCCI SA were receiving adequate protection from the supervisory regime in place, or in prospect.  The Board asked whether the UK depositors might not be better protected if BCCI were only permitted to take deposits in the UK via a UK subsidiary.  They questioned whether the formation of such a subsidiary would increase the "moral hazard" of the UK supervisors in relation to the whole BCCI group and whether, even if it did, the interests of the UK depositors should not be paramount.  The paper went on to state that the cause of the concern did not stem from any obvious weakness in the BCCI group.  The concern was rather one of scepticism towards a large, shadowy and swift growing bank with no natural geographic base.  The paper then stated:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The BCCI group is frequently subject to rumours which suggest that it or its clients operate at the margin of legality.  Many observers accordingly have developed a gut feeling that the bank might suddenly run into serious difficulties without warning.  The fact that so much of the group's business is booked in centres where supervision is less professional, particularly in relation to the type of business which BCCI undertakes, makes the absence of warning all the more likely."<p></p></ul>
<p>Lord Neill submitted that in July 1983, in September 1987 and in April 1990 the Bank took no steps to arrange for supervision of BCCI on a satisfactory basis but was reckless as to the serious risk of loss to depositors.</p>
