<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;134.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appellants were all segregated by an order of the relevant prison governor under rule 80(1) of the Prison Rules.  But they were not subject to segregation for more than 72 hours unless, on an application by the governor, the Scottish Ministers granted written authority prior to the expiry of the 72 hour period:  rule 80(5).  That authority had effect for a period of one month from the expiry of the 72 hour period and it could be renewed for further periods of a month on a subsequent application by the governor:  rule 80(6).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;135.&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms of these rules would therefore suggest that, while the basis for the initial segregation of 72 hours would be the governor's order, the basis for any segregation for a period of longer than that would be constituted by the governor's order plus the written authority granted by the Scottish Ministers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;136.&nbsp;&nbsp;During the course of the hearing before the House reference was made to the power of a governor under para (7)(a)(1) to cancel an order made under rule 80(1) at any time if he considers it appropriate to do so.  It appeared to be accepted by the respondents that this power applied at any time, even when the Scottish Ministers had granted authority under rule 80(5) and (6).  Despite the distinction drawn between a para (1) order and a para (5) authority in rule 80(8), I am prepared to accept that this is indeed the position, especially since the duty in para 7(b), to cancel an order if a medical officer advises that it should be done, must surely apply at any time when the prisoner is segregated.  It follows that, at any time during the appellants' detention, the governor had a power under para 7(a)(1) to cancel the segregation order if he considered it appropriate to do so.  He therefore had a continuing role in relation to the appellants' detention, even though it had been authorised by the Scottish Ministers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;137.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appellants all seek a declarator that in their case both the initial orders by the governors under Rule 80(1) and the grants of authority by the Ministers under Rule 80(5) and (6) were incompatible with their article 8 Convention rights and so unlawful under section 6(1) of the HRA and ultra vires by virtue of section 57(2) of the Scotland Act.  So far as they relate this claim against the Ministers to the Scotland Act, no question of a time-limit arises.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;138.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the Scottish Ministers argued that, when making an order under rule 80(1) or making an application to the Ministers under rules 80(5) and (6), the governor of a prison is exercising a specific power which the Prison Rules confer on governors and which cannot be exercised by the Ministers themselves.  Counsel for the appellants submitted that, while this might be an appropriate conclusion where the functions were conferred exclusively on some unique office holder, the position was different here where, in terms of rule 3(1), the term "governor" in rule 80 covers a variety of people down to "the most senior officer who is present in prison at that time".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;139.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, having regard to the express terms of the relevant paragraphs of Rule 80, the Ministers' submission on this point should be accepted.  In <i>Leech v Deputy Governor of Parkhurst Prison</i> [1988] AC 533, 578D-E, Lord Oliver of Aylmerton held, in the case of a governor carrying out his disciplinary functions under the English Prison Rules 1964, that the governor "is not a mere servant or alter ego of the Secretary of State but a statutory officer performing statutory duties."  Mutatis mutandis, I would apply his reasoning to the governor's role under rule 80.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;140.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that the definition of "governor" is flexible enough to cater for various circumstances cannot affect the fundamental point that whoever is acting as governor for the purposes of rule 80 at the relevant time is exercising a distinct function, or distinct functions, which cannot be carried out by the Scottish Ministers.  Lord Oliver cannot have thought that there was any particular magic in the term "governor" since rule 99 of the Prison Rules 1964, which were in issue in <i>Leech</i>, provided that "'governor' includes an officer for the time being in charge of a prison."  That definition, too, is designed to introduce a certain measure of flexibility even in cases of discipline.  Under rule 80 of the Scottish Prison Rules, the Scottish Ministers have their own distinct functions.  The division between the role of the governor and the role of the Ministers is indeed essential if the protections for prisoners contained in the rule are to be effective.  It follows that the familiar principle in <i>Carltona Ltd v Commissioners of Works </i>[1943] 2 All ER 560 has no application to what the governor does under rule 80.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;141.&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither party suggested that, if the House allowed the appeal on the first issue, this second issue could simply be left over to be decided after any proof.  Admittedly, it is not clear at this stage how significant any case based on the orders and the applications of the governors may turn out to be when any proof has been held since, on any view, their actions, while distinct, were closely tied up with the actions of the Scottish Ministers.  In such circumstances it would often be appropriate to leave such an issue until the end, when its practical significance, if any, should become clearer.  But two related matters seem to me to point strongly against adopting that course here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;142.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, if it is indeed the case that the governors are carrying out a distinct function that is conferred on them alone and for which the Scottish Ministers are not responsible, then their actions are not covered by the Scotland Act.  This does not, of course, leave any gap in the protection of prisoners' Convention rights since any acts or failures to act by the governors which were incompatible with prisoners' Convention rights would be unlawful under section 6(1) of the HRA.  On the other hand, it does mean that any proceedings in respect of an alleged violation of the appellants' Convention rights by the governors would need to be based on the HRA and the time-limit in section 7(5) would apply to those proceedings.  It may not be without significance that in their written submissions counsel for the appellants refer to the possibility of amending the pleadings to seek an equitable extension of the time-limit in terms of section 7(5)(b).  The Scottish Ministers reserve their position until any motion is made to amend.  I shall come back to this point shortly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;143.&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, and even more importantly, if - as I hold - the Scottish Ministers are correct and they are not responsible for the actions of the governors, any proceedings relating to the actions of the governors would need to be directed, not against the Scottish Ministers, but against the governors themselves.  The present proceedings were served on the governors as interested parties, but they were not made respondents and they have not entered the process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;144.&nbsp;&nbsp;If indeed it is the case that any proceedings for relief in respect of the governors' actions would have to be directed against the governors themselves, then it is a point which should be addressed now and not postponed until after the proof.  Deciding the point against the appellants at that stage could either cause them substantial prejudice or else lead to attempts to bring fresh proceedings in some form or another, with further expense and delay.  Accordingly, since the Scottish Ministers have raised the point and both sides have addressed it, I consider that the House should decide it by sustaining the argument for the Scottish Ministers.  The point is also of significance for the third issue to which I now turn.</p>
<i><p><i>The Third Issue</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;145.&nbsp;&nbsp;The third issue relates to the appropriate starting point for the running of the time limit in section 7(5) of the HRA.  Like the first issue, this point arises only in the cases of Mr Blanco and Mr Henderson.  Moreover, once your Lordships have held that section 7(5) of the HRA does not apply to the proceedings against the Scottish Ministers by reference to the Scotland Act, it arises as a live issue only in relation to proceedings against the respective governors based on section 6(1) of the HRA.  As I have just noted, the governors are not respondents in the present proceedings and, therefore, Mr Blanco and Mr Henderson do not have any claim for any relief by way of damages under section 8 against them.  So the issue would only really arise if and when counsel for Mr Blanco and Mr Henderson sought leave to amend their petitions to make the governors respondents and to seek remedies against them.  In that eventuality, it would seem at least arguable that any proceedings, so far as directed against the governors as public authorities, would have been commenced well after the expiry of the one-year period in section 7(5)(a) of the HRA.  On that view the appellants would have to seek an equitable extension under section 7(5)(b).  It would then be for counsel acting on behalf of the governors to argue against such an extension, if so advised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;146.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it would be wrong to speculate on these matters at this stage.  Once it is held, as I have held, that the Scottish Ministers are not responsible for the actions of the governors under rule 80, it follows that the Ministers have no interest or locus to take any point on the application of section 7(5) to possible proceedings against the governors.  It is quite simply a point that does not arise in these proceedings in their present form.  I would accordingly express no view on it.</p>
<i><p><i>The Fourth Issue</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;147.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth issue relates to the relevancy of the averments that the orders and grants and renewals of authority were disproportionate et separatim unreasonable at common law.  So far as the orders and grants of authority themselves are concerned, the petitioners have averments and craves based on article 8 of the Convention.  Similarly, the appellants have averments and craves relating to the conditions of their segregation which are again based, in part, on article 8.  Proportionality is built into the article and so the averments relating to the proportionality of the Scottish Ministers' actions are relevant to that aspect of the cases.  If article 8 is held to apply and the appellants show that the Ministers' actions in granting or extending authority were disproportionate, then the appellants will succeed without having to rely on the common law.  So the relevancy, at common law, of the appellants' averments that the Ministers' actions were disproportionate will arise as a live issue only if the court holds (1) that article 8 does not apply to the relevant grants of authority etc of the Ministers or that those grants of authority etc were not disproportionate under article 8;  (2) that those grants of authority etc were not <i>Wednesbury </i>unreasonable but (3) that they might none the less be disproportionate at common law.  In my view the point can safely and prudently be left until such a contingency occurs.</p>
<i><p><i>The Fifth Issue</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;148.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth and final issue relates to the procedure adopted by the Lord Ordinary and approved by the Inner House in relation to the public immunity claim made by the Minister of Justice in respect of certain documents.  Since I agree with what your Lordships have said on the point, I can deal with it briefly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;149.&nbsp;&nbsp;More often than not, procedural questions are best left to the Inner House.  But here, in deciding that the Lord Ordinary should not look at the documents concerned, both the Lord Ordinary herself and the Inner House have proceeded on a mistaken basis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;150.&nbsp;&nbsp;In judicial review proceedings the respondent public authority is expected to lodge the documents which relate to the decision under review and so, frequently, the petitioner will not need to ask the court to order production.  Nevertheless, there are cases, such as the present, where the petitioner wants to recover documents which the other side has not lodged and is unwilling to lodge.  In such cases, in the usual way, the petitioner must draw up a document specifying or describing the documents which he wants.  That document is then lodged in process and a motion is made for the judge to take the necessary steps to require the person holding the documents to hand them over.  In the present case the documents in question were in the hands of the respondents.  The motion to recover the documents listed in the specification no 12 of process was granted unopposed.  The petitioners then sought a further batch of documents listed in the specification no 13 of process.  The Lord Ordinary heard counsel By Order and her interlocutor of 18 August 2004 records that she granted the order sought, "there being no objection".  Since a party is not entitled to recover any document unless it is of potential relevance to an averment in the pleadings, the fact that there was no objection by counsel for the respondents shows that they accepted that documents falling within the terms of the specification were indeed relevant to the issues raised in the pleadings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;151.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordinarily, that would have been an end of the matter:  the respondents would simply have had to produce all the documents falling within the terms of the specification.  But, in the same interlocutor, the Lord Ordinary refers to the respondents having asserted a claim to public interest immunity in respect of certain documents.  That assertion presupposed that the documents in question were covered by the terms of the specification and would have to be produced unless the Lord Ordinary upheld the respondents' claim for public interest immunity in respect of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;152.&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of an agreement contained in a "protocol", under conditions of the strictest confidentiality, senior counsel for the petitioners was allowed to inspect the complete versions of the documents for which the respondents were claiming public interest immunity.  Although devised with the best of intentions, this procedure was, in my view, wrong in principle.  As a result, it not only gave rise to very real practical difficulties but led the court to adopt a mistaken approach to the inspection of the documents by the Lord Ordinary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;153.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the respondents' claim that, in the public interest, the redacted parts of the documents should not be revealed was valid, then, in normal course, it was valid against counsel for the petitioners who should therefore not have seen the full version.  As it was, counsel for the petitioners was left in a very difficult situation where, as a result of reading the documents, he had information that he was not able to reveal to, or discuss with, his clients or instructing solicitors.  He even felt inhibited from revealing it to the Lord Ordinary.  The result was a certain paralysis in the procedure.  In agreement with all of your Lordships, I am satisfied that no such procedure should be followed in future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;154.&nbsp;&nbsp;Counsel for the petitioners moved the Lord Ordinary to have the documents produced to the court so that she could decide whether the redacted passages should be disclosed to the petitioners.  By her interlocutor of 8 February 2005, however, the Lord Ordinary refused to order that the documentary material covered by the public interest immunity certificate should be produced for inspection by the court.  The First Division refused the reclaiming motion against that decision.  In doing so, they proceeded on the basis that, having seen the documents, counsel for the petitioners should have been able to point to specific averments in the pleadings which disclosure of the redacted passages would serve to prove or disprove and without which the petitioner in question would be deprived of the means of the proper presentation of his case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;155.&nbsp;&nbsp;That approach presupposes, contrary to principle, that counsel for the petitioners has read the unredacted material - something which had happened in this case only because of the protocol.  The correct starting point, as I have said, is that the redacted passages are indeed relevant to one or more issues in the petitioners' cases, since otherwise there could be no question of them being produced under the specification.  In these circumstances, there was no onus on counsel for the petitioners to show why they should recover the full version of the documents, including the redacted passages.  The decision on whether they should do so was one for the Lord Ordinary after balancing the competing interests of the petitioners in having relevant material and of the public in maintaining the confidentiality of that material.  I can see no way in which the Lord Ordinary could carry out that vital balancing exercise in this case without actually looking at the documents in question.  In holding that she should not look at them, both the Lord Ordinary and the Inner House appear to have attached undue weight to an isolated remark of Lord Fraser of Tullybelton in <i>Air Canada v Secretary of State for Trade </i>[1983] 2 AC 394, 436C-D, and not enough weight to a passage in his earlier speech in <i>Science Research Council v Nassé </i>[1980] AC 1028, 1085F-H.  There he indicated that, where the holder of documents objected to producing them on the ground of confidentiality, it would be the duty of the judge to read them and decide whether disclosure of the contents was necessary for the fair disposal of the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;156.&nbsp;&nbsp;The procedure which should be followed was outlined recently by Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood in <i>Tweed v Parades Commission for Northern Ireland </i>[2007] 1 AC 650, a judicial review case where issues of proportionality were in play.  He said, at p 674, para 58:</p>
<p></p><ul>"[T]he judge should receive from the respondent and inspect the full text of the disputed documents (consistently with the practice laid down by the House of Lords in <i>Science Research Council v Nassé </i>[1980] AC 1028);  if he concludes that realistically their disclosure could not affect the outcome of the proportionality challenge he will dismiss the appellant's application for inspection;  if, however, he reaches the contrary conclusion he will need to consider (with counsel's assistance) the question of redaction;  only then may he still need to determine the respondent's public interest immunity claim."<p></p></ul>
<p>Similar guidance is to be found in the speech of Lord Bingham at p 656, para 5.  If the Lord Ordinary reaches the stage when she has to determine the public immunity claim, then, as laid down in <i>Science Research Council v Nassé</i>, the test to be applied is whether production of the full version of the document to the petitioners is necessary for disposing fairly of the proceedings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;157.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons I would allow the appeal on this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;158.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would accordingly dispose of the appeals as Lord Hope proposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;159.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already mentioned that judicial review proceedings should be brought promptly in the interests of good administration.  Precisely the same interests dictate that they should also be disposed of promptly.  The reforms introduced in the wake of Lord Fraser of Tullybelton's observations in <i>Brown v Hamilton District Council </i>1983 SC (HL) 1, 49, were designed to produce a speedy result by, for example, requiring only succinct pleadings.  The pleadings in this case are the reverse of succinct and are anything but clear.  That has undoubtedly contributed to some of the delays that have occurred.  I can only express the hope that everything will be done by the Lord Ordinary to ensure that the cases come to trial as speedily as possible, given that they have already been in court for over four years.</p>
<p><b>LORD WALKER OF GESTINGTHORPE</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;160.&nbsp;&nbsp;In November 2004 the Lord Ordinary was to have embarked on the full hearing of these linked claims.  But one item of evidence (a specialist's report) was not ready and it was decided that the time set aside for the hearing should be devoted to argument on a number of pleas in law and other interlocutory issues.  These arguments before the Lord Ordinary occupied 15 days.  A further 12 days' argument took place before the First Division during January 2006, and by interlocutors dated 29 November and 13 December 2006 the First Division gave leave to appeal to your Lordships' House on five issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;161.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord Ordinary's decision to hear so much interlocutory argument was no doubt intended to save time and costs in the long run, but I very much doubt whether that aim will ultimately be achieved.  Important issues of law have been argued without a proper evidential basis of findings of fact, and even (as your Lordships were told more than once in the course of argument) without the pleadings being in their final form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;162.&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulty of identifying the real issues has been exacerbated (for those not very familiar with Scottish procedure) by the huge amount of duplicated and redundant material in the voluminous papers placed before the House.  The papers seem to have been prepared with more regard to the letter than to the spirit of the appropriate practice directions.  All this juggernaut of litigation is being conducted at public expense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;163.&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important issue of law is as to the interaction of the Human Rights Act 1998 and the Scotland Act 1998.  On that issue your Lordships are equally divided, with each side regarding the outcome as tolerably clear.  I have to say that I have found this point much more difficult.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;164.&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate centres on section 100 of the Scotland Act 1998 which was introduced, as your Lordships were told, as a late amendment to the Bill.  Subsections (1) and (3) are expressed in an unusual way in that they are (in terms of what is expressly enacted) wholly negative in their effect.  Reading and rereading these subsections, and trying to put them into their proper legislative context, I find it very difficult to accept that they represent a subtle and deliberate choice made by Parliament in order to produce a coherent legislative scheme.  If that is indeed what they represent I can only say, facing up as best I can to the Swiftian strictures of my noble and learned friend Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, that the subtlety passes me by.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;165.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have at times during the appeal been attracted to the notion that section 100 may have had no clear positive purpose (that is, to confer a statutory cause of action) but had only the negative purpose of setting limits on any such right of action as the court might ultimately hold to have been conferred.  That would have been a curiously unambitious aim, but not wholly implausible at a time when there was continuing uncertainty about the principles governing claims for damages against public authorities (<i>X (Minors) v Bedfordshire County Council</i> [1995]  2 AC 633 was decided by this House in June 1995).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;166.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have however come to the conclusion that that notion, and the alternative approaches canvassed by my noble and learned friends Lord Scott of Foscote and Lord Mance, face even greater difficulties than the views set out by my noble and learned friends Lord Hope of Craighead and Lord Rodger.  I would therefore join with them in allowing the appeal on the first issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;167.&nbsp;&nbsp;On all the other issues I agree with the opinions of Lord Hope and Lord Rodger. I would make the order which Lord Hope proposes. I respectfully concur in the observations in para 65 of Lord Hope's opinion and the final paragraph of Lord Rodger's opinion.</p>
<p><b>LORD MANCE</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<i><p>Introduction</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;168.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the benefit of reading in draft the opinions prepared by all of your Lordships. I gratefully adopt the summary of the issues and account of the background which my noble and learned friend Lord Hope of Craighead gives in paragraphs 1 to 9. I have however reached different conclusions on issues (1) and (3).</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Issue 1: the relationship between the Scotland Act and the Human Rights Act in the context of claims based on breach of Convention rights</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) General</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;169.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Human Rights Act 1998 was enacted on 9th November 1998 ten days before the Scotland Act 1998, although its provisions were (with presently immaterial exceptions) only brought into force on 2 October 2000.  The two statutes are essential elements of the architecture of the modern United Kingdom. It is important that they interact precisely and coherently. Their drafters had this in mind, as evidenced by cross-referencing in both. We should construe both statutes in the same spirit. This is of great relevance to the main issue on this appeal: whether the Scotland Act enables claims to be made for damages in respect of acts incompatible with Convention rights, which would be free of the time limit applicable to similar claims under s.7(5) of the Human Rights Act. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;170.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Human Rights Act makes it "unlawful" for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right (s.6(1)). S.7(1)  enables a person who claims that a public authority has acted (or proposes to act) in such a way to "(a) bring proceedings against the authority under  this Act in the appropriate court or tribunal, or (b) to rely on the Convention right or rights concerned in any legal proceedings", but in each case only if he is or would be a victim of the unlawful act. This limitation reflects the Strasbourg test of standing. It has been criticised as too restrictive of challenges by public interest groups. But what is presently relevant is the requirement under s.7(5) that proceedings under s.7(1)(a) (though not s.7(1)(b)) be brought before the end of "the period of one year beginning with the date on which the act complained of took place; or …. such longer period as the court or tribunal considers equitable having regard to all the circumstances". This is subject to any rule imposing a stricter time limit in relation to the procedure in question. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;171.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under English procedure, subject to the court's power to extend time, judicial review proceedings must be begun promptly and in any event not later than three months after the grounds to make the claim first arose (CPR 54). There is no equivalent limit in Scotland, though principles of <i>mora</i>, taciturnity and acquiescence may in some circumstances bar proceedings. But the appellants' damages claims are based (at present solely) on allegations of acts incompatible with the appellants' Convention rights, and the respondents submit that they can only be brought subject to the time limit in s.7(5) of the Human Rights Act. The practical result (depending on how that time limit applies) could be to preclude pursuit of certain claims or aspects of the petitioners' claims, subject to the court's discretion to extend time.  The appellants submit that their claims can be made under or by reference to the Scotland Act and without express time limit. Further, in his submissions in reply, Mr O'Neill raised a new point: that the appellants' claims would anyway fall within s.7(1)(b), rather than s.7(1)(a) of the Human Rights Act, and so would not be subject to the time limit in s.7(5) in any event.</p>
