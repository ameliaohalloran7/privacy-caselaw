<p align="right"><a href="spence-3.htm">(back to preceding text)</a></p>

<p class="para">91.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, I believe that the difficult exercise of identifying the outer parameters of the Regulations’ application requires further thought and more detailed submissions on another occasion. A persuasive case can be made for saying that the Regulations do not supersede the ordinary principles governing liability to third parties, merely because a third party suffers injury due to a defect in work equipment.  The HSC endorsed this in its proposals, to which the Regulations were intended to give effect “without modifications", when the HSC said in paragraph 47:</p>
<p class="qt">“At present, PUWER does not apply to persons who provide work equipment as part of a work activity for use by members of the public e.g. an air line on a garage forecourt or lifts provided for use by members of the public in a shopping mall, we propose to retain this position in PUWER II. This is a grey area where consumer legislation and health and safety legislation overlap so it is not proposed to apply PUWER to work equipment provided primarily for use by members of the public. Members of the public will continue to be protected by the requirements of [the Health and Safety at Work Act], primarily sections 3 and 4.”</p>
<p class="para">In <i>Donaldson v. Hays Distribution Services Ltd. </i>2005 CSIH 48; 2005 SC (Vol. 1) 523, the First Division adopted a similar distinction, when holding that a visitor who was crushed between a lorry and a loading bay while collecting her purchases at a shopping centre did not have a strict liability claim under the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 (SI 1992/3004) against the lorry driver’s employers or the controllers of the bay. However, it is unnecessary in my view to consider such problems further in circumstances where the injured appellant was a contractor at work repairing work equipment controlled by the platform operator against whom the claim is brought.</p>
<p class="lawlord">LORD NEUBERGER OF ABBOTSBURY</p>
<p class="mylords">My Lords,</p>
<p class="para">92.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having read in draft the opinions of my noble and learned friends, Lord Hoffmann, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, Lord Carswell and Lord Mance, I can be brief in explaining why, in agreement with them, I consider that this appeal should be allowed. </p>
<p class="para">93.&nbsp;&nbsp;Interpreting the 1998 Regulations is not an easy task, at least judging by the problems posed by the issues raised on this appeal. The first issue is whether the door closer in this case was “work equipment” within regulation 2(1) For the reasons given by Lord Hoffmann in paras 10 and 11, by Lord Rodger at para 49, Lord Carswell at paras 73 and 74, and by Lord Mance in para 89, and as a matter of ordinary language, I consider that the door closer was an “appliance …. or installation for use at work". </p>
<p class="para">94.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree with the reasons of Lord Hoffmann, in paras 12 to 14, and of Lord Rodger, in para 58, for rejecting the argument that, because the door closer might be regarded as part of the premises to which it was attached, it cannot be “work equipment". There may well be cases where it could be difficult to decide whether an item should be treated as work equipment or as part of the fabric of work premises, but this is not such a case. I also agree with Lord Rodger at para 56, where he says that the door closer did not cease to be work equipment because it had broken down or was being repaired.</p>
<p class="para">95.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, the door closer was work equipment for which Talisman was responsible under the 1998 Regulations to its regular workers on the Tartan Alpha platform as they “used” it. The second issue is whether Talisman has a similar responsibility to the appellant, who was in the process of repairing the door closer as an employee of KBR, to whom the repair of the door closer appears to have been contracted. </p>
<p class="para">96.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once a particular item is “work equipment", at least from the perspective of a particular employer, it seems to me that it cannot cease to be work equipment (save perhaps in cases such as that of the company car when used for an entirely private journey, as mentioned by Lord Mance at the beginning of para 84). Accordingly, in this case, given that the door closer was “work equipment", it did not cease to become so simply because it was being repaired, rather than used as a door closer. In this connection, I agree with your Lordships that the reasoning of the Court of Appeal in <i>Hammond v The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis </i>[2004] ICR 1467 (which could be said to be a weaker case than this for the employer, as the claimant in that case was his employee) cannot be supported. </p>
<p class="para">97.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Lord Mance in para 86, I find the reasoning of Lord Rodger in paras 50 to 54 persuasive, and it seems to me that, in practice, the reasoning of Lord Hoffmann in para 23 will, at least normally, amount to the same thing. </p>
<p class="para">98.&nbsp;&nbsp;The limits of the scope of the duty imposed by the 1998 Regulations so far as third parties are concerned need not be decided in this case. There is much to be said for the view that there is no limit to the class of persons to whom the duty is owed, as is implied by what Lord Hoffmann says in paras 19 and 20. Thus, at least as at present advised, there seems to me to be nothing in the express terms of the 1998 Regulations to suggest that the duties they impose are to be limited to full-time employees, or any other limited class of persons. </p>
<p class="para">99.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, for the reasons given by Lord Mance in para 90, I consider that Talisman’s duties under the 1998 Regulations in relation to the door closer did extend to the appellant, although I share the concerns as expressed in the following paragraph. I also agree that, for the reasons given by Lord Rodger, at paras 59 to 63, the appellant was “using” the door closer when he was repairing it, in the light of the very wide definition of “use of work equipment” in regulation 2(1). </p>
<p class="para">100.&nbsp;&nbsp;The final issue is, given that the appellant’s appeal should be allowed in relation to Talisman, whether it should also be allowed in relation to KBR. On that issue, as Lord Hoffmann has explained in para 28, it has been conceded by counsel representing both respondents that, if Talisman is liable to the appellant for the damages that he claims, KBR should also be so liable. Accordingly, while I share Lord Mance’s concerns in this connection as expressed in para 88, it is unnecessary to consider that aspect any further.</p>
