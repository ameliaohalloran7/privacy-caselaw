<p class="para">79.&nbsp;&nbsp;By imposing the hospital order with a restriction, the judge was ensuring that, because he had committed manslaughter, the claimant would not be free to move around in the community unless and until authorised to do so by the Secretary of State. This meant, among other things, that he was not to be free to work and earn while subject to the orders.  In other words, his earning capacity was removed for as long as they were in force.  In my view, it would be inconsistent with the policy underlying the making of the orders for a civil court now to award the claimant damages for loss of earnings relating to the period when he was subject to them.</p>
<p class="para">80.&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific authority in favour of that approach, where the plaintiff had been imprisoned, is indeed to be found in the judgment of Samuels JA in <i>State Rail Authority of New South Wales v Wiegold</i> (1991) 25 NSWLR 500, 515:</p>
<p class="qt">“It is true that in the present case the learned trial judge did not, as in <i>Meah v McCreamer </i>[1985] 1 All ER 367, find that the respondent was entitled to compensation for loss of liberty resulting from imprisonment, or for lost wages during incarceration, or for any loss in post release earning capacity resulting from his conviction and imprisonment.  Rather, what he did was to refuse to treat the conviction and imprisonment of the appellant as a vicissitude of life, for want of a better term, which had crystallised before the date of the hearing, and which reduced the notional economic loss which could be attributed to the appellant’s negligence: cf <i>Faulkner v Keffalinos </i>(1970) 45 ALJR 80, at 85, 88.  But in point of principle, I cannot see that there is a relevant distinction between the two sorts of case.  If one cannot get ‘direct’ compensation for the non-economic or economic loss resulting from imprisonment, one should not be able to receive ‘indirect’ compensation for lost earning capacity after imprisonment by treating the fact of imprisonment as irrelevant to the assessment of economic loss.”</p>
<p class="para">81.&nbsp;&nbsp;I respectfully agree with Samuel JA’s analysis.  It should also be applied in this case, even though the particular disposal chosen by Rafferty J happened to take the form of a hospital order rather than a sentence of imprisonment.  That is consistent with the view of the Law </p>
<p class="para">Commission in the passage quoted at para 66 above.</p>
<p class="para">82.&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the civil court should cleave to the same policy as the criminal court.  For that reason, the events which the claimant triggered on 19 August 2001 should not be regarded as irrelevant to the due assessment of the loss of earnings for which the defendants are liable.  Rather, the House should uphold the defendants’ contention that, as a matter of policy, they should not be held liable for any such loss after 20 August 2001 when the claimant gave himself up to the police. I respectfully agree with what my noble and learned friend, Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood says on this point.</p>
<p class="para">83.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the appropriate approach on the facts of this case. The position might well be different if, for instance, the index offence of which a claimant was convicted were trivial, but his involvement in that offence revealed that he was suffering from a mental disorder, attributable to the defendants’ fault, which made it appropriate for the court to make a hospital order under section 37 of the 1983 Act.  Then it might be argued that the defendants should be liable for any loss of earnings during the claimant’s detention under the section 37 order, just as they should be liable for any loss of earnings during his detention under a section 3 order necessitated by a condition brought about by their negligence. That point does not arise on the facts of this case, however, and it was not fully explored at the hearing. Like my noble and learned friend, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, I therefore reserve my opinion on it.</p>
<p class="para">84.&nbsp;&nbsp;The claimant has a number of other claims for damages, which were not explored in detail at the hearing.  In particular, he has what is described as a claim for an “indemnity” against any future liability in damages to Mr Boultwood’s dependants - a claim for economic loss.  He also has a claim for his feelings of guilt and remorse.  As my noble and learned friend, Lord Hoffmann, says, these claims are not a consequence of the sentence of the criminal court and so cannot be disposed of on the ground of inconsistency.  Nevertheless, I agree with him that they should be rejected.</p>
<p class="para">85.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>British Columbia v Zastowny </i>[2008] 1 SCR 27, 41-42, para 30, quoted at para 68 above, Rothstein J observed that a person is not entitled to be indemnified for the consequences of his criminal acts for which he has been found criminally responsible. He cannot attribute them to others or seek rebate of those consequences. Yet that is precisely what the claimant is trying to do, both in his claim for any sum he is found liable to pay in damages to Mr Boultwood’s dependants and in his claim for his feelings of guilt and remorse.</p>
<p class="para">86.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Meah v McCreamer (No 2) </i>[1986] 1 All ER 943 Woolf J rejected an attempt to recover the damages which the plaintiff had been found liable to pay to two women whom he had subjected to criminal attacks. His main reason for rejecting the claim was that the damages were too remote. But he would also have rejected it, at pp 950h-951f, on the public policy ground that the plaintiff was not entitled to be indemnified for the damages which he was liable to pay as a result of his criminal attacks. That seems to me to be an appropriate application of the ex turpi causa rule.</p>
<p class="para">87.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same way, in this case the claimant should not be entitled to an indemnity for any damages he had to pay in consequence of his having assaulted and killed Mr Boultwood.  The same goes for his claim for feelings of guilt and remorse. Alternatively, the claims can be treated as simply raising issues of causation and disposed of as Lord Hoffmann explains.</p>
<p class="para">88.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, and in agreement with Lord Hoffmann, I would allow the appeal and restore the order of Flaux J.</p>
<p class="lawlord">LORD BROWN OF EATON-UNDER-HEYWOOD</p>
<p class="mylords">My Lords,</p>
<p class="para">89.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have the greatest sympathy for this respondent.  Truly his life has been a tragedy. For forty years a decent and law-abiding citizen, now, consequent on severe psychological trauma sustained in the Ladbroke Grove rail crash, subject to hospital and restraint orders following conviction for manslaughter. But for his injuries it is inconceivable that the respondent would ever have killed anyone.</p>
<p class="para">90.&nbsp;&nbsp;The detailed facts of the case have been recounted by others of your Lordships. I shall not repeat them but shall instead seek to illustrate the problem they raise by reference to a much simplified set of facts broadly based upon them.</p>
<p class="para">91.&nbsp;&nbsp;Assume A, a man of forty, is psychologically injured by B’s negligence so as to suffer a continuing partial loss of earnings: from the date of the accident he earns £15,000 per annum instead of the £20,000 per annum he had previously been earning. Assume that had his claim been heard two years later he would have been awarded £10,000 special damages (for 2 years partial loss of earnings) and, say, £50,000 for future loss of earnings (10 years at £5,000 p.a.). Assume that two years after the accident, his claim not yet having been heard, he deliberately kills C for no good reason, a killing which, but for his injuries, he would never have committed.  This is reflected by his being convicted not for murder but for diminished responsibility manslaughter for which he is sentenced to detention in hospital with a restriction order. Assume that when thereafter his claim comes to be heard he remains detained. From the date of the killing he has ceased to earn anything and is not expected to earn again.</p>
<p class="para">92.&nbsp;&nbsp;On these assumed facts A clearly remains entitled to an award of £10,000 special damages. But what of his future loss of earnings? Following the killing he is in fact worse off to the full extent of the £20,000 p.a. he would have been earning but for the accident (£200,000 on a 10 year multiplier). Can he claim this?  Or if not this, can he at least continue to assert his partial loss claim at the rate of £5,000 p.a. (£50,000)?</p>
<p class="para">93.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an obvious and fundamental problem in claiming the full £20,000 per annum. To establish this, A needs to rely not only on B’s negligence resulting in his psychological injury and consequential reduced earning capacity but also on the fact of his killing C and his resultant detention transforming his partial earning loss into a total one.  For the reasons given by my noble and learned friends Lord Hoffmann and Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, this problem is so plainly insurmountable that it is unnecessary to spend further time upon it. A cannot obtain compensation for the consequences of his own deliberate act in killing C, an act for which the law holds A criminally responsible  notwithstanding that his responsibility is diminished because of the injuries resulting from B’s negligence. So much is plainly established on the authorities: <i>State Rail Authority of New South Wales v Wiegold</i> (1991) 25 NSWLR 500, <i>Clunis v Camden and Islington Health Authority</i> [1998] QB 978, <i>Worrall v British Railways Board</i> (unreported) 29 April 1999; [1999] CA Transcript No 684 <i>British Columbia v Zastowny</i> [2008] 1 SCR 27. Common to all is the principle that the integrity of the justice system depends upon its consistency.  The law cannot at one and the same time incarcerate someone for his criminality and compensate him civilly for the financial consequences.  I shall refer to this henceforth as the consistency principle. It is the underlying rationale for the application of the <i>ex turpi causa non oritur actio </i>doctrine in the present context.</p>
<p class="para">94.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the face of it, however, a continuing partial loss claim looks less objectionable.  Here it is not A who is seeking to rely on the killing and its consequences to enlarge his pre-existing claim but rather B who seeks to invoke the killing to terminate A’s pre-existing claim. Why should B, whose negligence it was, after all, which diminished A’s responsibility for the killing and who therefore might himself be thought partially responsible for the killing, actually be <i>better</i> off as a result of it? If, as Lord Hoffmann envisages at paragraph 46 of his opinion, C’s dependants would have a claim against B (assuming always that the usual requirements of causal connection and foreseeability are satisfied), so that to that extent at least the law makes B responsible for C’s death, why should the killing actually advantage B vis-a-vis A?  Could B, for example, claim indemnity against A in respect of any liability B may be under to C’s dependants?  Surely not.</p>
<p class="para">95.&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not follow, however, that the continuing partial loss claim remains sustainable and, indeed, two reasons are suggested why it too must fail.  One is the basic principle that subsequent events affecting a loss of earnings claim have to be taken into account when assessing what loss is recoverable—see, for example, <i>Jobling v Associated Dairies Ltd</i> [1982] AC 794 where, before trial, the claimant was found to be suffering from myelopathy which in any event was to disable him totally.  This I shall refer to as “the vicissitudes principle” (as it was called in <i>Jobling</i>) and, where the supervening event has already occurred, it applies in conjunction with a second principle, that the court will not speculate when it knows. The other reason is that the partial loss claim, no less than the total loss claim, falls foul of the consistency principle. Lord Hoffmann (at para 49 of his opinion) emphasises the first of those reasons, Lord Rodger (at paras 76-81) the second.</p>
<p class="para">96.&nbsp;&nbsp;For my part I question whether the first reason is in itself  sufficient to dispose of the partial loss claim. <i>Baker v Willoughby</i> [1970] AC 467, where the claimant was injured by two successive tortfeasers (as succinctly described by Lord Rodger at paragraph 76 of his opinion), demonstrates if nothing else that on occasion justice will require some modification of the vicissitudes principle.  How precisely, in the case of successive torts, this modification is to be rationalised and applied—the subject of extensive discussion in the speeches in <i>Jobling</i> and some subsequent consideration by Laws LJ in the Court of Appeal in <i>Rahman v Arearose Ltd</i> [2001] QB 351 is not presently in point.  Just as <i>Baker v Willoughby</i> was held to have no application in <i>Jobling</i> where “the victim is overtaken before trial by a wholly unconnected and disabling illness” (Lord Edmund-Davies at p809E), so too here, where the respondent (“the victim” of the appellant’s tort) has been “overtaken before trial” by a continuing detention order disabling him from working, <i>Baker v Willoughby </i>cannot apply. Obviously neither <i>Jobling</i> nor the present case involved successive torts. But whereas the disabling subsequent event in <i>Jobling</i> (myelopathy) was “wholly unconnected", that can hardly be said of the manslaughter and the respondent’s consequential detention here. But for the appellants’ negligence there would have been no manslaughter and no detention. That here is a given.</p>
<p class="para">97.&nbsp;&nbsp;All these cases raise in one form or another the question: on what disabling supervening events is the initial tortfeasor entitled to rely to reduce or extinguish the consequences of his tort?  Put another way: from what further misfortunes of the claimant should the tortfeaser be held entitled to benefit?</p>
<p class="para">98.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is perhaps instructive in this context to consider the recent decision of the House in <i>Corr v IBC Vehicles Ltd</i> [2008] AC 884.  Shift the facts and suppose that Mr Corr had in fact failed rather than succeeded in his suicide attempt but had further injured himself so as to turn a partial loss of earnings into a total one. It inevitably follows from the House’s decision that, so far from such a supervening event bringing the claimant’s partial earning loss to an end, he would have been found entitled to recover the whole. Why? Why would the continuing loss claim not fall foul of the vicissitudes principle? Essentially, as it seems to me, for two reasons: first, because the original tort remained causative of the suicide attempt (certainly the latter was not “wholly unconnected with the original injuries”), and, secondly, because there was no public policy reason for regarding the suicide attempt as a supervening vicissitude such as to extinguish the tortfeasor’s liability for the continuing loss.  The first of those reasons is common to this case too (which is why it seems to me that the vicissitudes principle is not sufficient in itself to defeat A’s continuing loss claim).  But what of the second reason, recognising of course that manslaughter, unlike suicide, <i>is</i> a criminal offence? </p>
<p class="para">99.&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn, therefore, to the consistency principle, the principle which so plainly defeats the total loss claim.  Does it logically operate to defeat the partial loss claim too? The only one of the many authorities put before your Lordships which appears to bear at all directly upon this question is <i>State Rail Authority of New South Wales v Wiegold </i>(the facts of which are sufficiently set out by Lord Rodger at paragraph 67 of his opinion). Of particular relevance is the passage in Samuels JA’s judgment already set out by Lord Rodger but which for convenience I now repeat:</p>
<p class="qt">“It is true that in the present case the learned trial judge did not, as in <i>Meah v McCreamer</i> [1985] 1 All ER 367, find that the respondent was entitled to compensation for loss of liberty resulting from imprisonment, or for lost wages during incarceration, or for any loss in post release earning capacity resulting from his conviction and imprisonment.  Rather, what he did was to refuse to treat the conviction and imprisonment of the appellant as a vicissitude of life, for want of a better term, which had crystallised before the date of the hearing, and which reduced the notional economic loss which could be attributed to the appellant’s negligence: cf <i>Faulkner v Keffalinos</i> (1970) 45 ALJR 80, at 85, 88.  But in point of principle, I cannot see that there is a relevant distinction between the two sorts of case. If one cannot get ‘direct’ compensation for the non-economic or economic loss resulting from imprisonment, one should not be able to receive ‘indirect’ compensation for lost earning capacity after imprisonment by treating the fact of imprisonment as irrelevant to the assessment of economic loss.”  (p.515)</p>
<p class="para">100.&nbsp;&nbsp;The authority there referred to, <i>Faulkner v Keffalinos</i>, like <i>Baker v Willoughby</i>, concerned injuries sustained in successive torts (there two car accidents), but it reached a rather different conclusion. Windeyer J, giving the leading judgment in the High Court of Australia, said this (at p85):</p>
<p class="qt">“The impairment of a faculty, such as a capacity to earn money, is not like damage to property. The capacity has no value unless it be exercisable.  It is only while, and for so long as, it can be exercised that an impairment of it can produce a pecuniary loss. It is for this reason that in assessing damages for the destruction or reduction of earning capacity an allowance must ordinarily be made for the contingency—if in the particular case it is seen as a reasonable possibility—of interruptions of a man’s working life by periods of unemployment, sickness or accident.  If in fact any of such things occurs before the assessment has to be made, what would have been allowed for as a possibility has become an actuality: the risk of an interruption of earnings has materialised and a hypothetical deduction to be made in the computation of damages has crystallised.  It is therefore a mistake to think of damages recoverable for the consequences of the first accident as diminished by the second accident.  So far as the damages result from the impairment of earning capacity, the second accident merely supplies a measure of one thing that must be taken into account, namely the risk of an accident.”</p>
<p class="para">101.&nbsp;&nbsp;In referring to that case, therefore, Samuels JA was saying that the vicissitude principle applied no less where the supervening event  was disability consequent upon imprisonment for a criminal offence (there the cultivation of marijuana) than where it was some other disabling event. And he was saying that, by the same token as the conviction there (notwithstanding that, as here, the claimant would never have committed the offence but for his injuries sustained through the defendant’s negligence) precluded any claim based on the losses directly sustained through his imprisonment, so too the fact of imprisonment had to be regarded as a vicissitude rather than ignored when assessing “indirect” loss also. True, the indirect loss there being claimed was not a continuing partial loss of earnings whilst in prison but rather the losses the claimant would suffer both in wages and superannuation benefits following release from prison. But in principle the case is indistinguishable from the present.  And, in common with all of your Lordships, I am persuaded that Samuels JA was right.  In the last analysis there is no logical basis on which (in my illustration) A could be regarded as responsible and B in no way legally liable for the full consequences of his detention (A’s inability to earn the full £20,000 p.a. he would have earned but for his accident) and yet be entitled in respect of the continuing loss claim to disregard his responsibility for his supervening detention and thus ignore it as a vicissitude terminating his claim.</p>
<p class="para">102.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst recognising that in the result the tortfeasor benefits from criminality which in one sense he himself has contributed to bringing about, the opposite conclusion would result in the claimant being able to ignore a vicissitude for which he for his part has been held responsible (if only to a diminished extent). And this surely would be a strange conclusion when one bears in mind that vicissitudes for which a claimant may be wholly blameless (as in <i>Jobling</i> itself) can and do take effect to terminate what earlier had appeared recoverable long-term continuing losses.</p>
<p class="para">103.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that any of these observations are at odds with anything said by others of your Lordships. On the contrary, I am in  substantial agreement with all that others have said—including not least the reservations expressed by my noble and learned friend Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers at paragraph 15 of his opinion. Sympathetic though I am to the respondent, the disputed elements of his claim do indeed fall foul of the <i>ex turpi causa</i> principle.</p>
<p class="para">104.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons I too would allow this appeal and restore the order of the judge below. </p>
