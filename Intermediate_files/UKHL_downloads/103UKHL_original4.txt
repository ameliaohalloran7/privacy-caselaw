<p class="para">83.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in the present case, as in any other, it is for the independent investigator to decide, once he has become familiar with the issues, whether there needs to be a public hearing and, if so, what shape it should take. In reaching that decision, he will have in mind both what his initial enquiries have revealed and the factors which the Grand Chamber said in <i>Ramsahai </i>should determine the degree of public scrutiny that is required.</p>
<p class="para">84.&nbsp;&nbsp;With these observations and for substantially the same reasons as all of your Lordships, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p class="lawlord">LORD WALKER OF GESTINGTHORPE</p>
<p class="mylords">My Lords,</p>
<p class="para">85.&nbsp;&nbsp;In agreement with all your Lordships, I would dismiss this appeal. The formal disposal of the appeal is of limited practical importance, since the Prison Service has already agreed to commission a further independent inquiry into Mr L’s attempted suicide, the inquiry to be conducted as what has been called a D inquiry (see <i>R(D) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</i> [2006] 3 All ER 946) and the costs will in any event fall on public funds. I am also in general agreement with your Lordships’ reasons. But because of the importance of this appeal I add some observations of my own.</p>
<p class="para">86.&nbsp;&nbsp;Between 1996 and 2007 the mean annual average of suicides in prison was about 82. The worst period was from 2002 to 2004, with an average of 95 suicides (including a disproportionately high average of 12 women). There was an improvement during 2005 and 2006 but in 2007 there were 92 suicides (84 men and 8 women). In <i>R(Middleton) v West Somerset Coroner</i> [2004] 2 AC 182, para 5, Lord Bingham of Cornhill (reviewing the position down to 2003) referred to these figures as “grim", but added the observation quoted in the first paragraph of the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood. Every suicide is a tragedy, in or out of prison, and nonetheless so because it is practically inevitable that there will be prison suicides. For too long our prisons have been seriously overcrowded, and the sheer volume of numbers of prisoners often makes it difficult for prison officers to perform the duties of care which they owe to those who are in the custody of the state.</p>
<p class="para">87.&nbsp;&nbsp;As Lord Bingham observed in <i>Middleton</i> (para 5), </p>
<p class="qt">“These statistics, grim though they are, do not of themselves point towards any dereliction of duty on the part of the authorities (which have given much attention to the problem) or any individual official. But they do highlight the need for an investigative regime which will not only expose any past violation of the state’s substantive obligations [under article 2 of the Convention] but also, within the bounds of what is practicable, promote measures to prevent or minimise the risk of future violations.”</p>
<p class="para">Lord Bingham did not therefore restrict the purpose of an independent investigation to establishing a past violation of the state’s substantive obligations. He included the wider purpose of learning from experience, whether or not there have been identifiable failures, systemic or operational, for which the management of the Prison Service as a whole, or particular individuals within the Prison Service, must take responsibility.</p>
<p class="para">88.&nbsp;&nbsp;The distinction between systemic and operational failures is central to the <i>Osman</i> principle (<i>Osman v United Kingdom </i> (1998)  29 EHRR 245) as it has developed in relation to the state’s duty to protect those in its custody against self-harm (or harm from others in custody).  Sometimes the systemic duty is expressed at a high level of generality, as Lord Bingham of Cornhill put it in <i>Van Colle v Chief Constable of the  Hertfordshire Police</i> [2008] 3 WLR 593, para 28: </p>
<p class="qt">“The state’s . . . primary duty to secure the right to life by putting in place effective criminal law provisions to deter the commission of offences against the person backed up by law enforcement machinery for the prevention, suppression and sanctioning of breaches of such provisions.”</p>
<p class="para">But at a lower level there is often no clear dividing line between systemic and operational failures, and the distinction is one of degree only. Moreover an excessively elaborate and prescriptive system may carry the seeds of its own failure, in that it may be predictable that overworked and under-motivated staff in the lower levels of the system will be unable or unwilling to comply fully with it. In the Prison Service, as in branches of the social services dealing with vulnerable old people and children, there is almost inevitably a gulf between policy-makers’ vision of informed, collective, multi-disciplinary decision-taking and the incidents of missing files, missed appointments, misunderstandings and muddling through which regrettably occur among those on the ground.</p>
<p class="para">89.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Lordships have been able to read some 400 pages of official documents in exhibits SC1 and SC2 to the affidavit of Saimo Chahal, a partner in the firm of solicitors acting for JL. Some of these (notably the report of Mr Sheikh, some incident reports and some medical reports) post-date Mr L’s attempted suicide. But the bulk of the documentation came into existence before the suicide attempt. It includes the official Local Suicide Prevention Policy for Feltham YOI published in January 2002, the official explanation of the F2052 SH system, and the official records of Mr L’s medical care and daily supervision and support, together with “multi-disciplinary continuation sheets” and logs of the periods for which Mr L was under specially close observation.  Study of these documents leaves me with the clear impression that the Prison Service managers have worked very hard to put in place a system for identifying, monitoring and counselling prisoners at risk of suicide or self-harm. It may have tended towards a level of elaboration which might leave experienced and conscientious prison officers with restricted opportunities for relying on their own intuitive knowledge of human nature. But your Lordships did not hear any argument on this point, and it would be wrong to express any definite opinion about it. It is sufficient to say that if there were any serious errors in the treatment of Mr L—an issue which still remains to be considered at the forthcoming independent investigation—it seems likely that they will be found (if one must choose an alternative) to have been operational rather than systemic.</p>
<p class="para">90.&nbsp;&nbsp;In bringing this appeal (while conceding that there is to be a full independent inquiry) the Secretary of State is for practical purposes seeking guidance from your Lordships as to future policy and procedures. The Secretary of State is particularly concerned, understandably, about resource implications. I can sympathise with this concern but there are obvious limits to how far it is for your Lordships, or any court, to give anything like detailed guidance on these matters.  Even if a majority of your Lordships were to concur in my views, they would be no more than expressions of opinion. But with that caveat I will express some tentative views.</p>
<p class="para">91.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it there are three interwoven strands to the problem:  identifying which incidents of non-fatal self-harm by prisoners may call for independent investigation; working out the best procedure for decision-making about setting up an independent investigation; and determining the form of any independent investigation which is necessary.</p>
<p class="para">92.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first of these points, Prison Service Order 2700 (issued in October 2007) deals at length with different aspects of suicide prevention and self-harm management. Chapter 13 (actions following an incident of self-harm) contains the following paragraph (13.4.1):</p>
<p class="qt">“It is strongly recommended that following incidents of serious self-harm an investigation is carried out into the circumstances of the incident (‘serious incidents’ are defined as those which mean the prisoner involved required resuscitation and/or transfer to an outside hospital as a result of their harming themselves). As each individual incident will differ in level of severity, Governors/Directors will need to judge when such investigations are appropriate.  Cases where the injury was life threatening, the person required hospitalisation and it is likely that they will be <i>(sic)</i> sustain permanent injuries as a result of the self-harm incident, are examples of where Governors/Directors are likely to consider an investigation into the incident to be imperative.  Wherever possible the family ought to be included in such investigations.  Care needs to be taken to retain required documentation.”</p>
<p class="para">93.&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for resuscitation and/or transfer to an outside hospital is no doubt a sensible starting point but it cannot (as the paragraph itself recognises) be exhaustive. Even in cases where there is no serious permanent injury, investigation may be needed if the self-harmer was a known suicide risk, or if the means of self-harm (whether a ligature, a sharp instrument or some harmful substance) suggested a failure in the system of searches (ineffective searches are mentioned in a recent IPCC publication, “Near Misses in Police Custody", as the most common causative factor in near-miss incidents). No doubt there are other special cases calling for the exercise of judgment by Governors and Directors.</p>
<p class="para">94.&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the procedure to be adopted, it seems unavoidable, because of time constraints, that the first steps of any investigation should be internal to the Prison Service (and therefore lacking in independence).  Senior staff at the prison may need to take immediate action to impound files and records, and make written records (however brief) of what they are told by prison officers or prisoners who were on the spot at the time.  But an independent element should be added to the preliminary investigation as soon as possible. This point was emphasised on behalf of the intervener, the Equality and Human Rights Commission, by Mr John Wadham, its Group Legal Director, in his witness statement:</p>
<p class="qt">“Whenever a death or near death occurs it is very important that a decision as to what kind of investigation is necessary is made quickly, before any evidence is disturbed or lost and before those who witnessed the events forget the details or have their accounts contaminated by the accounts of others.  Obviously the more likely it is that there may be some culpability or some systemic failure associated with those that can give evidence the more important that it is that those investigating are independent of the people that they are investigating.”</p>
<p class="para">The point was also made by counsel for the intervener in their supplementary written submissions, citing the decision of the Grand Chamber in <i>Ramsahai v The Netherlands</i> 15 May 2007. That was a case on very different facts: a man suspected of stealing a motor-scooter at gunpoint was shot by the police in Amsterdam, and there was a delay of some 15 hours before the State Criminal Investigation Department became involved in the investigation. In principle, however, it is clearly right that any preliminary investigation should acquire the character of an independent investigation at the earliest possible time.</p>
<p class="para">95.&nbsp;&nbsp;In practice this means that the Prison Service should hand over the investigation (with all relevant documentary material, including official records and any preliminary written statements) to an independent investigator, or a team of independent investigators. Mr Wadham suggests that the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman would be an appropriate investigator. Your Lordships were not told much about the resources available to the Ombudsman.  But he already carries out a similar function in relation to fatal incidents, and it seems to me that it would be appropriate, if the Ombudsman has or can be furnished with adequate human and other resources, for his oversight to be extended to non-fatal but serious incidents that may call for an article 2 investigation. The Ombudsman would form an independent view as to what further investigations were required; whether any such investigations ought to meet the requirements of article 2; and if so, whether there should be a full D-type inquiry. It seems likely that in the majority of cases some further investigation would be necessary, but that relatively few non-fatal incidents would call for a lengthy and expensive procedure involving taking oral evidence in public.</p>
<p class="para">96.&nbsp;&nbsp;In agreement (as I understand it) with all your Lordships I agree that not every investigation is required, in order to comply with article 2, to amount to what has been referred to as a D-type inquiry. The essential requirements of article 2 are set out in para 107 of Lord Brown’s opinion. I respectfully agree with all that he says in that and the following paragraph, and with what my noble and learned friend Lord Rodger of Earlsferry says in paras 73 to 80 of his opinion. Since it is for the State itself to initiate an article 2 investigation, the Ombudsman would (under the procedure suggested above) have to make a recommendation to the Prison Service; but he would do so in the confident expectation that his recommendation would be accepted.  The precise procedure to be followed at a formal public inquiry, in the (perhaps comparatively rare) cases where it was called for, would be for the individual or tribunal conducting the inquiry. </p>

<p class="lawlord">LORD BROWN OF EATON-UNDER-HEYWOOD</p>
<p class="mylords">My Lords,</p>
<p class="para">97.&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of suicides in custody is all too well-known.  Although fewer such deaths occurred in 2005 and 2006 than in the previous three years, in 2007 numbers were tragically back to where they had been, almost two a week. The number of near-suicides in custody (genuine suicide attempts resulting in lasting serious injury) is greater still.  As Lord Bingham of Cornhill pointed out in <i>R (Middleton) v West Somerset Coroner</i> [2004]  2 AC 182, 192, para 5: </p>
<p class="qt">“Many of those in prison are vulnerable, inadequate or mentally disturbed; many have drug problems; and imprisonment is inevitably, for some, a very traumatic experience.”</p>
<p class="para">98.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsurprisingly, therefore, the law imposes upon detaining authorities special duties with regard to safeguarding those (whether of sound or unsound mind) in their custody: a common law duty to take reasonable care for their safety (<i>Reeves v Commissioner of Police of  the Metropolis</i> [2000] 1 AC 360 where, at p 369, Lord Hoffmann describes the duty as “a very unusual one, arising from the complete control which the police or prison authorities have over the prisoner, combined with the special danger of people in prison taking their own lives”), and a duty under article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights “to protect them [and] to account for any injuries suffered in custody, which obligation is particularly stringent when the individual dies” (<i>Keenan v United Kingdom</i> (2001) 33 EHRR 913, para 90 where the Court emphasised, as it had in earlier cases, “that persons in custody are in a vulnerable position”).</p>
<p class="para">99.&nbsp;&nbsp;This appeal concerns the near-suicide of a 20 year old in youth custody awaiting trial. Initially he was assessed as a suicide risk but after 18 days his self-harm at risk form was closed. Eleven days later he was found hanging from his cell bars and, although resuscitated, sadly is left with serious brain damage.</p>
<p class="para">100.&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout these proceedings it has been common ground that the respondent’s attempted suicide falls within the ambit of article 2.  The appellant Secretary of State, however, contests the need in such cases for any article 2 investigation except where the State is in “arguable breach” of its substantive article 2 duty to protect life and this, he submits, will only be so when arguably the prison authorities knew or ought to have known of a real and immediate risk of the prisoner committing suicide and failed then to take reasonable preventive measures.</p>
<p class="para">101.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reasons given by my noble and learned friend Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers whose opinion I have had the advantage of reading in draft, I too would reject that argument and dismiss the appeal: as already explained the State bears a particular responsibility towards those detained and it is bound to carry out an article 2 investigation whenever its system for preventing suicide fails. In every such case it is for the State to account for the failure. Whether or not the investigation ultimately is likely to reveal a substantive breach of article 2—operationally (as in the <i>Osman</i> type case) or systemically (as to the procedures for detecting where such a real and immediate risk arises)—is really not material at the outset.</p>
<p class="para">102.&nbsp;&nbsp;It by no means follows, however, that the article 2 investigation required in every case of near-suicide must match in all respects that achieved in this country in the case of all actual prison suicides: an initial investigation by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman (“ensuring as far as possible that the full facts are brought to light and any relevant failing is exposed, any commendable action or practice is identified, and any lessons learned from the death", as the PPO’s published terms of reference put it) followed by a <i>Middleton</i> type inquest.  </p>
<p class="para">103.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is really only on this aspect of the case that I wish to add a few paragraphs to what Lord Phillips has already said.  I am concerned in particular with what my Lord at para 10 describes as a “D type investigation” (after <i>R (D) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</i> [2006] 3 All ER 946), which apparently is what the Secretary of State is now embarking upon in the present case. By a D type investigation I understand to be meant an independent public inquiry whereby whoever conducts the inquiry “would make the evidence and any written submissions public and take oral evidence in public, subject to the proviso . . . that there might be Convention-compatible reasons for not holding the whole investigation in public” (para 24 of <i>D</i>). That certainly was the nature of the investigation ordered by the Court of Appeal in <i>D</i> and subsequently carried out by the PPO (Mr Shaw) over some 20 months at the cost of about half a million pounds, leading to a comprehensive report in May 2008.</p>
<p class="para">104.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion a public inquiry of that sort (or, indeed, of any such sort) goes far beyond what can reasonably be judged necessary to satisfy the article 2 procedural duty arising in any save the most exceptional near-suicide case and for my part I regard <i>D</i> itself to have been wrongly decided. As I read the judgment it appears to have been founded principally upon two decisions in particular: that of the European Court of Human Rights in <i>Edwards v United Kingdom</i> (2002)  35 EHRR 487 and that of the House of Lords in <i>R (Amin) v Secretary for the Home Department</i> [2004] 1 AC 653. But those cases were to my mind critically different from suicide cases and still more so from near-suicide cases. Each of them involved the killing of a prisoner by his own cellmate. Mr Edwards was killed by a man suffering acute mental illness with a record of violence who plainly should have been recognised as a serious risk to others.  Mr Mubarek (Mr Amin’s nephew) was killed by a man known to be both very dangerous and a racist.  Because there were criminal prosecutions, in neither case was there an inquest.  And in each case a private rather than a public inquiry was held, with very little family involvement. Small wonder that in these circumstances the respective courts required open public inquiries to be held. The Strasbourg Court in <i>Edwards</i> (at para 83) said this:</p>
<p class="qt">“In the present case, where the deceased was a vulnerable individual who lost his life in a horrendous manner due to a series of failures by public bodies and servants who bore a responsibility to safeguard his welfare, the Court considers that the public interest attaching to the issues thrown up by the case was such as to call for the widest exposure possible.”</p>
<p class="para">And at para 31 of his speech in <i>Amin</i>, Lord Bingham, having noted (at para 21) the case’s “strong similarities” to <i>Edwards</i>, set out the purposes which would ordinarily be served by an inquest (whereby deaths are usually “publicly investigated before an independent judicial tribunal with an opportunity for relatives of the deceased to participate”), namely: </p>
<p class="qt">“to ensure so far as possible that the full facts are brought to light; that culpable and discreditable conduct is exposed and brought to public notice; that suspicion of deliberate wrongdoing (if unjustified) is allayed; that dangerous practices and procedures are rectified; and that those who have lost their relative may at least have the satisfaction of knowing that lessons learned from his death may save the lives of others.” </p>
<p class="para">True it is that Lord Bingham was not there expressly confining his remarks to cellmate killings as opposed to deaths in custody generally.  Plainly, however, cellmate killings (and the Strasbourg Court’s judgment in <i>Edwards</i>) provided the immediate context for those remarks and I find it quite impossible to regard them as authority for the wider proposition that a D type investigation which “take[s] oral evidence in public” is ordinarily required in near-suicide cases. I recognise, of course, that, like cases of cellmate killings (although, of course, for a different reason) near-suicides are not the subject of inquests. But there can be no doubt that inquests themselves often go beyond the strict requirements of article 2 investigation.</p>
<p class="para">105.&nbsp;&nbsp;There seem to me two very important distinctions between cases of cellmate killings and those of near-suicide. One is the difference between death and serious injury. Calamitous though near-suicide cases may be, death adds a further dimension of gravity—a point made by Lord Phillips at para 20 and recognised by the European Court of Human Rights in the passage cited above (para 98) from <i>Keenan</i>.  Secondly, however deeply troubled one may be about cases of suicide and near-suicide in custody, they do not to my mind prompt quite the same feelings of horror and outrage as do cases where a prisoner is killed by the very person he is locked up with. Detaining authorities plainly owe a high duty to safeguard those in custody so far as possible from themselves. But the duty to protect them from others with whom they are confined must surely be higher still.</p>
<p class="para">106.&nbsp;&nbsp;I accept unhesitatingly Mr Emmerson QC’s submission that the costs of Mr Shaw’s inquiry into <i>D</i>‘<i>s</i> attempted suicide were exceptional (indeed Mr Shaw’s report itself says as much) and that any such inquiry in future might more reasonably be expected to cost nearer £65,000 (the Secretary of State’s own working estimate for such an inquiry where evidence is heard in public). That itself, however, is substantially more than the estimated cost of £15,000 odd for the Ombudsman’s routine (pre-inquest) investigation in all actual cases of suicide in custody. Of course the nature and extent of the state’s article 2 obligation in cases of near-suicide cannot be measured in monetary terms. But it is idle to pretend that money is no object and certainly, the larger the category of near-suicide cases the Secretary of State (or, if he is challenged as to this, the court) recognises to attract the article 2 obligation, the more imperative it must be to keep the discharge of the obligation within manageable financial limits.</p>
<p class="para">107.&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to near-suicide cases resulting, as here, in lasting serious injury (I say nothing as to the substantially larger number of self-harm incidents recorded in the statistics), I have no doubt that Mr Shaw was right in his <i>D</i> report to recommend (as noted by Lord Phillips at para 47) investigations which “include an independent element, and engage the person who has been harmed and/or their family". If the Ombudsman himself, or perhaps a senior deputy, could carry them out, so much the better. Elementarily, to satisfy the basic requirements of any article 2 investigation, besides being independent and involving the family, they must in addition be initiated by the state, be promptly and reasonably expeditiously carried out, and provide for a sufficient element of public scrutiny.  Beyond this, however, it is impossible to be prescriptive.  </p>
<p class="para">108.&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally speaking I can see no need for inquiries into near-suicides to take place in public although obviously the independent investigator’s report would itself be made public. If, of course, any particular problems come to light during the investigation—if, say, witnesses prove uncooperative, or egregious failures become manifest (again one cannot be prescriptive about the circumstances which might occasion a change of course), the person conducting the investigation might feel it necessary to expand it into something akin to a D<i>-</i>type inquiry. For my part, however, I would expect that to be a comparatively rare event and, concerned though inevitably your Lordships must be about a number of apparently troubling features of the respondent’s attempted suicide, I question whether this is itself such a case.</p>
<p class="para">109.&nbsp;&nbsp;That, however, is really by the way. It is not suggested that your Lordships’ opinions will affect the outcome of the present case. Rather it is hoped that they will illuminate the nature of the article 2 obligation arising in future such cases. It is not altogether easy to throw light on questions necessarily raised in somewhat general terms. The above represents the furthest I have felt able to go. I add only that I agree also with everything said by my noble and learned friend Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe. </p>
