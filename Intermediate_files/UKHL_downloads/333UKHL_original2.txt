<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the evidence it can readily be accepted that article 8 is engaged.  Hedley J observed (para 18) "that these will be dreadfully painful times for the child".  Everybody will sympathise with that observation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is necessary to measure the nature of the impact of the trial on the child.  He will not be involved in the trial as a witness or otherwise.  It will not be necessary to refer to him.  No photograph of him will be published.  There will be no reference to his private life or upbringing.  Unavoidably, his mother must be tried for murder and that must be a deeply hurtful experience for the child.  The impact upon him is, however, essentially indirect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26.&nbsp;&nbsp;While article 8.1 is engaged, and none of the factors in article 8.2 justifies the interference, it is necessary to assess realistically the nature of the relief sought.  This is an application for an injunction beyond the scope of section 39, the remedy provided by Parliament to protect juveniles directly affected by criminal proceedings.  No such injunction has in the past been granted under the inherent jurisdiction or under the provisions of the ECHR.  There is no decision of the Strasbourg court granting injunctive relief to non-parties, juvenile or adult, in respect of publication of criminal proceedings.  Moreover, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which entered into force on 2 September 1990, protects the privacy of children directly involved in criminal proceedings, but does not protect the privacy of children if they are only indirectly affected by criminal trials: articles 17 and 40.2(vii); see also Geraldine Van Bueren, <i>The International Law on the Rights of the Child,</i> 1994, 141 and 182.  The verdict of experience appears to be that such a development is a step too far.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;27.&nbsp;&nbsp;The interference with article 8 rights, however distressing for the child, is not of the same order when compared with cases of juveniles, who are directly involved in criminal trials.  In saying this I have not overlooked the fact that the mother, the defendant in the criminal trial, has waived her right to a completely public trial, and supports the appeal of the child.  In a case such as the present her stance can only be of limited weight.</p>
<i>X.  Article 10.
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28.&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 10 is also engaged.  This case is concerned with the freedom of the press, subject to limited statutory restrictions, to report the proceedings at a criminal trial without restriction.  It is necessary to assess the importance of this freedom.  I start with a general proposition.  In <i>Reynolds v Times Newspapers Limited</i> [2001]  2 AC 127 Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead described the position as follows (200G-H):</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is through the mass media that most people today obtain their information on political matters.  Without freedom of expression by the media, freedom of expression would be a hollow concept.  The interest of a democratic society in ensuring a free press weighs heavily in the balance in deciding whether any curtailment of this freedom bears a reasonable relationship to the purpose of the curtailment."<p></p></ul>
<p>These observations apply with equal force to the freedom of the press to report criminal trials in progress and after verdict.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;29.&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of the freedom of the press to report criminal trials has often been emphasised in concrete terms.  In <i>R v Legal Aid Board ex parte Kaim Todner (A firm)</i> [1999]  QB 966, Lord Woolf MR explained (at 977):</p>
<p></p><ul>"The need to be vigilant arises from the natural tendency for the general principle to be eroded and for exceptions to grow by accretion as the exceptions are applied by analogy to existing cases.  This is the reason it is so important not to forget why proceedings are required to be subjected to the full glare of a public hearing.  It is necessary because the public nature of the proceedings deters inappropriate behaviour on the part of the court.  It also maintains the public's confidence in the administration of justice.  It enables the public to know that justice is being administered impartially.  It can result in evidence becoming available which would not become available if the proceedings were conducted behind closed doors or with one or more of the parties' or witnesses' identity concealed.  It makes uninformed and inaccurate comment about the proceedings less likely . . .  Any interference with the public nature of court proceedings is therefore to be avoided unless justice requires it.  However Parliament has recognised there are situations where interference is necessary."<p></p></ul>
<p>These are valuable observations.  It is, however, still necessary to assess the importance of unrestricted reporting in specifics relating to this case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dealing with the relative importance of the freedom of the press to report the proceedings in a criminal trial Hale LJ drew a distinction.  She observed (at para 56):</p>
<p></p><ul>"The court must consider what restriction, if any, is needed to meet the legitimate aim of protecting the rights of CS.  If prohibiting publication of the family name and photographs is needed, the court must consider how great an impact that will in fact have upon the freedom protected by Article 10.  It is relevant here that restrictions on the identification of defendants before conviction are by no means unprecedented.  The situation may well change if and when the mother is convicted.  There is a much greater public interest in knowing the names of persons convicted of serious crime than of those who are merely suspected or charged.  These considerations are also relevant to the extent of the interference with CS's rights."<p></p></ul>
<p>I cannot accept these observations without substantial qualification.  A criminal trial is a public event.  The principle of open justice puts, as has often been said, the judge and all who participate in the trial under intense scrutiny.  The glare of contemporaneous publicity ensures that trials are properly conducted.  It is a valuable check on the criminal process.  Moreover, the public interest may be as much involved in the circumstances of a remarkable acquittal as in a surprising conviction.  Informed public debate is necessary about all such matters.  Full contemporaneous reporting of criminal trials in progress promotes public confidence in the administration of justice.  It promotes the values of the rule of law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;31.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons I would, therefore, attribute greater importance to the freedom of the press to report the progress of a criminal trial without any restraint than Hale LJ did.</p>
<i><p>XI.  Consequences of the grant of the proposed injunction.</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of specific consequences of the grant of an injunction as asked for in this case to be considered.  First, while counsel for the child wanted to confine a ruling to the grant of an injunction restraining publication <i>to protect a child</i>, that will not do.  The jurisdiction under the ECHR could equally be invoked by an adult non-party faced with possible damaging publicity as a result of a trial of a parent, child or spouse.  Adult non-parties to a criminal trial must therefore be added to the prospective pool of applicants who could apply for such injunctions.  This would confront newspapers with an ever wider spectrum of potentially costly proceedings and would seriously inhibit the freedom of the press to report criminal trials.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33.&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if such an injunction were to be granted in this case, it cannot be assumed that relief will only be sought in future in respect of the name of a defendant and a photograph of the defendant and the victim.  It is easy to visualise circumstances in which attempts will be made to enjoin publicity of, for example, the gruesome circumstances of a crime.  The process of piling exception upon exception to the principle of open justice would be encouraged and would gain in momentum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;34.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, it is important to bear in mind that from a newspaper's point of view a report of a sensational trial without revealing the identity of the defendant would be a very much disembodied trial.  If the newspapers choose not to contest such an injunction, they are less likely to give prominence to reports of the trial.  Certainly, readers will be less interested and editors will act accordingly.  Informed debate about criminal justice will suffer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;35.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, it is true that newspapers can always contest an application for an injunction.  Even for national newspapers that is, however, a costly matter which may involve proceedings at different judicial levels.  Moreover, time constraints of an impending trial may not always permit such proceedings.  Often it will be too late and the injunction will have had its negative effect on contemporary reporting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;36.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, it is easy to fall into the trap of considering the position from the point of view of national newspapers only.  Local newspapers play a huge role.  In the United Kingdom according to the website of The Newspaper Society there are 1301 regional and local newspapers which serve villages, towns and cities.  Apparently, again according to the website of The Newspaper Society, over 85% of all British adults read a regional or local newspaper compared to 70% who read a national newspaper.  Very often a sensational or serious criminal trial will be of great interest in the community where it took place.  A regional or local newspaper is likely to give prominence to it.  That happens every day up and down the country.  For local newspapers, who do not have the financial resources of national newspapers, the spectre of being involved in costly legal proceedings is bound to have a chilling effect.  If local newspapers are threatened with the prospect of an injunction such as is now under consideration it is likely that they will often be silenced.  Prudently, the Romford Recorder, which has some 116,000 readers a week, chose not to contest these proceedings.  The impact of such a new development on the regional and local press in the United Kingdom strongly militates against its adoption.  If permitted, it would seriously impoverish public discussion of criminal justice.</p>
<i></i><p><i>XII.  The decision of Hedley J.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;37.&nbsp;&nbsp;In agreement with Hale LJ the majority of the Court of Appeal took the view that Hedley J had not analysed the case correctly in accordance with the provisions of the ECHR.  I do not agree.  In my view the judge analysed the case correctly under the ECHR.  Given the weight traditionally given to the importance of open reporting of criminal proceedings it was in my view appropriate for him, in carrying out the balance required by the ECHR, to begin by acknowledging the force of the argument under article 10 before considering whether the right of the child under article 8 was sufficient to outweigh it.  He went too far in saying that he would have come to the same conclusion even if he had been persuaded that this was a case where the child's welfare was indeed the paramount consideration under section 1(1) of the Children Act 1989.  But that was not the shape of the case before him.</p>
<i></i><p><i>XIII.  The Disposal.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;38.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would dismiss the appeal.  The effect of the opinions delivered in the House today is that there is no injunction in respect of publication of the identity of the defendant or of photographs of the defendant or her deceased son.</p>
<p><b>LORD HOFFMANN</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;39.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the advantage of reading in draft the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Steyn.  For the reasons he gives, with which I agree, I would dismiss this appeal.</p>
