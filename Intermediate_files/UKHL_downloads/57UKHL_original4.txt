<p align="right"><a href="Comm-3.htm">(back to preceding text)</a></p>

<p class="para">76.&nbsp;&nbsp;On reflection, however, I consider that paragraph (b) is not relevant in this case.  As already observed, Parliamentary counsel was careful to distinguish between “information” and “data".  In the present case, the effect of the inclusion of para (e) in the definition of “data” in section 1(1) of the 1998 Act is that all the recorded information about an individual held by the Agency must fall within the definition of “data".  So, if one asks what data the Agency holds on an individual, it is all the information which it has relating to that individual.  If the individual to whom all the information relates is identifiable from some information in the data, then all the data count as “personal data".  Suppose, for instance, that the Agency holds various pieces of information about a living individual, identified in each case by a different code number.  The Agency also holds other items of information in the shape of the various keys to unlock the different code numbers and identify the individual to whom the pieces of information relate.  In that situation, all the items of information relating to the individual identified by the code number and the keys themselves are “data” and those data relate to an individual who can be identified from them.  So they are all “personal data” in terms of para (a) of the definition:  all the data relate to an individual who can be identified from those data.  The processing of any of those data is the processing of personal data.</p>
<p class="para">77.&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph (b) of the definition of “personal data” applies in a different situation.  It applies where the individual to whom data relate is identifiable not from the data themselves but from “other information",  ie information which does not count as “data” because it does not fall under any of paras (a) - (e) in the definition of data.  So it applies where a public authority does not yet hold information but is likely to come into possession of the information (which will then count as “data”) - and that information will make it possible to identify a living individual to whom existing data relate.  It also applies where the data controller, who is not a public authority, possesses relevant information which does not, however, fall within any of paras (a) - (d) of the definition of “data” in section 1(1) of the 1998 Act.  That could include, for instance, a single sheet of paper containing the key which identified the individual to whom data, as defined in paras (a) to (d) of the definition, related.  The data would be “personal data” if the person to whom they related could be identified from the “information” on that sheet of paper.</p>
<p class="para">78.&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows that, in the present case, the question is simply whether, in terms of para (a) of the definition, the data which ISD has been asked to disclose are “personal data” because they “relate to a living individual who can be identified - (a) from those data….”</p>
<p class="para">79.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing in the papers to indicate what actual steps would have been involved in preparing any information or data to be supplied by the Agency in response to the request by Mr Collie.  It is at least possible that, in order to produce the relevant information, ISD would have had to access medical records relating to individuals whom it could identify, whether by using a separate key or otherwise.  If so, that step would unquestionably have involved the processing of personal data, to which the data protection principles would have applied.  But would the resulting data still constitute “personal data” when they were extracted and put into the relevant tables ready for disclosure?  The data would undoubtedly relate to living individuals, but could those individuals be identified from those data?  That is a question of fact.  If the individuals could be identified, the data would be “personal data"; if they could not be identified, the data would just be - to adopt a description used by Lord Hoffmann in a completely different context - “plain vanilla” data.</p>
<p class="para">80.&nbsp;&nbsp;Assume, for instance, that a data controller, who can indeed identify the individuals to whom all the data relate, aggregates the sensitive personal data for such a large geographical area that it becomes impossible for anyone else to identify the individuals in question from the aggregate data.  The data remain “personal data” in the data controller’s hands for so long as, by using reasonable means, he can still identify the individuals to whom they relate.  He accordingly, remains subject to regulation by the 1998 Act if he processes those data - even by simply holding or retrieving them.</p>
<p class="para">81.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, suppose the data controller takes further steps, say, by removing any identifying codes and separating off the data comprising the aggregate totals for the large geographical area, so that it is then impossible for him to make any connexion between the aggregate data and the individuals concerned.  In that situation, the individuals to whom the aggregate data related could no longer be identified from the aggregate data.  So the aggregate data would not constitute “personal data", but plain vanilla data.  The processing of plain vanilla data is not regulated by the 1998 Act.  Moreover, if the plain vanilla data are held by a Scottish public authority, the exemption in section 2 of the 2002 Act does not apply.</p>
<p class="para">82.&nbsp;&nbsp;This result is consistent with the spirit of Council Directive 95/46/EC which the 1998 Act is intended to implement.  In particular, recital 26 to the directive presupposes that “the principles of protection shall not apply to data rendered anonymous in such a way that the data subject is no longer identifiable….”</p>
<p class="para">83.&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows, that, if ISD could have complied with Mr Collie’s request by supplying him with fully anonymised data from which it would have been impossible to identify the individuals to whom the figures related, then the data would not have constituted “personal data” and so the exemption under sections 1(6) and 2 of the 2002 Act would not have applied.  That might well have been the case, for example, if Mr Collie had been content with ISD’s offer to supply the aggregate figures for the whole Dumfries and Galloway Health Board Area for the entire period from 1990 to 2001.  But, by appealing to the Commissioner, he indicated that this offer was not acceptable.</p>
<p class="para">84.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commissioner readily concluded that the data in the form sought by Mr Collie would constitute “personal data” because, due to the small counts in the cells, the individuals to whom the data related could have been identified by members of the public.  The Commissioner went on to hold that disclosure of the data in that form would be unfair and unlawful and would, accordingly, contravene the first non-disclosure principle.</p>
<p class="para">85.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commissioner held, however, that the Agency should, at least, have disclosed the cells which contained zero, since those cells did not contain personal data.  Although perhaps at first sight attractive, that argument must be rejected since, inevitably, by publishing the cells with zeros, ISD would have identified those other cells which contained a count for any year.  And, given the small counts and the small areas involved, this would have created very much the same risk of individuals being identified as publishing the counts of 1 or more for the other cells.</p>
<p class="para">86.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Commissioner was satisfied that ISD had good reason not to supply the actual positive counts, he ordered the Agency to supply Mr Collie with the information which he sought in a different, barnardised, form, if (as was the case) he did not prefer to receive the aggregate figures.  The First Division held that such barnardised data would no longer have constituted “personal data” in terms of section 1(1) of the 1998 Act.  Counsel for the Commissioner supported that view.  He argued that, if the data are barnardised, so that anyone from outside the Agency sees only the data with random adjustments, they no longer relate to any particular individual and so have ceased to be “personal data” for purposes of section 1(1) of the 1998 Act.  The First Division accepted that argument.  I would reject it.</p>
<p class="para">87.&nbsp;&nbsp;The question only arises, of course, if, immediately before they are barnardised, the data are indeed personal data, because the individuals to whom they relate can be identified from them.  When the data are barnardised, statistical noise is introduced into the tables, but the tables contain no new information:  the counts in the cells still relate to the same diagnoses.  For instance, if there is one girl diagnosed with leukaemia in a particular census ward in a particular year, the barnardised data for that ward will still relate to the fact that that girl was diagnosed as suffering from leukaemia in that year:  the only difference is that, randomly, the count relating to that girl may now be 1 or 2.  Barnardising is simply one method which can be used by those publishing frequency tables to minimise the risk of revealing the identities of the individuals to whom the counts relate.  If, however, even after barnardisation, the individuals to whom the data relate can still be identified, the data remain “personal data".  Whether or not the individuals are identifiable from the barnardised data is a question of fact, the answer to which may vary from situation to situation and, indeed, from individual to individual.</p>
<p class="para">88.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, the Commissioner did not actually hold that barnardising the data would have made it impossible to identify the individuals to whom they related.  Rather, he held that it would have substantially removed the risk of them being identified.  In my view, however, the material which the Agency placed before the Commissioner did not provide an adequate basis for that conclusion.  Indeed, at first sight, it seems at least possible that, with the very small counts in the cells in the tables, the individuals in question could still be identified from those data.  Counsel for the Commissioner accepted that, if the supposed factual basis for his decision were flawed in this way, it would be appropriate for the decision to be quashed and for him to reconsider it.</p>
<p class="hditl">Disposal</p>
<p class="para">89.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons I would allow the appeal and make the order proposed by my noble and learned friend, Lord Hope of Craighead.</p>
<p class="lawlord">BARONESS HALE OF RICHMOND</p>
<p class="mylords">My Lords,</p>
<p class="para">90.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Collie asked the Common Services Agency for the incidences of childhood leukaemia in the age range 0 to 14 in each year from 1990 to 2003 and for each census ward in the Dumfries and Galloway postal area. The Commissioner held that he could not have the information in that form, because of the risk that recipients might be able to identify individuals from it. But he also held that it should be provided “suitably amended to protect against potential identification of individuals". There is some reason to think that, even amended in the way which he had in mind (“barnardised”), there would still be a risk that individuals could be identified. But that is a question of fact for the Commissioner. </p>
<p class="para">91.&nbsp;&nbsp;We can easily understand the public interest in making this information available. If I were a parent living in the area I would certainly want to know. We would all like the legal position to be that, if the risk of identification can indeed be eliminated, the Agency is obliged to provide it. That reflects the expectation in Recital 26 of the European Directive 95/46/EC: that the principles of protection shall not apply to data rendered anonymous in such a way that the data subject is no longer identifiable.  It would have been so much easier if this had been clearly stated in the Data Protection Act 1998. </p>
<p class="para">92.&nbsp;&nbsp;Much though I would like that to be the position, I have had much more difficulty in spelling it out from the definition of “personal data” in section 1(1) of the Act. In the end, however, I have reached it by the following route. For this purpose, I am assuming the particular data which Mr Collie has requested, anonymised in such a way that neither he nor anyone else to whom he might pass them on could identify the individuals to whom they relate. The Agency may well have the key which links those data back to the individual patients. The Agency therefore could identify them and remains bound by the data protection principles when processing the data internally. But the recipient of the information will not be able to identify the individuals either from the data themselves, or from the data plus any other information held by the Agency, because the recipient will not have access to that other information. For the purpose of this particular act of processing, therefore, which is disclosure of these data in this form to these people, no living individual to whom they relate is identifiable. I am afraid that this may not be exactly the same route as that taken by either of my noble and learned friends, Lord Hope of Craighead or Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, but for practical purposes this may not matter and I have no wish to add further confusion to this already confusing case by elaborating.  </p>
<p class="para">93.&nbsp;&nbsp;If, of course, barnardisation is not effective to protect individuals from the risk of identification, then the information can only be disclosed in accordance with the data protection principles. On this subject I have nothing to add to the observations of Lord Hope and Lord Rodger. </p>
<p class="para">94.&nbsp;&nbsp;I too, therefore, would allow this appeal and make the order proposed by Lord Hope. </p>
<p class="lawlord">LORD MANCE</p>
<p>My Lords, </p>
<p class="para">95.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the benefit of reading in draft the opinions of my noble and learned friends, Lord Hope of Craighead and Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, and I agree with them that the appeal should be allowed and the order proposed by Lord Hope made. </p>
<p class="para">96.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only significant difference in the reasoning of my noble and learned friends relates, as I see it, to the interpretation and so application of part (b) of the definition of “personal data” in s.1(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998. Both take the view, as I do, that part (a) relates to the particular data under consideration, that is, in this case, the barnardised data. Lord Rodger takes the view that part (b) is irrelevant, because the “other information” to which it refers only embraces “other information” which is not itself “data” in the possession of the data controller at the time of processing. Lord Hope takes the view that “other information” in part (b) covers all other information including data other than the particular data under consideration for processing (here the barnardised data). But he concludes that this makes no difference because part (b) only contemplates a situation where the particular data under consideration and the “other information” each have a contribution to make to the result (that is the potential identification of a living individual). </p>
<p class="para">97.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unnecessary in this case to decide between these rival views, but my own preference is for Lord Hope’s. In all other respects, I also agree with his reasoning. </p>
