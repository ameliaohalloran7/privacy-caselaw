<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;48. This theme was developed in <i>Page v Smith</i> [1996]  AC 155, 181A-D by Lord Browne-Wilkinson, where he observed that medical science has demonstrated that the body can suffer injuries which are not demonstrably attributable to physical injury:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Injuries of this type may take two forms.  First, physical illness or injury not brought about by a chain of demonstrable physical events but by mental or emotional stresses, ie by a psychiatric route.  Examples are a heart attack or a miscarriage produced by shock.  In this case, the end product is a physical condition although it has been brought about by a process which is not demonstrably a physical one but lies in the mental or nervous system.  The second form is psychiatric illness itself which is brought about by mental or emotional stresses, ie by a psychiatric route.  Because medical science has so far been less successful in demonstrating the nature of psychiatric illness and the processes whereby it is brought about by the psychiatric route, the courts have been more reluctant to accept the risk of such illness as being foreseeable.  But since the decision of this House in <i>McLoughlin v O'Brian</i> [1983]  1 AC 410 it has been established that, in certain circumstances, a defendant can be liable for illness or injury, whether psychiatric or physical, produced in a plaintiff by purely psychiatric processes, without any direct physical impact on, or injury to, the limbs or organs of the plaintiff."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;49. This passage helps to set the scene for these appeals.  The branch of medical science which is concerned with psychiatric disorders and disturbances is still in the process of development.  It is not yet fully understood.  We are able to identify physical conditions which have been brought about by a psychiatric route.  Mr King's peptic ulcer disorder is a physical condition of this type.  We can also identify various psychiatric illnesses which, according to our present state of knowledge, appear not to have been the product of any kind of physical injury.  But the distinction between what I have described as a mental injury and a physical injury is unclear, and the extent to which it can be maintained is debatable.  It may now be possible to show objectively, by means of expert medical evidence, that a psychiatric illness is due to a disturbance within the patient's own central nervous system which drugs can control or alleviate.  As I shall show later, this has been the basis for some recent decisions in the Federal courts in the United States that a psychiatric illness of that kind is a physical injury.  It is of some importance therefore to appreciate the basis on which counsel for the passengers in these cases presented their argument.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50. The argument in the courts below has assumed that the mental injury which Mr King and Miss Morris sustained is one which cannot be attributed to any kind of physical injury.  This point was expressly conceded in Mr King's case.  Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers MR acknowledged in Miss Morris's case that the stage may one day be reached when a physical cause can be demonstrated for these kinds of psychiatric illnesses: [2002] QB 100, 114, para 40.  But he said her appeal had to be approached on the assumption that that stage had not yet been reached.  I understand the point to have been a matter of express concession in her case also.  Mr Braslavsky was content to present her appeal to this House on the same basis.  He did not attempt to link her mental injury to any physical condition affecting the tissues of her body.  He maintained that it was sufficient for her to show that Dr Cooling's diagnosis was that she was suffering from a depressive illness which had a recognised international classification.  He said that his case was that she was suffering from a recognised mental disorder, not that her disorder could be linked to any injury to her body.</p>
<i><p>Domestic jurisprudence</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;51. It may be helpful, before embarking upon an examination of the words "any other bodily injury" in article 17 of the Convention, to examine the present state of our own jurisprudence as to how similar words in domestic legislation are to be interpreted.  This is not to say that the approach which we take when we are construing our own legislation is the approach which we should take when we are construing the Convention.  The construction of an international convention proceeds upon different principles.  But this exercise may help to put the problem in its current context.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;52. The word "bodily" is not unknown in the legislation of the United Kingdom.  The phrase "bodily functions" in modern social security legislation has received a broad interpretation: see <i>Cockburn v Chief Adjudication Officer</i> [1997]  1 WLR 799.  Lord Slynn of Hadley said, at p 813, that this phrase could extend to the operation of the senses and their communication to the brain.  But the concept of function is not the same as that of injury.  More in point is the use of the phrase "bodily harm" in English criminal law to describe various categories of offences against the person: see sections 18, 20 and 47 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861.  The phrase "grievous bodily harm" is used in sections 18 and 20 of that Act.  The phrase "actual bodily harm" is used in section 47.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;53. The meaning of the phrase "actual bodily harm" in that context was considered in <i>R v Chan-Fook</i> [1994]  1 WLR 689.  The issue was whether an assault which caused no physical injury but caused an hysterical and nervous condition in the victim was an assault occasioning actual bodily harm.  It was held by the Court of Appeal that, while the phrase did not include emotions such as fear or panic, it was capable of including psychiatric injury.  Hobhouse LJ, delivering the judgment of the court, said at p 694B-C:</p>
<p></p><ul>"These are three words of the English language which require no elaboration and in the ordinary course should not receive any.  The word 'harm' is a synonym for injury.  The word 'actual' indicates that the injury (although there is no need for it to be permanent) should not be so trivial as to be wholly insignificant."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;54. Later, at p 694H, he said that in certain cases an explanation might be required of what is involved in the word "bodily".  Rejecting the argument that inclusion of the word in the phrase "actual bodily harm" limits harm to harm to the skin, flesh and bones of the victim, he said, at p 6956:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The body of the victim includes all parts of his body, including his organs, his nervous system and his brain.  Bodily injury therefore may include injury to any of those parts of his body responsible for his mental and other faculties."<p></p></ul>
<p>He recognised that there was a line to be drawn between mere emotions on the one hand and some psychiatric illness on the other, and that this was a matter for expert evidence.  He concluded his discussion of this issue with these words, at p 696C:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Accordingly the phrase 'actual bodily harm' is capable of including psychiatric injury.  But it does not include mere emotions such as fear or distress nor panic nor does it include, as such, states of mind that are not themselves evidence of some identifiable clinical condition."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;55. In <i>R v Ireland</i> [1998]  AC 147 the question was whether psychiatric illness was capable of amounting to bodily harm in terms of sections 18, 20 and 47 of the 1861 Act.  Two appeals were before the House.  In neither case had the victims suffered from structural injuries to the brain such as might require the intervention of a neurologist, nor was it suggested that they had developed psychotic or psychoneurotic conditions.  The case was that they had developed anxiety and depressive disorders, which could be distinguished from simple states of fear or problems in coping with everyday life.  It was held, in the light of contemporary knowledge covering recognisable psychiatric injuries, that injuries of that kind fell within the phrase "bodily harm" as used in the 1861 Act.  Having examined the progress in scientific understanding since that date and the recognition in recent English case law that in the relevant context the distinction between physical and mental injury is by no means clear cut, Lord Steyn said, at pp 158G-159A:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The proposition that the Victorian legislator when enacting sections 18, 20 and 47 of the 1861 Act, would not have had in mind psychiatric illness is no doubt correct.  Psychiatry was in its infancy in 1861.  But the subjective intention of the draftsman is immaterial.  The only relevant inquiry is as to the sense of the words in the context in which they are used.  Moreover the Act of 1861 is a statute of the 'always speaking' type: the statute must be interpreted in the light of the best current scientific appreciation of the link between the body and psychiatric injury."<p></p></ul>
<p>He concluded, at p 159B, that the word "bodily harm" must be interpreted in the context of the 1861 Act so as to include recognisable psychiatric illness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;56. In the light of these decisions and the reasoning which was used to support them, I think that there is little doubt that, if same words as those in article 17 were used in a United Kingdom statute to describe the kinds of personal injury caused by an accident that would entitle the victim to recover damages, they would now be held to extend to those kinds of mental injury that could be shown to amount to a recognisable psychiatric illness or injury by expert evidence.  The depressive illness which Dr Cooling has diagnosed in Miss Morris's case according to DSM IV criteria (296.2) would seem to fall readily into that category.  This brings me to the question whether the words used in the Convention can be construed in the same way.</p>
<i><p><i>The Convention</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;57. The history of the Convention and its incorporation into our law which I shall now outline has been fully described elsewhere and is not controversial.  But it is necessary to place it on record in this judgment by way of background.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;58. The Warsaw Convention was concluded in French on 12 October 1929.  Arrangements were made for it to be received into the law of the United Kingdom by the Carriage by Air Act 1932, and the French text was ratified by the United Kingdom on 14 February 1933.  The 1932 Act gave the force of law to a translation of the French text into English.  Only the English text was set out in the First Schedule to that Act.  Section 4 of the 1932 Act gave power by Order in Council to apply the provisions of the First Schedule to non-international carriage by air, subject to such exceptions, adaptations and modifications, if any, as might be specified.  The provisions of the First Schedule were applied, in a modified form, to non-international carriage by air by the Carriage by Air (Non-international Carriage) (United Kingdom) Order 1952 (SI 1952/158).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;59. The Warsaw Convention was amended by a Protocol which was concluded at The Hague in 1955.  The Carriage by Air Act 1961 gave effect to the Convention concerning international carriage by air, now known as "The Warsaw Convention as Amended at The Hague, 1955", so that it too might have the force of law in the United Kingdom in relation to any carriage by air to which the Convention applied.  Force of law to the Convention in regard to international carriage by air is given by section 1(1) of the 1961 Act, read together with Schedule 1.  Part I of the Schedule to that Act sets out a translation of the Convention into English.  Part II sets out the text in French.  Section 1(2) of the Act provides that, if there is an inconsistency between the text in English in Part I of the Schedule and the text in French in Part II, the text in French shall prevail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60. Once again steps were taken to enable the provisions of the Convention, in their amended form, to be applied to carriage by air, not being carriage to which the Convention applies: see section 10(1).  This was done by the Carriage by Air Acts (Application of Provisions) Order 1967 (SI 1967/480), for the purposes of which the expression "the amended Convention" is defined by article 2(1) of the Order as meaning the English text of the Warsaw Convention as amended by the Hague Protocol.  The Order applies to all carriage by air, not being carriage to which the amended Convention applies: article 3.  Article 4(a) provides that Schedule 1 to that Order is to have effect in respect to carriage which is not "international carriage" as defined in Schedule 2 to the Order.  Schedule 2 sets out the provisions relating to international carriage in the unamended Warsaw Convention, to which continuing force had to be given as some states party to the Warsaw Convention had not adopted the Hague Convention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;61. The carriage of Miss Morris on the KLM flight from Kuala Lumpur to Amsterdam was plainly international carriage by air to which the rules in Schedule 1 to the 1961 Act ("the Hague rules") apply.  In her case the position is straightforward.  The statute provides that the French text is to prevail over the English text if there is any inconsistency: section 1(2).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;62. The carriage of Mr King in the helicopter when it took off from the Beryl platform in the North Sea was not international carriage as defined in Schedule 2 to the 1967 Order.  The rules which applied to that carriage were those set out in Schedule 1 to that Order ("the United Kingdom rules").  But the parties in Mr King's case are agreed that, although the Hague rules do not apply in his case, it is proper in his case too to look at the French text of the Convention when construing the articles in Schedule 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;63. For the reasons which I gave in <i>Herd v Clyde Helicopters Ltd</i> [1997]  AC 534, 552B-E I would endorse this approach.  The long title of the 1961 Act states that it is "An Act to give effect to the Convention concerning international travel by air known as 'the Warsaw Convention as amended at The Hague, 1955', to enable the rules contained in that Convention to be applied, with or without modification, in other cases and, in particular, to non-international carriage by air; and for connected purposes."  One of the primary objectives of the United Kingdom rules, as in the case of the Convention itself, was to eliminate conflict of laws problems which are just as likely to arise from non-Convention as from Convention carriage.  As Lord Reed said in Mr King's case, the practical advantages of construing identical provisions in all three sets of rules, including those in Schedule 2 to the 1961 Order ("the Warsaw rules"), in the same sense are manifest: 2001 SLT 126, 159I.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;64. Chapter III of the Convention contains the provisions which are relevant to these appeals.  It is headed "Liability of the Carrier."  The articles in this chapter are numbered from 17 to 30.  Article 17 is concerned with the carrier's liability for death or injury suffered by a passenger.  Article 18 is concerned with the carrier's liability for destruction or loss of or damage to registered baggage or cargo.  Article 19 is concerned with damage caused by delay in the carriage by air of passengers, baggage or cargo.  Article 20 provides that the carrier is not liable if he proves that he and his servants or agents have taken all necessary measures to avoid the damage or that it was impossible for him or them to take such measures.  These provisions must be read together with article 24, which provides that, in the cases covered by these articles, any action for damages, however founded, can only be brought subject to the conditions and limits set out in the Convention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;65. The general character and purpose of the Hague rules, which were authorised to be applied by Order in Council to non-international carriage by air by section 10(1) of the 1961 Act, were described in <i>Holmes v Bangladesh Biman Corporation</i> [1989]  AC 1112, 1129 by Lord Bridge of Harwich; see also <i>Sidhu v British Airways plc</i> [1997]  AC 430, 453-454.  They impose liability on the carrier without proof of fault in respect of the death of or injury to passengers, damage to or loss of baggage or cargo and delay to passengers, baggage or cargo.  They impose limits on the amount recoverable in respect of the death, injury, damage, loss or delay.  They nullify contractual provisions tending to relieve the carrier of liability or to lower the limits of liability.  Actions for damages to enforce the rights given by the Rules can only be brought subject to the Rules, and they exclude other remedies.  What was sought to be achieved was a uniform international code which could be applied by the courts of all the high contracting parties.  In those areas with which it deals the rules which it lays down were intended to be uniform and exclusive of resort to domestic law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66. From the point of view of the passenger or the owner of baggage or cargo, the imposition of liability without proof of fault on the carrier and the nullification of provisions relieving him of liability or restricting the amount of his liability are very significant advantages.  From the point of view of the carrier too however there are significant advantages in the system laid down by the Convention.  A principal consequence of that system is the exposure of the carrier to liabilities without the freedom to contract out of them.  But it defines those situations in which compensation is to be available, and it sets out the limits of liability and the conditions under which claims to establish liability, if disputed, are to be made.  A balance has been struck between these competing interests, in the interests of certainty and uniformity.</p>
<i><p><i>The issue</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;67. As Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers MR said in Miss Morris's case [2002] QB 100, 119, para 67, it is not difficult to see that the Convention was intended to create a uniform set of circumstances in which a carrier by air would be obliged to pay compensation for damage sustained by a passenger.  But this raises the question, what damage?  To answer this question it is necessary to turn to the wording of the articles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;68. I must first set out the relevant articles in Chapter III of the Convention, using the English text as set out in Part I of the Schedule to the 1961 Act.</p>
<p></p><ul>"17.  The carrier is liable for damage sustained in the event of the death or wounding of a passenger or any other bodily injury suffered by a passenger, if the accident which caused the damage so sustained took place on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>18(1).  The carrier is liable for damage sustained in the event of the destruction or loss of, or of damage to, any registered baggage or any cargo, if the occurrence which caused the damage so sustained took place during the carriage by air . . .<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>19.  The carrier is liable for damage occasioned by delay in the carriage by air of passengers, baggage or cargo.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>20.  The carrier is not liable if he proves that he and his servants or agents have taken all necessary measures to avoid the damage or that it was impossible for him or them to take such measures.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>21.  If the carrier proves that the damage was caused by or contributed to by the negligence of the injured person the court may, in accordance with the provisions of its own law, exonerate the carrier wholly or partly from his liability . . .<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>24(1).  In the cases covered by articles 18 and 19 any action for damages, however founded, can only be brought subject to the conditions and limits set out in this Convention.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(2).  In the cases covered by article 17, the provisions of the preceding paragraph also apply, without prejudice to the questions as to who are the persons who have the right to bring suit and what are their respective rights."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;69. The article 17 in the French text as set out in Part II of the Schedule is in these terms:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Le transporteur est responsable du dommage survenu en cas de mort, de blessure ou de toute autre lésion corporelle subie par un voyageur lorsque l'accident qui a causé le dommage s'est produit à bord de l'aéronef ou au cours de toutes opérations d'embarquement et de débarquement."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70. The wording of article 17 indicates that three things must be established in order to demonstrate that the carrier is liable.  The first is that the passenger must have sustained death or wounding or other bodily injury.  The second is that there must have been an accident which took place on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking.  The third is that the passenger's death, wounding or bodily injury must have been caused by the accident.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;71. In <i>Air France v Saks</i> (1985)  470 US 392, 398-399 the United States Supreme Court said that the text of the Convention implies that, however the word "accident" is defined, it is the cause of the injury that must satisfy that definition rather that the occurrence of the injury alone.  At p 405 the court concluded that liability under article 17 arises only if a passenger's injury is caused by an unexpected or unusual event that is external to the passenger.  This interpretation of the article was approved by the Court of Appeal in <i>Chaudhari v British Airways plc</i> The Times, 7 May 1997; Court of Appeal (Civil Division) Transcript No 590 of 1997.  It was also approved and applied by Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers MR in Miss Morris's case [2002] QB 100, 110, para 24. I agree that it gives the word "accident" a natural and sensible meaning in the context of article 17, and I too would adopt this approach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72. In Mr King's case it was accepted that the incident which he describes in his averments was an accident.  In Miss Morris's case the defendant argued that the indecent assault which she suffered could not reasonably be described as an accident.  The Court of Appeal held that it was not necessary to show that the event had any relationship with the operation of the aircraft or carriage by air, that the incident in which Miss Morris was involved exemplified a special risk inherent in air travel and that she had sustained an accident within the meaning of the article: [2002] QB 100, 112, para 31.  So long as it occurred during the time when the passenger was in the charge of the carrier, the passenger was entitled to be compensated for its consequences if the carrier was not able to discharge the burden imposed by article 20 of showing that he and his servants or agents had taken all necessary measures to avoid the damage or that it was impossible for him or them to take such measures.  There has been no appeal against this finding by the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73. The remaining question, which is common to both cases, is whether the mental injury which the passengers sustained falls within the scope of the expression "bodily injury".  That is the central issue in these appeals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74. I propose to approach this question by examining first the principles of interpretation that are relevant to this issue.  I shall then discuss the natural meaning of the words used in both the English and the French texts.  I shall then look at the travaux préparatoires in order to see what light, if any, they may cast on this issue.  Finally I shall examine the jurisprudence of other jurisdictions in order to see whether a settled practice has developed as to the meaning of this phrase and, if not, what guidance can be obtained from the approach which has been taken to the problem in the United States.  Before undertaking this exercise I should like to pay tribute to the researches of counsel, to the quality of the judgments both in the Court of Session and in the Court of Appeal and to the diligence and attention to detail with which they have set out and examined the relevant material.</p>
<i><p><i>Principles of interpretation</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75. Almost everything that needs to be said on this subject was referred to in <i>Sidhu v British Airways </i>plc [1997]  AC 430, and it is necessary here to provide only a brief summary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76. We are concerned in this case with the meaning of words used an international convention.  The Convention must be considered as a whole, and it should receive a purposive construction: <i>Grein v Imperial Airways Ltd</i> [1937]  1 KB 50, 74-76 per Greene LJ; <i>Fothergill v Monarch Airlines Ltd</i> [1981]  AC 251, 279 per Lord Diplock.  The ordinary and natural meaning of the words used in the English text in Part I of the Schedule provides the starting point.  But these words must also be compared with their equivalents in the French text in Part II of the Schedule, as section 1(2) of the 1961 Act tells us that if there is any inconsistency the text in French shall prevail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77. As the language was not chosen by English draftsmen and was not designed to be construed exclusively by English judges, it should not be interpreted according to the idiom of English law.  What one is looking for is a meaning which can be taken to be consistent with the common intention of the states which were represented at the international conference.  The exercise is not to be controlled by technical rules of English law or domestic precedent.  It would not be right to search for the legal meaning of the words used, as the Convention was not based on the legal system of any of the contracting states.  It was intended to be applicable in a uniform way across legal boundaries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78. In situations of this kind the language used should be construed on broad principles leading to a result that is generally acceptable: see <i>Stag Line Ltd v Foscolo, Mango Co Ltd</i> [1932]  AC 328, 350 per Lord Macmillan; <i>James Buchanan &amp; Co Ltd v Babco Forwarding and Shipping (UK) Ltd</i> [1978]  AC 141, 152 per Lord Wilberforce.  But this does not mean that a broad construction has to be given to the words used in the Convention.  As Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers MR said in Miss Morris's case [2002] QB 100, 125, para 90, it is not axiomatic that the broad principle of "general acceptation" described in these cases militates in favour of a broad rather than a narrow interpretation of the phrase "any other bodily injury"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79. It is legitimate to have regard to the travaux préparatoires in order to resolve ambiguities or obscurities: <i>Forthergill v Monarch Airlines Ltd</i> [1981]  AC 251, 278 per Lord Wilberforce.  But caution is needed in the use of this material, as the delegates may not have shared a common view.  An expression by one of them as to his own view is likely be of little value if it was met simply by silence on the part of the other delegates.  It will only be helpful if, after proper analysis, the travaux clearly and indisputably point to a definite intention on the part of the delegates as to how the point at issue should be resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80. It is also legitimate to have regard to subsequent practice in the application of the Convention, if this shows that the contracting parties were in agreement as to its interpretation when it was entered into.  General guidance to this effect is given, albeit only prospectively, in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (1980) (Cmnd 7964), articles 31(1) and 32.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81. In an ideal world the Convention should be accorded the same meaning by all who are party to it.  So case law provides a further potential source of evidence.  Careful consideration needs to be given to the reasoning of courts of other jurisdictions which have been called upon to deal with the point at issue, particularly those which are of high standing.  Considerable weight should be given to an interpretation which has received general acceptance in other jurisdictions.  On the other hand a discriminating approach is required if the decisions conflict, or if there is no clear agreement between them.</p>
