<p align="right"><a href="honey-4.htm">(back to preceding text)</a></p>

<p class="para">119.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, the effect of section 121(1) is to suspend, but not to remove permanently, a secure tenant’s right to buy if and so long as he or she “is obliged to give up possession … in pursuance of an order of the court". Those words clearly mean that the tenant is presently so obliged, as the subsection goes on to deal separately with a future obligation. In those circumstances, in the absence of an express provision to support such a conclusion, it does not appear to me that it is open to the court to conclude that the right to buy pursuant to a notice already served under section 122 is permanently lost once the tenant is obliged to deliver up possession. It is true that the right to buy, albeit pursuant to a new notice, would not be lost, but the right to buy enjoyed by a tenant who has served a section 122 notice is a right to buy pursuant to that notice. Part V of the 1985 Act sets out the circumstances in which such a right can be lost, and it therefore seems to me that, particularly in the light of the provisions of section 121, it cannot be a correct inference to draw from the provisions of Parts IV and V of the Act that the right is lost once a possession order becomes operative.</p>
<p class="para">120.&nbsp;&nbsp;If Mr Arden’s argument were correct, it would inevitably seem to mean that if any of the events identified in section 121(1) or (2) occurred, a secure tenant who had served notice exercising his right to buy would lose the right to rely on the notice, however far advanced the exercise had got, and however blameless he was for the triggering of section 121. To take the example identified by Keene LJ, a tenant against whom a vexatious bankruptcy petition was presented, would not merely have his right to rely on the notice suspended, but would forfeit the right, even if the sale was close to completion. That harsh result casts further doubt on the argument that the right to rely on a section 122 notice is lost if any of the events specified in section 121(1) or (2) occurs.  </p>
<p class="para">121.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the well-established rule that discharge of a suspended possession order revives the secure tenancy retrospectively logically carries with it the consequence that the tenant must be retrospectively treated as having had a secure tenancy throughout the period when he or she was contemporaneously “obliged to give up possession…in pursuance of an order of the court". As Simon Brown LJ said in <i>Rogers </i>(1999) 32 HLR 361, 371, “a section 85(2)(b) order is fully retrospective in effect", and the same must <i>a fortiori </i>apply to a discharge under section 85(4).</p>
<p class="para">122.&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite apart from this, it is relevant to refer to my conclusion that an assured tenancy does not expire at the time of breach of the terms of suspension of a suspended order for possession, but only when the order for possession is executed. If Mr Arden’s argument were correct, it would mean that the effect of a suspended possession order on a secure tenant’s right to buy could be far more penal than on that of an assured tenant. This would be most surprising.</p>
<p class="para">123.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is fair to say that this conclusion could have unsatisfactory, even unfair, consequences for landlords of tenants with the right to buy (although, as Mr Drabble pointed out on behalf of Mrs Honeygan-Green, there is no evidence of any serious problems in practice). The price payable is fixed by reference to values as at the date of service of the section 122 notice, and the tenant is entitled to pull out of the negotiations at any time up to completion. Accordingly, where a tenant has served a section 122 notice and a suspended order for possession is subsequently made, the landlord would appear to face the prospect of an uncertain but potentially very long period (quite conceivably many years) before the tenant could enforce the right to buy. </p>
<p class="para">124.&nbsp;&nbsp;The tenant, conversely, would appear to have such a period (over whose duration he or she would often have a substantial degree of control) in which he could see how the economic situation developed, and, in a rising market, he could insist on completing the purchase at a historically very low price, or, in a falling market, he could pull out of the transaction. That would be an enormously attractive option, which, to add insult to injury from the landlord’s perspective, would only arise from the tenant’s breach, normally failure to pay rent. Mr Arden further suggested that a long delay between service of the section 122 notice and completion could have unfair consequences on the landlord in relation to service charges, as a result of the operation of para 16B of Schedule 6 to the 1985 Act. It is unnecessary to deal with these points to determine any of these appeals, but it is worth exploring them a little further.</p>
<p class="para">125.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Court of Appeal, it was suggested that it might be possible for the court, when making a suspended order for possession under section 85, against a tenant who has served a section 122 notice, to impose conditions relating to the exercise of the right to buy pursuant to that notice. In particular, that the court might be able to require the tenant to abandon the section 122 notice as a condition of the suspension of the order for possession. </p>
<p class="para">126.&nbsp;&nbsp;While I recognise the very wide ambit of the words of section 85(3)(b), which gives the court power to “impose such other conditions as it thinks fit", I have real doubts whether it would be appropriate in principle or in practice to construe them as having such an effect. The effect of the provisions of Part V of the 1985 Act, which is concerned with the right to buy, is that a secure tenant’s right to enforce the right to buy pursuant to a section 122 notice is suspended, not lost, when an order for possession becomes effective. That may well make it rather difficult to justify interpreting a provision in Part IV of the same Act, concerned with the other rights of secure tenants, so as to enable the court to order that the right to buy pursuant to the notice will or may be lost. Quite apart from this, in many cases where the point arose the court may well be likely to find exercising such a jurisdiction difficult and contentious, and it could easily lead to arbitrary and inconsistent results.</p>
<p class="para">127.&nbsp;&nbsp;An alternative possible solution involves focussing on the fact that, while section 121(1) prevents a tenant proceeding with any steps in relation to a section 122 notice, there is no such bar against the landlord. Accordingly, runs the argument, if the tenant is precluded from taking any steps, the landlord can bring matters to a head by serving successive notices under sections 140 and 141. If the tenant does not complete within the time specified in the second, section 141, notice, then, as explained, the section 122 notice is treated as withdrawn.</p>
<p class="para">128.&nbsp;&nbsp;At first sight, it might seem a little strange if a landlord could serve a notice requiring the tenant to proceed with a purchase under the 1985 Act at a time when section 121 of that Act specifically precludes the tenant from so proceeding. However, there may be two answers to that. The first is that, as my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann said during argument, the section 140 and 141 notices may well  properly be construed as requiring the tenant to arrange matters so that he or she can proceed with the steps laid down in Part V of the 1985 Act, which includes discharging the circumstances which give rise to the operation of section 121. Secondly, the notion that the landlord is not precluded from serving notices under sections 140 and 141 at a time when section 121 applies can be said to be consistent with section 141(5) of the 1985 Act. That expressly provides that where a tenant is precluded from completing because of arrears of rent (i.e. because section 138(2) applies) the landlord is still entitled to serve and rely on notices under sections 140 and 141.</p>
<p class="para">129.&nbsp;&nbsp;As to Mr Arden’s argument based on service charges, I suspect that it may well be possible to avoid any unfairness to the landlord in that connection by giving a realistic construction to the rather convoluted provisions of sections 125A, B and C of the 1985 Act when read together with para 16B of Schedule 6.</p>
<p class="para">130.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unnecessary to decide these points as they do not directly arise in any of these appeals. As the points are not straightforward and the competing arguments were not fully developed before your Lordships, it would, I believe, be safer not to express any firm conclusions on them.</p>
<i><p class="para">Disposal of the three appeals</p></i>
<p class="para">131.&nbsp;&nbsp;If, as I understand to be the case, your Lordships have all reached the same conclusions as I have reached, then the outcome of these three appeals is as follows.</p>
<p class="para">132.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appeal in <i>Knowsley Housing Trust v White </i>is allowed. Mrs White is entitled to a declaration that she is, and since the grant of her tenancy has always been, an assured tenant, notwithstanding that there is an effective suspended order for possession against her and that she is and has been in breach of the terms of suspension. The Court of Appeal understandably applied to section 9 of the 1988 Act its earlier reasoning in relation to section 85 of the 1985 Act (as approved by this House), and concluded that, from the date she failed to comply with the terms on which the order for possession was suspended, Mrs White became a tolerated trespasser. The reasoning in those earlier cases may be open to doubt, but it is inappropriate to reconsider the principles they laid down so far as secure tenancies under the 1985 Act are concerned. However, assured tenancies under the 1988 Act do not end as a result of an order for possession until the order is executed (or the tenant otherwise vacates). </p>
<p class="para">133.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appeal in <i>Porter v Shepherds Bush Housing Association </i>is allowed, and Mr Porter’s application for discharge of the suspended possession order made against him is remitted to the County Court. The mere fact that the tenant has paid off all the arrears and costs, so that the landlord can no longer enforce the order, cannot prevent the tenant from going back to the court under section 85(2) or for an order under section 85(4). Mr Underwood, for the Association, realistically appreciated that the contrary conclusion reached in <i>Swindon </i>[2003] HLR 610, although regarded as binding on the Court of Appeal, was unsupportable in this House. He therefore rightly agreed that Mr Porter’s application should be remitted to the County Court.</p>
<p class="para">134.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appeal in <i>Islington London Borough Council v Honeygan-Green </i>is dismissed. The tenant’s right to rely on her notice of 23 May 2000, exercising the right to buy, was suspended on about 1 November 2002, when the order for possession took effect (in the light of the reasoning in <i>Thompson </i>[1987] 1 WLR 1425). However, as the Court of Appeal held, her right was revived retrospectively and with immediate effect when the order for possession was discharged on 8 July 2003 (or, as I see it, if earlier, when para 6 of the order for possession took effect).</p>
