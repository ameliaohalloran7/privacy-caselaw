<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21. In <i>Ex p Main</i> [1999] QB 349 and again in the present case, the Court of Appeal held that the policy represented the minimum intrusion into the rights of prisoners consistent with the need to maintain security, order and discipline in prisons.  That is a conclusion which I respect but cannot share.  In my opinion the policy provides for a degree of intrusion into the privileged legal correspondence of prisoners which is greater than is justified by the objectives the policy is intended to serve, and so violates the common law rights of prisoners.  Section 47(1) of the 1952 Act does not authorise such excessive intrusion, and the Home Secretary accordingly had no power to lay down or implement the policy in its present form.  I would accordingly declare paragraphs 17.69 to 17.74 of the Security Manual to be unlawful and void in so far as they provide that prisoners must always be absent when privileged legal correspondence held by them in their cells is examined by prison officers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22. Although, in response to a request by the House during argument, counsel for Mr Daly proffered a draft rule which might be adopted to govern the searching of privileged legal correspondence, it would be inappropriate for the House to attempt to formulate or approve the terms of such a rule, which would call for careful consideration and consultation before it was finalised.  It is enough to indicate that any rule should provide for a general right for prisoners to be present when privileged legal correspondence is examined, and in practice this will probably mean any legal documentation to avoid time-wasting debate about which documents are privileged and which are not.  But the rule must provide for the exclusion of the prisoner while the examination takes place if there is or is reasonably believed to be good cause for excluding him to safeguard the efficacy of the search, and the rule must permit the prison authorities to respond to sudden operational emergencies or urgent intelligence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23. I have reached the conclusions so far expressed on an orthodox application of common law principles derived from the authorities and an orthodox domestic approach to judicial review.  But the same result is achieved by reliance on the European Convention.  Article 8.1 gives Mr Daly a right to respect for his correspondence.  While interference with that right by a public authority may be permitted if in accordance with the law and necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety, the prevention of disorder or crime or for protection of the rights and freedoms of others, the policy interferes with Mr Daly's exercise of his right under article 8.1 to an extent much greater than necessity requires.  In this instance, therefore, the common law and the convention yield the same result.  But this need not always be so.  In <i>Smith and Grady v United Kingdom</i> (1999)  29 EHRR 493,  the European Court held that the orthodox domestic approach of the English courts had not given the applicants an effective remedy for the breach of their rights under article 8 of the convention because the threshold of review had been set too high.  Now, following the incorporation of the convention by the Human Rights Act 1998 and the bringing of that Act fully into force, domestic courts must themselves form a judgment whether a convention right has been breached (conducting such inquiry as is necessary to form that judgment) and, so far as permissible under the Act, grant an effective remedy.  On this aspect of the case, I agree with and adopt the observations of my noble and learned friend Lord Steyn which I have had the opportunity of reading in draft.</p>
<p><b>LORD STEYN</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24. I am in complete agreement with the reasons given by Lord Bingham of Cornhill in his speech.  For the reasons he gives I would also allow the appeal.  Except on one narrow but important point I have nothing to add.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25. There was written and oral argument on the question whether certain observations of Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers MR in <i>R (Mahmood) v Secretary of State for the Home </i>Department [2001]  1 WLR 840 were correct.  The context was an immigration case involving a decision of the Secretary of State made before the Human Rights Act 1998 came into effect.  The Master of the Rolls nevertheless approached the case as if the Act had been in force when the Secretary of State reached his decision.  He explained the new approach to be adopted.  The Master of the Rolls concluded, at p 857, para 40:</p>
<p></p><ul>"When anxiously scrutinising an executive decision that interferes with human rights, the court will ask the question, applying an objective test, whether the decision-maker could reasonably have concluded that the interference was necessary to achieve one or more of the legitimate aims recognised by the Convention.  When considering the test of necessity in the relevant context, the court must take into account the European jurisprudence in accordance with section 2 of the 1998 Act."<p></p></ul>
<p>These observations have been followed by the Court of Appeal in <i>R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p Isiko</i> (unreported), 20 December 2000 and by Thomas J in <i>R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p Samaroo</i> (unreported), 20 December 2000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26. The explanation of the Master of the Rolls in the first sentence of the cited passage requires clarification.  It is couched in language reminiscent of the traditional <i>Wednesbury</i> ground of review (<i>Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation</i> [1948] 1 KB 223), and in particular the adaptation of that test in terms of heightened scrutiny in cases involving fundamental rights as formulated in <i>R v Ministry of Defence, Ex p Smith</i> [1996]  QB 517, 554E-G per Sir Thomas Bingham MR.  There is a material difference between the <i>Wednesbury </i>and<i> Smith</i> grounds of review and the approach of proportionality applicable in respect of review where convention rights are at stake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;27. The contours of the principle of proportionality are familiar.  In <i>de Freitas v Permanent Secretary of Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, Lands and Housing</i> [1999]  1 AC 69 the Privy Council adopted a three stage test.  Lord Clyde observed, at p 80, that in determining whether a limitation (by an act, rule or decision) is arbitrary or excessive the court should ask itself:</p>
<p></p><ul>"whether: (i) the legislative objective is sufficiently important to justify limiting a fundamental right; (ii) the measures designed to meet the legislative objective are rationally connected to it; and (iii) the means used to impair the right or freedom are no more than is necessary to accomplish the objective."<p></p></ul>
<p>Clearly, these criteria are more precise and more sophisticated than the traditional grounds of review.  What is the difference for the disposal of concrete cases?  Academic public lawyers have in remarkably similar terms elucidated the difference between the traditional grounds of review and the proportionality approach: see Professor Jeffrey Jowell QC,<i> </i>"Beyond the Rule of Law: Towards Constitutional Judicial Review" [2000] PL 671; Craig, Administrative Law, 4th ed<i> </i>(1999)<i>, </i>561-563<i>;</i> Professor David Feldman,<i> </i>"Proportionality and the Human Rights Act 1998"<i>, </i>essay in <i>The Principle of Proportionality in the Laws of Europe </i>(1999), pp 117, 127 et seq<i>.  </i>The starting point is that there is an overlap between the traditional grounds of review and the approach of proportionality. Most cases would be decided in the same way whichever approach is adopted.  But the intensity of review is somewhat greater under the proportionality approach.  Making due allowance for important structural differences between various convention rights, which I do not propose to discuss, a few generalisations are perhaps permissible.  I would mention three concrete differences without suggesting that my statement is exhaustive.  First, the doctrine of proportionality may require the reviewing court to assess the balance which the decision maker has struck, not merely whether it is within the range of rational or reasonable decisions.  Secondly, the proportionality test may go further than the traditional grounds of review inasmuch as it may require attention to be directed to the relative weight accorded to interests and considerations.  Thirdly, even the heightened scrutiny test developed in <i>R v Ministry of Defence, Ex p Smith</i> [1996]  QB 517, 554  is not necessarily appropriate to the protection of human rights.  It will be recalled that in <i>Smith</i> the Court of Appeal reluctantly felt compelled to reject a limitation on homosexuals in the army.  The challenge based on article 8 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (the right to respect for private and family life) foundered on the threshold required even by the anxious scrutiny test.  The European Court of Human Rights came to the opposite conclusion: <i>Smith and Grady v United Kingdom</i> (1999) 29 EHRR 493.  The court concluded, at p 543, para 138:</p>
<p></p><ul>"the threshold at which the High Court and the Court of Appeal could find the Ministry of Defence policy irrational was placed so high that it effectively excluded any consideration by the domestic courts of the question of whether the interference with the applicants' rights answered a pressing social need or was proportionate to the national security and public order aims pursued, principles which lie at the heart of the court's analysis of complaints under article 8 of the Convention."<p></p></ul>
<p>In other words, the intensity of the review, in similar cases, is guaranteed by the twin requirements that the limitation of the right was necessary in a democratic society, in the sense of meeting a pressing social need, and the question whether the interference was really proportionate to the legitimate aim being pursued.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28. The differences in approach between the traditional grounds of review and the proportionality approach may therefore sometimes yield different results.  It is therefore important that cases involving convention rights must be analysed in the correct way.  This does not mean that there has been a shift to merits review.  On the contrary, as Professor Jowell [2000] PL 671, 681 has pointed out the respective roles of judges and administrators are fundamentally distinct and will remain so.  To this extent the general tenor of the observations in <i>Mahmood</i> [2001] 1 WLR 840 are correct.  And Laws LJ rightly emphasised in <i>Mahmood,</i> at p 847, para 18,  "that the intensity of review in a public law case will depend on the subject matter in hand".  That is so even in cases involving Convention rights.  In law context is everything.</p>
<p><b>LORD COOKE OF THORNDON</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;29. Having had the advantage of reading in draft the speeches of my noble and learned friends, Lord Bingham of Cornhill and Lord Steyn, I am in full agreement with them.  I add some brief observations on two matters, less to supplement what they have said than to underline its importance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30. First, while this case has arisen in a jurisdiction where the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms applies, and while the case is one in which the Convention and the common law produce the same result, it is of great importance, in my opinion, that the common law by itself is being recognised as a sufficient source of the fundamental right to confidential communication with a legal adviser for the purpose of obtaining legal advice.  Thus the decision may prove to be in point in common law jurisdictions not affected by the Convention.  Rights similar to those in the Convention are of course to be found in constitutional documents and other formal affirmations of rights elsewhere.  The truth is, I think, that some rights are inherent and fundamental to democratic civilised society.  Conventions, constitutions, bills of rights and the like respond by recognising rather than creating them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;31. To essay any list of these fundamental, perhaps ultimately universal, rights is far beyond anything required for the purpose of deciding the present case.  It is enough to take the three identified by Lord Bingham:  in his words, access to a court; access to legal advice; and the right to communicate confidentially with a legal adviser under the seal of legal professional privilege.  As he says authoritatively from the woolsack, such rights may be curtailed only by clear and express words, and then only to the extent reasonably necessary to meet the ends which justify the curtailment.  The point that I am emphasising is that the common law goes so deep.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32. The other matter concerns degrees of judicial review.  Lord Steyn illuminates the distinctions between "traditional" (that is to say in terms of English case law, <i>Wednesbury</i>) standards of judicial review and higher standards under the European Convention or the common law of human rights.  As he indicates, often the results are the same.  But the view that the standards are substantially the same appears to have received its quietus in <i>Smith and Grady v United Kingdom</i> (1999)  29 EHRR 493 and <i>Lustig-Prean and Beckett v United Kingdom</i> (1999)  29 EHRR 548.  And I think that the day will come when it will be more widely recognised that <i>Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation</i> [1948] 1 KB 223 was an unfortunately retrogressive decision in English administrative law, insofar as it suggested that there are degrees of unreasonableness and that only a very extreme degree can bring an administrative decision within the legitimate scope of judicial invalidation.  The depth of judicial review and the deference due to administrative discretion vary with the subject matter.  It may well be, however, that the law can never be satisfied in any administrative field merely by a finding that the decision under review is not capricious or absurd.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33. I, too, would therefore allow the present appeal.</p>
<p><b>LORD HUTTON</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;34. I have had the advantage of reading in draft the speeches of my noble and learned friends, Lord Bingham of Cornhill and Lord Steyn.  I am in full agreement with the speech of Lord Bingham of Cornhill and for the reasons which he gives I would also allow this appeal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;35. I am also in agreement with the general observations made by Lord Steyn on <i>R (Mahmood) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</i> [2001]  1 WLR 840. </p>
<p><b>LORD SCOTT OF FOSCOTE</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;36. I have had the advantage of reading in draft the opinion prepared by my noble and learned friend, Lord Bingham of Cornhill.  I am in complete agreement with the reasons he has given for allowing the appeal.</p>
