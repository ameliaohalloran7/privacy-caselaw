        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appellate procedure follows the same logic. 
          The only question on an appeal against conviction is whether the conviction 
          was unsafe. If it was, then the appeal must be allowed: in all other 
          cases the appeal must be dismissed: the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 section 
          2 (as amended). A whole variety of factors may affect the safety of 
          a conviction - error of law, the admission of evidence which ought to 
          have been excluded, some unfairness in the trial or the summing-up, 
          relevant evidence not adduced at the trial. The powers of the Court 
          of Appeal to admit fresh evidence or extend the time for appeal are 
          wide; they are not constrained by the consideration of the interests 
          of any other person. They are to be exercised whenever it would serve 
          the interests of justice. Pleas, admissions and concessions can where 
          it is just to do so be withdrawn. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal will also listen to criticisms 
          of the conduct of the defence and give effect to them when they have 
          merit. It is hard to visualise a case where the criticism would (in 
          the absence of immunity) be sufficiently substantial to justify a claim 
          against the advocate but not give a ground of appeal which the Court 
          of Appeal would have to evaluate. Similarly, when, at a later time, 
          new factors arise which justify the reconsideration of the safety of 
          the conviction, the case can be referred back to the Court of Appeal 
          under the Criminal Appeal Act 1995, s. 9. The duty of the advocates 
          appearing before the Court of Appeal are the same as at the trial, the 
          achievement of a just outcome. Their role is adversarial but their duty 
          is not partisan.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prosecuting advocate is not in practice 
          subjected to any consideration of personal liability for his conduct 
          of the case. (Indeed, a general non-liability in negligence of the Crown 
          Prosecution Service has been upheld by the Court of Appeal on policy 
          grounds: <i>Elguzouli-Daf v. Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis</i> 
          [1995] QB 335.) If he has to revisit what occurred at the trial, it 
          will be solely to provide further assistance to an appellate court or 
          other similarly placed body. The defending advocate will normally conduct 
          any appeal from a conviction (or sentence). He will do so in the same 
          interest as before, the interests of justice. If some question arises 
          about his conduct of the trial, this will probably make it inappropriate 
          that he represent, or continue to represent, the defendant on the appeal. 
          But he will remain under a duty to assist the Court of Appeal. Normally 
          the defendant will waive his privilege and a full and frank written 
          account of what occurred and the reasons for it will be given by the 
          advocate to the Court of Appeal. It will readily be appreciated that 
          to introduce into this scheme of criminal justice a principle that the 
          defendant should be free to sue his advocate for damages in negligence 
          will significantly alter the relationships involved and make more, not 
          less, difficult the achievement of justice within the criminal justice 
          system which is its purpose and is also the public interest.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, I make no apology for emphasising 
          the position on criminal appeals: the reason why the question of immunity 
          arises is because of the argument that a defendant who has been the 
          victim of a miscarriage of justice should have a remedy. On any view 
          the primary remedy must be the criminal appeal. Therefore the primary 
          inquiry must be how the abrogation of the immunity would affect the 
          effectiveness of the Court of Appeal in rectifying such miscarriages. 
          If its existence facilitates such rectification, that is a very strong 
          argument indeed in justification of the immunity. (Contrast the position 
          in the civil justice system where the position is the reverse.) To displace 
          this justification needs some significant counter-argument. However, 
          the evaluation of the other available arguments support rather than 
          undermine the justification for the immunity.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legitimate interest of the citizen charged 
          with a criminal offence is that he should have a fair trial and only 
          be convicted if his guilt has been proved. It is not an economic interest. 
          His interest like his potential liability under the criminal law stems 
          from his membership of the society to which he belongs - his citizenship. 
          If the charge against him has not been proved, he should be acquitted. 
          If he has been wrongly convicted, his appeal against conviction should 
          be allowed. If he has been wrongly or excessively sentenced, his punishment 
          should be remitted or reduced. His only remedy lies within the criminal 
          justice system. This is appropriate. The civil courts do not have any 
          part to play in such matters. The relevance of what the advocate does 
          during the criminal trial is to the issues at that trial, not the remoter 
          economic consequences of the outcome of that trial.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any involvement of the citizen in the criminal 
          justice system may have adverse consequences. There are adverse consequences 
          for witnesses which they in the public interest have to accept. There 
          are certainly adverse consequences for those suspected of or charged 
          with criminal offences. They may be held in custody. They normally have 
          to attend their trial. They may be arrested and subjected to interviews 
          or searches or tests which would otherwise be an infringement of their 
          civil liberties. They may be acquitted after a long and traumatic trial. 
          They may be convicted but have their conviction overturned on appeal. 
          Thus they will to a greater or lesser extent suffer disadvantage and 
          loss including loss of liberty and reputation.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided that the relevant persons have acted 
          in good faith, the citizen has to accept this as part of the price he 
          pays for living in the community and enjoying the protection of the 
          criminal law. A defendant who is detained in custody but acquitted at 
          his trial receives no compensation for his loss of liberty or for having 
          had serious allegations made against him. The same applies if he is 
          convicted and sentenced at his trial but has his conviction quashed 
          on appeal. He too receives no compensation. Those who have paid for 
          their own defence have no assurance that they will necessarily be awarded 
          costs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An unsafe or wrong conviction may have occurred 
          for any of a number of reasons. Someone may be to blame or there may 
          have been no fault on anybody's part. It may arise from something that 
          happened at the trial, <i>eg</i> erroneous expert evidence, or outside 
          court, eg undiscovered evidence. There may have been some defect in 
          the conduct of the trial like the failure of the judge or counsel to 
          anticipate a restatement of the law by an appellate court. There is 
          no need to proliferate examples; the diverse and various possibilities 
          will be well within the experience of any one actively engaged in the 
          criminal justice system. It will also be readily appreciated that some 
          of these factors may be apparent at the conclusion of the trial; others 
          may only come to light much later.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The payment of monetary compensation is something 
          upon which Parliament has spoken. The statutory policy is set out in 
          s. 133 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 (as amended) . This provides, 
          under the heading "Compensation for miscarriages of justice":</p>
        <p>"(1) Subject to subsection (2) below, when a person has been convicted 
          of a criminal offence and when subsequently his conviction has been 
          reversed or he has been pardoned on the ground that a new or newly discovered 
          fact shows beyond reasonable doubt that there has been a miscarriage 
          of justice, the Secretary of State shall pay compensation for the miscarriage 
          of justice to the person who has suffered punishment as a result of 
          such conviction or, if he is dead, to his personal representatives, 
          unless the non-disclosure of the unknown fact was wholly or partly attributable 
          to the person convicted.</p>
        <p>(2) No payment of compensation under this section shall be made unless 
          an application for such compensation has been made to the Secretary 
          of State.</p>
        <p>(3) The question whether there is a right to compensation under this 
          section shall be determined by the Secretary of State.</p>
        <p>(4) If the Secretary of State determines that there is a right to such 
          compensation, the amount of the compensation shall be assessed by an 
          assessor appointed by the Secretary of State.</p>
        <p>(4A) In assessing so much of any compensation payable under this section 
          to or in respect of a person as is attributable to suffering, harm to 
          reputation or similar damage, the assessor shall have regard in particular 
          to— </p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>(a) the seriousness of the offence of which the person was convicted 
            and the severity of the punishment resulting from the conviction;</p>
          <p>(b) the conduct of the investigation and prosecution of the offence; 
            and</p>
          <p>(c) any other convictions of the person and any punishment resulting 
            from them.</p>
          <p>(5) In this section 'reversed' shall be construed as referring to 
            a conviction having been quashed—</p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p>(a) on an appeal out of time; or </p>
            <p>(b) on a reference— </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>(i) under the Criminal Appeal Act 1995; or </p>
              <p>(ii) . . .</p>
            </blockquote>
          </blockquote>
          <p> (6) For the purposes of this section a person suffers punishment 
            as a result of a conviction when sentence is passed on him for the 
            offence of which he was convicted." </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statute distinguishes between those factors 
          which come to light in time to be considered on a normal first appeal 
          to the Court of Appeal (no compensation) and those which only come to 
          light later (potential compensation). Similarly it distinguishes between 
          new (or newly discovered) facts and errors of law or other non-factual 
          matters. There is a statutory policy, reflected also in the way in which 
          the Home Secretary exercises his discretion, which strikes a balance 
          between those encounters with the criminal justice system which the 
          state should compensate and those which it should not. The discretionary 
          element is similar to that contained in the criminal injuries compensation 
          scheme. Those who have encounters with criminal activity are not all 
          equally meritorious. The policy of the Legislature (and Executive) is 
          not to provide indiscriminate compensation for erroneous convictions. 
          To do so would be unacceptable in a liberal democratic society. My Lords, 
          we should respect that assessment of the public interest and the needs 
          of our society.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide a tort based liability to pay compensation 
          in respect of the role of only one of the participants in the criminal 
          justice system would not only destroy this balance but also produce 
          a capricious distribution of compensation between ultimately acquitted 
          defendants. If a defendant could say that <i>a</i> (I stress, <i>a</i>) 
          cause of his conviction was the fault of his advocate, he would recover 
          full civil damages; if it was the fault of anyone else involved in the 
          trial, he could not recover anything unless he came within the scope 
          of s. 133. From the defendant's point of view, it would be an arbitrary 
          lottery and produce anomalies between one defendant and another. As 
          a matter of statutory policy, it would provide a route by which the 
          statutory limitations and safeguards built into s. 133 could be avoided. 
          From the point of view of the administration of justice it would expose 
          the professional advocate to a risk of litigation which would handicap 
          him in performing his duty under the criminal justice system and disinterestedly 
          assisting, particularly at the appellate level, in the correction of 
          errors and remedying miscarriages of justice. To argue for a higher 
          need for a supposed redistributive justice to enable the defendant to 
          recover civil damages from his advocate, begs the question where the 
          greater justice lies in relation to criminal litigation as well as the 
          question whether such a need is indeed higher than the need to facilitate 
          as far as possible the rectification of miscarriages of justice within 
          the criminal justice system. </p>
        <i> Conclusion</i>: 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, there are essential differences 
          between the civil and criminal justice systems. In the civil justice 
          system, the nature of the advocate's role in the whole process, the 
          nature of the subject matter, the legitimate interest of the client, 
          the appropriateness of the tort remedy and the absence of clear or sufficient 
          justification all militate against the recognition of an advocate immunity. 
          It is not necessary: in certain respects it is counterproductive.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the criminal justice system, the position 
          is the reverse of this. The advocate's role, the purpose of the criminal 
          process, the legitimate interest of the client, the inappropriateness 
          of the tort remedy, the fact that it would handicap the achievement 
          of justice, the fact that it would create anomalies and conflict with 
          the statutory policy for the payment of compensation for miscarriages 
          of justice, all demonstrate the justification for the immunity in the 
          public interest and, indeed, the interests of defendants as a class.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To put it at its lowest, strong arguments exist 
          for making a distinction between the civil and criminal justice systems 
          and the respective need for advocate immunity within them. Because these 
          appeals did not raise this question it was not specifically examined 
          either orally or in written submissions before your Lordships or before 
          any lower court. In my judgment there would be significant consequences 
          of what would be a radically new approach to the administration of criminal 
          justice and (without prejudging the outcome) these potential consequences 
          call for a focused evaluation with the assistance of judgments of lower 
          courts. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the consequences of the limited issues 
          raised by these appeals has been that your Lordships have not heard 
          argument upon the definition of what would be the scope of some limited 
          immunity applying to criminal advocacy only. The questions of definition 
          are certainly not of the same order as the problems which would exist 
          for the civil advocacy immunity. It is clear that the same difficulties 
          of delimitation do not exist in the criminal justice system as in the 
          civil justice system. The distinction between civil and criminal proceedings 
          is already well established and used but a view would have to be taken 
          about judicial review proceedings relating to the criminal courts. As 
          regards what comes under the heading of advocacy, there is a clear point 
          of focus being the trial at which the guilt of the defendant is sought 
          to be established. There are existing authorities (<i>eg Somasundaram 
          v. M. Julius Melchior &amp; Co.</i> [1988] 1 WLR 1394 and <i> Acton v. Graham 
          Pearce &amp; Co.</i> [1997] 3 AER 909) which consider the scope of the immunity 
          in the criminal justice system. Unlike in the civil system, the questions 
          of delimitation are not such as to provide a reason for rejecting the 
          immunity in the criminal system. But it is right that any necessary 
          refinement and redefinition, whether by your Lordships or the Court 
          of Appeal, should only result from a properly informed and considered 
          argument directed to those points. The hearing of the present appeals 
          has not been such an occasion.</p>
        <i> The Hunter 'Solution'</i>: 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I should refer to the suggestion that 
          the <i>Hunter</i> principle (<i>sic</i>) provides an adequate answer 
          to any problem arising from the absence of an immunity in relation to 
          criminal advocacy and therefore renders the immunity unnecessary and 
          disproportionate. As I have explained already the <i>Hunter</i> argument 
          does not address the relevant question or relate to the justification 
          for the immunity in the criminal justice system. It is simply irrelevant 
          and fails to understand the justification for the immunity. The immunity 
          exists and should be maintained because it serves the public interest 
          by making a significant contribution to the working of the criminal 
          justice system and not because it provides protection to lawyers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suggestion has been developed into the 
          formulation of a rule that would be a novel rule of public policy: that 
          no civil action in negligence for breach of professional duty can be 
          brought against an advocate in respect of the conviction of his client 
          unless the conviction had first been set aside by an appellate court. 
          That this would be a novel rule cannot be disputed. It would create 
          an anomalous judge-made bar to a negligence action which does not at 
          present exist. The relevant concepts for the law of negligence are causation 
          foreseeability and mitigation. It would need to be assimilated with 
          the statutory law governing the limitation of actions in a way that 
          it is probable that only Parliament should carry out (with or without 
          the assistance of the Law Commission). </p>
        <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunter</i> was a wholly exceptional case 
          which had nothing to do with advocate liability. In <i>Hunter</i> there 
          was an abuse of the civil process by using it for the improper purpose 
          of mounting a collateral attack on an adverse criminal decision. But 
          a client suing his lawyer would argue that it was proper for him use 
          the civil process for the purpose of recovering compensation from his 
          lawyer for breach of duty; indeed that is the only way in which he could 
          enforce the civil obligation to pay such compensation under the law 
          of tort. Provided that the action was not wholly without merit and was 
          <i>bona fide</i> brought for the stated purpose and there was no immunity 
          upon which the lawyer was entitled to rely, the lawyer would have difficulty 
          in sustaining an argument that the action was an abuse of process. To 
          challenge in later litigation an earlier non-binding decision between 
          different parties is not in itself abusive, provided there are grounds 
          for doing so. So far as questions of law are concerned, the doctrine 
          of precedent contemplates this. So far as questions of fact are concerned, 
          each court has to try and decide questions of fact upon the evidence 
          adduced before it. Judicial comity and common sense take care of most 
          of these situations in practice but the law does tolerate the possibility 
          of apparently inconsistent decisions. The element of vexation is an 
          aspect of abuse, the use of litigation for an improper purpose, trying 
          to have repeated bites at the same cherry. The objectionable element 
          is not the risk of inconsistency.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suggested new rule would give a status 
          in the civil law to a criminal conviction which at present it does not 
          have. Under the rule in <i>Hollington v. F. Hewthorn &amp; Co. Ltd.</i> 
          [1943] KB 587, the decision of a criminal court was not evidence of 
          the truth of the facts upon which it was based. This principle applied 
          to any decision of another court or tribunal which did not come within 
          the principles of <i>res judicata</i> as between the parties to the 
          later action. Parliament modified this rule in relation to criminal 
          convictions but it has not gone to the length proposed by the suggested 
          new rule. Under section 11 of the Civil Evidence Act 1968 the person 
          concerned is only to "be taken to have committed that offence [of which 
          he was convicted] unless the contrary is proved". In other words, the 
          conviction is not conclusive: <i>cf</i> section 13 relating to defamation 
          actions. The relevant person (or anyone else with an interest in doing 
          so) is at liberty to prove that he did not commit the crime of which 
          he was convicted. The suggested new rule would have, either expressly 
          or by implication, to contradict this provision. If the existing law 
          is to be changed in this way, it would again be a matter for Parliament 
          and the Law Commission.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>Hunter</i> 'solution' is not a solution 
          and provides no argument for not continuing to recognise the existing 
          advocate immunity in the criminal justice system. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, my Lords, I would dismiss the 
          appeals. The claims disclose causes of action against the appellants. 
          The appellants are not entitled to an immunity in respect of the claims 
          made against them in these actions.</p>
        <p><b>LORD MILLETT</b></p>
        <p>My Lords,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the advantage of reading in draft 
          the speeches of my noble and learned friends Lord Steyn and Lord Hoffmann, 
          with which I am in full agreement.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that all your Lordships would 
          abolish the advocate's immunity in civil proceedings, but that some 
          of you would retain it in criminal cases. I readily acknowledge that 
          the case for abolition is stronger in civil litigation, and given my 
          lack of experience of the criminal justice system I have given anxious 
          consideration to the views of those of your Lordships who would retain 
          the immunity in criminal proceedings. I have, however, come to the conclusion 
          that such a partial retention of the immunity should not be supported.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My reasons for this conclusion are twofold. 
          In the first place, I think that to make the existence of the immunity 
          depend on whether the proceedings in question are civil or criminal 
          would be to draw the line in the wrong place. There is a wide variety 
          of cases tried before the magistrates which are for all practical purposes 
          civil in character, and in which the retention of the immunity would 
          be anomalous, but which are commenced by information or summons and 
          which are classified as criminal proceedings. Conversely disciplinary 
          proceedings before professional bodies are classified as civil proceedings 
          but are criminal or quasi-criminal in character. Here the abolition 
          of the immunity would be anomalous but its retention difficult to justify.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second place, even if the immunity were 
          retained only in criminal cases tried on indictment, in which the liberty 
          of the subject is at stake (and which is probably the kind of case your 
          Lordships primarily have in mind), it is difficult to believe that the 
          distinction would commend itself to the public. It would mean that a 
          party would have a remedy if the incompetence of his counsel deprived 
          him of compensation for (say) breach of contract or unfair dismissal, 
          but not if it led to his imprisonment for a crime he did not commit 
          and the consequent and uncompensated loss of his job. I think that the 
          public would at best regard such a result as incomprehensible and at 
          worst greet it with derision. The more thoughtful members of the public 
          might well consider that we had got it the wrong way round.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These considerations persuade me that we ought 
          not to retain the immunity in criminal proceedings in the absence of 
          compelling reasons to do so. I acknowledge that there is a particularly 
          high public interest in the efficient administration of criminal justice, 
          that the need to ensure that the accused has a fair trial makes it difficult 
          for the judge to intervene, and that both judge and defence counsel 
          are likely to err on the side of caution. But that is the position today, 
          despite the existence of the immunity. I have some scepticism in accepting 
          the proposition that its removal will make matters significantly worse, 
          and I observe that two of your Lordships with experience of criminal 
          trials do not think that it will.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion the defending advocate in a criminal 
          trial will retain formidable safeguards against vexatious attack even 
          if he no longer enjoys a formal immunity from suit. His former client 
          will not be allowed to challenge the correctness of the conviction unless 
          and until it is set aside, and a claim which does not challenge the 
          correctness of the conviction, like that in <i>Rondel v. Worsley</i> 
          [1969] 1 A.C. 191 itself, should normally be struck out as an abuse 
          of the process of the court. The withdrawal of legal aid combined with 
          the new powers of the court to strike out hopeless claims even though 
          they plead a good cause of action should make the great majority of 
          unmeritorious claims still-born. But if the immunity from suit is retained 
          for the moment in criminal cases alone, then sooner or later a case 
          is bound to arise in which the House will be called on to reconsider 
          the question. It will be a bad case involving a clear miscarriage of 
          justice, for otherwise the immunity will not be engaged. It will be 
          a case in which the accused was plainly innocent but was wrongly convicted 
          and served a term of imprisonment as a result of the gross incompetence 
          of his counsel. The conviction will have been quashed on appeal, perhaps 
          accompanied by severe criticism from the court of the conduct of the 
          counsel who was responsible. And by the time the civil claim reaches 
          the House, the public will have become accustomed to read of cases where 
          advocates have been successfully sued for incompetence in the course 
          of civil proceedings even though far less than their client's liberty 
          was at stake. Moreover, the Human Rights Act 1998 will be in force, 
          and the House will have to reconsider the question in terms of article 
          6 of the European Convention of Human Rights.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would grasp the nettle now. I believe that 
          the general public would find the proposed distinction indefensible. 
          In the absence of compelling reasons to support it based on more than 
          instinct or intuition, of which I can find none, I find it hard to disagree. 
          I also think that it is difficult to defend a blanket professional immunity 
          in terms of the European Convention on Human Rights. I would dismiss 
          these appeals and declare that the advocate has no immunity from suit 
          in relation to his conduct of proceedings whether civil or criminal.</p>
