<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;134.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sections 2 and 3 of the 1897 Act provided for the claims of preferential creditors to rank ahead of those secured by a floating charge.  In doing so it referred to a "floating charge" without providing any statutory definition of that expression.  Parliament evidently regarded the concept of a floating charge as sufficiently certain in meaning as not to require definition.  Parliament took the same course when registration of floating charges was introduced in 1900, and in all later relevant statutes.  The lack of a statutory definition, and the difficulties of providing a clear and comprehensive definition, were discussed by the Court of Appeal in <i>In re Yorkshire Woolcombers Association Ltd</i> [1903]  2 Ch 284 (especially a much-cited passage in the judgment of Romer LJ at p295) and by this House on appeal in the same case under the name of <i>Illingworth v Houldsworth</i> [1904]  AC 55. </p>
<i><p><i></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i>Upgrading the security to a fixed charge</i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;135.&nbsp;&nbsp;These difficulties have not diminished over the years.  Sections 2 and 3 of the 1897 Act (now re-enacted, with a refinement as to timing, as sections 175 (2) (b) and 40 (2) respectively of the Insolvency Act 1986) make a floating charge more precarious as a security.  Banks and other large commercial lenders have therefore tried, for understandable reasons, to upgrade their security by imposing fixed (and not merely floating) charges on parts of a trading customer's circulating capital, especially book debts.  This chapter of commercial history has been described by Professor Sir Roy Goode QC, <i>Legal Problems of Credit and Security</i>, 3rd ed. (2003) pp121-123.  In practice, most standard forms of debenture make the charge extend not just to book debts but to all present and future "book debts and other debts", the extent of which expression was considered by Hoffmann J in <i>In re Brightlife Ltd</i> [1987]  Ch 200, 204-5; but nothing turns on that in this appeal.  In considering the practical effect of charges on debts it should be borne in mind that money paid into a trading company's bank account will not necessarily represent the proceeds of debts of any description, especially if the trader is a retailer making a large number of cash sales, either over the counter or on a "cash with order" basis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;136.&nbsp;&nbsp;Banks and their advisers have had some success in their efforts to upgrade their security.  It is quite clear that a fixed charge on book debts, present and future, is conceptually possible.  That was the most important point decided (or at any rate confirmed) by Slade J in <i>Siebe Gorman &amp; Co Ltd v Barclays Bank Ltd </i>[1979]  2 Lloyd's Rep 142, and the Crown, the appellant in this appeal, does not seek to cast any doubt on that general proposition.  The Crown challenges the decision on a much narrower point, that is the correct construction of the particular form of debenture which was before the Court.  But that narrow point is itself of considerable general importance because the <i>Siebe Gorman</i> form has become a precedent and has been widely used, either in precisely the same words or in very similar words, by numerous banks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;137.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Siebe Gorman</i>, Slade J decided that the form of debenture before him did on its true construction restrict the borrower, R H McDonald Ltd ("McDonald") in making use of the proceeds of collected debts in the ordinary course of its business.  Slade J clearly accepted that, in the absence of such a restriction, the charge on debts could not as a matter of law have been more than a floating charge, even though the parties described it as a fixed (or specific) charge.  He said at p 158,</p>
<p></p><ul>"if I had accepted the premise that [McDonald] would have had the unrestricted right to deal with the proceeds of any of the relevant book debts paid into its account, so long as that account remained in credit, I would have been inclined to accept the conclusion that the charge on such book debts could be no more than a floating charge."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Crown has little quarrel with that, except perhaps for the adjective "unrestricted."</p>
<i><p><i>The essential difference</i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;138.&nbsp;&nbsp;This passage brings us close to the issue of legal principle, that is the essential difference between a fixed charge and a floating charge.  Under a fixed charge the assets charged as security are permanently appropriated to the payment of the sum charged, in such a way as to give the chargee a proprietary interest in the assets.  So long as the charge remains unredeemed, the assets can be released from the charge only with the active concurrence of the chargee.  The chargee may have good commercial reasons for agreeing to a partial release.  If for instance a bank has a fixed charge over a large area of land which is being developed in phases as a housing estate (another example of a fixed charge on what might be regarded as trading stock) it might be short-sighted of the bank not to agree to take only a fraction of the proceeds of sale of houses in the first phase, so enabling the remainder of the development to be funded.  But under a fixed charge that will be a matter for the chargee to decide for itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;139.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under a floating charge, by contrast, the chargee does not have the same power to control the security for its own benefit.  The chargee has a proprietary interest, but its interest is in a <i>fund </i> of circulating capital, and unless and until the chargee intervenes (on crystallisation of the charge) it is for the trader, and not the bank, to decide how to run its business.  There is a detailed and helpful analysis of the matter, with full citation of authority, in Professor Sarah <i>Worthington's Proprietary Interests in Commercial Transactions</i> (1996) pp 74-77; see also her incisive comment on this case ("An Unsatisfactory Area of the Law—Fixed and Floating Charges Yet Again") in (2004) 1 International Corporate Rescue 175.  So long as the company trades in the ordinary way (a requirement emphasised by Romer L J in the <i>Yorkshire Woolcombers</i> case [1903] Ch 284, 295, and by the Earl of Halsbury on appeal in the same case, [1904] AC 355, 357-8) the constituents of the charged fund are in a state of flux (or circulation).  Trading stock is sold and becomes represented by book debts; these are collected and paid into the bank; the trader's overdraft facility enables it to draw cheques in favour of its suppliers to pay for new stock; and so the trading cycle continues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;140.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have drawn attention to Slade J's reference to an "unrestricted" right to deal with the proceeds of collected debts. It is clear that not every restriction on a trader's freedom of action is a badge of a fixed charge: see <i>Brightlife</i> [1987] Ch 200, 209.  A prohibition on factoring or otherwise dealing with uncollected debts does not prevent the trader from collecting the debts itself.  But if the terms of the debenture were such as to require the  trader to pay all its collected debts into the bank and to prohibit the trader from drawing on the account (so that the account is blocked), a charge on debts, described as a fixed or specific charge, would indeed take effect as such (see <i>Re Keenan Brothers Ltd</i> [1986]  BCLC 242, a decision of the Supreme Court of Ireland, followed by Morritt J in <i>William Gaskell Group Ltd v Highley</i> [1994]  1 BCLC 197).  In those circumstances the chargee would be in control, prior to crystallisation, and the trader would be unable to trade in the ordinary way without the chargee's positive concurrence.  In <i>Agnew, </i>Lord Millett pointed out ([2001] 2 AC 710, 730, para 48) that it was not enough to provide in the debenture for an account to be blocked, if it was not in fact operated as a blocked account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;141.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both sides agree that the label of "fixed" or "specific" (which I take to be synonymous in this context) cannot be decisive if the rights created by the debenture, properly construed, are inconsistent with that label.  There is a fairly close parallel (first drawn, I think, by Hoffmann J in <i>Brightlife</i> [1987] Ch 200, 209 and often repeated) with the important distinction, in land law, between a lease and a licence: see the decision of this House in <i>Street v Mountford</i> [1985] AC 809.  The distinction is clear in principle although landlords (in framing letting agreements) and banks (in framing debentures) may produce legal documents in a form which makes the principle difficult to apply.  Whether or not it is appropriate to describe this by some disparaging term such as camouflage, it is the court's duty to characterise the document according to the true legal effect of its terms, as has been very clearly explained by Lord Millett in <i>Agnew</i> [2001]  2 AC 710, 725-726, para 32.  In each case there is a public interest which overrides unrestrained freedom of contract.  On the lease/licence issue, the public interest is the protection of vulnerable people seeking living accommodation.  On the fixed/floating issue, it is ensuring that preferential creditors obtain the measure of protection which Parliament intended them to have.  This public interest is unaffected by the changes in the classes of preferential creditors made by section 251 of the Enterprise Act 2002.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;142.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion Slade J did not, in <i>Siebe Gorman</i>, make any significant error in stating the general principles which apply.  But he did not correctly construe the debenture which was before him in that case, and his decision on its construction has had surprisingly far-reaching consequences.</p>
<i><p><i>Siebe Gorman &amp; Co Ltd v Barclays Bank Ltd</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;143.&nbsp;&nbsp;In his submissions on <i>Siebe Gorman</i>, Mr Moss QC mentioned that the judgment of Slade J was given after an eight-day trial.  So it was, but that fact cannot by itself add weight to its authority.  Only two pages of a 25 page judgment are directly concerned with whether the charge on McDonald's debts, although expressed in the debenture as a fixed charge, amounted in law to a floating charge.  Slade J also had to resolve many disputed issues of fact, which were complicated by the death, before trial, of a key witness.  He had to consider issues of estoppel and rectification (though he did not ultimately have to decide those issues.)  He did have to decide a difficult issue as to priority of charges (and his judgment on that issue may be the main reason why the judgment was reported).  Of the 17 authorities cited, only three appear to have been cited on the issue of characterisation of the charge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;144.&nbsp;&nbsp;The key passage in the judgment of Slade J, at pp158-159, is set out in full in the judgment of the Master of the Rolls in this case, [2004] Ch 337, 376, para 72.  I have already quoted part of it, with which the Crown has little or no quarrel.  The crucial passage which the Crown does criticise is as follows (at p159):</p>
<p></p><ul>"I see no reason why the court should not give effect to the intention of the parties, as stated in clause 3 (d), that the charge should be a first fixed charge on book debts.  I do not accept the argument that the provisions of clause 5 (c) negative the existence of a specific charge.  All that they do, in my judgment, is to reinforce the specific charge given by clause 3.  The mere fact that there may exist certain forms of dealing with book debts which are not specifically prohibited by clause 5 (c) does not in my judgment turn the specific charge into a floating charge.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>This conclusion that the charge is a specific charge involves the further conclusion that, during the continuance of the security, the bank would have the right, if it chose, to assert its lien under the charge on the proceeds of the book debts, even at a time when the particular account into which they were paid was temporarily in credit."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;145.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Briggs QC, for the Crown, submitted that Slade J was wrong about the significance of clause 5 (c) of the debenture, which provided that during the continuance of the security McDonald</p>
<p></p><ul>"shall pay into the company's account with the bank all monies which it may receive in respect of the book debts and other debts hereby charged and shall not without the prior consent of the bank in writing, purport to charge or assign the same in favour of any other person and shall if called upon to do so by the bank execute a legal assignment of such book debts and other debts to the bank."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge saw this as reinforcing the specific charge given by clause 3 (that is, the "label").  Its real significance, in my opinion, was that it did not in any way restrict McDonald from taking the most natural course for a trader in the ordinary way of business, that is collecting the debts and paying them into its current account with the chargee bank. I agree with the criticism by Alan Berg, "Charges over Book Debts: a Reply" [1995] JBL 433, 445 that the judge's construction was based too much on linguistic considerations, in isolation from the matrix of facts in which the security was created.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;146.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the debenture was granted, McDonald had a single current account which was overdrawn at the outset, with an overdraft limit (see [1979] 2 Lloyd's Rep 142, 146-7 summarised in paras 62 and 63 of the judgment of the Master of the Rolls).  It is the proper characterisation of a charge at the time of its creation that is important, and the various manoeuvres which took place in the last few weeks before McDonald's final collapse (summarised in paras 65-69 of the Master of the Rolls' judgment) cannot be relevant to the issue of characterisation.  For at least a year after the grant of the debenture, McDonald was free to use its overdraft facility to recycle its book debts in the ordinary course of its business.  Slade J seems, with great respect, to have overlooked that that was the crucial point.  The bank could decide to intervene and alter the banker-customer relationship.  Indeed it did so by blocking McDonald's account about seven weeks before it learned of the winding-up petition.  But under the charges as created there was no such restriction, either in clause 5 (c) or elsewhere.  The last sentence of the criticised passage which I have set out above (beginning "This conclusion that the charge is a specific charge involves the further conclusion that . . .") was not, as its language makes perfectly clear, reinforcing the first conclusion with a second line of reasoning.  It was drawing a further (incorrect) conclusion from the first (incorrect) conclusion.</p>
<i><p><i></i></p>
</i><p><i><i>Later authority</i></i></p>
<i>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;147.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the Vice-Chancellor ([2004] Ch 337, 355, para 39) I feel the greatest hesitation and reluctance in disagreeing with a decision of Slade J.  Indeed, the very high respect in which his judgments have always been held must have contributed to the enduring influence which <i>Siebe Gorman</i> has had.  In their printed case Mr Moss and Mr Goldring assert that <i>Siebe Gorman</i> has been approved or accepted in many subsequent cases, and in England has not (until the Vice-Chancellor's decision) been held to be wrongly decided, or regarded as limited to its own facts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;148.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is very largely correct, although I do detect some inclination on the part of experienced Chancery judges to treat the decision as turning on a particular (and not fully explained) point of construction.  That is my reading of Hoffmann J's observations in <i>Brightlife</i> [1987]  Ch 200, 210 and of Lord Millett's observations in <i>Agnew</i> [2001] 2 AC 710, 727, para 38.  In <i>In re Portbase Clothing Ltd</i> [1993]  Ch 388, 396, Chadwick J made clear that he did not have to consider, and was not considering, whether <i>Siebe Gorman</i> was rightly decided.  In the only English case in which <i>Siebe Gorman</i> was directly challenged, <i>In re A Company (No. 005009 of 1987) Ex p Copp</i> [1989] BCLC 13, the grounds of challenge were curiously oblique, no doubt in recognition of the fact that a first-instance Chancery judge would be very inclined to follow Slade J (as Knox J did) unless some point of distinction could be established.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;149.&nbsp;&nbsp;In New Zealand <i>Siebe Gorman</i> has not been followed at first instance (the Court of Appeal of New Zealand found it unnecessary to decide this point): <i>Hoverd Industries Ltd v Supercool Refrigeration &amp; Air Conditioning (1991) Ltd</i>  [1994] 3 NZLR 300; [1995] 3 NZLR 577.  In relation to a debenture in the <i>Siebe Gorman</i> form Tompkins J stated ([1994] 3 NZLR 300, 321):</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is my conclusion that a requirement to pay the proceeds of the book debts into the company's account without any restriction on how the company may use those proceeds does not give effective possession of those proceeds to the bank.  It does not, without more, fasten the charge onto those proceeds.  Supercool was free to deal with those proceeds except in the two respects stated, unless and until the BNZ intervened in a manner that would effectively inhibit that freedom."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I consider that that would be a correct statement of the position under English law.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;150.&nbsp;&nbsp;A debenture in the <i>Siebe Gorman</i> form has also been considered by the Supreme Court of Ireland in <i>Re Holidair Ltd</i> [1994]  1 ILRM 481.  <i>Siebe Gorman</i> was not cited.  But the reasoning of Blaney J (with whom three other members of the court agreed) is compelling (at p493):</p>
<p></p><ul>"I am satisfied, accordingly, that the correct construction of the clause is that the trustee had a discretion to determine into what company account with what bank the proceeds of book debts should be paid from time to time.  But there is no restriction in the clause on the companies drawing the monies out of these accounts.  Accordingly, there is nothing in it to prevent the companies from using the proceeds of the book debts in the normal way for the purpose of carrying on their business.  By reason of this the charge has also the third characteristic referred to by Romer LJ in his judgment in the case of <i>In re Yorkshire Woolcombers' Association Ltd</i> and is accordingly a floating charge and not a fixed charge."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;151.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>In re New Bullas Trading Ltd</i> [1994]  1 BCLC 485, the Court of Appeal, differing from Knox J ([1993] BCLC 1389) upheld as a fixed charge a charge expressed as a fixed charge on book debts until they were collected, coupled with the requirement for them to be paid into a specified bank account (the chargee was not itself a bank) and a floating charge on the proceeds in the bank account.  This decision was not followed by the Court of Appeal of New Zealand in <i>Commissioner of Income Tax v Agnew</i> [2001]  1 NZLR 223 (the headnote is mistaken in referring to the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>New Bullas</i> as having been adopted; it was either distinguished or left in the air).  <i>Agnew</i> then came on appeal to the Privy Council [2001] 2 AC 710, which upheld the Court of Appeal of New Zealand and in doing so strongly disapproved of <i>New Bullas</i>.  Mr Moss has not sought to defend <i>New Bullas</i> and it may not be strictly necessary for your Lordships to express any view about it.  But for my part I am sure that the Privy Council was correct in <i>Agnew,</i> and this House has already gone some way to approving <i>Agnew</i> in <i>Smith (Administrator of Cosslett (Contractors) Ltd) v Bridgend County Borough Council</i> [2002] 1 AC 336, 352.  The essential fallacy in <i>New Bullas</i> has been explained by Professor Worthington in a note, "Fixed Charges Over Book Debts and Other Receivables" (1997) 113 LQR 562:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The categorisation of a charge over receivables requires examination of the permitted dealings with collected proceeds <i>only</i> in order to clarify whether the chargor is free to deal with the charged asset itself (the receivable) in the ordinary course of business without the consent of the chargee.  This, and nothing else, is the hallmark of a floating charge."<p></p></ul>
<i></i><p><i><i>The judgments below </i></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;152.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having covered most of the ground already I can set out quite shortly my views on the judgments of Sir Andrew Morritt V-C and the Court of Appeal [2004] Ch 337.  The Vice-Chancellor held that <i>Siebe Gorman</i> was indistinguishable but wrongly decided.  The Court of Appeal (Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers MR, Jonathan Parker and Jacobs LJJ) reversed the Vice-Chancellor in a single judgment of the Master of the Rolls with which the other members of the court agreed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;153.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my respectful opinion the Vice-Chancellor was correct on every point in his judgment except one, which does not present any obstacle to your Lordships (that is as to the relative authority as precedents of <i>New Bullas</i> and <i>Agnew</i>).  On every point of substance I agree with the Vice-Chancellor's analysis and conclusions.  In particular, I agree with his reasons for holding that <i>Siebe Gorman</i> was not distinguishable (p 347, paras 15 and 16):</p>
<p></p><ul>"Counsel for the bank points out that the observations of Slade J were directed to an account which was in credit.  By contrast in this case the account was when opened and at all times thereafter in debit.  He submits that the payment of the proceeds of a book debt into an overdrawn bank account prevents its further identification or tracing through such debit balance so that it cannot be contended that the company thereby enjoyed an unrestricted use of that book debt or of those proceeds.  It is convenient to deal with this point at this stage.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>I do not think that any distinction is to be drawn for this purpose between the operation of an account which is in credit and the operation of one which is in debit but within the overdraft facilities agreed with the bank.  The question is not whether the subsequent drawings by the company can be traced to or identified as the proceeds of a previous book debt but whether the charge when created contemplated that the company should continue to trade and should until the occurrence of some specified future event be free to use in such trade the class of asset described as book debts."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vice-Chancellor then referred to the classic statements in the <i>Yorkshire Woolcombers</i> case [1903] 2 Ch 284, 289 and <i>Illingworth v Houldsworth </i>[1904] AC 355, 357-358.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;154.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree with the Vice-Chancellor's reasons for declining to follow <i>Siebe Gorman.</i>  He referred to the critical passage in Slade J's judgment (which I have already set out) and observed (p 355, para 39):</p>
<p></p><ul>"But, as indicated in <i>Agnew's</i> case, the real question was whether the rights and obligations conferred and imposed by clause 5(c) disclosed an intention that the company should be free to deal with the book debts and withdraw them from the security without the consent of the bank.  Such an approach to the provisions of clause 5 (c) of the debenture in the <i>Siebe Gorman</i> case must have led to the conclusion that the collection and free use of the proceeds of book debts through the ordinary operation of the bank account was not only permitted but envisaged.  The inevitable consequence would be to reject the description of the transaction as a first fixed charge."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;155.&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows that the Court of Appeal, although right on the doctrine of precedent, was in my view wrong to reverse the Vice-Chancellor on the issue of substance.  I respectfully think that the Master of the Rolls was wrong in the broad ground of decision which he put forward at p 383, para 94 of his judgment. It has the attraction of simplicity and certainty but it approaches an essentially practical question (can the trader continue to use his circulating capital, including any credit available under an agreed overdraft, in the ordinary course of his business?) as if it were a technical question of tracing in equity.  The Vice-Chancellor was right to reject that approach, as he did in the first passage which I have quoted from his judgment.  I also think that the Master of the Rolls was wrong on the narrower issue of construction which he considered a little earlier in his judgment (p 382, para 93).  I need not repeat my reasons for that conclusion.</p>
<i><p><i>Postcript: draftsmen's precedents and collateral transactions</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;156.&nbsp;&nbsp;Judges considering this area of the law have often commented on the convenience (in point of legal certainty) of using standard-form clauses, the meaning of which has already been determined by the court.  For instance Knox J observed in <i>Ex p Copp</i> [1989]  BCLC 13, 25: </p>
<p></p><ul>"this is a type of transaction in respect of which judicial precedent is a particularly valuable guide to the commercial adviser.  It is one of the main justifications for the doctrine of precedent that the adviser can, if he can rely on precedent, give reliable advice to his clients, and it is trite law that that is a particularly cogent consideration in regard to property transactions of one sort or another."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requirements for particulars of floating charges to be registered publicly, and for a company's register of debentures to be open for inspection, suggest that Parliament intended that the existence and scope of any floating charge should be ascertainable by the general public, at least in theory (doubts as to how the system works in practice were expressed by Lord Hoffmann in the <i>Cosslett</i> case, [2002]  1 AC 336, 347-8, para 19). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;157.&nbsp;&nbsp;These considerations might be thought to lead to the conclusion that everything relevant to the characterisation of a charge should be apparent on the face of the formal debenture, without further inquiry.  That was, as I understand it, one of the reasons why Knox J, in <i>Ex p Copp,</i> declined to look at evidence about an agreed overdraft limit, regarding it as a<i> </i>"collateral arrangement".  Knox J may have been right in his view that it was unnecessary to receive evidence about an overdraft limit (which may change from time to time) but he took the wrong approach as to the effect of the debenture itself, as the Vice-Chancellor rightly concluded ([2004] Ch 337, 355, para 40).  The form of debenture showed that the recycling of book debts was "not only permitted but envisaged" and it contained no relevant restriction on that being done in the ordinary course of business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;158.&nbsp;&nbsp;In practice banks use printed standard forms of debenture in simple cases, and City solicitors no doubt have more sophisticated forms, suitable for very large transactions, in their word-processing libraries.  It is most desirable that any form of secured debenture, whether simple or complicated, should contain all the terms necessary for its correct characterisation, without resort to any side-letters or other less formal documents (as in the Australian case of <i>Hart v Barnes</i> (1982)  7 ACLR 310, mentioned in <i>Agnew</i> at para 23).  But the fact is that when a bank takes a charge there will normally be at least three documents in play: the debenture creating the charge, the bank's facility letter offering a term loan or an overdraft, and the bank's general terms and conditions.  Sometimes there will be more documents that are relevant.  I would not rule out the possibility that in some (probably rare) cases all this documentation might have to be taken into account, in its proper commercial context, in determining whether a charge "as created" was a fixed or floating charge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;159.&nbsp;&nbsp;In one of the earliest cases on floating charges, <i>In re Florence Land and Public Works Co</i> (1878)  10 Ch D530, 537, Sir George Jessel MR said,</p>
<p></p><ul>"The question we have to decide must be decided, like all other questions of the kind, having regard to the surrounding circumstances under which the instrument was executed, and especially the respective positions of the parties who were the contracting parties, to carry out whose agreement that instrument was executed."<p></p></ul>
