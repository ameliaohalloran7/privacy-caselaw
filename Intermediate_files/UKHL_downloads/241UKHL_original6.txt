<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;166.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have the greatest admiration for the manner in which the judge applied himself to this most difficult case and this passage of his judgment covered an area of particular difficulty. The problem was that all the evidence had focussed on Mr Gregg's chances of surviving, disease free, for 10 years from the start of treatment. That, as I understand it, was why Professor Goldstone addressed himself to Mr Gregg's chances of surviving for five years from the date of trial, which itself started five years after the commencement of treatment. The judge's approach equated disease free survival after 10 years with survival for the rest of Mr Gregg's working life. While this may not have been realistic, I do not see that the judge had any data which would enable him to adopt a more realistic approach.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applying a loss of a chance approach to the facts of this case</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;167.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gregg suffered a series of adverse events beyond the initial development of his cancer:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i)&nbsp;&nbsp;The spread of the cancer to the pectoral region, accompanied by acute pain;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;High dose chemotherapy with harvesting of stem cells;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;Relapse when a tumour developed in the right axilla, accompanied by chemotherapy</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;Psychiatric distress on being told that this relapse meant that he would die</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v)&nbsp;&nbsp;A further suspected relapse with additional chemotherapy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He may also suffer a further adverse event: premature death within 10 years of the commencement of treatment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;168.&nbsp;&nbsp;The chance that the delay in commencing his treatment has caused each of these adverse events is not the same. The evidence did not, however, permit the judge to make nice differentiations. He simply addressed himself to assessing the chance that, if Mr Gregg had received prompt treatment, he would have avoided all these adverse events. He concluded that his chance of so doing had been reduced by 20% as a result of the delay in commencing his treatment. He thus equated Mr Gregg's lost chance of avoiding the adverse events prior to trial with his lost chance of avoiding premature death.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;169.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no longer possible to reach such a conclusion. The closer that Mr Gregg comes to being a survivor the smaller is the likelihood that the delay in commencing his treatment has had any effect on his expectation of life. At the same time, Professor Goldstone's model and his other evidence indicate that if Mr Gregg proves to be a survivor, the odds are high that he would have achieved complete and final remission if treated before his cancer had spread. On balance of probability I suspect that one is now in a position to conclude that the delay in commencing Mr Gregg's treatment has not affected his prospect of being a survivor but has caused him all the other adverse events which I have set out above. If his claim is to be assessed on the basis of a loss of a chance, some discount will have to be made for the small possibility that, even had he been treated promptly, he would have experienced the same adverse events and some small award may fall to be made for the loss of a chance of living 10 years, unless such an exercise is swept away as being "de minimis".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;170.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, these reflections on the present case demonstrate, so it seems to me, that the exercise of assessing the loss of a chance in clinical negligence cases is not an easy one. Deductions cannot safely be drawn from statistics without expert assistance. I am all too well aware that I have drawn a number of deductions from the evidence in this case without expert assistance and that these are at odds with those that have been drawn by others. Even if some of my deductions can be shown to be unsound, I hope that I have demonstrated that analysis of the evidence in this case is no easy task. In contrast, the task of determining the effect of Dr Scott's negligence on a balance of probabilities was very much easier. It is always likely to be much easier to resolve issues of causation on balance of probabilities than to identify in terms of percentage the effect that clinical negligence had on the chances of a favourable outcome. This reality is a policy factor that weighs against the introduction into this area of a right to compensation for the loss of a chance. A robust test which produces rough justice may be preferable to a test that on occasion will be difficult, if not impossible, to apply with confidence in practice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;171.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand it is hard to justify a test which results in substantial injustice simply on the ground that it is easier to apply. I have given careful consideration to the reasoning of my noble and learned friends Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead and Lord Hope of Craighead but I am not persuaded that the injustice that they identify is as cogent as they suggest or that it justifies the change to our law that Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead proposes. While Lord Hope of Craighead has endorsed Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead's conclusions he has added reasons of his own for allowing this appeal which I have difficulty in reconciling with Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead's approach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;172.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Fairchild v Glenhaven Funeral Services Ltd</i> [2003] 1 AC 32 this House made a change in the law of negligence in the interests of justice. The change benefits a workman who has contracted a mesothelioma after being exposed to asbestos fibres by a series of employers. An employer who has contributed 20% of that exposure and thus 20% to the employee's risk of contracting the disease will be liable <i>in full</i> to the employee, albeit that the chances are 5 to 1 that he is not in fact responsible for causing the disease. In this case Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead proposes a different approach in the case of a doctor whose negligence has decreased the chance that a patient will be cured of a disease. Under that proposal the doctor will be liable <i>to the extent</i> that his negligence has reduced the chance of a cure. My Lords it seems to me that there is a danger, if special tests of causation are developed piecemeal to deal with perceived injustices in particular factual situations, that the coherence of our common law will be destroyed.<i></i></p><i>
</i>
<i>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;173.&nbsp;&nbsp;In enquiring whether justice requires a change to our law, I propose to consider four different heads of claim that may be brought by a living claimant. These are:<i></i></p><i>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i)&nbsp;&nbsp;A claim that negligence has caused a discrete injury;<i></i></p><i>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;A claim that the injury so caused may, in the future, cause further injury;<i></i></p><i>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;A claim that the injury so caused has reduced the claimant's expectation of life;<i></i></p><i>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;A claim that negligence has reduced the prospect of cure of a fatal illness.<i></i></p><i>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall, in discussing these heads, refer to the facts of the present case for purposes of illustration.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A claim that negligence has caused a discrete injury</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;174.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under our law as it is at present, and subject to the exception in <i>Fairchild, </i>a claimant will only succeed if, on balance of probability the negligence is the cause of the injury. If there is a possibility, but not a probability, that the negligence caused the injury, the claimant will recover nothing in respect of the breach of duty: <i>Hotson v East Berkshire Health Authority </i>[1987] AC 750; <i>Wilsher v Essex Area Health Authority</i> [1988] AC 1074. There is an argument that justice would be better served if, in such a situation, damages were recoverable for the chance that the negligence may have caused the injury. Neither Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead nor Lord Hope of Craighead considers that in this case we should hold that those two decisions of this House are no longer good law. I agree. So to hold would have implications for the balance of probability test of causation in other areas of our law. That consideration could better be given by the Law Commission than this House and it certainly has not been given in the present case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;175.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I understand the speech of Lord Hope of Craighead, he would hold the normal rule applicable in the present case. His analysis is that, on balance of probability, Dr Scott's negligence caused the enlargement of Mr Gregg's cancer with consequent pain and suffering and that Mr Gregg is entitled to general damages for this head of damage in full. If so, I believe that he differs from Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, as I shall show when I come to consider the fourth head of claim.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A claim that injury caused by negligence may cause further injury</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;176.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is commonplace for an injury caused by negligence to carry with it the chance that it may lead to further injury, such as arthritis or epilepsy. The usual approach of the English court is to make a single award of damages which has regard to this chance of future injury. In some circumstances, however, it is more satisfactory for a claimant to recover damages in respect of injury actually sustained and to have the right to claim further damages if and when that injury is shown to have led to further injury. In such circumstances, the court can make an order for provisional damages - see section 32A of the Supreme Court Act 1981. The test of causation in relation to both the original injury and a subsequent injury alleged to be consequent upon the original injury is balance of probability.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A claim that injury caused by negligence has reduced the claimant's expectation of life</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;177.&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Lord Hope of Craighead that this case has been made peculiarly difficult to analyse by reason of the fact that, at least before this House, the only claim advanced has been a claim for loss of expectation of life. English law in relation to personal injury has yet to recognise a claim for the loss of a future prospect that is not consequent upon an established injury. It does, however, recognise that a claimant who has sustained such an injury can recover damages for loss of expectation of life, or "lost years".  Such a head of claim has been established by decisions of this House, and is something of an oddity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;178.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of us, if asked why we would not wish to die prematurely, would respond that we would not wish to be deprived of the pleasures of a full life including the enjoyment of the company of those we love. The law, however, gives only token compensation for such loss. What it does give is compensation for the earnings that the claimant will be unable to achieve once he is dead. There is a reason for this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;179.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 1(1) of the Fatal Accidents Act 1976, as amended, provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>If death is caused by any wrongful act, neglect or default which is such as would (if death had not ensued) have entitled the person injured to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof, the person who would have been liable if death had not ensued shall be liable to an action for damages, notwithstanding the death of the person injured.<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who can bring the action are the dependants of the deceased and the damages that they can claim represent the loss of the dependency. They have, of course, to prove that the death was caused by negligence on balance of probability. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;180.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Pickett v British Rail Engineering Ltd </i>[1980] AC 136 a claimant suffering from mesothelioma had brought a claim against his employers and won, but his claim for loss of earnings consequent upon his anticipated premature death was not allowed. He appealed and then died. His personal representatives pursued the appeal to this House. The House proceeded on the assumption that, because the claimant had brought a successful claim for his personal injury, a claim by his dependants under the Fatal Accidents Act was precluded, although Lord Salmon emphasised that he expressed no concluded opinion about the correctness of that assumption. In these circumstances the House held that damages could be recovered for loss of earnings in the claimant's lost years. Only in this way could provision be made for the loss to be suffered by the dependants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;181.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was soon recognised that this decision gave rise to problems where the heirs of the deceased were not his dependants - see <i>Gammell v Wilson </i>[1982] AC 27.  These problems were, to a degree, remedied by section 4 of the Administration of Justice Act 1982, which provided that the damages recoverable for the benefit of a deceased person in a survival action should not include "any damages for loss of income in respect of any period after that person's death". It remains the position, however, that a living claimant, who proves that he has been caused a personal injury by negligence, can include in the damages recovered compensation for lost earnings in the "lost years". </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;182.&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that this right is a poor substitute for the right of the claimant's dependants to make full recovery for loss of dependency if and when the claimant dies prematurely. It would be much better if the claimant had no right to recover for such loss of earnings and the dependants' right to claim under section 1(1) of the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 subsisted despite the claimant's recovery of damages for his injury. I am not persuaded that this result could not be achieved by a purposive construction of that section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;183.&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, so long as the dependants' rights under the Fatal Accidents Act only arise where death is proved, <i>on balance of probability</i>, to have resulted from negligence, I do not see that there is a strong case for changing the law so as to enable a claimant to recover for <i>loss of the chance</i> of achieving earnings in the lost years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;184.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like, now, to turn to the claim for lost years in the present case. <i>Pickett v British Rail Engineering </i>establishes that, where a claimant proves on balance of probability that an injury has been caused by negligence, and that such injury has shortened his life, he can recover damages in respect of the earnings lost in the "lost years". The lost years are calculated by comparing the age at which the claimant would have expected to die had he not been injured with the age at which he is expected to die in consequence of his injury. Statistics will normally be used to calculate the former and, save where death is imminent, the latter. The expected age at death will be the age to which the claimant will live on balance of probability. His chances of reaching a greater age will be less than 50%. His chances of reaching a lesser age will be more than 50%. In so far as calculations are based on statistics the exercise is, of course, a somewhat artificial one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;185.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case the claimant has not adopted a conventional manner of advancing his claim for lost years. Insofar as the statistical evidence established that his prospects of surviving had been reduced by Dr Scott's negligence, it should have been possible, by use of statistical evidence, to show that, on balance of probabilities, his life expectancy had been reduced by a specific number of years. It should, with the use of statistics, have been possible to calculate a single life expectancy for all in Professor Goldstone's model. A comparison of that life expectancy with Mr Gregg's life expectancy at the date of trial would have produced a specific number of lost years. On the premise (I believe a false premise) that these years were lost as a consequence of the spread of the cancer, damages should have included any earnings lost in those years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;186.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of advancing his claim in this conventional way, Mr Gregg has claimed for the reduction in his chance of surviving for ten years. He has then equated this with his chance of surviving to the age of 65. This has enabled him to claim a proportion of what he would have earned in the rest of his working life. The result may be more satisfactory to him than the result of the conventional approach, but no challenge has been made to the unconventional approach to claiming damages for earnings lost in the lost years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;187.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Hope of Craighead has concluded that Dr Scott's negligence caused the spread of Mr Gregg's cancer and that he can recover for the effect that the spread of his cancer had on his life expectancy. That conclusion is not, as a matter of principle, in any way at odds with the current law. It is, I think, the approach adopted by Latham LJ in the Court of Appeal. It involves starting the calculation by considering what Mr Gregg's prospects of surviving would have been had he been treated promptly and achieved complete remission, rather than suffered the spread of the cancer. On Professor Goldsone's model these prospects would have been, not 42 out of 100 but between 38 and 42 out of 55. It seems to me that Lord Hope of Craighead's approach will produce a different result to that of Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, to which I now turn.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A claim that negligence has reduced the prospect of the cure of a fatal illness</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;188.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gregg was suffering from a progressive disease which, if not treated, was almost certain to result in the spread of cancer leading to premature death. Delay in commencing the treatment in such a case tends to reduce the prospects of a cure, but whether, and to what extent it will do so in the individual case depends on factors unascertainable by the court. It is in these circumstances that Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead postulates that a claimant should recover damages for the reduction in his prospects of a cure, whether those prospects would have been more or less than 50% in the absence of the negligence. I can envisage the application of this approach once the adverse outcome, which the exercise of due care might have averted, has occurred. I find it less easy to see the basis on which the claim is established where the adverse outcome is still prospective. Does the claimant have to show that the negligence has had some adverse physical impact in order to establish his cause of action? If so, is liability for that adverse impact also to be assessed on a loss of a chance basis, rather than on balance of probability? I suspect that my noble and learned friend would answer yes to each question. If so, it is apparent that his approach will produce a different outcome from that of Lord Hope of Craighead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;189.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no doubt cases where it is possible to adopt the simple approach of asking to what extent the negligent treatment has reduced the prospects of curing the patient. There are other cases, and this is one, where that simple question is almost impossible to answer. On the facts known to him at the time of the trial it was possible for the judge to lump together the five adverse events that Mr Gregg had experienced and the prospect of Mr Gregg dying of his cancer and to say that the delay in his treatment had increased the chances of all of these occurring by the same 20%. On the facts known today, that is no longer possible. The likelihood seems to be that Dr Scott's negligence has not prevented Mr Gregg's cure, but has made that cure more painful. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;190.&nbsp;&nbsp;The complications of this case have persuaded me that it is not a suitable vehicle for introducing into the law of clinical negligence the right to recover damages for the loss of a chance of a cure. Awarding damages for the reduction of the prospect of a cure, when the long term result of treatment is still uncertain, is not a satisfactory exercise. Where medical treatment has resulted in an adverse outcome and negligence has increased the chance of that outcome, there may be a case for permitting a recovery of damages that is proportionate to the increase in the chance of the adverse outcome. That is not a case that has been made out on the present appeal. I would uphold the conventional approach to causation that was applied by Judge Inglis.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;191.&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge concluded, on the data before him, that on balance of probabilities the delay in commencing Mr Gregg's treatment that was attributable to Dr Scott's negligence had not affected the course of his illness or his prospects of survival, which had never been as good as even. The data have now changed and Mr Gregg's prospects of survival, despite the delay in commencing his treatment, seem good. The delay may well, however, have meant that his path to what seems a likely cure has involved more intrusive treatment, and more pain, suffering and distress than would have been experienced had treatment commenced promptly. Those acting for Mr Gregg have, however, not sought to re-open the facts but have relied on the facts as found by the judge. On those facts I agree with Lord Hoffmann and Baroness Hale that this appeal must be dismissed.</p>
<p>BARONESS HALE OF RICHMOND</p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;192.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal were divided about this case, as are we. We have found it very difficult. Yet the vast majority of personal injury cases are not difficult. The evidence may be complicated, witnesses may be confused or unreliable and the expert opinions may be contradictory or incomprehensible. But eventually the trial judge sorts it all out and makes findings of fact, as did His Honour Judge Inglis in his conspicuously careful and detailed judgment in this case. Usually, it is then a matter of applying some well settled principles to the facts found. Well settled principles may be developed or modified to meet new situations and new problems: the decisions in <i>Fairchild v Glenhaven Funeral Services Ltd</i> [2003] 1 AC 32 and <i>Chester v Afshar</i> [2004] 3 WLR 927 are good examples. But those two cases were dealing with particular problems which could be remedied without altering the principles applicable to the great majority of personal injury cases which give rise to no real injustice or practical problem. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;193.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now hornbook law that damage is the gist of the action in negligence. The defendant owes a duty to take reasonable care of the claimant, the breach of which has caused the claimant actionable damage. The primary facts of what took place must be proved on the balance of probabilities. It must also be shown on the balance of probabilities that what the defendant negligently did or failed to do caused the claimant's damage. As Tony Weir (<i>Tort Law</i>, Oxford University Press, 2002, pp 74-75) puts it:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Classically all that need be shown is that it would <i>probably</i> have made a difference if the defendant had not been in breach of duty. Certainty is not required. The essential thing is to persuade the judge that the harm would probably have been avoided if the defendant had acted properly: it does not matter whether he is easily persuaded, because it is obvious, or is persuaded only with difficulty, because the matter is far from clear. The tendency to state the matter in terms of percentages is to be avoided. 'More likely than not' is a matter of persuasion, not of proof." <p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;194.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once persuaded, however, the judge awards the claimant the full value of the damage that has been caused. As Tony Weir goes on to say:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The idea that recovery should be proportional to the cogency of the proof of causation is utterly unacceptable . . . " <p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;195.&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is more likely than not that the defendant's carelessness caused me to lose a leg.  I do not want my damages reduced to the extent that it is less than 100% certain that it did so. On the other hand, if it is more likely than not that the defendant's carelessness did <i>not</i> cause me to lose the leg, then the defendant does not want to have to pay damages for the 20% or 30% chance that it did. A 'more likely than not' approach to causation suits both sides.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;196.&nbsp;&nbsp;So it matters how the claimant, and the law, define the damage which is the gist of his action. In this case, the particulars of claim defined the damage flowing from the defendant's negligent failure to refer the claimant for specialist investigation in an entirely conventional way:</p>
<p></p><ul>"By reason of the Defendant's negligence, the Claimant has suffered pain and injury, loss and damage.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>PARTICULARS OF PAIN AND INJURY<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>There was rapid spread and development of the Claimant's non-Hodgkin's lymphoma disease at the end of 1995. Had the Claimant been referred in or about November 1994, the malignancy would have been diagnosed and treatment commenced with the disease having progressed no further than stage 1. The treatment would have been by means of either radiotherapy or CHOP chemotherapy. There would have been a very high likelihood of cure. The Claimant would have been unlikely to develop any secondary recurrence, and would not have required the further treatment detailed above.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>The prospects of obtaining a cure by the time that treatment was in fact commenced were reduced to below 50%  . . . <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>PARTICULARS OF LOSS AND DAMAGE<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>The Claimant refers to the provisional schedule of loss and damage served herewith . . . "<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;197.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have never seen that schedule. But we can deduce from the way in which the judge assessed the damages which he would have awarded, had the claimant proved the case as alleged in the Particulars of Claim, that it was a conventional claim for pain, suffering and loss of amenity; loss of earnings and costs of care; and loss of expectation of life. All of this would have been payable had he succeeded in proving on the balance of probabilities that 'but for' the defendant's failure to refer him for investigation in November 1994 he would have been 'cured'. The law's definition of cure for this purpose is a permanent cure, restoring him to a normal expectation of life. Only that would entitle him to damages for loss of earnings during what would otherwise have been that normal life span. One of the many complications in this case is that the definition of cure to which the medical evidence was directed was disease free survival ten years after the initial treatment. One can well understand why, both for clinical and research purposes, there has to be a working definition of this kind. But it has no particular relevance to the law. The law asks what difference the negligence has made to the claimant's life as a whole. But if the claimant <i>had</i> succeeded in proving that but for the defendant's negligence he would have been cured, neither claimant nor defendant would have suggested that his damages should be discounted to reflect the degree to which the judge was not certain that this was so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;198.&nbsp;&nbsp;But at trial the claimant could not prove that without the delay in referral he would probably have been 'cured' (even on the particular definition of 'cure' adopted by the experts in the case). It turned out that his was a type of cancer in which the chances of cure were never that good. So he tried to redefine the damage he had been caused by the delay. On appeal, he put it in two different ways (he also had a third argument, based on <i>Fairchild</i>, but that has not been pursued before us).</p>
