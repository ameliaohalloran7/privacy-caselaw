<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96.&nbsp;&nbsp;Neuberger J, on the other hand, found as a fact that there was no difference between uEPO and EPO made according to claim 26. He drew no distinction between EPO made in accordance with claim 19 and EPO made in accordance with claim 26, calling them both recombinant EPO ("rEPO"). He found (at paragraphs 545 to 557) that there was no necessary distinction between rEPO and uEPO.  It seems clear that if the European Patent Office had made similar findings of fact, it would have rejected claim 26.  So TKT say that Neuberger J ought to have held it had been anticipated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the judge and the Court of Appeal rejected this argument as a matter of law, and for similar reasons. In the Court of Appeal, Aldous LJ said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The [Technical] Board [of the EPO] accepted that it is permissible to have a claim to a product defined in terms of a process of manufacture, but state that such claims should only be granted in cases when the product cannot be satisfactorily defined by reference to its composition, structure or other testable parameter. That is a rule of practice which is not the concern of the national courts."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is, I must respectfully say, an incomplete statement of the position of the Board.  The first requirement is that the product must be new and that a difference in the method of manufacturing an identical product does not make it new. It is only if the product is different but the difference cannot in practice be satisfactorily defined by reference to its composition etc that a definition by process of manufacture is allowed.  The latter may be a rule of practice but the proposition that an identical product made by a new process does not count as new is in my opinion a proposition of law.  It cannot be new in law but not new for the purposes of the practice of the Office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99.&nbsp;&nbsp;Aldous LJ then went on to say "it seems that the Office concluded that claim 26 fell within the type of case where the product could not be satisfactorily defined by its features."  That is true, but again incomplete. The important point is that the Office found that rEPO according to claim 26 was a new product because its glycosolation pattern would necessarily be different from that of uEPO.  Once this finding of fact was removed, there was no basis for allowing claim 26.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100.&nbsp;&nbsp;Aldous LJ also relied upon article 64(2) as being consistent with a product-by-process claim. But in my opinion it leads to exactly the opposite conclusion and the Technical Board in <i>International Flavors</i> so held.  The point of article 64(2) is to extend the protection afforded by a process claim to a product directly made by that process and to make it unnecessary to claim the product defined by reference to the process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is important that the United Kingdom should apply the same law as the EPO and the other Member States when deciding what counts as new for the purposes of the EPC: compare <i>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc v H.N. Norton &amp; Co Ltd</i> [1996]  RPC 76, 82. It is true that this means a change in a practice which has existed for many years. But the difference is unlikely to be of great practical importance because a patentee can rely instead on the process claim and article 64(2).  It would be most unfortunate if we were to uphold the validity of a patent which would on identical facts have been revoked in opposition proceedings in the EPO. I would therefore allow this part of the appeal and declare claim 26 invalid on the ground of anticipation.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sufficiency</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102.&nbsp;&nbsp;TKT appeal against the Court of Appeal's rejection of their submissions that the specification is, on various grounds, insufficient to support claims 19 and 26.  The law on this point is contained in section 72(1)(c) of the Act.  A patent may be revoked if the specification does not disclose the invention "clearly enough and completely enough for it to be performed by a person skilled in the art."  That means that the disclosure must enable the invention to be performed to the full extent of the monopoly claimed: see <i>Biogen Inc v Medeva plc</i> [1997]  RPC 1,48.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the specification is sufficient or not is highly sensitive to the nature of the invention. The first step is to identify the invention and decide what it claims to enable the skilled man to do.  Then one can ask whether the specification enables him to do it. For example, in <i>American Home Products Corporation v Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd</i> [2001]  RPC 159 the patentee claimed that the known drug rapamycin and any of its derivatives could be put to a new use.  But the claim for such use of all derivatives was not enabled because only some derivatives could be so used and the specification did not enable the skilled man to identify which they were.  The answer may well have been different if the claim was to a new process for making rapamycin and its derivatives or if rapamycin and its derivatives had been new products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104.&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that a good deal of the argument in this case about sufficiency, like the argument about infringement, really turns on a dispute over exactly what the invention is: whether it is the discovery of the DNA sequence which codes for EPO, or a way of making EPO, or a new artificial form of EPO. And the confusion is compounded by the fact that claims 19 and 26 are both in essence product-by-process claims, even though, in the case of claim 19, the product is distinguished from prior art by an artificial condition about molecular weight.  All this creates ambiguity about the nature of the invention. But in order to decide whether the invention has been fully enabled, you first have to decide what the invention is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105.&nbsp;&nbsp;The complaints of insufficiency are four.  First, if (contrary to the view I have expressed on infringement) the claims cover EPO made by any form of recombinant DNA technology, it is said that they are insufficient because the specification does not enable TKT's technology.  I shall call this the "breadth of claim objection". It is a classic patent law squeeze.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106.&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, TKT submit that even if the claims are confined to EPO made by the expression of exogenous DNA in a host cell, they enable high-level expression only in CHO cells, which have the genetic mutation allowing Amgen's method of amplification.  The specification is insufficient to enable high-level expression in any other cell variety. I shall call this the "cell variety objection".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the claims are not only to EPO but to all analogues which behave like EPO in promoting the manufacture of red blood cells.  The specification is alleged to be insufficient because it does not enable one to predict which analogues will behave like EPO:  (the "analogues objection").</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the test for distinguishing EPO falling within claim 19 from uEPO (molecular weight) is in practice incapable of application.  I shall call this the "molecular weight objection". </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before considering any of the four objections, it is, as I indicated earlier, necessary to decide the nature of the invention which the specification had to enable. In my opinion, it was a way of making EPO. For the reasons which I gave when discussing infringement, it was not and could not be the DNA sequence.  It could only be a way (however broadly expressed) of making EPO by the use of that information. It could not be EPO itself because that was not new. Nor was it the discovery that a product had a useful quality.  The useful qualities of EPO were well known. Even in the case of claims 19 and 26, although they are nominally product claims, the essence of the invention lies in the process.  If one keeps in mind that the invention is a way of making EPO, a good deal of the difficulty about sufficiency resolves itself.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breadth of claims</p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110.&nbsp;&nbsp;If your Lordships agree with my view on the construction of the claims, they do not cover the TKT process and the specification need not enable it.  So your Lordships need not decide whether the specification would have been sufficient if the patent had claimed every method of making EPO by recombinant DNA technology. The judge, for whom the breadth of claims question did arise, said that the TKT process was enabled by the disclosure in Table VI because it could not have been operated without the DNA sequence information. Table VI was, he said, a principle capable of general application. He cited in support the decisions of the Netherlands Court of Appeal in <i>Kirin Amgen c.s./Boehringer Mannheim c.s.</i> (27 January 2000) and the Federal Court of Australia in <i>Genetics Institute Inc v Kirin-Amgen Inc (No 3)</i> (unreported, 25 June 1998). The Court of Appeal, for whom the question did not arise, was inclined to agree with the judge.  Aldous LJ said (at [2003] RPC 31, 64):</p>
<p></p><ul>"The law contemplates that patents will not lack sufficiency even though the claims cover inventive improvements. If the law was otherwise there would be no room for patents which disclosed a principle of general application unless the specification described how to carry out later inventions using the principle."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111.&nbsp;&nbsp;As the question does not arise for your Lordships either, I do not propose to express a concluded view. But the judge's view was plainly influenced by his opinion that Table VI could itself be the invention. He regarded Table VI as disclosing a "principle capable of general application" and applied a passage from my speech in the <i>Biogen </i>case  ([1997] RPC 1 at pp. 48-49):</p>
<p></p><ul>"If the invention discloses a principle capable of general application, the claims may be in correspondingly general terms … [I]f the patentee … has disclosed a beneficial property which is common to [a class of products] he will be entitled to a patent for all products of that class (assuming them to be new) even though he has not himself made more than one or two of them."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112.&nbsp;&nbsp;This gave rise to a good deal of argument about what amounted to a "principle of general application".  In my opinion there is nothing difficult or mysterious about it.  It simply means an element of the claim which is stated in general terms.  Such a claim is sufficiently enabled if one can reasonably expect the invention to work with anything which falls within the general term. For example, in <i>Genentech I/Polypeptide expression (T 292/85)</i> [1989]  OJ EPO 275, the patentee claimed in general terms a plasmid suitable for transforming a bacterial host which included an expression control sequence to enable the expression of exogenous DNA as a recoverable polypeptide.  The patentee had obviously not tried the invention on every plasmid, every bacterial host or every sequence of exogenous DNA. But the Technical Board of Appeal found that the invention was fully enabled because it could reasonably be expected to work with any of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an example of an invention of striking breadth and originality. But the notion of a "principle of general application" applies to any element of the claim, however humble, which is stated in general terms. A reference to a requirement of "connecting means" is enabled if the invention can reasonably be expected to work with any means of connection.  The patentee does not have to have experimented with all of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion the facts did not support the application of this principle. Assuming the claims can be read, as the judge thought, to include any way of making EPO by recombinant DNA technology, the specification does not disclose a way of making it in sufficiently general terms to include the TKT process. It discloses only how to make EPO by introducing exogenous DNA coding for EPO into a host cell. The TKT method is not a version of this process which, although untried, could reasonably be expected to work just as well.  It is different. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115.&nbsp;&nbsp;The distinction is well illustrated by the Dutch and Australian cases upon which the judge relied. The issue in the Dutch appeal was whether the invention enabled the use of all forms of exogenous DNA, including cDNA and synthetic DNA. I agree that it did. But that is because cDNA and synthetic DNA were both forms of exogenous DNA. The specification enabled the use of exogenous DNA in general terms and there was no reason for the skilled man to think that, if cDNA or synthetic DNA were obtainable, they would not work equally well. The Australian case was likewise concerned with whether the invention enabled the use of cDNA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116.&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge appears to have considered that an invention was enabled by a disclosure if it could not be worked without that disclosure. But that is obviously not enough. The disclosure in the specification must be not merely necessary; it must be sufficient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117.&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the point made by the Court of Appeal, it is of course correct so far as it goes. The choice of a particular form of an integer falling within the terms of the claim may improve the way the invention works and be in itself an inventive step.  The specification is not insufficient merely because it does not enable the person skilled in the art to make such an invention. The use of the improvement is still a way of working the original invention. But TKT does not rely upon the fact that the use by TKT of an endogenous EPO gene was inventive. Their objection is that it is not a way of making EPO which is disclosed, even in the most general terms, by the specification.  As the point does not arise, I do not propose to express a concluded view. But, unlike the Court of Appeal, I think that the breadth of claim objection may well have been a good one.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cell varieties</p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118.&nbsp;&nbsp;By contrast, I entirely agree with the Court of Appeal that the specification enabled the use of any cell for the expression of exogenous DNA. It is true that Amgen were only able to secure high-level expression in CHO cells. But the invention did not promise high-level expression and the discovery of another cell which enabled high-level expression would have been exactly the kind of improvement which the Court of Appeal said did not have to be enabled by the specification. The use of such a cell is a way of making EPO disclosed by the invention.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analogues</p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119.&nbsp;&nbsp;In considering analogues, it is important to bear in mind that the invention did not consist in the discovery that EPO and some of its analogues promoted the formation of red blood cells.  That was well known.  The case is therefore different from <i>American Home Products Corporation v Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd</i> [2001]  RPC 159 in which the invention lay in the discovery that a known product (and possibly some of its analogues) had an immuno-suppressive effect. But the substance of this invention is a way of making EPO and its analogues. If the claim were to a process for making EPO and EPO-like analogues, it could be sufficiently enabled if the person skilled in the art could make analogues, at any rate if he could, without undue experimentation, decide whether any given analogue had the necessary EPO-like qualities or not. The difficulty is that whatever may be the substance of the invention, Amgen have chosen to claim the product made by their invention and to define it by reference to its having EPO-like qualities.  That difficulty would have been avoided if Amgen had relied upon a process claim and article 64(2). No doubt the reason why they did not do so was that, if they had relied upon the process claim (27), it would have been even clearer that TKT were not using the invention:</p>
<p></p><ul>"A process for production of [EPO], which process is characterised by culturing under suitable nutrient conditions a … host cell transformed or transfected with a DNA sequence according to … claim 1 in a manner allowing the host cell to express said [EPO]"<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Amgen Inc v Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd</i> 18 USPQ2nd 1016 (1991) the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals held that the claim to analogues was bad and I see the force of the reasoning which led them to that conclusion. As I consider that claims 19 and 26 are both invalid for other reasons, I prefer to express no concluded view on the analogues question.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Molecular weight</p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121.&nbsp;&nbsp;Claim 19 distinguishes the product falling within the claim on the ground that it has a "higher molecular weight by SDS-PAGE from erythropoietin isolated from urinary sources".  SDS-PAGE is a well known method of ascertaining the apparent molecular weight of a protein which is fully described in the judgments below. There is no problem about applying the SDS-PAGE test to two proteins and deciding that one has a higher apparent molecular weight than the other. The difficulty lies in identifying the uEPO to test against the rEPO made according to the process specified in claim 19.  The judge heard days of evidence of experiments to determine the molecular weights of various kinds of uEPO. There were variations which might have been attributable to the source of the urine and the method of purification or might have been purely random. The claim, which spoke of "erythropoietin isolated from urinary sources" appeared to be indifferent to source or method of purification. The judge summed up his findings on the experiments at paragraph 479:</p>
<p></p><ul>"First, some rEPOs have a higher apparent molecular weight by SDS-PAGE than some uEPOs; secondly, some rEPOs have the same apparent molecular weight as some uEPOs; thirdly, no rEPOs have a lower apparent molecular weight than any uEPOs."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, it appeared from a scientific paper in evidence that rEPO expressed in insect cells (which <i>prima facie</i> came within claim 19) probably had a lower molecular weight than any uEPO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123.&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge concluded from this evidence that claim 19 was incapable of being infringed:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It appears to me that the variations in apparent molecular weight between different batches of urinary EPO, coupled with the fact that it is clear that many recombinant EPOs do not satisfy the test, would put the skilled addressee seeking to discover whether his product was within claim 19, and seeking to discover this in a reasonable way, in an unsatisfactory, indeed, an impossible position."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;124.&nbsp;&nbsp;The claim appeared to assume that all uEPOs had effectively the same molecular weight, irrespective of source and method of isolation.  This had been shown not to be the case. So which uEPO did the claim require to be used for the test?  Simply to use the first uEPO which came to hand would turn the claim into a lottery. On the other hand, it would be burdensome to have to work one's way through several specimens of uEPO (which were, as I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, extremely hard to come by) and even then the result would be inconclusive because <i>non constat</i> that some untried specimen did not have a different molecular weight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125.&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge decided that the lack of clarity made the specification insufficient. It did not merely throw up the possibility of doubtful cases but made it impossible to determine in <i>any</i> case whether the product fell within the claim.  The invention was not disclosed "clearly enough and completely enough for it to be performed by a person skilled in the art": section 72(1)(c).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;126.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal disagreed.  They said that it was sufficient that some uEPO could be tested against eEPO by SDS-PAGE. The fact that it did not specify which uEPO and that choosing one uEPO would bring the product within the claim and another would not was "lack of clarity dressed up to look like insufficiency."  For my part, I do not think that can be right. If the claim says that you must use an acid, and there is nothing in the specification or context to tell you which acid, and the invention will work with some acids but not with others but finding out which ones work will need extensive experiments, then that in my opinion is not merely lack of clarity; it is insufficiency.  The lack of clarity does not merely create a fuzzy boundary between that which will work and that which will not.  It makes it impossible to work the invention at all until one has found out what ingredient is needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;127.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal went on to say that even if they were wrong on this point, the claim was sufficiently enabled. They gave the generality of the direction to use uEPO a specificity which they regarded as sufficient with the aid of the following propositions:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The onus is upon TKT to establish that the test is insufficient; secondly, that the question of insufficiency has to be judged as of 1984; thirdly, it has to be decided by the court through the eyes of the skilled person; fourthly, the skilled person is deemed to be seeking success rather than failure; fifthly, lawyers can often think up puzzles at the edge of a claim, but skilled persons are concerned with practicalities not puzzles."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;128.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal placed great emphasis upon the fact that the skilled person was taken to be "seeking success", a phrase which is used by Aldous LJ 12 times over six pages.  But I am unclear about what in the present context that means. Ordinarily, it is clear enough.  The skilled person is taken to be trying to make the invention work. If the skilled person would quickly realise that one method would work and another would fail, the specification is not insufficient because the claim is expressed in terms broad enough to include both methods.  That was the point made by Lord Shaw of Dunfermline in the well-known passage cited  by the Court of Appeal from his speech in <i>British Thomson-Houston Company Ltd v Corona Lamp Works Ltd</i> (1922)  39 RPC 49, 89.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;129.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, however, the choice of uEPO has nothing to do with making the invention work. It is simply a criterion against which one tests whether the rEPO falls within the claims.  The very concepts of "success" or "failure" seems irrelevant to the choice of uEPO. What counts as "success"?  Ex hypothesi the skilled person does not know in advance whether any given uEPO will bring his rEPO within the claim or not. From the point of view of success or failure, one is as good as another. All the skilled man can do is try to guess which uEPO the patentee had in mind and if the specification does not tell him, then it is insufficient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;130.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal then proceeded to re-examine the judge's findings of fact about the conclusions to be drawn from the experiments and scientific papers on the molecular weight of different uEPOs.  They excluded some of the samples which he had taken into account on the ground that they would not be considered by a skilled person who was "seeking success".  But, for the reasons I have given, that does not appear to me a coherent reason. Others were excluded on the ground that the method of purification would not have been adopted by a skilled man in 1984.  The judge was prepared to accept methods of purification which had been published in 1984 (like that of <i>Miyake et al</i>, to which I have already referred) and what he called "obvious workshop modifications" of those methods.  The Court of Appeal rejected the latter methods on the ground that there was no evidence that the skilled man would have adopted them. But the claims, as I have said, appear to be indifferent as to methods of purification. It is true that the patentee must be taken to have contemplated the kind of method a skilled man would have adopted in 1984 and the patent cannot become insufficient because some entirely different method, consistently producing uEPO with a different molecular weight, is invented afterwards. But the specification refers to a number of methods of purification which were in many respects different from each other. It seems to me unreal to suppose that a skilled person, trying to find out whether his rEPO was within the claims and reading a specification which obviously assumed that the method of purification did not matter, would adhere to the letter of one published method or another and not mix and match. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;131.&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of whether the various purification methods were obvious modifications of published 1984 protocols was a matter for the judge who had heard the evidence.  In my opinion he was entitled to reach the conclusions which he did and was right in law to conclude that the claim was not sufficiently enabled.  I would therefore allow this part of the appeal and restore the judge's conclusion that claim 19 was invalid for insufficiency.</p>
<i><p>Conclusion</p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;132.&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is that I would allow TKT's appeal and revoke the patent on the ground that claim 19 is insufficient (section 72(1)(c)) and claim 26 is anticipated (section 72(1)(a)).  Standing back from the detail, it is clear that Amgen have got themselves into difficulties because, having invented a perfectly good and ground-breaking process for making EPO and its analogues, they were determined to try to patent the protein itself, notwithstanding that, even when isolated, it was not new. Hence the patenting of the two product-by-process claims which have failed, one because the last-minute amendment to distinguish the product from the natural EPO turned out to based upon the false premise that all uEPO had the same molecular weight and the other because the factual basis on which the European Patent Office allowed it turned out to be wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;133.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the advantage of reading in draft the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Hope of Craighead and would warmly associate myself with his tribute to Professor Yudkin.  His teaching was invaluable to the Committee and must have resulted in a considerable saving in costs for the parties.</p>
LORD HOPE OF CRAIGHEAD
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;134.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the great advantage of reading in draft the speech which has been delivered by my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann.  I agree with it, and for all the reasons that Lord Hoffmann has given I too would dismiss Amgen's appeal, allow TKT's cross-appeal and make the orders which he has proposed.  I wish to associate myself also with the additional points made by my noble and learned friend Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;135.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before leaving the case however I should like to pay a particularly warm tribute to the valuable assistance which, with the agreement of the parties and in common with others of your Lordships, I received from Professor Michael D Yudkin, Professor of Biochemistry at Oxford University, in a series of seminars which he gave<i> in camera </i>before the appeal was heard to introduce us to the relevant aspects of recombinant DNA technology.  The work which Professor Yudkin did by means of these carefully prepared seminars enabled all those involved to concentrate on the issues of law in the appeal without having to spend a good deal of extra time in the course of the hearing on learning about the technology.  This had the result of shortening the length of time that it was necessary to devote to the hearing by several days.  It was at Lord Hoffmann's suggestion in the course of a preliminary hearing that this was done, as there was no dispute about the technology.  I suggest that it is a course which might usefully be adopted in the future in cases of this kind, where the technology is complex and undisputed and the parties are willing to consent to it.</p>
<p><b>LORD RODGER OF EARLSFERRY</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
