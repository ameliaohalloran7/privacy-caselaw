<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in full agreement with the reasons given by my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill for his conclusion that the decision of the Parole Board in this case was ultra vires.  I would allow the appeal.</p>
<p><b>LORD RODGER OF EARLSFERRY</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100.&nbsp;&nbsp;On 12 August 1966 the appellant, Harry Roberts, murdered three unarmed police officers.  In December of the same year he was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a recommendation that he should serve at least 30 years in custody - a recommendation that might well be regarded as lenient by today's standards when Parliament has fixed 30 years as the appropriate starting point for the murder of one police officer in the course of his duty.  Mr Roberts has been in prison ever since.  Now the Parole Board have to consider, in terms of section 28 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997, whether to direct that he should be released on licence.  By section 28(6) they are not to do so unless they are "satisfied that it is no longer necessary for the protection of the public that [Mr Roberts] should be confined."  The protection of the public is the paramount consideration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board's proceedings in Mr Roberts' case have been protracted - due, in large measure, to the present litigation.  To begin with, since Mr Roberts is a mandatory life prisoner, the proceedings were not covered by any rules.  Then, as from 18 December 2003, they were governed by the Parole Board Rules 1997 made by the Secretary of State under section 32(5) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 ("the 1991 Act").  On 1 August 2004, however, just after the Court of Appeal's decision, the Parole Board Rules 2004 came into force.  They will apply to the hearing in this case.  So, even though the decisions of the Board and of the courts below were taken before the 2004 Rules came into force, it is common ground that the House should consider the position in terms of these Rules.  This is only common sense since the Board could, in any event, make fresh directions under the 2004 Rules.  One effect of the new Rules is to spell out certain matters that were not mentioned in previous versions.  So, in that respect, the context of some of the arguments has changed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102.&nbsp;&nbsp;By virtue of rule 6(1), when deciding whether a prisoner should be released, the Board have to consider, inter alia, relevant information and reports served on them by the Secretary of State.  Paras (2) and (3) of rule 6 provide:</p>
<p></p><ul>"(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Any part of the information or reports referred to in paragraph (1) which, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, should be withheld from the prisoner on the grounds that its disclosure would adversely affect national security, the prevention of disorder or crime or the health or welfare of the prisoner or others (such withholding being a necessary and proportionate measure in all the circumstances of the case), shall be recorded in a separate document and served only on the Board together with the reasons for believing that its disclosure would have that effect.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a document is withheld from the prisoner in accordance with paragraph (2), it shall, unless the chair of the panel directs otherwise, nevertheless be served as soon as practicable on the prisoner's representative if he is -<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;a barrister or solicitor,<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;a registered medical practitioner, or<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;a person whom the chair of the panel directs is suitable by virtue of his experience or professional qualification;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>provided that no information disclosed in accordance with this paragraph shall be disclosed either directly or indirectly to the prisoner or to any other person without the consent/authority of the chair of the panel."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103.&nbsp;&nbsp;As rule 6(2) envisages may happen, in preparation for the hearing in the present case, the Secretary of State included in the information that he supplied to the Board certain sensitive material which, in his opinion, should be withheld from Mr Roberts.  This information was to be withheld because there were fears for the safety of the informant if his or her identity should become known, and the informant was unwilling to give evidence unless he or she had an assurance that the information would not be given to Mr Roberts - or, importantly, to his representatives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104.&nbsp;&nbsp;Previous versions of the Rules made provision for withholding information from a prisoner on the ground that its disclosure would adversely affect the health or welfare of the prisoner or of others.  But in all such cases the information was to be served on the prisoner's representative, provided that it was not to be disclosed either directly or indirectly to the prisoner or to any other person without the authority of the chairman of the panel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule 6(2) in the 2004 Rules adds to the reasons for withholding information:  it may also be withheld if its disclosure would adversely affect national security or in order to prevent disorder or crime.  But withholding the information must be a necessary and proportionate measure in all the circumstances of the case.  Rule 6(3) contains a further innovation which is of importance in the present case.  While the sensitive information should generally be served on the prisoner's representative, rule 6(3) provides that the chairman of the panel may direct otherwise.  In other words, as here, the chairman of the panel may direct that the information should be withheld not only from the prisoner but from his representative.  Presumably in the light of experience, when making the 2004 Rules the Secretary of State anticipated that this was a power which could be needed to enable the Board to perform their functions properly in certain situations.  So he included this clause which gives the chairman this express power.  Although the rule does not spell out the grounds on which the chairman is to make the direction, it is implicit in the scheme of paras (2) and (3) that such a direction must be necessary and proportionate on grounds of national security, the prevention of disorder or crime, or the health or welfare of the prisoner or others.  It is the giving of this type of direction which must always be a course of last, never of first, resort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule 6(3) expressly contemplates a situation where, in coming to their decision on whether to release a prisoner, the Board may take into account information about the prisoner which has been supplied by the Secretary of State but which the prisoner and his representative cannot see.  In reality, it is this rule which gives rise to the procedure that Mr Roberts says is unfair.  But, despite this, as his counsel specifically acknowledged in the hearing before the House, Mr Roberts does not challenge the validity of rule 6(3) in our domestic law.  In particular, he does not suggest that the Secretary of State lacked the power under section 32(5) of the 1991 Act to make this provision.  Rather, his complaint is that the Board, being a statutory tribunal of limited jurisdiction, lack the power to adopt the special advocate procedure.  Therefore the question at issue in these proceedings, and on which the House heard argument, concerns the powers of the Board under the 1991 Act and the 2004 Rules to adopt the special advocate procedure, not the powers of the Secretary of State under section 32(5) to make rule 6(3).  My noble and learned friend, Lord Woolf, suggests that Mr Owen QC might have advanced his argument on behalf of the appellant in a more persuasive manner by focussing on the power of the Secretary of State under section 32(5) to make rule 6(3) and adopting the argument in paras 24 et seq of the speech of my noble and learned friend, Lord Bingham of Cornhill.  But such an argument would have been irrelevant in these proceedings where the remedy sought is the quashing of the Board's decision, not the quashing of the Secretary of State's rule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even although rule 6(3) invests the chairman with the power to give a direction to withhold information from the prisoner and his representative, in any case where he exercises the power the Board must be under an obligation to do everything they can to mitigate the potentially serious adverse consequences for the prisoner.  Here, with that aim in mind, and following precedents in other kinds of proceedings, on 13 June 2003 the Board directed an advocate appointed by the Attorney General to receive the information and to represent the interests of the prisoner, Mr Roberts, at the hearing.  Since the advocate cannot discuss the information with the prisoner or his representative, no-one suggests that such an appointment eliminates all the disadvantages which flow from the direction.  Far from it.  But, as Lord Woolf observes, it is a step which can only help the prisoner and it is, moreover, one which accords him "a substantial measure of procedural justice":  <i>Chahal v United Kingdom </i>(1996) 23 EHRR 413, 469, para 131.  Appointing such an advocate can accordingly be regarded as incidental to, and conducive to, the discharge of the Board's functions in accordance with rule 6(3).  Therefore, in purely domestic law terms, in making such an appointment the Board act within their powers under section 32(7) of, and para 1(2)(b) of Schedule 5 to, the 1991 Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the use of the specially appointed advocate procedure will not be appropriate unless the chairman of the panel has, in the first place, properly exercised the power under rule 6(3) to direct that the sensitive material should not be disclosed to the prisoner's representative.  In the present case the appellant is represented by an experienced solicitor who has acted for him for many years.  Nor is there a hint of criticism of the solicitor's professional propriety.  Therefore, those who have not seen the closed material may well find it surprising that the Board decided that a direction to withhold the material from the appellant's representatives should be given.  But that question was first explored in the directions hearing before Sir Richard Tucker who, having considered all the relevant material, concluded inter alia that "if full disclosure of the contents of section C were made to Mr Roberts, there would be a real risk to the safety of the source or sources".  After a further directions hearing with further submissions on the appellant's behalf, the Board concluded that disclosure of the information to Mr Roberts' representatives would lead to a real risk of inadvertent disclosure to him by those representatives.  In the decision under review they therefore directed that the sensitive information should not be disclosed to Mr Roberts or his legal representatives but only to the specially appointed advocate.  Not only was that decision taken after careful consideration of the submissions of counsel but, "upon a review of the utmost intensity," Maurice Kay J approved the deployment of the specially appointed advocate procedure in this case.  In doing so, he specifically held, [2004] 2 All ER 776, 787f - g, that there was no sensible way in which the evidence in question, which is relevant to the performance of the Board's function, could have been placed before it, save for the way that had been pursued.  Moreover, in his view, "the fears of the source are both subjectively and objectively justified" and "exceptional circumstances ... exist" in this case.  There is no appeal against his judgment on the merits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109.&nbsp;&nbsp;The House must therefore proceed on the basis, first, that, given what Maurice Kay J described in his closed judgment as "the potential importance of the sensitive material," the material should be available to the Board when taking their decision on the appellant's release, but, secondly, that the risk of danger to the informant or informants is indeed such as to make it necessary and proportionate to withhold the material from the appellant and his solicitor.  In other words, the circumstances justify a direction in terms of rule 6(3).  In that situation the use of the specially appointed advocate procedure is a way of protecting Mr Roberts' interests, while allowing the Board to carry out their statutory function of deciding, on the basis of all the relevant information, whether he can be safely released.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Woolf points out that in a case such as the present things may well turn out differently at the hearing:  at an early stage the prisoner may in fact be informed of the gist of the evidence against him, or documents may be made available in a redacted version.  But to rely on that comforting scenario would really be to wish away the very problem which the House is required to confront.  The House is called upon to consider what is to be done when, as here, the Board decide, in good faith and for good reason, that information which is relevant to their decision cannot be made available to the prisoner or his representative in any shape or form without jeopardising the safety of the source of the information.  These circumstances - for which no-one is to blame - are exceptional.  They pose a difficult problem for our system - one, moreover, which inapposite references to Kafka<i> </i>do nothing to illuminate and tend, rather, to trivialise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, rule 6(3), which was made by the Secretary of State under the authority of Parliament, points to the solution which the House must adopt in this case:  the Board may use the information, even though the prisoner and his representative do not have access to it.  By appointing a special advocate, the Board have done what they can to assist Mr Roberts in the predicament brought about by the proper application of this rule - and no-one has suggested how they could have done more.  Of course, as all concerned recognise, a hearing conducted on this basis falls short of the ideal.  Therefore, if the vires of rule 6(3) were under challenge (which they are not), one question might well be whether, in the case of a convicted murderer, the procedure met the minimum standard of fairness for a hearing of this particular kind in circumstances where the use of the material was necessary and proportionate.  The answer to that question, relating to the vires of the rule, could not depend on the contingencies of particular proceedings, such as those involving Mr Roberts.  In addressing the question, however, a court would have to contemplate the two possible alternative solutions, each of which gives decisive weight to the interests of the prisoner.  One solution would be to disclose the information to the prisoner's representative and, if possible, to require the informant to give evidence, even though this would risk putting his life or health in jeopardy.  That solution would be, to say the least, unattractive and might well give rise to significant issues under articles 2 and 3 of the European Convention.  The other solution would be for the Board to exclude from their consideration any evidence which could not be safely disclosed to the prisoner or his representative.  In other words, the Board should close their eyes to evidence, even though it would be relevant to the decision which Parliament has charged them to take for the protection of the public.  That solution too would be - again, to say the least - unattractive and, moreover, hard to reconcile with the Board's statutory duty not to direct a prisoner's release on licence unless they are satisfied that it is no longer in the interests of the public that he should be confined.  I therefore respectfully regard Lord Woolf's observations in paras 79 - 81 as being of great force, but I say no more about the point, since it does not arise for decision in this case and the House did not hear argument on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112.&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as the argument based on the European Convention is concerned, substantially for the reasons given by Lord Bingham, I consider that the House cannot decide in advance whether the full hearing, involving the specially appointed advocate, meets the requirements of article 5(4).  The same competing interests fall to be considered for the purposes of article 5(4), but the weight to be attached to the various factors may well depend, in part at least, on what happens at the hearing.  For example, perhaps in the light of the advocate's cross-examination based on a study of the solicitor's file, the Board may reject the evidence of the source as unreliable or incredible.  Or else, the Board may accept it in part but none the less order Mr Roberts' release.  These and similar possibilities mean that a court will be in a position to determine whether Mr Roberts has had the kind of hearing required by article 5(4) only once the hearing has taken place and the Board have reached their decision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
LORD CARSWELL
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appellant Harry Maurice Roberts, who is now aged 68 years, was convicted on 12 December 1966 of the murder by shooting of three policemen.  He was sentenced to imprisonment for life and the minimum term which he was to serve (then commonly known as the "tariff") was fixed at 30 years.  On the expiry of that term on 30 September 1996 it became the duty of the Parole Board, under the statutory provisions to which I shall refer, to consider whether he should be released.  It has not yet given a decision in favour of release and the appellant remains in prison.  The appeal before the House concerns the procedure which the Parole Board may adopt in considering sensitive information and whether it may have resort to the practice adopted in certain other tribunals of engaging a specially appointed advocate ("SAA") to represent, so far as he is able, the interests of the prisoner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115.&nbsp;&nbsp;The statutory foundation of the Parole Board is to be found in the Criminal Justice Act 1991.  Section 32(1) provides, as amended:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The Parole Board shall be, by that name, a body corporate and as such shall<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;be constituted in accordance with this Part; and</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;have the functions conferred by this Part in respect of long-term and short-term prisoners and by Chapter II of Part II of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 … in respect of life prisoners within the meaning of that Chapter."</p>
<p>There is a clear implication from the matters to which the Secretary of State has to have regard in giving directions under section 32(6) that these are objects of the Board.  They are (a) the need to protect the public from serious harm from offenders and (b) the desirability of preventing the commission by them of further offences and securing their rehabilitation.  As my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill confirmed in <i>R (West) v Parole Board </i>[2005] 1 WLR 350 at para 26, the Board's sole concern is with risk, and it has no role at all in the imposition of punishment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116.&nbsp;&nbsp;Powers relating to the Board's functions were conferred by paragraph 1(2) of Schedule 5 to the 1991 Act:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It shall be within the capacity of the Board as a statutory corporation to do such things and enter into such transactions as are incidental to or conducive to the discharge of  …<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b) its functions under Chapter II of Part II of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 in respect of life prisoners within the meaning of that Chapter."<p></p></ul>
<p>By virtue of the provisions of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 and the Criminal Justice Act 2003 the Parole Board now has the function of deciding on the release of life prisoners, as distinct from merely advising the Secretary of State, and its remit extends to mandatory as well as discretionary life prisoners.  Section 28(5) and (6) of the 1997 Act provide:</p>
<p></p><ul>"(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as -<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;a life prisoner to whom this section applies has served the relevant part of his sentence; and <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;the Parole Board has directed his release under this section, <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>it shall be the duty of the Secretary of State to release him on licence.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parole Board shall not give a direction under subsection (5) above with respect to a life prisoner to whom this section applies unless - <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;the Secretary of State has referred the prisoner's case to the Board; and <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;the Board is satisfied that it is no longer necessary for the protection of the public that the prisoner should be confined."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rules were made by the Secretary of State, pursuant to the power contained in section 32(5) of the 1991 Act, with respect to the proceedings of the Parole Board.  No express provision for the appointment of an SAA is contained in any of the rules made and authority has to be sought from the general power contained in paragraph 1(2) of Schedule 5 to the 1991 Act, to do such things as are incidental to or conducive to the discharge of its functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule 6 of the Parole Board Rules 2004 (which it is agreed will apply to the Board's hearing of the appellant's case) makes provision for the service of information and reports:</p>
<p></p><ul>"6.&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)  Within 8 weeks of the case being listed, the Secretary of State shall serve on the Board and, subject to paragraph (2), the prisoner or his representative -<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;the information specified in Part A of Schedule 1 to these Rules,<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;the reports specified in Part B of that Schedule, and<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;such further information as the Secretary of State considers to be relevant to the case.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Any part of the information or reports referred to in paragraph (1) which, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, should be withheld from the prisoner on the grounds that its disclosure would adversely affect national security, the prevention of disorder or crime or the health or welfare of the prisoner or others (such withholding being a necessary and proportionate measure in all the circumstances of the case), shall be recorded in a separate document and served only on the Board together with the reasons for believing that its disclosure would have that effect.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a document is withheld from the prisoner in accordance with paragraph (2), it shall, unless the chair of the panel directs otherwise, nevertheless be served as soon as practicable on the prisoner's representative if he is -<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;a barrister or solicitor,<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;a registered medical practitioner, or<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;a person whom the chair of the panel directs is suitable by virtue of his experience or professional qualification;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>provided that no information disclosed in accordance with this paragraph shall be disclosed either directly or indirectly to the prisoner or to any other person without the consent/authority of the chair of the panel."<p></p></ul>
<p>The express power contained in rule 6(3) for the chair of the panel to direct the withholding of a document from the prisoner's representative was an innovation in the 2004 Rules, though such a power may have previously existed by necessary implication.  As my noble and learned friend Lord Woolf has pointed out, it will be exercised by a chairman who has held high judicial office and applies his experience of balancing conflicting considerations in deciding whether to give such a direction.  The use of an SAA, with all of the handicaps which it imposes upon a prisoner, accordingly will operate to mitigate the rigour of a direction and the disadvantages accruing to him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appellant's dossier which was furnished to the Parole Board shows a progression over time in his behaviour and attitude from a hostile and unco-operative prisoner, who made numerous escape plans in the earlier part of his detention, to one who had with maturity and the passing of time settled down into a well behaved prisoner who qualified for enhanced status.  In March 2000 he was transferred to an open prison.  A review was due to begin in September 2001, with the prospect that a process leading towards eventual release would be put in train.  Then in or about September 2001 HM Prison Service received allegations that he had been involved in drug dealing, bringing unauthorised material into prison and other infractions of discipline.  He was transferred back to a closed prison and investigations into the allegations commenced.  His solicitors made detailed representations on his behalf and were informed by a letter of 22 April 2002 that although material disclosed to them in connection with the appellant's removal from the open prison would be added to the dossier, certain material to be included in it would not be disclosed to him.  The solicitors protested strongly in correspondence about the withholding of this material.  The Prison Service has expressed as its reason for withholding a fear for the safety of the source of the information on which it is based if it should become known whence it had come and the unwillingness of the informant to give evidence unless he had a sufficient assurance that the information would not be given to the appellant or his representatives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appellant's case was referred to the Parole Board by the Secretary of State in May 2002 and he was interviewed by a member of the Board on 6 June 2002.  He then brought an application for judicial review, which was concluded by a consent order dated 18 October 2002 whereby the appellant and the Secretary of State agreed on a procedure for dealing with the sensitive material.  Although it referred to the appointment of an SAA as a possible procedure, the consent did not extend to agreement on the part of the appellant that it should be adopted.  The Vice-Chairman of the Parole Board Scott Baker LJ considered the matter and recommended on 15 November 2002 that an SAA should be appointed, the sensitive material should be disclosed to him and a hearing should take place before the legal chairman of the panel to discuss procedure and receive representations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121.&nbsp;&nbsp;That hearing took place on 30 May 2003, when the chairman of the panel Sir Richard Tucker presided and representatives of the Secretary of State, the Prison Service and the appellant were present, including counsel, together with the SAA Mr Nicholas Blake QC.  Mr Blake had been appointed as recommended by Scott Baker LJ and took part in directions hearings on 9 May and 30 May 2003.  He had also furnished an opinion in February 2003, in which he advised, after seeing the sensitive material, that consideration be given to disclosing it to counsel nominated by the appellant's solicitor, who would be subject to the restrictions contained in the Parole Board Rules forbidding disclosure to the prisoner or any other person without the consent or authority of the chair of the panel.  This advice was not accepted and the matter remained to be considered at the hearing on 30 May 2003.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the directions hearing on 9 May 2003 the chairman made the following findings:</p>
<p></p><ul>"i)&nbsp;&nbsp;with regard to the 'sensitive material' contained in section C of the dossier, the fears of the source or sources are genuine and held on reasonable grounds<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(reference para 11 of Ms Kaufmann's skeleton argument of 7 May 2003);<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>ii) if full disclosure of section C were to be made to Mr Roberts, there would be a real risk to the safety of the source or sources (para 12 of Ms Kaufmann's skeleton argument);<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>iii) in making directions on disclosure, the Board must balance the interests of the various parties involved.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>These are:<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>a) the public - the Board's ultimate purpose is to protect the public.  Moreover, it is important that all judicial decisions are made on the basis of the broadest information available;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>b) the prisoner - the prisoner has the right to proper representation and examination of the evidence.  This is not, however, an absolute right.  The Parole Board Rules, while not specifically applicable to mandatory lifers, but issued in line with the application of Article 5(4) of the ECHR to other categories of life sentence prisoners, acknowledge that the public interest may restrict the prisoner's right in this respect (reference rule 5 [of the Parole Board Rules 1997]);<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>c) the source or sources of the 'sensitive material' - these parties have the right under articles 2 and 3 of the ECHR, and under common law, to protection." <p></p></ul>
<p>The three interests concerned have been referred to throughout this case as the "triangulation of interests".</p>
