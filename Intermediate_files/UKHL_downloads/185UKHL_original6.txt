<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;The "cause of action" issue: does English law recognise a restitutionary claim for tax paid under a mistake of law?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;The "mistake" issue (arising if DMG succeeds on issue (1)): did DMG make the payments of ACT under a mistake of law?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;The "discovery" issue (arising if DMG succeeds on issues (1) and (2)): when did DMG discover (or could with reasonable diligence have discovered) its mistake?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;The "settled law" issue (arising if DMG succeeds on issues (1) to (3)): does English law recognise a defence of "settled law" to a claim for restitution of tax paid under a mistake of law?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;The "scope of section 32(1)(c)" issue (arising if DMG fails on issue (1), and raised for the first time in this House): can DMG bring itself within section 32(1)(c) even if mistake of law is not an essential element of its cause of action?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;The "pleading" issue (raised by the Revenue's cross-appeal and linked to the limitation issues): this is the point on section 35 of the Limitation Act 1980 already identified.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118.&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be apparent that it may not be strictly necessary for your Lordships to resolve each of these issues in order to dispose of the appeal. But as this is a test case under the GLO, and the facts of other cases will differ, it seems desirable to consider all the issues. On DMG's printed case there is a seventh issue, the "expiration" issue, arising only if DMG cannot rely on section 32(1)(c), and if the Revenue succeeds on its cross-appeal. This is a truly arcane point raised (but then left undecided) by Park J in paras 39 and 40 of his judgment, and not discussed at all in the Court of Appeal. Like Park J I would leave it for another day unless there is some practical need to answer it.</p>
<i></i><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woolwich and Kleinwort Benson</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119.&nbsp;&nbsp;The speeches delivered in this House in <i>Woolwich</i> [1993] AC 70 and<i> Kleinwort Benson</i> [1999] 2 AC 349 have attracted a great deal of academic interest and commentary. The speeches (especially those of Lord Goff) were also subjected to very close scrutiny in the courts below. Buxton LJ warned himself (para 265) against treating Lord Goff's speeches as if they were statutes, but the fact is that they were in the courts below subjected to the same sort of minute examination as would be appropriate for a statutory (or even, if I may say so without disrespect, a scriptural) text. Your Lordships have been invited to undertake the same sort of exercise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120.&nbsp;&nbsp;That invitation cannot be wholly disregarded. But before getting too caught up in the exegesis of Lord Goff's speeches, and at the danger of stating the obvious, I would by way of preliminary make some simple observations about the issues in the two cases, and about all the speeches which were delivered (in each case there were quite full speeches from every member of the Appellate Committee, with two dissenting speeches). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121.&nbsp;&nbsp;To my mind the salient points about <i>Woolwich</i> [1993] AC 70 were as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;It was decided in 1992 when the general rule barring recovery of money paid under a mistake of law still held the field.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case there was no mistake on the part of the building society, which had from the first challenged the validity of the transitional provisions in the relevant regulations. It seems to have received confident professional advice and to have acted confidently on the advice. It paid the tax under protest, which was a reasonable thing to do since thousands of small investors might have been alarmed by the news that it was said to be in default.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;The claim (as originally formulated) was for the repayment of a principal sum of almost £57m with interest. After the issue of the writ the principal sum was repaid (with interest from the date of the writ). So only pre-writ interest was eventually at stake, but there had been a principal sum claimed to be due when the writ was issued.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority (Lord Goff, Lord Browne-Wilkinson and Lord Slynn of Hadley) upheld the simple principle that tax paid in response to an unlawful demand could be recovered, regardless of compulsion, and that this result was not ousted (or "trumped") by any concurrent mistake of law (Lord Goff, at p 177 F-H, Lord Browne-Wilkinson, at p 198 C-H, agreeing with Lord Goff but not expressly mentioning mistake of law; Lord Slynn, at pp 204 H-205 A).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;The minority (Lord Keith of Kinkel and Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle) considered that there could be no recovery in the absence of compulsion or duress, and that there was no relevant distinction between payment of tax in response to a demand under an ultra vires regulation and payment in response to a demand under a misconstrued statute. If the statutory provisions for repayment of overpaid taxes were inadequate that was a matter for Parliament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;The case had no European element at all, though Lord Goff did refer (at p 177 C-E) to the <i>San Giorgio</i> case [1983] ECR 3593, remarking that it would be strange if the right of the citizen to recover overpaid charges were to be more restricted under domestic law than it is under European law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122.&nbsp;&nbsp;The salient points about <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> [1999] 2 AC 349 were as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not about tax but about interest rate swaps. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;There were arguably concurrent restitutionary claims, that is a claim based on money paid under a void contract and (if and only if the House abrogated the long-standing bar on recovery of money paid under a mistake of law) a claim on that ground.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;The significance of section 32(1)(c) of the Limitation Act 1980 was clearly recognised; that was the whole point of the appellant bank seeking to overturn the rule barring recovery for mistake of law. The majority decided to overturn the rule despite explicitly acknowledging that an indefinitely extended limitation period might produce unsatisfactory results (Lord Goff at p 389 A-C; Lord Hoffmann, at p 401 D-F; Lord Hope of Craighead, at p 417 G-H). The minority also noted this point (Lord Browne-Wilkinson at p 359 H; Lord Lloyd of Berwick at p 390 A).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;The House divided as to whether a mistake of law included a mis-prediction of the result of litigation (in that case, of the outcome of <i>Hazell v Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council</i> [1992] 2 AC 1, decided by this House in 1991 after a challenge made in 1989 by a local authority auditor). This issue brought the House into the difficult area of the declaratory nature of judgments. The majority held that mistake of law should be broadly interpreted. I will not try to note all the relevant passages in their complex reasoning, but I note in particular Lord Goff at p 379 G; Lord Hoffmann at p 400 D-E and Lord Hope at p 411 C-D. The minority held that this was unrealistic and amounted to falsification of history (Lord Browne-Wilkinson at p 358 A-B and Lord Lloyd at p 394 A).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;"Settled law" was therefore for the minority not a defence to a prima facie restitutionary claim, but a reason why there was no claim at all (Lord Browne-Wilkinson at pp 360A-362G and Lord Lloyd at p 394 B-H). The majority discussed "settled law" as a defence, as had recently been proposed by the Law Commission in its Report (No 227, 1994) on "Restitution: Mistakes of Law and Ultra Vires Public Authority Receipts and Payments" ('the 1994 report') para 5. The majority rejected the proposed defence (Lord Goff at pp 381 B-383C; Lord Hoffmann at p 401 B-D; Lord Hope at pp 414A-415B). The passage in Lord Goff's speech which I have just mentioned has led to much discussion and I shall refer to it as the debatable passage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a further issue as to "closed swaps" which is not relevant to this appeal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;The case had no European element at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123.&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> has attracted some academic criticism (notably from Professor - as he then was - Jack Beatson, who was the chief architect of the Law Commission report). It has also attracted some approbation (notably from Professor Burrows). It has not been argued that your Lordships should depart from the decision.</p>
<i></i><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judgments below</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;124.&nbsp;&nbsp;Park J addressed the first issue in a section of his judgment (paras 14-19) headed 'Does English law recognise a claim in restitution to recover taxes paid under a mistake of law?' He quoted at length what I have called the debatable passage in Lord Goff's speech in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i>. He concluded that it did not bear the meaning for which the Revenue contended, for a number of reasons (set out in para 18 of his judgment). In particular he noted that none of the other speeches in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> supported the view that the payment of unlawfully exacted tax was to be an exception to the new principle permitting recovery of money paid under a mistake of law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125.&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the second and third issues, Park J held, after a careful analysis (paras 20-32), that DMG did make all three payments of ACT under a mistake of law, and that the mistake was not discovered until the decision of the ECJ in <i>Hoechst</i> on 8 March 2001. He had already, at the Revenue's request, para 18 (iv), left open the fourth issue (as to a possible settled law defence). The fifth issue was not raised before him. On the sixth issue (as to the pleadings) he decided (para 38) that the amendments did not plead a new cause of action. Instead they merely gave further particulars of a cause of action which had already been pleaded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;126.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Court of Appeal (Buxton, Rix and Jonathan Parker LJJ) the cause of action issue was most fully covered in the long and careful judgment of Jonathan Parker LJ (paras 146-160, summarising the arguments, and paras 192-227, the Lord Justice's reasoning and conclusions). Buxton LJ set out his reasons separately (paras 265-291). On this issue Rix LJ agreed with both (paras 250 and 261). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;127.&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasoning on the cause of action issue in the judgments of Jonathan Parker LJ and Buxton LJ is complex and it is not easy to summarise it briefly. But the crucial passage in Jonathan Parker LJ's judgment seems to me to be para 195. He had just quoted from Lord Goff's speech in <i>Woolwich</i> [1993] AC 70, 176 approving the dissenting judgment of Wilson J in <i>Air Canada v British Columbia</i> (1989) 59 DLR (4th) 161, 169. The Lord Justice continued (para 195):</p>
<p></p><ul>"It seems to me that the above passage, notwithstanding that it is strictly obiter, is of direct significance in the context of the cause of action issue. Lord Goff is plainly referring to cases (of which the <i>Air Canada</i> case was one) in which there is an unlawful demand <i>and</i> a mistake of law by the taxpayer; indeed, if it were otherwise his reference to the mistake of law rule would not be explicable. His conclusion (as I read it) is that in such cases the mistake of law rule has no application since the taxpayer's cause of action is founded not on his mistake but on the unlawful nature of the demand (in effect, on the revenue's mistake): in other words, that the <i>Woolwich</i> cause of action effectively subsumes any cause of action which might otherwise exist for mistake of law."<p></p></ul>
<p>Jonathan Parker LJ went on to a very detailed discussion of the debatable passage in Lord Goff's speech in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i>, and to a consideration of Park J's reasons for not giving that passage the significance which the Revenue sought to attach to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;128.&nbsp;&nbsp;Buxton LJ took a rather different approach to the cause of action issue (paras 265-278). But he too concentrated on analysing the speeches of Lord Goff in <i>Woolwich</i> and <i>Kleinwort Benson</i>. He saw the development of the law in <i>Woolwich</i> (para 270) as "not any deduction from or development of the existing rules of restitution" and (para 271) as "a new remedy, perhaps drawing upon, but certainly not directly applying, ordinary principles of restitution." He pointed out that in <i>Woolwich</i> Lord Goff contemplated ([1993] AC 70, 174C-177C) that strict rules of limitation might be needed for cases of unlawfully exacted tax but that on DMG's interpretation of his speech Lord Goff must have "none the less looked with equanimity in the <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> case upon the prospect of claims in respect of such demands that, in the present case, were not raised until nine or ten years after demand made." On the same theme the Lord Justice referred (para 283) to the fact that "Woolwich is restricted to a claim with a six-year limitation period because, as Lord Goff pointed out in the <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> case, it had made no mistake."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;129.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second and third issues Jonathan Parker LJ agreed with the judge (paras 229-236). Buxton LJ took a different line (paras 279-284) developing his earlier reasoning and expressing the view (para 279):</p>
<p></p><ul>"that the considerations that lead to recovery in a case of an ultra vires demand can only with the greatest difficulty be fitted into the rules governing recovery on grounds of mistake."<p></p></ul>
<p>Rix LJ (para 262) agreed with Buxton LJ's observations. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;130.&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Jonathan Parker LJ dealt with the fourth issue (settled law) and he did so briefly (para 237), agreeing with the view of Lord Hoffmann in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> that it was a matter for Parliament. The Court of Appeal did not consider the fifth issue. On the sixth issue (pleadings) the majority agreed with the judge, but Buxton LJ dissented (see Jonathan Parker LJ at paras 238-248, Rix LJ at paras 252-260 and Buxton LJ at paras 292-297).</p>
<i></i><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cause of action issue</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;131.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, it is impossible to read through the judgments (totalling almost 300 paragraphs) in the Court of Appeal without some surprise at the amount of time which the court devoted to what a single Law Lord (however eminent, and without doubt Lord Goff is pre-eminent in this field) said about mistake of law in a case (<i>Woolwich</i>) in which the claimant was never under a mistake (and so the mistake of law rule was not an issue) and about unlawfully exacted taxes in a case (<i>Kleinwort Benson</i>) which had nothing to do with tax. I fear that this may have led to some basic matters of principle being overlooked, or at least being insufficiently considered. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;132.&nbsp;&nbsp;These matters of principle (which have very properly been relied on and developed before your Lordships) include the following: (1) the constitutional principle of equality; (2) the need for coherence in the development of the English law of unjust enrichment; (3) English law's general readiness to permit a claimant to chose between concurrent claims; (4) the consequences of treating the <i>Woolwich</i> principle as exhaustive and exclusive, especially as regards (i) mistake of fact (ii) limitation of actions and (iii) legal certainty of any proposed exception; and (5) the European element (which was not present in either <i>Woolwich</i> or <i>Kleinwort Benson</i>). I must develop these points briefly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;133.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the rule of law, the Crown (that is the executive government in its various emanations) is in general subject to the same common law obligations as ordinary citizens. This is recognised by section 21(1) of the Crown Proceedings Act 1947: see the observations of Vaisey J in <i>Sebel Products Limited v Commissioners of Customs and Excise </i>[1949] Ch 409, 413 (though the notion of implied contract applied in that case must now be obsolete). There are exceptions to this principle but they are generally the subject of express enactment. The Revenue's case requires a non-statutory exception whose extent is both far-reaching and uncertain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;134.&nbsp;&nbsp;Buxton LJ saw <i>Woolwich</i> as a major departure in the common law, rather than as an incremental development of the English law of unjust enrichment. I would respectfully disagree. <i>Woolwich</i> was certainly a very important development but the majority saw it as a development which was within the proper province of the court, and not an exercise in exorbitant judicial legislation. The Law Commission's thorough examination of <i>Woolwich</i> in its 1994 Report (Part VI paras 6.1-6.46) seems to have accepted this, while noting some uncertainties as to how far the principle would extend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;135.&nbsp;&nbsp;When Parliament enacts a special regime providing special rights and remedies, that regime may (but does not always) supersede and displace common law rights and remedies (or more general statutory rights and remedies). Whether it has that effect is a question of statutory construction: <i>Marcic v Thames Water Utilities Limited </i>[2003] UKHL 66; [2004] 2 AC 42, 56-58, paras 29-36 and <i>Autologic Holdings plc v Inland Revenue Commissioners </i>[2006] 1 AC 118 (which Mr Rabinowitz QC for DMG put forward as a procedural analogue to the present case). Where section 33 of the Taxes Management Act 1970 ("TMA") applies it does no doubt displace any common law remedy for tax paid under a mistake. But in <i>Woolwich</i> tax was demanded under a regulation which was void. There was therefore no valid assessment and the statutory regime was simply not engaged: see Lord Goff in <i>Woolwich</i> [1993] AC 70, 169. Similarly, the ECJ has decided in <i>Hoechst</i> that the ACT regime is unlawful under EU law so far as it discriminates between national and multi-national groups of companies. The Revenue accepts that neither section 33 of TMA (as it stood at the relevant time) nor any other statutory provision applies to the situation in which DMG finds itself. The gap in the statutory provisions cannot provide the Revenue with a defence, both because of <i>Woolwich</i> and, in the context of EU law, because of the principle of effectiveness. The appropriate remedy for DMG is, as the Revenue concedes, restitutionary in nature. It is not for the repayment of a principal sum unlawfully exacted from the taxpayer, but for its unlawful exaction before it became due. The ECJ has made it clear that the domestic court must provide an appropriate remedy, despite the principle reaffirmed by this House in <i>President of India v La Pintada Compania Navigacion SA</i> [1985] AC 104. Your Lordships heard no argument as to whether and how the <i>Pintada</i> principle applies to the law of unjust enrichment; I note that in his leading speech in the case, Lord Brandon covered (at pp 115-116) the position in terms of damages under common law, Admiralty law, equity and statute law, but did not refer to restitution or unjust enrichment. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;136.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would leave open the question whether DMG has to rely on any special principle of EU law in order to obtain a remedy in respect of an exaction which is unlawful only in being premature. In other respects, DMG's claim relies on ordinary domestic principles. English law generally permits a claimant to chose between concurrent causes of action and concurrent remedies as best suits his interests. Lord Goff has been one of the most important influences in developing that approach: see especially <i>Henderson v Merrett Syndicates Limited </i>[1995] 2 AC 145, 193-194:</p>
<p></p><ul>"My own belief is that, in the present context, the common law is not antipathetic to concurrent liability, and that there is no sound basis for a rule which automatically restricts the claimant to either a tortious or a contractual remedy. The result may be untidy; but, given that the tortious duty is imposed by the general law, and the contractual duty is attributable to the will of the parties, I do not find it objectionable that the claimant may be entitled to take advantage of the remedy which is most advantageous to him, subject only to ascertaining whether the tortious duty is so inconsistent with the applicable contract that, in accordance with ordinary principle, the parties must be taken to have agreed that the tortious remedy is to be limited or excluded."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;137.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Goff reaffirmed the same approach, in the context of unjust enrichment, in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> [1999] 2 AC 349, 387:</p>
<p></p><ul>"However an equally strong argument may perhaps be made in favour of mistake of law trumping failure of consideration, though either approach is antagonistic to the usual preference of English law to allow either of two alternative remedies to be available, leaving any possible conflict to be resolved by election at a later stage."<p></p></ul>
<p>The Law Commission took the same view in the 1994 Report (para 10 footnote 1). The claimant bank was allowed to put its case on mistake of law, rather than on payment under a void contract, precisely in order to rely on an extended limitation period under section 32(1)(c) of the Limitation Act 1980. None of the members of the Court of Appeal cited this passage from Lord Goff's speech or even, so far as I can see, paid any regard to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;138.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have so far been considering what appear to me to be the main positive arguments in favour of allowing the appeal, and their cumulative effect appears to me to be formidable. That effect is buttressed by considering some of the difficulties involved in the Revenue's case. In the first place, if the <i>Woolwich</i> principle is the only ground for recovery of wrongly paid tax, it would exclude not only an alternative cause of action based on mistake of law, but also one based on mistake of fact. That would involve a departure from a well-established principle from which public authorities are not excepted (see for instance <i>Meadows v Grand Junction Waterworks Company</i> (1905) 21 TLR 538) and I can see no good reason for doing so. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;139.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that the departure can be justified simply by pointing to the possibility that the claimant may, by relying on mistake, obtain a longer limitation period. Parliament has enacted that where there is an action for relief from the consequences of a mistake, time should not run so long as the mistake remains undiscovered. If that is thought to be too generous in some cases, Parliament can change it (and has done so by section 320 of the Finance Act 2004). But the notion that it is right to show some indulgence to a claimant labouring under an undiscovered mistake is an entirely natural one, and it is not to my mind made unnatural simply because the claim is for unlawfully exacted tax. Taxpayers naturally assume that Parliament has got it right. I am puzzled by Buxton LJ's reference (para 283) to the building society being </p>
<p></p><ul>"restricted to a claim with a six-year limitation period because, as Lord Goff pointed out in the <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> case it had made no mistake"<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the suggestion that this was somehow unfair. In <i>Woolwich</i> the building society was fortunate in having expert legal advice that the relevant regulation was invalid, and the resources and determination to take on the Revenue promptly. It did not need any extended limitation period. Many other taxpayers would not be in the same position. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;140.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the <i>Woolwich</i> principle is to be an exhaustive and exclusive regime for unlawfully exacted taxes, set apart from the general law of unjust enrichment, legal certainty would require the limits of the exception to be ascertainable with a fair degree of precision. In the debatable passage in his speech in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> Lord Goff referred twice to "taxes and other similar charges," which is imprecise. Mr Glick suggested that the similarity was to be found in the existence of a special statutory regime regulating recovery. This suggested test was not fully explored in argument but it seems unlikely to be a satisfactory means of setting a clear dividing line within a spectrum which stretches from central government taxes and duties through rates, community charge, drainage rates and charges, special levies and licence fees imposed by statute on different industrial and commercial activities, and charges made by statutory undertakers (as to the last category see <i>South of Scotland Electricity Board v British Oxygen Co Limited (No 2)</i> [1959] 1 WLR 587). This point was touched on, inconclusively, by the Privy Council in <i>Waikato Regional Airport v Attorney-General of New Zealand</i> [2003] UKPC 50 at para 80 (discriminatory charges levied on New Zealand airports in respect of official biosecurity services).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;141.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, all these considerations lead me to the conclusion that the judge was right, and the Court of Appeal was wrong, in relation to the cause of action issue. That is not to say that I see no difficulty in reconciling this conclusion with the debatable passage in Lord Goff's speech in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i>. Undoubtedly that passage represented part of Lord Goff's mature reflections on the development of the English law of unjust enrichment. It is not easy to reconcile the passage with the rest of Lord Goff's reasoning, but I think that the explanation is provided in the opinions of my noble and learned friends Lord Hoffmann and Lord Hope of Craighead, both of whom sat with Lord Goff in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> (and whose opinions I have had the great advantage of reading in draft). But whatever the difficulties of the passage, there are to my mind two clear beacons in Lord Goff's speech, one before and one after the debatable passage, which are clearer and more reliable guides. The first is his affirmation of a general right to recover money paid under a mistake of law ([1999] 2 AC 349, 375):</p>
<p></p><ul>"I would therefore conclude on issue (1) that the mistake of law rule should no longer be maintained as part of English law, and that English law should now recognise that there is a general right to recover money paid under a mistake, whether of fact or law, subject to the defences available in the law of restitution."<p></p></ul>
<p>The other passage, at p 387, is that referring to "the usual preference of English law to allow either of two alternative remedies" which I have already cited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;142.&nbsp;&nbsp;I reach this conclusion without any heavy reliance on principles of EU law, except perhaps in relation to the <i>Pintada </i>principle (which I regard as uncertain in relation to the law of unjust enrichment). But the European context confirms my conclusion. The domestic court must give DMG an equivalent and effective remedy, and that would not be achieved, in my opinion, if recovery were limited so as to exclude an alternative concurrent remedy which would be available in a dispute between private citizens.</p>
