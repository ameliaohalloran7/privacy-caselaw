<p class="para">133.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, that does not mean that it would be wrong to treat different stages of the possession-seeking exercise differently. For instance, where the reason for seeking possession (or, if relevant, the landlord’s knowledge), changes during the course of the procedure, it may be that an exercise, which had started off as lawful, could thereby become unlawful under the 1995 Act. </p>
<p class="para">134.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is convenient to mention another point at this juncture. It rightly remains common ground that Lewisham “manage[s]” the flat within section 22(3), and, until the oral argument developed before your Lordships, it had been common ground (albeit tacitly) that Mr Malcolm was “occupying” the flat. However, Lewisham suggested that, until he returned to live in the flat in May 2005, Mr Malcolm was not “occupying” the flat. In particular, therefore, it was said that he was not occupying the flat, and therefore entitled to the protection of section 22(3)(c), when the notice to quit was served and the possession proceedings were started. </p>
<p class="para">135.&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Mr Jan Luba QC, who appeared for Mr Malcolm, that it is too late for Lewisham to raise that argument. Neither the effect of the grant of the subtenancy nor the nature of Mr Malcolm’s intentions at the time of the subletting was examined before the Judge. Both or either of those matters could well be relevant to the issue of whether he was “occupying” the flat between June 2004 (when he sublet it) and May 2005 (when he returned). Further, there were hardly any submissions on the precise meaning in section 22(3) of “occupying", a word whose interpretation depends very much on context. Quite apart from this, Mr Malcolm was undoubtedly occupying the flat before Lewisham’s possession claim was heard, and he will be there if and when Lewisham applies for a warrant of execution.</p>
<i><p class="para">The comparator under section 24(1)(a) of the 1995 Act</p>
</i>
<p class="para">136.&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important and difficult issue raised on this appeal is the nature of the comparison exercised to be carried out in relation to a claim under section 24(1)(a). The issue may be characterised as identifying the meaning of “that reason” in the phrase “others to whom that reason does not or would not apply". Lewisham’s case is that “that reason” refers back to the “reason which relates to the disabled person’s disability", whereas Mr Malcolm (supported by the Commission) argues that “that reason” simply refers back to “the reason". Thus, on his case, unlike that of Lewisham, the causal link is not included when considering “that reason” in section 24(1)(a). On Lewisham’s case, the comparator involves stripping out the disability but not the reason, so there would only be discrimination if a non-disabled person to whom the same reason would apply would be accorded more favourable treatment. On Mr Malcolm’s case (supported by the Equality and Human Rights Commission), the comparator involves stripping out the reason and the disability, so there would discrimination if a non-disabled person to whom the reason did not apply was accorded more favourable treatment.</p>
<p class="para">137.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, in the present case, Lewisham says that there would be no discrimination even if the Court of Appeal was right in concluding that Mr Malcolm’s schizophrenia amounted to a disability within section 1(1), and there was a sufficient link between that disability and the reason for seeking possession. That is because Lewisham’s treatment of Mr Malcolm was no different from its treatment of any other secure tenant who had sublet. On the other hand, given that the only reason Lewisham is seeking possession is because Mr Malcolm had sublet, and the subletting, according to the Court of Appeal, was attributable to his disability, he contends that there was discrimination because he was “treated less favourably” than a non-disabled tenant who had not sublet.</p>
<p class="para">138.&nbsp;&nbsp;Either reading of section 24(1)(a) is linguistically defensible, and, as Mr Rabinder Singh QC, for the Commission, said, choosing between them is difficult. The point was considered by the Court of Appeal in <i>Clark v Novacold Ltd </i>[1999] ICR 951, in relation to the subsequently repealed section 5(1)(a), which contained effectively the same definition of discrimination, in relation to employment, as section 24(1)(a) in relation to premises<i>. </i>In a judgment, with which Beldam and Roch LJJ agreed, Mummery LJ decided that the interpretation promoted by Mr Malcolm in these proceedings, which I shall call the wider construction, was correct - see the discussion at 960G to 965D. </p>
<p class="para">139.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not without considerable misgivings, I have come to the conclusion that Lewisham’s argument, in favour of what I shall call as the narrower construction, is to be preferred, at least in relation to section 24(1)(a). Although either reading of the section can be said to accord with the words used, it appears to me that the narrower construction is the more natural. If “the reason” the landlord is seeking possession is non-payment of rent due to the tenant’s disability, to take as a comparator a non-disabled tenant who is similarly in arrear with his rent appears sensible, whereas, at least at first sight, it seems somewhat odd to use as a comparator a tenant who has not failed to pay rent at all. Indeed, in <i>Novacold</i>, Mummery LJ at 963B described the narrower construction as “the obvious way of determining” whether there had been discrimination (foreshadowing what my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill says at the start of para 14 of his opinion, which I have had the advantage of reading in draft).</p>
<p class="para">140.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, as Toulson LJ pithily said in the Court of Appeal at para 155, the wider construction would mean, at least on the basis of the present state of the authorities, “that the complainant is logically bound to be able to satisfy the requirement of showing that his treatment is less favourable than would be accorded others to whom the reason for his treatment did not apply” because “without the reason there would not be the treatment” The same point is made more fully by Lord Scott, in paras 32 and 33 of his opinion, and it obviously calls into question whether the wider construction is correct.</p>
<p class="para">141.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, it is fair to say that, on the narrower construction, the reach of section 22, and therefore its beneficial effect, is very limited. That is, in principle, a powerful argument in favour of the wider construction, as anti-discrimination statutes should, at least in general, be construed benevolently towards their intended beneficiaries. The consequences of the narrower construction would now be somewhat mitigated by sections 24A to 24M of the 1995 Act, which were added in 2005 and impose significant duties on landlords in relation to the terms of letting and the physical state of the demised and associated premises, where the tenant is disabled. However, the fact that those provisions now exist cannot be invoked as an aid to the construction of section 24. </p>
<p class="para">142.&nbsp;&nbsp;While the narrower construction results in section 24 having a very limited reach, the wider construction would, by contrast, produce a remarkably extensive, and, from a land owner’s point of view, potentially highly invasive, result. Indeed, as Mr James Goudie QC, for Lewisham, said, the consequences of the wider construction of section 24(3) are extraordinary, and have been commented on in the Court of Appeal, even when adopting it (see e.g. in <i>Manchester City Council v Romano </i>[2004] EWCA Civ 834, [2005] 1 WLR 2775, paras 121 to 123). It would mean that a secure tenant, whose failure (such as non-payment of rent, breach of covenant, or cesser of residence) would normally give a landlord a right to possession and a money claim, would be immune from suit, potentially indefinitely, if the failure was in some way causally linked to his disability. </p>
<p class="para">143.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, a private sector landlord is entitled to possession as of right against an assured tenant if more than eight weeks of rent is in arrear - see section 7(3) of, and ground 8 of Schedule 2 to, the Housing Act 1988. On the wider construction of section 24(1)(a), a landlord could not seek possession against a tenant on this ground if the arrears were attributable to the tenant’s disability, which would seem to be a somewhat startling result. It was a result considered and rejected by the Court of Appeal in <i>S v Floyd </i>[2008] EWCA Civ 201, where the tenant was 132 weeks in arrear. At para 69, Mummery LJ (with whom Lawrence Collins LJ and Munby J agreed) held that the landlord’s contractual right to possession on the basis of a mandatory ground (i.e. where the court did not have to be additionally satisfied that it was reasonable to order possession) was not precluded by section 22(3)(c). He distinguished the case from <i>Romano</i>, where the Court of Appeal, relying on <i>Novacold, </i>had reached a different conclusion in relation to a ground for possession where the landlord also had to establish that it was reasonable to order possession. </p>
<p class="para">144.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was agreed before your Lordships, rightly in my view, that the reasoning in para 69 of <i>Floyd </i>could not be supported: as a matter of logic. The right of a landlord of any premises to possession is always contractual, in the sense that he cannot obtain possession if he has no contractual right to it. The effect of statutes such as the Housing Acts 1985 and 1988 Acts is to fetter this contractual right: when one talks of a statutory provision giving the landlord the right to possession, the reality is that the provision removes a fetter on the landlord’s contractual right imposed by another statutory provision. Accordingly, the conclusions on this point in <i>Romano </i>and <i>Floyd</i> cannot stand together, as Lord Scott and my noble and learned friend, Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood have said. (However, if, as I believe, the result in <i>Floyd </i>is right, that emphatically does not mean that a tenant’s disability is irrelevant when considering, in a case such as <i>Romano</i>, whether it is reasonable to make an order for possession against him). </p>
<p class="para">145.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that Mummery LJ was unhappy about applying, indeed ultimately failed to apply, his reasoning in <i>Novacold </i>to the facts in <i>Floyd </i>is unsurprising. Indeed, it is very significant for present purposes, in that it calls into question the correctness of  the reasoning in <i>Novacold </i>on the proper approach to the statutory comparator, or at least the applicability of that reasoning to section 24(1)(a). </p>
<p class="para">146.&nbsp;&nbsp;As Lord Scott pointed out in argument, the effect of the wider construction of 24(1)(a) could produce a particularly unjust regime for landlords. Section 22(1) and (4) preclude discrimination by a prospective landlord so far as his preparedness to let, or to permit an assignment, to disabled persons. On the wider construction, this would mean that, under section 22(1) and (4), a landlord could not lawfully refuse to let, or permit an assignment, to a person with a record of non-payment of rent due to disability, so he would often be obliged to let to such a person. Thereafter, under section 22(3)(c), he might never obtain possession against that person for non-payment of rent. Indeed, in the light of the closing words of section 22(3)(c), Mr Luba accepted that the landlord could not even sue for rent arrears. .</p>
<p class="para">147.&nbsp;&nbsp;The wider construction appears to result in other surprising consequences. It would mean that a licensee, whose licence had expired and who refused to vacate because of physical or mental disability, could not be evicted, or even sued for damages, by virtue of section 22(3)(c). Even a person who entered as a trespasser would, as Mr Luba accepted, appear to be immune from suit if his entry or remaining on the property was attributable to his disability. </p>
<p class="para">148.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have mentioned, as a matter of general policy, there is much to be said for the view that the court should lean in favour of an interpretation which assists the intended beneficiaries of anti-discrimination legislation. However, the legitimate interests of those whose common law rights are affected by the legislation must also be borne in mind. If the wider construction results in the legislation benefiting more groups than the narrower construction, then, absent any good reason to the contrary, the former should prevail. However, where the wider construction would involve private rights being taken away without compensation, potentially in circumstances which could reasonably be regarded as extraordinary and positively penal, the policy arguments appear to me to point in favour of the narrower construction.</p>
<p class="para">149.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, it appears to me that considerable difficulties could be encountered in determining whether “the reason … relate[d] to the disability” if the wider construction was correct. In the present case, Lewisham contends that its reason for seeking possession was because of its housing management policy, which cannot be said to be related to Mr Malcolm’s disability. If that is right, then it seems to me that section 22(1)(c) would be a broken reed, as an evicting landlord could always claim that he was relying on his policy of obtaining possession whenever he could, or his policy of always seeking possession against tenants who breached their covenants. That would involve adopting a very narrow approach to the “reason” which, as I see it, would be inconsistent with the justification for, and indeed would defeat the purpose of, the wider construction in relation to the comparator. </p>
<p class="para">150.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if, in the present case, the reason was caught by section 24(1)(a), it would mean that <i>Floyd </i>was wrongly decided, which I find hard to accept, but it seems to me that it must follow. In that case, possession was sought because of non-payment of rent by the tenant, which was attributable to his disability, whereas here possession is sought because the tenant sublet, which, at least according to the Court of Appeal, was attributable to his disability. Indeed, I have difficulty in seeing how, as a matter of logic, the decision in <i>Williams v Richmond Court (Swansea) Ltd </i>[2006] EWCA Civ 1719<i>, </i>discussed at the end of para 85 of Baroness Hale’s opinion,<i> </i>could be justified if the present case is caught by section 24(1)(a). The reasons that the landlord  in that case refused to install a stair-lift, insofar as they were based on “aesthetics, cost of repair, inconvenience” (per Richards LJ at para 43), cannot alter the fact that, on the wider construction, the disabled tenant was being treated less favourably than her comparators, and the landlord’s reasons as quoted did not fall into any of the categories of statutory justification (although there was an additional reason which might have done, but does not appear to have been relied on).   </p>
<p class="para">151.&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, then, the wider construction accords less naturally with the words used in section 24(1)(a), it involves what, on analysis, amounts to a pointless comparator exercise, it produces startling, indeed penal, results, and it leads to difficulties when it comes to deciding if “the reason … relates to the … disability". For those reasons, I am of the view that, notwithstanding the consequent very limited scope of section 22, the narrower construction is to be preferred, at least unless there is a good reason, which I have not so far considered, to adopt the wider construction.</p>
<p class="para">152.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he saw considerable logic in adopting the narrower construction in <i>Novacold</i>, Mummery LJ favoured the wider construction for a number of reasons. The first was the difference between the language of the 1995 Act and that of other anti-discrimination legislation (at 963B-D). I am not convinced that the different language of one statute, concerned with a similar but different problem, can be safely relied on as a guide to the meaning of an expression in another statute. Secondly, Mummery LJ said that the wider construction avoided problems over comparators which the narrower construction could raise (at 963F-H). In my view, while such problems may well arise in the employment context, they would rarely, if ever, arise in the context of section 24 Indeed, as can be seen from para 45 in the judgment of Richards LJ in <i>Richmond Court</i>, the wider construction can lead to difficulties with comparators. </p>
<p class="para">153.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Mummery LJ cited an example (the exclusion of blind people from a café because of a general prohibition against dogs) given by the minister in his statement introducing the 1995 Act in the House of Commons, which suggests that the wider construction was intended by the legislature. In paras 76 to 79 of her opinion, Baroness Hale now takes that point further, by tracing the Parliamentary history of the wording of the discrimination definitions in the 1995 Act, and identifying another ministerial statement (in this House). I accept that both the drafting history and at least one of the two ministerial statements can fairly be said to support the wider construction, and they have caused me to review my preference for the narrower construction. </p>
<p class="para">154.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have reached the conclusion, however, that the parliamentary material does not justify adopting the wider construction. The issue is difficult, and neither interpretation produces a particularly satisfactory result. However, I do not think that this is one of those rare cases where recourse to ministerial statements is appropriate. The narrower construction, which I would adopt applying normal principles of interpretation, does give section 24 a pretty limited ambit, which some might regard as surprising, but it is far from absurd or capricious. The wider construction, however, does appear to lead to results which could be fairly characterised as absurd and capricious. It seems scarcely appropriate to invoke ministerial statements in support of such an interpretation. To put it another way, I am in insufficient doubt as to the correct answer to justify looking at the parliamentary material.</p>
<p class="para">155.&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite apart from this, I am not convinced that either of the ministerial statements can be regarded as conclusively indicating that the wider construction of section 24(1)(a) is what was intended by the legislature. The guide dog example, quoted by Mummery LJ, was not so expressed as to make it clear that the enforcement of a general ban on dogs in a restaurant was intended to be unlawfully discriminatory against blind people. All that the minister said was that “it would be a prima facie case of indirect discrimination against blind people and therefore unlawful". That does not tell one whether the prima facie conclusion would be displaced if the policy of the restaurant was to ban all dogs.</p>
<p class="para">156.&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, such discrimination would be covered by section 19(3)(a) or (f)  - being in relation to “access to and use of any place which members of the public are permitted to enter” or “facilities for … refreshment…”), in respect of which discrimination is defined in section 20. The discrimination discussed in the ministerial statement quoted by Baroness Hale is concerned with employment, and therefore related to what was section 4, in respect of which discrimination was defined in section 5. The present case, of course, is concerned with section 22, and hence with the definition of discrimination in section 24.  Under section 5(3), an employer was given a fairly wide ground for justifying discrimination, namely that he must have a reason for it which is “both material to the circumstances of the particular case and substantial". No such broad grounds exist under section 22(3).</p>
<p class="para">157.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that the three definitions of discrimination in the 1995 Act were all made at the same time, but no consideration whatever appears to have been given in parliament to the meaning, let alone the effect, of the reworded section 24(1)(a). It seems questionable whether, in any event, it would be right to take the exceptional course of relying on a ministerial statement in those circumstances.</p>
<p class="para">158.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would, on the face of it at least, be very surprising if section 24(1)(a) had a different meaning from the effectively identically worded section 5(1)(a), but it would not be an impossible conclusion. While the 1995 Act has a single definition of “disability” which is generally applicable, it has three effectively identical definitions of “discrimination", each of which applies in different fields (employment, goods facilities and services, and premises). The combination of the contrast between section 5(3) and section 24(3), and the fact that the wider construction of section 5(1)(a) has been assumed to be right for some years - perhaps together with other factors, such as subsequent implied parliamentary approval<i> </i>- could conceivably justify the decision in <i>Novacold </i>being correct as to the effect of section 5(1)(a), despite the conclusion I have reached as to the meaning of section 24(1)(a). However, no party argued for such a conclusion, and, as at present advised, it seems to me that this was realistic. As Lord Brown points out in para 111, the principle reasons for rejecting the wider construction of section 24(3) is its potentially extraordinarily penal consequences for property owners and the apparent pointlessness of the comparison exercise, and the same arguments apply to the wider construction of section 5(1)(a) in relation to employers.</p>
<i><p class="para">If the treatment was unlawful, does that give Mr Malcolm a defence?</p></i>
<p class="para">159.&nbsp;&nbsp;The discussion in the preceding section assumes that, if Lewisham was unlawfully discriminating against Mr Malcolm contrary to section 22(3)(c) by maintaining these proceedings, the court could not make an order for possession. Mr Singh argued, however, that a landlord’s right to possession in a case where section 22(3)(c) applied was not automatically barred, but was a matter for the court’s discretion. In other words, in a case such as this (or indeed <i>Romano </i>or <i>Floyd</i>), it was said that the court has to balance the landlord’s contractual right to possession (permitted, as it were, by the Housing Act) against the fact that section 22(3)(c) renders it “unlawful". </p>
<p class="para">160.&nbsp;&nbsp;In agreement with the Court of Appeal and with your Lordships, I cannot accept that argument. If the service of the notice to quit in the present case was unlawful under section 22(3)(c), then the court could not give effect to it. If, by seeking an order for possession, a landlord is acting in a way the legislature has held to be unlawful, then, again, the court cannot make such an order. In either case, the court would be permitting, indeed facilitating, an unlawful act. The fact that the court will not always enjoin an unlawful act (e.g. a trespass) is nothing to the point: it is one thing to refuse to restrain a common law tort; it is another to make an order enforcing a statutorily unlawful claim. Quite apart from this, the balancing exercise involved in exercising the suggested discretion would be very difficult, and there is no statutory or other guidance as to how it should be carried out: it would lead to unpredictability in an area of law where there is quite enough uncertainty already.</p>
<i><p class="para">The need for knowledge of the disability</p>
</i>
<p class="para">161.&nbsp;&nbsp;The question whether a landlord need know of a tenant’s particular disability in order to be guilty of discrimination under section 22 does not seem to me to be capable of an entirely simple answer. If, at the time of the alleged discriminatory act, the landlord has no reason to know of the tenant’s disability and the act is not inherently discriminatory, then I consider that a landlord would not be acting unlawfully. So, in this case, it seems to me that, when it served the notice to quit, Lewisham could not have been acting unlawfully, even if, as the Court of Appeal thought, the subletting had been causally linked to Mr Malcolm’s schizophrenia. Service of a notice to quit, either generally or because the tenant has sublet, is plainly not inherently discriminatory, and, at least on the evidence your Lordships have been taken to, Lewisham had no reason to think that Mr Malcolm suffered from schizophrenia or that it was linked to the subletting.</p>
<p class="para">162.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, it would require very clear words before a statute could render a person liable for damages for discrimination against a disabled person, owing to an act which was not inherently discriminatory carried out at a time when the person had no reason to know of the disability which could render the act discriminatory. Sections 22 to 25 contain no such clear words; indeed, if anything, rather the contrary. I agree with what all your Lordships say on this issue.</p>
<p class="para">163.&nbsp;&nbsp;Different considerations apply where the act is obviously liable to be actually or even potentially discriminatory. To take an obvious, rather crass, example, it would be discriminatory if a landlord advertised property as unavailable for people with one or more disabilities. Further, in a case such as the present, I consider that a landlord could be liable if, in all the circumstances, he reasonably ought to have been aware of the disability. Whether, in a particular case, it can be said that an act is obviously potentially discriminatory, or that a landlord ought to have been aware of the disability must turn very much of the facts of that case. In those circumstances and because the outcome of this appeal does not turn on such an issue, it is not appropriate (even if it were possible) to give any guidance on those matters. </p>
<i><p class="para">The “reason” for the treatment and the link with the disability</p>
</i>
<p class="para">164.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are various ways in which the “reason” under section 24(1)(a) can be characterised in this case. For instance, that Mr Malcolm had sublet, that he was in breach of covenant, that he had ceased to reside, that he had lost security of tenure, or that Lewisham wanted to control who lived in its housing stock. There was some dispute whether the “reason” refers to the landlord’s subjective motivation or the legal ground on which he relies, and, if it is the subjective motivation, whether one looks for a policy reason or a case-specific reason. Difficulties could also arise where there is more than one reason, or where it is said that the link between the reason and the disability is too indirect or slender.</p>
