<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;167.&nbsp;&nbsp;If <i>Moses v Macferlan</i> (1760) 2 Bur 1005 is recognisably the first leading case in English restitution law, then the first monograph on English restitution law can probably be identified as the work by Sir William Evans entitled "An Essay on the Action for Money Had and Received".  It was published in 1802 and dedicated to Sir Edward Law (later Lord Ellenborough). It is reprinted in [1998] RLR 3.  In its opening paragraphs, Evans identified the subject-matter of his study as </p>
<p></p><ul>"the action for money had and received, as enforcing an obligation to refund money which ought not to be retained."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;168.&nbsp;&nbsp;Evans quoted as a "proper introduction" to the subject the famous passage from the judgment of Lord Mansfield CJ in <i>Moses v Macferlan</i> (at p 1012):</p>
<p></p><ul>"This kind of equitable action, to recover back money, which ought not in justice to be kept, is very beneficial, and therefore much encouraged.  It lies for money which, <i>ex aequo et bono</i>, the defendant ought to refund; it does not lie for money paid by the plaintiff, which is claimed of him as payable in point of honour and honesty, although it could not have been recovered from him by any course of law; as in payment of a debt barred by the Statute of Limitations, or contracted during his infancy, or to the extent of principal and legal interest upon an usurious contract, or, for money fairly lost at play: because in all these cases, the defendant may retain it with a safe conscience, though by positive law he was barred from recovering.  But it lies for money paid by mistake; or upon a consideration which happens to fail; or for money got through imposition, (express or implied) or extortion; or oppression; or an undue advantage taken of the plaintiff's situation, contrary to laws made for the protection of persons under those circumstances.  In one word, the gist of this kind of action is, that the defendant, upon the circumstances of the case, is obliged by the ties of natural justice and equity, to refund the money."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;169.&nbsp;&nbsp;The last chapter (IX) of the essay is concerned with damages (which must be understood as meaning restitutionary awards).  It provides a convenient starting-point for considering interest on restitutionary awards.  After referring to <i>Dutch v Warren</i> (1721) (best reported within <i>Moses v Macferlan</i> (1760) 2 Burr 1005, 1010) Evans stated:</p>
<p></p><ul>"And it has been very lately determined, that in an action for money had and received, the plaintiff can recover nothing but the net sum received without interest.  <i>Walker v Constable</i> (1798) 1 Bos &amp; Pul 306.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>It seems however difficult to reconcile these two decisions, more especially the last, to the principles of general reasoning.  Where one party, by his refusal to complete a contract, gives the other a right to treat the contract as [a] nullity; why should that right, which is allowed in its nature, be restricted in its extent?<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>And though a recovery of incidental damages for the non-performance of a contract, would be repugnant to the nature of an action founded upon the disaffirmance of such contract, it is by no means a necessary consequence of that principle, that damages should not be allowed in respect of the interest of the money improperly detained; and this observation, in respect of the action, as it is brought for restitution of money unduly paid, and which is founded upon a legal fiction, will be more forcible where the allegation, which is commonly formal, is literally true: when money is actually received by one man for the use of another, and instead of being paid over, is placed at interest, or employed in business: but if there is a technical rule which governs the action in general, it would be incorrect to dispense with the application of it in particular cases."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;170.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Walker v Constable</i> (1798) 1 Bos &amp; Pul 306 was a claim for the return (with interest) of a deposit paid under an abandoned contract.  The relevant part of the report of the decision of the Court of Common Pleas is as follows (at p 307):</p>
<p></p><ul>"Buller J, that the plaintiff might perhaps be entitled to recover interest under the count for money had and received.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Adair having again mentioned the case this day, <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>The Court were of opinion, on the authority of <i>Moses v Macferlan </i>2 Bur 1005, that in an action for money had and received the Plaintiff could recover nothing but the net sum received without interest."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Moses v Macferlan</i>, Lord Mansfield did not make any reference to interest as such.  But the report shows that he was presented with arguments that the count for money had and received (which was, for procedural reasons, a popular form of action) should not be extended too far.  In that context he explained (at p 1010) that the count for money had and received had advantages for the litigants on both sides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"One great benefit, which arises to suitors from the nature of this action, is, that the plaintiff needs not state the special circumstances from which he concludes 'that, <i>ex aequo et bono</i>, the money received by the defendant, ought to be deemed as belonging to him:' he may declare generally 'that the money was received to his use;' and make out his case, at the trial.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>This is equally beneficial to the defendant. It is the most favourable way in which he can be sued: he can be liable no further than the money he has received; and against that, may go into every equitable defence, upon the general issue; he may claim every equitable allowance; he may prove a release without pleading it; in short, he may defend himself by everything which shews that the plaintiff <i>ex aequo et bono</i>, is not entitled to the whole of his demand, or to any part of it."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;171.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rabinowitz submitted that Lord Mansfield's reference to the defendant being liable "no further than the money he has received" did no more than exclude any consequential loss.  The fact that the judgment went on to refer to <i>Dutch v Warren</i> supports this.  In any case the practice of not awarding interest on the count for money had and received seems to have been partly procedural.  It was also strongly influenced by the rule in <i>Page v Newman,</i> under which the Court looked for an express or implied term as to interest.  This appears from <i>de Havilland v Bowerbank</i> (1807)  1 Camp 50 where the report shows that the point was reconsidered by Lord Ellenborough at the instance of the Attorney-General (at p 52):</p>
<p></p><ul>"Lord Ellenborough said, that the rule proposed, of considering how far the plaintiff was damnified was so wide, that it would let in interest in almost every case, and it afforded no assistance in drawing a line between cases where interest should be allowed, and where it should be refused.  If the party lost the use of his money, it was his own fault in not suing for it.  He thought, that where money of the plaintiff had come to the hands of the defendant, to establish a right to interest upon it, there should either be a specific agreement to that effect, or something should appear from which a promise to pay interest might be inferred, or proof should be given of the money being used."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;172.&nbsp;&nbsp;The same rule was reaffirmed by Tindal CJ and the other judges of the Court of Common Pleas in <i>Fruhling v Schroeder</i> (1835)  2 Bing (NC) 78.  Again the rule in <i>Page v Newman</i> (although not mentioned as such) seems to have been decisive (at p.79): </p>
<p></p><ul>"The rule has been laid down in so many cases, that interest cannot be recovered unless it be expressly reserved by the contract between the parties, or the payment of it is to be implied from the course of dealing between them, that it is unnecessary to refer to them."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;173.&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar approach was taken in an early 20th century appeal to the Privy Council from Sierra Leone, <i>Johnson v The King</i> [1904]  AC 817.  Johnson was a contractor who had grossly overcharged the government for his services in moving granite to a naval installation in Freetown.  He presented vouchers for moving over 4,000 tons of granite when he had actually moved less than 450 tons.  He was sued for the amount overpaid, a sum of just over £8,000, together with interest.  But although he had by then been prosecuted, convicted and imprisoned, and though fraud was pleaded in the civil claim, at trial the case was not rested on fraud.  The Privy Council held that that was fatal to the claim for interest (Johnson had paid into court the principal sum claimed).  Lord Macnaghten stated (at p.821):</p>
<p></p><ul>"The learned counsel for the defendant pointed out that fraud had not been proved in the action.  But the learned judge held that it was unnecessary to go into that point, as the defendant admitted 'receiving the money by mistake or as overpayment.'  Consequently he thought the law would 'imply a promise from defendant to pay back to the plaintiff the money paid in excess.'  He thought the allegation of special damage in the statement of claim sufficient, and gave 'judgment for the plaintiff for £428.13s.3d. damages by way of interest without costs.'<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Having regard to the law as settled by the judgment of the House of Lords in the case of <i>London, Chatham and Dover Ry Co v South Eastern Ry Co</i> it is impossible to support the decision of the Acting Chief Justice on the ground upon which it was rested."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, a principle applicable to contractual debts was being applied to a restitutionary claim, because it was treated as quasi-contractual in nature (this point is well made in Edelman and Cassidy Interest Awards in Australia, part 1<i> </i>p 93). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;174.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, the constant search, in these old cases, for an express or implied term as to interest reflects the fact that unjust enrichment was for a very long time regarded as a sort of appendage to the law of contract.  That is how Lord Mansfield put it in <i>Moses v Macferlan</i> (1760)  2 Bur 1005, 1008,</p>
<p></p><ul>"If the defendant be under an obligation, from the ties of natural justice, to refund; the law implies a debt, and gives this action, founded in the equity of the plaintiff's case, as it were upon a contract ('<i>quasi ex contractu</i>,' as the Roman law expresses it)."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was therefore natural that the rule as to interest on contractual debts should be applied to restitutionary awards.  The term "quasi-contract" should not have survived Lord Wright's great speech in <i>Fibrosa Spolka Akcyjna v Fairbairn Lawson Combe Barbour Ltd </i>[1943] AC 32, 61, though in fact it lingered on for another generation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;175.&nbsp;&nbsp;It may have received its final <i>quietus</i> with the judgment of Robert Goff J in <i>BP Exploration Co (Libya) Ltd v Hunt (No 2)</i> [1979] 1 WLR 783 (upheld by this House [1983] 2 AC 352).  In his judgment Robert Goff J, as well as restating the principles underlying unjust enrichment, decided that the wording of section 3(1) of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934 was wide enough to include interest on restitutionary awards, so that there is a statutory power (now found in section 35A of the Supreme Court Act 1981) to award simple interest, at the Court's discretion, on a restitutionary award.  That was plainly a step forward, but it may have distracted attention from considering where (apart from statute) restitutionary interest stood once unjust enrichment had been set free from the fettering fiction of quasi-contract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;176.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Chancery was more generous in giving interest on restitutionary awards, as appears from the judgment of Malins VC in <i>In re Maria Anna and Steinbank Coal and Coke Company (McKewan's case)</i> (1877)  6 Ch D 447, 455-456  (upheld by the Court of Appeal, without a reasoned judgment on this point, at p 462).  Interest was ordered as of course against a fiduciary agent who failed to account (<i>Harsant v Blaine, Macdonald &amp; </i>Co (1887) 56 LJQB 511, followed by the High Court of Australia in <i>Bayne v Stephens</i> (1908) 8 CLR 1).  But at equity too there were anomalies: in particular a personal restitutionary claim to recover a mistakenly paid legacy seems not to have carried interest, although a proprietary restitutionary claim did so: see <i>Re Diplock; Diplock v Wintle</i> [1948]  Ch 465, 506-507 (following, on the personal claim, <i>Gittins v Steele</i> (1818)  1 Swanst 199, a decision of Lord Eldon LC) and at 558 (on the proprietary claims).  <i>Gittins v Steele</i> was discussed by Lord Goff and Lord Woolf in <i>Westdeutsche</i> [1996] AC 669, 694, 730. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;177.&nbsp;&nbsp;In short the state of English law as regards interest in respect of restitutionary claims (considered as a genus) has been at least as confused as that in respect of compensatory claims.  It is regrettable that (for reasons adverted to by my noble and learned friend Lord Mance, whose opinion I have had the advantage of reading in draft) the whole subject was not more fully investigated in <i>Westdeutsche</i>.  In the event, this House's decision to depart from <i>Sinclair v Brougham</i> [1914]  AC 398 (a possibility not even hinted at, so far as I can see, in the Court of Appeal [1994] 1 WLR 938) threw the argument on interest into disarray, and the three members of the House who decided not to develop the equitable jurisdiction to award interest relied strongly on the absence of full argument (see Lord Browne-Wilkinson at p 718, Lord Slynn of Hadley at pp 718-719 and Lord Lloyd of Berwick at pp 738-739).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;178.&nbsp;&nbsp;The crucial insight in the speeches of Lord Nicholls and Lord Hope is, if I may respectfully say so, the recognition that what Lord Nicholls calls income benefits are more accurately characterised as an integral part of the overall benefit obtained by a defendant who is unjustly enriched.  Full restitution requires the whole benefit to be recouped by the enriched party: otherwise "the unravelling would be partial only" (Lord Nicholls in <i>Nykredit Mortgage Bank plc v Edward Erdman Group Ltd</i> [1997] 1 WLR 1627, 1637).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;179.&nbsp;&nbsp;That was a case where money paid in damages had to be refunded in consequence of an appellate judgment.  The same principle has been applied by differently constituted divisions of the Court of Appeal of New South Wales and by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia (<i>Heydon v NRMA Ltd (No 2)</i> (2001)  53 NSWLR 600;  <i>Roads and Traffic Authority v Ryan (No 2)</i> [2002]  NSWCA 128 (16 May 2002); <i>Cornwall v Rowan (No 2)</i> [2005]  SASC 122 (1 April 2005)).  In the first of these cases Mason P (at pp 604-606) cited from his judgment in <i>National Australia Bank Ltd v Budget Stationery Supplies Pty Ltd </i>(23 April 1997, unreported).  Having set out a long catalogue of cases in which the <i>London, Chatham</i> rule had been bypassed, Mason P continued:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Passing <i>London, Chatham</i> like ships in the night, these cases proceeded upon the obvious principle that, when A retains money owned by or owing to B over a period of time, A derives a benefit (at B's expense) usually measurable by what A would have had to pay in the market to borrow that sum for that period.  Since this benefit is derived without justification and at the expense of the person to whom the principal sum was due, we should now recognise it as an unjust enrichment.  It stands independently of, but appurtenant upon the obligation to pay, the 'principal' sum."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also noted the doubts as to a "free-standing" right to interest expressed in the High Court in <i>Commonwealth of Australia v SCI Operations Pty Ltd</i> (1998)  192 CLR 285, 316-7. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;180.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to add a word about terminology.  In the course of argument the expression 'disgorgement interest' was frequently used, sometimes (if I understood counsel correctly) as a synonym for restitutionary interest, sometimes as a species of restitutionary interest, and sometimes in contrast to restitutionary interest.  It is hard to make progress through that sort of confusion.  There is a clear need for a vocabulary, generally understood and accepted, to distinguish between (1) proprietary claims which may involve tracing in equity (as in <i>Attorney General for Hong Kong v Reid</i> [1994]  1 AC 324); (2) personal claims for an account of profits (that is, for a sum equal to the profits actually made by the defendant); and (3) personal claims for interest which represents (in a more or less conventional way) the benefit which the defendant is presumed to have derived from money in his hands.</p>
<i><p><i>The ECJ judgment in Hoechst</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;181.&nbsp;&nbsp;In his opinion Lord Hope has fully analysed the effect of paragraphs 77 to 96 of the judgment of the ECJ in <i>Hoechst</i> [2007] Ch 620. I respectfully agree with his analysis. While leaving causes of action and remedies to the national court, the ECJ has made clear that the national court must award an effective remedy.  The ECJ emphasised (para 88) that </p>
<p></p><ul>"in an action for restitution the principal sum due is none other than the amount of interest which would have been generated by the sum, use of which was lost as a result of the premature levy of the tax."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without referring in terms to <i>La Pintada </i>[1985] AC 104, it made clear that the rule in that case must not be applied.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;182.&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly in the paragraphs of its judgment dealing with a compensatory award the ECJ distinguished (para 93) <i>R v Secretary of State for Social Security, Ex p Sutton</i>  (Case C-66/95) [1997] ICR 961 as a case where entitlement to interest was not an essential component of the claimant's right, stating that: </p>
<p></p><ul>"in the present cases, it is precisely the interest itself which represents what would have been available to the claimants, had it not been for the inequality of treatment, and which constitutes the essential component of the right conferred on them."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead it compared the cases with <i>Marshall v Southampton and South West Hampshire Area Health Authority (Teaching) (No 2)</i> (Case C-271/91) [1994] QB 126, in which the requisite full compensation had to include an allowance for the time value of money.  This case is even stronger because the time value element is not ancillary but absolutely central to the claim.</p>
<i><p><i>Conclusions</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;183.&nbsp;&nbsp;The judgment of the ECJ is in my opinion a powerful encouragement for this House to reconsider the basis on which a monetary award reversing unjust enrichment can and should take account of the time value of money.  In modern economic conditions simple interest does not provide full compensation in a case where unjust enrichment has lasted for a significant period (a fact which is now reflected, as Lord Hope points out, in the practice of the European Commission).  As Hobhouse J said in <i>Westdeutsche</i> at first instance, [1994] 4 All ER 890, 955,</p>
<p></p><ul>"Simple interest does not reflect the actual value of money.  Anyone who lends or borrows money on a commercial basis receives or pays interest periodically and if that interest is not paid it is compounded (eg <i>Wallersteiner v Moir No 2</i> [1975]  QB 373 and <i>National Bank of Greece SA v Pinios Shipping Co, The Maira</i> [1990]  1 AC 637).  I see no reason why I should deny the plaintiff a complete remedy or allow the defendant arbitrarily to retain part of the enrichment which it has unjustly enjoyed."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hobhouse J was of course delivering his judgment before this House decided not to follow <i>Sinclair v Brougham</i> [1914]  AC 398, and so at a time when there appeared to be an indisputable equitable jurisdiction to award compound interest in a case of this sort.  The House's decision in <i>Westdeutsche</i> could be distinguished (except in relation to those cases, mentioned in para 33 of Park J's judgment, where amounts of ACT were actually repayable as principal sums) on the basis that in <i>Westdeutsche</i> the House was not concerned (or at any rate did not perceive itself as concerned) with a case where part of the principal sum had been repaid before issue of the writ (in fact the position was more complicated, as the Court of Appeal pointed out in <i>IM Properties plc v Cape &amp; Dalgleish</i> [1999]  QB 279 at pp 305 (Waller LJ) and 308 (Hobhouse LJ)).  But such a distinction would be anomalous and might be thought to leave the law in an even less satisfactory state.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;184.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Nicholls and Lord Hope propose to cut through the thicket of problems by recognizing a restitutionary remedy available as of right at common law, subject to the Court's power to resort to "subjective devaluation" in order to avoid injustice in hard cases.  This would be following a course which, in <i>Westdeutsche</i>, was not so much rejected as assumed not to be open.  I must confess that my own inclination would be to take the course which this House came very close to taking, but ultimately drew back from taking, in <i>Westdeutsche</i>: that is to extend the court's equitable jurisdiction to award compound interest.  Before your Lordships the law has been much more fully investigated, and in my opinion there are compelling reasons for departing from <i>Westdeutsche</i>, and recognising the force of Lord Goff's and Lord Woolf's powerful dissenting speeches in that case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;185.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Lord Goff [1996] AC 669, 695-697 and Lord Woolf (at 721-723) saw their preferred solution as an extension of equity's auxiliary jurisdiction in order to make good the inadequacy of a common law remedy.  That would in my opinion be a principled development in the still-evolving relationship between equity and the common law (see Professor Andrew Burrows, "We Do This at Common Law but That in Equity" (2002) 22 OJLS 1).  It would be a further and permissible step in the progress which this House has made towards developing what Lord Goff (in <i>Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Lincoln City Council</i> [1999] 2 AC 349, 372G) referred to as "a coherent law of restitution." </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;186.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Westdeutsche</i> Lord Goff and Lord Woolf both considered (at 691 and 723 respectively) that on the facts of that case compound interest was required in order to achieve complete restitution and reverse unjust enrichment.  Lord Woolf recognised (at 722) that the exercise of the auxiliary jurisdiction would (as with all equitable remedies) be discretionary, and (at 724) that compound interest should not be awarded if the facts were such that the defendant would not have earned compound interest.  Awards of simple interest under section 35A of the Supreme Court Act 1981 are also discretionary, but the Court's exercise of its discretion causes few difficulties in practice.  In my opinion this is clearly a case in which compound interest should be awarded, since (i) it is a case where Community law requires full restitution; (ii) the defendant is economically powerful and sophisticated and must be supposed (as the agreed "conventional basis" seems to recognise) to have taken full advantage of its premature receipts of ACT; and (iii) it is not suggested that the claimant has been at fault or has been dilatory in making or pursuing its claim.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;187.&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel some apprehension about the suggested conclusion that compound interest should be available as of right, subject only to an exception for "subjective devaluation," a concept normally applicable to benefits in kind (see Birks, An Introduction to the Law of Restitution, revised 1989 edition p.109, quoting Robert Goff J in <i>BP Exploration Co (Libya) Ltd v Hunt (No 2)</i> [1979] 1 WLR 783, 799).  It is true that the time value of money (as opposed to money itself) may be regarded as a "non-money benefit", as Birks does in Unjust Enrichment, 2nd ed. P.53.  But it is a benefit which can readily be quantified in money terms; that has been, for many centuries, the function of interest.  The discretionary nature of an equitable award of interest provides the necessary flexibility, though I would expect the principles for the exercise of the discretion to develop along familiar and predictable lines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;188.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case either the common law route or the equitable route leads to the same conclusion.  The appropriate exercise of discretion is to order the Revenue to pay compound interest at a conventional rate calculated by reference to the average cost of government borrowing during the relevant period.  I would therefore dismiss the appeal and make the order proposed by Lord Hope.</p>
LORD MANCE
<p><b>My Lords,</b></p>
<i><p><b>Introduction</b></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;189.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a further appeal in the series relating to advance corporation tax ("ACT"). It has involved two hearings, one of two days in November 2006 and a further day's hearing at the House's request in May 2007. ACT was until 5th April 1999 levied under s.14 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. But it was held by the European Court of Justice in Joined Cases C-397/98 and C-410/98, <i>Metallgesellschaft Limited and Others v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue and HM Attorney General</i> [2001] Ch 620, to discriminate unlawfully against companies with parents resident in other Member States. Lord Hoffmann, in <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Group Plc v. H. M. Inland Revenue Commissioners </i>[2006] UKHL 49, [2007] 1 AC 558 described the conceptual basis of ACT:</p>
<p></p><ul>"3. ….. The tax ….. was in theory corporation tax payable in advance of the date on which it would otherwise have been payable. A company resident in the United Kingdom pays corporation tax on profits arising in a given accounting period and, generally speaking, the tax is payable nine months after the period ends. But the trigger for the payment of [advance] corporation tax was the payment of a dividend. A company which paid a dividend became liable to account to the Inland Revenue for ACT calculated as a proportion of the dividend. This could afterwards be set off against the corporation tax ('mainstream corporation tax' or 'MCT') which became chargeable on its profits. The revenue thereby obtained early payment of the tax and, in cases in which the company's liability for MCT turned out to be less than it had paid as ACT, payment of tax which would not otherwise have fallen due.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;The rule that ACT was payable on dividends was however subject to an exception if the dividend was paid to a parent company in the same group. Under section 247 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 the company and its parent could jointly make a group income election which gave them the right to be treated for the purposes of ACT as if they were the same company. No ACT would be payable on the distribution by the subsidiary. It would however be payable on any distribution by the parent. The Act confined the right of election to cases in which the parent was resident in the United Kingdom. Otherwise a subsidiary which had elected would not be liable to ACT and the parent, being non-resident, would not be liable either.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the <i>Metallgesellschaft Hoechst</i> case the Court of Justice decided that these arrangements infringed the right of establishment guaranteed by article 52 (now 43) of the EC Treaty in that they discriminated against companies resident in other member states. It held that the companies which had been unlawfully required to pay ACT were entitled to restitution or compensation. The nature of the remedies, the procedures by which they could be enforced and matters like the appropriate limitation periods were said to be matters for domestic law. The only specific qualification imposed by the Court of Justice was that English courts could not apply the rule in the <i>The Pintada</i> (<i>President of India v La Pintada Cia Navigacion SA</i> [1985] AC 104) to deny any recovery of interest to a claimant whose ACT had been set off against MCT before the commencement of proceedings. The claimant was entitled to be compensated for loss of the use of the money between the date on which it was paid and the date when MCT became due. …."<p></p></ul>
