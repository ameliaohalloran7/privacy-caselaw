<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;155.&nbsp;&nbsp;But here the accompanying text made it plain that these photographs were different. They showed her coming either to or from the NA meeting. They showed her in the company of others, some of whom were undoubtedly part of the group. They showed the place where the meeting was taking place, which will have been entirely recognisable to anyone who knew the locality. A picture is 'worth a thousand words' because it adds to the impact of what the words convey; but it also adds to the information given in those words. If nothing else, it tells the reader what everyone looked like; in this case it also told the reader what the place looked like.  In context, it also added to the potential harm, by making her think that she was being followed or betrayed, and deterring her from going back to the same place again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;156.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no need to do this. The editor accepted that even without the photographs, it would have been a front page story. He had his basic information and he had his quotes. There is no shortage of photographs with which to illustrate and brighten up a story about Naomi Campbell. No doubt some of those available are less flattering than others, so that if he had wanted to run a hostile piece he could have done so. The fact that it was a sympathetic story is neither here nor there. The way in which he chose to present the information he was entitled to reveal was entirely a matter for him. The photographs would have been useful in proving the truth of the story had this been challenged, but there was no need to publish them for this purpose. The credibility of the story with the public would stand or fall with the credibility of Daily Mirror stories generally. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;157.&nbsp;&nbsp;The weight to be attached to these various considerations is a matter of fact and degree. Not every statement about a person's health will carry the badge of confidentiality or risk doing harm to that person's physical or moral integrity. The privacy interest in the fact that a public figure has a cold or a broken leg is unlikely to be strong enough to justify restricting the press's freedom to report it. What harm could it possibly do?  Sometimes there will be other justifications for publishing, especially where the information is relevant to the capacity of a public figure to do the job. But that is not this case and in this case there was, as the judge found, a risk that publication would do harm. The risk of harm is what matters at this stage, rather than the proof that actual harm has occurred. People trying to recover from drug addiction need considerable dedication and commitment, along with constant reinforcement from those around them. That is why organisations like Narcotics Anonymous were set up and why they can do so much good. Blundering in when matters are acknowledged to be at a 'fragile' stage may do great harm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;158.&nbsp;&nbsp;The trial judge was well placed to assess these matters. He could tell whether the impact of the story on her was serious or trivial. The fact that the story had been published at all was bound to cause distress and possibly interfere with her progress. But he was best placed to judge whether the additional information and the photographs had added significantly both to the distress and the potential harm. He accepted her evidence that it had done so. He could also tell how serious an interference with press freedom it would have been to publish the essential parts of the story without the additional material and how difficult a decision this would have been for an editor who had been told that it was a medical matter and that it would be morally wrong to publish it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;159.&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge was also obliged by section 12(4)(b) of the 1998 Act, not only to have particular regard to the importance of the Convention right to freedom of expression, but also to any relevant privacy code. The Press Complaints Commission Code of Practice supports rather than undermines the conclusion he reached:</p>
<p></p><ul>"3. * Privacy<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>i)&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private and family life, home, health and correspondence. A publication will be expected to justify intrusions into any individual's private life without consent.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of long lens photography to take pictures of people in private places without their consent is unacceptable.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Note - Private places are public or private property where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>The public interest<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>There may be exceptions to the clauses marked * where they can be demonstrated to be in the public interest.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The public interest includes:<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>i)&nbsp;&nbsp;Detecting or exposing crime or a serious misdemeanour.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;Protecting public health and safety.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;Preventing the pubic from being misled by some statement or action of an individual or organisation. . . . "<p></p></ul>
<p>This would appear to expect almost exactly the exercise conducted above and to lead to the same conclusion as the judge. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;160.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore allow this appeal and restore the order of the judge.</p>
LORD CARSWELL
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;161.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the advantage of reading in draft the opinions of my noble and learned friends, Lord Hope of Craighead and Baroness Hale of Richmond, and I agree with them that the appeal should be allowed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;162.&nbsp;&nbsp;The arguments advanced to your Lordships ranged over a wide spectrum of issues in the law of breach of confidence, but in the end they seemed to me to come down to fairly short points and straightforward questions, which involved the application of reasonably well settled principles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;163.&nbsp;&nbsp;The material in the article the subject of this appeal was divided by counsel into five categories, set out in paragraph 88 of Lord Hope's opinion, to which I would refer.  It was not in dispute that the information was imparted in confidence to the respondents, but that they were in the circumstances of the case justified in publishing that contained in the first two categories, the facts that the appellant was a drug addict and that she was receiving treatment for her addiction.  These facts would ordinarily be regarded as matters of confidential information.  The justification for their publication in this case, however, consists in the fact that the appellant is a well known figure who courts rather than shuns publicity, described as a role model for other young women, who had consistently lied about her drug addiction and compared herself favourably with others in the fashion business who were regular users of drugs.  By these actions she had forfeited the protection to which she would otherwise have been entitled and made the information about her addiction and treatment a matter of legitimate public comment on which the Press were entitled to put the record straight.  The contest in this litigation centred round the question whether the respondents were on the same basis entitled to publish the material comprised in the third, fourth and fifth categories, as the Court of Appeal held, or whether it fell outside the class of information the subject of legitimate comment and should be treated as information received in confidence which should not have been published.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;164.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal drew a distinction between the information that the appellant was receiving therapy from Narcotics Anonymous and details of the treatment of a medical condition, regarding the latter but not the former as private information.  They did not regard it as more than a "peripheral disclosure" and considered that the publication of the details given in the "Mirror" about the appellant's attendance at NA meetings was not in its context sufficiently significant to amount to a breach of duty of confidence owed to her.  They held that a reasonable person of ordinary sensibilities, on reading that the appellant was a drug addict, would not find it offensive that the "Mirror" newspaper also disclosed that she was attending meetings of Narcotics Anonymous (paragraph 54 of their judgment).  It was therefore not of sufficient significance to shock the conscience and justify the intervention of the court (paragraph 56).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;165.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am unable to agree with the distinction drawn by the Court of Appeal and for the reasons given by Lord Hope and Lady Hale I consider that the information was private.  It seems to me that the publication of the details of the appellant's course of treatment at NA and of the photographs taken surreptitiously in the street of her emerging from a meeting went significantly beyond the publication of the fact that she was receiving therapy or that she was engaged in a course of therapy with NA.  It revealed where the treatment was taking place and the text went into the frequency of her treatment.  In this way it intruded into what had some of the characteristics of medical treatment and it tended to deter her from continuing the treatment which was in her interest and also to inhibit other persons attending the course from staying with it, when they might be concerned that their participation might become public knowledge.  This in my view went beyond disclosure which was, in the words of the Court of Appeal, "peripheral to" the publication of the information that the appellant was a drug addict who was receiving treatment and was capable of constituting breach of confidence.  One cannot disregard the fact that photographs are a powerful prop to a written article and a much valued part of newspaper reporting, especially in the tabloid or popular press (hence the enthusiasm of paparazzi to obtain pictures of celebrities for publication in the newspapers).  I think that the Court of Appeal dismissed them too readily as adding little to the reports already published and that they were not justified in rejecting the judge's conclusions on this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;166.&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows that it is not necessary in this case to ask, in the terms formulated in the judgment of Gleeson CJ in <i>Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd </i>(2001) 208 CLR 199 at para 41, whether disclosure of the information would be highly offensive to a reasonable person of ordinary sensibilities.  It is sufficiently established by the nature of the material that it was private information which attracted the duty of observing the confidence in which it was imparted to the respondents.  It also follows in my opinion that the motives of the respondents in publishing the information, which they claim to have done in order to give a sympathetic treatment to the subject, do not constitute a defence, if the publication of the material in the third, fourth and fifth categories revealed confidential material.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;167.&nbsp;&nbsp;One must then move to the balancing exercise, which involves consideration of articles 8 and 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the process which was described in some detail by Lord Woolf CJ in paragraph 11 of his judgment in <i>A v B plc </i>[2003] QB 195, 204-210.  The carrying out of the balancing is at the centre of this case and forms the point at which the two currents of opinion divide.  I agree with the analysis contained in paragraphs 105 to 113 of Lord Hope's opinion in the present appeal and am gratefully content to adopt it.  I also agree with him that in order to justify limiting the article 10 right to freedom of expression the restrictions imposed must be rational, fair and not arbitrary, and they must impair the right no more than necessary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;168.&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolution of this question depends on the weight which one attributes to several factors, the extent of the distress to the appellant and the potential adverse effects on her drug therapy, the extent to which one judges the material in categories 3, 4 and 5 to have gone beyond that contained in categories 1 and 2, and the degree of latitude which should be allowed to the press in the way in which it chooses to present a story.  Weighing and balancing these factors is a process which may well lead different people to different conclusions, as one may readily see from consideration of the judgments of the courts below and the opinions given by the several members of the Appellate Committee of your Lordships' House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;169.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion it is a delicately balanced decision, and the answer to the questions which one must ask is by no means self-evident.  My own conclusion is the same as that reached by Lord Hope and Lady Hale.  My reasons can be expressed in fairly short compass.  Publication of the details about the appellant's attendance at therapy carried out by Narcotics Anonymous, highlighted by the photographs printed, constituted in my judgment a considerable intrusion into her private affairs, which was capable of causing substantial distress, and on her evidence did cause it to her.  It is difficult to assess how much, if any, actual harm it may have done to her progress in therapy.  In her evidence the appellant said that she had not gone back to the World's End centre of NA since the article was published and that she had only attended about four meetings in other centres in England, though she had gone to meetings abroad and met privately at her home with other NA attendees.  It seems to me clear, however, that the publication of the article did create a risk of causing a significant setback to her recovery.  In favour of the respondents it is urged that the material in categories 3, 4 and 5 differed very little in kind from that in categories 1 and 2, the view which found favour with the Court of Appeal.  My noble and learned friends, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead and Lord Hoffmann, also emphasised the importance of allowing a proper degree of journalistic margin to the press to deal with a legitimate story in its own way, without imposing unnecessary shackles on its freedom to publish detail and photographs which add colour and conviction.  I do not minimise these factors, which are part of the legitimate function of a free press and require to be given proper weight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;170.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion the balance comes down in favour of the appellant on the issues in this appeal.  I would not myself attempt to isolate which of the contents of categories 3, 4 and 5 is more harmful or tips the balance.  I find it sufficient to hold that the information contained in categories 3 and 4, allied to the photographs in category 5, went significantly beyond the revelation that the appellant was a drug addict and was engaged in drug therapy.  I consider that it constituted such an intrusion into the appellant's private affairs that the factors relied upon by respondents do not suffice to justify publication.  I am unable to accept that such publication was necessary to maintain the newspaper's credibility.</p>
