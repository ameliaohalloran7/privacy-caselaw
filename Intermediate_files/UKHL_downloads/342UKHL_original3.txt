<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;48.&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been in this case a full and satisfactory investigation.  Mrs Middleton does not seek another inquest.  The conclusions of the jury, which Mrs Middleton sought to publicise, have been published to the world.  No purpose is served by a declaration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;49.&nbsp;&nbsp;The arguments of the Secretary of State and Mrs Middleton on the acceptability of the inquest regime to discharge the state's procedural investigative obligation under article 2 have, in each case, succeeded in part and failed in part.  But the Secretary of State has succeeded in persuading the House that the Court of Appeal's declaration should be set aside.  To that extent his appeal succeeds.  We make no order for the payment of costs by any party. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this appeal no question was raised on the retrospective application of the Human Rights Act and the Convention. They were assumed to be applicable. Nothing in this opinion should be understood to throw doubt on the conclusion of the House in <i>In re McKerr </i>[2004] UKHL 12.</p>
