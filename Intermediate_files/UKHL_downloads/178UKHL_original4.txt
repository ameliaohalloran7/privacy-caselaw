<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 6(3)(b) merely elucidates section 6(1), to which Lord Nicholls and Lord Rodger referred in paras 6 and 160. Further, Lord Rodger's use of the phrase "either generally or on the relevant occasion" in para 163 makes explicit that the rationale applies as much to the identification of a person exercising a function of a public nature under section 6(3)(b) as it does to the identification of a core public authority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89.&nbsp;&nbsp;A second point which emerges from <i>Aston Cantlow </i>is that, with the general purpose of section 6 thus identified, the rule in <i>Pepper v. Hart </i>[1993] AC 593 provides no further assistance. In paras 161 to 162, Lord Rodger expressly rejected a submission that reference to Hansard was permissible as an aid to construing the term "public authority" in section 6 (adding only that, had it been, it would have confirmed his view). Lord Hope agreed (para 37) that the Court of Appeal had (in rejecting a contrary submission based on <i>Pepper v Hart</i>: cf [2001] EWCA Civ 713; [2002] Ch 51, para 29) rightly declined to look at Hansard for assistance. Lord Scott, in agreeing (para 129) with the reasons given by Lord Hope and Lord Rodger for concluding that the parish council of Aston Cantlow was not a core public authority, can, as I read his opinion, also be taken to have agreed with their rejection of Hansard, although disagreeing on the application of section 6(3)(b). No submission was made to the House to the effect that any of these statements was wrong, or that <i>Pepper v Hart </i>has any greater relevance on this appeal than in <i>Aston Cantlow</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90.&nbsp;&nbsp;The House was shown two substantial, and informative, reports of the Joint Committee on Human Rights of the House of Lords and House of Commons on "The Meaning of Public Authority under the Human Rights Act"<i> </i>(the Seventh Report of Session 2003-04, HL Paper 39 and HC 382, and the Ninth Report of Session 2006-07, HL Paper 77 and HC 410). But, so far as these reports recite particular statements made during either House's consideration of the 1998 Act (which, on any issue relevant to this appeal, seem to have been very limited), such statements must be left on one side. So far as these reports proceed on the basis that Parliament had any particular intention, that is the issue which the House has to determine according to relevant principles of statutory construction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Lord Nicholls at paras 7 to 12 in <i>Aston Cantlow </i>expressed more detailed views on the characteristics of those bodies or persons which might constitute either core or hybrid public authorities. At para 7, he said that "behind the instinctive classification" as "governmental", and as core public authorities, of organisations such as government departments, local authorities, the police and the armed forces lay "factors such as the possession of special powers, democratic accountability, public funding in whole or in part, an obligation to act only in the public interest, and a statutory constitution"; and he referred to an article by Professor Dawn Oliver, "The Frontiers of the State: Public Authorities and Public Functions under the Human Rights Act": [2000] PL 476, as valuable in this connection. At para 9 he explained section 6(3)(b) as addressing situations where in the interests of efficiency and economy or otherwise, functions of a governmental nature were discharged by non-governmental bodies, sometimes as a result of privatisation, sometimes not. He gave as "obvious" examples the running of prisons by private organisations and the discharge of regulatory functions by organisations in the private sector such as the Law Society, or one might add the Bar Council.  Further, while a core public authority was disabled from having any Convention rights (cf article 34), a hybrid authority was not so disabled in respect of any act of a private nature, and:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Giving a generously wide scope to the expression 'public function' in section 6(3)(b) will further the statutory aim of promoting the observance of human rights values without depriving the bodies in question of the ability themselves to rely on Convention rights when necessary" (para 11).<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there was, in his view, "no single test of universal application" to decide whether a function was of a public nature, "given the diverse nature of governmental functions and the variety of means by which these functions are discharged today". However:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Factors to be taken into account include the extent to which in carrying out the relevant function the body is publicly funded, or is exercising statutory powers, or is taking the place of central government or local authorities, or is providing a public service" (para 12).<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Nicholls's view supports not only a broad application of section 6(3)(b) but also a factor-based approach such as Mr Sales in particular advocated. On the other hand, none of Lord Nicholls's specific examples is close to the present case.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;State responsibility in the Strasbourg case law</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the rationale of section 6 identified in <i>Aston Cantlow</i>, it is logical to start by considering whether Strasbourg case law offers any clear guidance on the scope of State responsibility in the present field. In my opinion it lacks any case directly in point. But two relevant principles appear. First, the State may in some circumstances be responsible for failure to take positive steps to regulate or control the activities of private persons where there will otherwise be a direct and immediate adverse impact on a person's Convention protected interests. Second, the State may in some circumstances remain responsible for the conduct of private law institutions to which it has delegated state powers. The case law does not always distinguish clearly between these principles. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93.&nbsp;&nbsp;Examples of the first principle are <i>Botta v Italy</i> (1998) 26 EHRR 241 and <i>Marzari v Italy </i>(1999) 28 EHRR CD 175 (failure to protect an individual's right to respect for private life) and <i>Z v United Kingdom </i>(2001) 34 EHRR 97 (local authority's failure to protect children known to be suffering ill-treatment). In <i>R (Bernard) v Enfield London Borough Council </i>[2002] EWHC 2282 (Admin), [2003] LGR 423, Sullivan J on the same principle held responsible a local authority which in breach of article 8 failed to act for over 20 months on assessments of need under section 47 of the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990, which should have led it to arrange care and accommodation under section 21 of the National Assistance Act 1948, as amended.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Storck v Germany </i>(2005) 43 EHRR 96 falls under the same principle. The Federal Republic was responsible in respect of the applicant's confinement in a private clinic in circumstances not authorised by a court or any other state entity, in view of (a) the lack at the time of any system for supervision by state authorities of the lawfulness and conditions of confinement of persons treated in such a clinic, and (b) the use of police force to return the applicant to the clinic after she had fled (paras 90 and 91). At one point (para 103), the European Court of Human Rights in <i>Storck </i>noted that the State could not "completely absolve itself from its responsibility" by delegating its obligations:</p>
<p></p><ul>"…. the State is under an obligation to secure to its citizens their right to physical integrity under article 8 of the Convention. For this purpose there are hospitals run by the State which co-exist with private hospitals. The State cannot completely absolve itself from its responsibility by delegating its obligations in this sphere to private bodies or individuals."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was followed by a reference to <i>Costello-Roberts v United Kingdom </i>(1993) 19 EHRR 112 and the observation that "similarly, in the present case, the State remained under a duty to exercise supervision and control over private psychiatric institutions" (para 103). It is clear that the basis of responsibility in <i>Storck </i>was not some general responsibility for every misdeed in the clinic, but responsibility under the first principle for the State's supervisory and policing failures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Costello-Roberts </i>itself is not an easy case to analyse. This is because the court held that there was in fact no breach of any Convention duty. The issue was whether the particular corporal punishment ("slippering") suffered by a pupil in a private school had infringed his Convention rights, and it was held that it was not of a severity to infringe either of articles 3 and 8.  But the court started by considering the State's potential responsibility, in which regard the United Kingdom argued "the English legal system had adequately secured the rights guaranteed by articles 3 and 8 …. by prohibiting the use of any corporal punishment which was not moderate or reasonable" (para. 26).  The court concluded however that in "the particular domain of school discipline, the treatment complained of although it was the act of a headmaster of an independent school, is none the less such as may engage the responsibility of the United Kingdom under the Convention if it proves to be incompatible with article 3 or article 8 or both". The basis was said to be the State's duty to secure to its children their right to education, including an appropriate school disciplinary system, which "cannot be said to be merely ancillary to the educational process", the co-existence of independent and state schools, in circumstances where the right to education is guaranteed equally to pupils in both, and the State's inability to "absolve itself from responsibility by delegating its obligations to private bodies or individuals" (para 27). While the Court in <i>Storck </i>treated the State in <i>Costello-Roberts </i>as responsible under the first principle, the actual reasoning in <i>Costello-Roberts </i>is open to the wider interpretation that the State may under the second principle have a non-delegable or vicarious responsibility for education, at least for such acts of a private school as may be said to be central to its educational role. In Professor David Feldman's <i>Civil Liberties and Human Rights in England </i>2nd ed (2002) p 97, he suggests that other aspects of a private school's activities, such as its contractual relations with parents, could fall outside its public functions. This might in turn suggest that termination of contractual relations would fall outside the Convention protections. It was along such lines that Buxton LJ [2007] 2 WLR 1097 may have been thinking in the present case when he suggested that "a hybrid body may be directly impleaded in the protection of some Convention rights but not of others" (para 78).  But this was not a theme pursued by any side before the House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96.&nbsp;&nbsp;Footnotes to the relevant passages in both <i>Costello-Roberts </i>and <i>Storck</i> refer to <i>Van der Mussele v Belgium </i>(1983) 6 EHRR 163. That case concerned a complaint by a pupil advocate that he was compelled to represent clients without fee. It was the Belgian State's obligation under article 6(3)(c) of the Convention to administer a system of free legal assistance in criminal matters. Belgian domestic legislation in turn obliged the Belgian Bar Association to provide such a system. As the European Court of Human Rights said, "legislation 'compels them to compel' members of the Bar to 'defend indigent persons'". The Court continued: "Such a solution cannot relieve the Belgian State of the responsibilities it would have incurred under the Convention had it chosen to operate the system itself" (para 29). In the next sentence, the court pointed out that the domestic legislation expressly obliged pupil advocates to act in cases assigned under the free legal assistance scheme. In the event and since pupil advocates had chosen to enter the profession, the legislative scheme was held consistent with the Convention. The case was not so much one of potential responsibility for delegated acts, as one of potential responsibility for the State's own legislative scheme.<i> </i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second principle is that the State may in some circumstances remain responsible for the manner of performance of essentially state or governmental functions or powers which it has chosen to delegate to a private law institution. Examples are provided by <i>Wós v Poland </i>(Application No 22860/02) (unreported) 1 March 2005 and <i>Sychev v Ukraine</i> (Application No 4773/02) (unreported) 11 October 2005. In <i>Wós </i>a Minister in the Polish cabinet in 1991 established the Polish-German Reconciliation Foundation under the Foundations Act 1984, a statute enabling persons to establish private law foundations to carry out socially and economically useful goals complying with the basic interests of the Republic. The Minister and his successor had as founder full control over appointments to the Foundation's boards, over the amendment of its statute and its dissolution. The Foundation's capital consisted of DEM 500m contributed by the Federal Republic of Germany under treaty with Poland, and the Foundation's role was to use such moneys to compensate victims of Nazi persecution. As a result of further international negotiations culminating in 2000 in an agreed Joint Statement signed by inter alia the Federal Republic and Poland, the Foundation also acquired in 2001 the role of disbursing to Polish resident claimants further moneys contributed by the Federal Republic and German companies to a German Foundation established to compensate victims of slave and forced labour. The court held that "the specific circumstances of the present case give rise to the conclusion that the actions of the Foundation …. in respect of both compensation schemes are capable of engaging the responsibility of the State" (para 74). It said that the State's choice of "a form of delegation in which some of its powers are exercised by another body cannot be decisive for the question of State responsibility ratione personae" (para 72) and that delegation to a body operating under private law of the Polish State's obligations arising out of international agreements could not "relieve the Polish State of the responsibilities it would have incurred had it chosen to discharge these obligations itself, as it could well have" (para 73). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Sychev </i>the State had established a private law commission to which were delegated certain State powers relating to the execution of court judgments. The court did not find it necessary to discuss whether or not the commission was or was not in itself a State authority for the purposes of article 34, but said that "It suffices to note that the body in question exercised certain State powers at least as regards the execution of court judgments" (para 54). The distinction drawn may be seen as mirroring that between core and hybrid public authorities in English domestic law. The court went on to say that "the exercise of State powers which affects Convention rights and freedoms raises an issue of State responsibility regardless of the form in which these powers happen to be exercised, be it for instance by a body whose activities are regulated by private law" (para 54). It also made points about the absence of any judicial or administrative control over the commission which could have invoked the first principle I have mentioned.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relevance of European case law</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first principle does not assist to determine whether Southern Cross is a public authority under section 6. State and governmental bodies have an important role in regulating and supervising the activities of many private bodies and persons, including care homes. But it is not suggested that Southern Cross occupied any such regulatory or supervisory role. The second principle recognises that there may be certain essentially state or governmental functions, particularly involving the exercise of duties or powers, for the manner of exercise of which the State will remain liable, notwithstanding that it has delegated them to a private law body. It is necessary to consider whether the provision of care and accommodation in a private care home under an arrangement made with a local authority falls within this principle. The above analysis confirms that Strasbourg case law contains no case directly in point. In contrast with <i>Sychev</i>, a private care home does not acquire or exercise any obvious State power or duty. In contrast with both <i>Wós</i> and <i>Sychev</i>, it is not established and capitalised by the State for state purposes. The ambit and significance of the reasoning in <i>Costello-Roberts</i> is less clear, but the case concerns the very different field of education, where the court may, on one view, have considered that any activity bearing centrally on the provision of education was a non-delegable State function, whether it is provided by a state or under private contractual arrangements in a private school. The case does not indicate that the same can or should be said of the provision of care and accommodation.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of section 6(3)(b) in domestic law</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100.&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming against this background to the interpretation of section 6(3)(b), the phrases "public authority" and "functions of a public nature" are readily understandable and applicable in cases of what Lord Nicholls called "special powers" or functions of a "governmental" nature in <i>Aston Cantlow</i> [2004] 1 AC 546, paras 7 and 9. Thus, local authorities were granted power, by section 111(1) of the Local Government Act 1972, to do "any thing …. which is calculated to facilitate, or is conducive or incidental to, the discharge of any of their functions", and in <i>Hazell v Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council </i>[1992] 2 AC 1, 29F Lord Templeman said that "the word 'functions' embraces all the duties and powers of a local authority; the sum total of the activities Parliament has entrusted to it. Those activities are its functions".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, as both <i>Aston Cantlow </i>and <i>R (West) v Lloyd's of London </i>[2004] EWCA Civ 506, [2004] 3 All ER 251 show, the mere possession of special powers conferred by Parliament does not by itself mean that a person has functions of a public nature. Such powers may have been conferred for private, religious or purely commercial purposes. Conversely, there can be bodies without special statutory powers amenable to judicial review, as shown by <i>R v Panel on Take-overs and Mergers, Ex p Datafin Plc </i>[1987] QB 815 and<i> R v Code of Practice Committee of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, Ex p Professional Counselling Aids Ltd. </i>(1991) 3 Admin LR 697, cited by Moses J in <i>R v Servite Houses, Ex p Goldsmith </i>[2001] LGR 55, 74b. In<i> Datafin</i>, the Panel was as a matter of fact entrusted with an extensive and vital regulatory role in the public interest, and that was sufficient to make it susceptible to judicial review. In <i>Code of Practice Committee</i>, applying <i>Datafin</i>, judicial review was available in respect of the administration by a trade association of a code of practice which it had voluntarily developed in conjunction with the Department of Health, and which was obligatory for members and followed in practice by non-members. I do not doubt that such bodies would in respect of their regulatory functions also constitute a public authority under section 6(3)(b). In <i>Datafin </i>Sir John Donaldson MR said [1987] QB 815, 826, 834, 835 that:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Lacking any authority de jure, it [the take-over panel] exercises immense power de facto …."<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"…. the panel is a truly remarkable body, performing its function without visible means of legal support. But the operative word is 'visible', although perhaps I should have used the word 'direct'. Invisible or indirect support there is in abundance. Not only is a breach of the [City] code [on Take-overs and Mergers], so found by the panel, ipso facto an act of misconduct by a member of the Stock Exchange, and the same may be true of other bodies represented on the panel, but the admission of shares to the Official List may be withheld in the event of such a breach. …. "<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"The picture which emerges is clear. As an act of government it was decided that, in relation to take-overs, there should be a central self-regulatory body which would be supported and sustained by a periphery of statutory powers and penalties wherever non-statutory powers and penalties were insufficient or non-existent or where EEC requirements called for statutory provisions."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102.&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasoning in <i>Datafin </i>has been welcomed for underlining the importance for the public of the role and de facto power exercised by the Take-over Panel, but regretted in so far as it retained as a supporting factor, in the passage at p 835, the imputed governmental source of the power: see Murray Hunt "Constitutionalism and the Contractualisation of Government in the United Kingdom" published in <i>the Province of Administrative Law</i> (ed Taggart)<i> </i>(1997), p 29. But it should be no surprise that the usual source of the "functions of a public nature" addressed by section 6(3)(b) is legislative or governmental, when section 6(3)(b) is intended to reflect in domestic law the scope of the State responsibility which the Convention addresses. The concept "governmental" or "of government" was found useful in <i>Aston Cantlow </i>by Lords Nicholls, Hope, Hobhouse and Rodger at paras 10, 49, 88 and 159. The existence and source of any special powers or duties must on any view be a very relevant factor when considering whether State responsibility is engaged in Strasbourg or whether section 6(3)(b) applies domestically. On this point, I prefer Mr Sales' submissions, that it is necessary to look at the context in which and basis on which a contractor acts, to Mr Pannick's submission, that all that is appropriate is to look at what a contractor "does". There is, for example, a clear conceptual difference between the functions of a private firm engaged by a local authority to enforce the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984, as amended, on a public road and the activities of the same firm engaged by a private land-owner or a local authority to enforce a private scheme or parking restrictions of which notice have been given on a private property or estate.  Mr Pannick in his own submissions seeks to identify what Southern Cross does by reference to the duties which the council owes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103.&nbsp;&nbsp;Typical State or governmental functions include powers conferred and duties imposed or undertaken in the general public interest. I shall not attempt to identify the full scope of the concept of "functions of a public nature", any more than Lord Nicholls did in <i>Aston Cantlow</i>. But some further consideration is appropriate of his suggested hallmarks of a public authority. As stated, these were, in the case of a core public authority and in addition to special powers, democratic accountability, public funding in whole or in part, an obligation to act only in the public interest and a statutory constitution. All these factors can readily be understood to throw light on the nature of a person's functions. When considering section 6(3)(b), Lord Nicholls suggested as factors, again in addition to statutory powers, the extent that a body is publicly funded or is "taking the place" of central government or local authorities or is providing a public service: [2004] 1 AC 546, para 12.  These are more generally expressed factors, to which I address some further comments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Court of Appeal Buxton LJ [2007] 2 WLR 1097, para 72 considered it arguable that Southern Cross did indeed "stand in the shoes of the local authority as it discharges its public duties under section 21", but Mr Pannick in my view rightly did not endorse that approach. That powers or duties may in some circumstances be delegated to others is clear - witness the examples, given by Lord Nicholls, of privately run prisons and the regulation (at that time) of the solicitors' profession by the Law Society or the example of the private contractor entrusted with responsibility for enforcing the Road Traffic Regulation Act. Section 101 of the Local Government Act 1972 enables a limited form of delegation, whereby arrangements may be made for the discharge of local authority functions by a committee or subcommittee or an officer of the authority or by any other local authority. More significantly, under section 70 of the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994, the Secretary of State may specify statutory functions which may be discharged by a person other than the authority primarily responsible for them. Section 72 provides that any acts or omissions of a person so authorised shall be treated for all purposes as done or omitted to be done by or in relation to the authority. Examples of such orders include the Contracting Out (Management Functions in relation to certain Community Homes) Order 1996 (SI 1996/586) and the Local Authorities (Contracting Out of Allocation of Housing and Homelessness Functions) Order 1996 (SI 1996/3205). In such cases, while the acts or omissions are by statute attributed to the authority, there is a clear basis for regarding the authorised delegate as a person having functions of a public nature within section 6(3)(b). But no delegation of that sort exists in relation to the council's functions under section 21 of the 1948 Act. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105.&nbsp;&nbsp;Democratic accountability, an obligation to act only in the public interest and (in most cases today) a statutory constitution exclude the sectional or personally motivated interests of privately owned, profit-earning enterprises. Public funding and the provision of a public service are most easily understood in a similar sense. In a much looser sense, the self-interested endeavour of individuals usually works to the general benefit of society, as Adam Smith noted. But more than that is required under section 6(3)(b). The difficulty is where to draw the line. Public funding takes various forms. The injection of capital or subsidy into an organisation in return for undertaking a non-commercial role or activity of general public interest may be one thing; payment for services under a contractual arrangement with a company aiming to profit commercially thereby is potentially quite another. In every case, the ultimate focus must be upon the nature of the functions being undertaken. The deployment in <i>Poplar Housing</i> [2002] QB 48,<i> </i>apparently as a decisive factor in favour of the application of section 6(3)(b), of the close historical and organisational assimilation of Poplar Housing with the local authority is in my view open to the objection that this did not bear on the function or role that Poplar Housing was performing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106.&nbsp;&nbsp;Other domestic legislation adopts the concept of public authority, in particular the Race Relations Act 1976 and the Freedom of Information Act 2000. The different contexts of these statutes mean that they offer very limited assistance in the construction of the Human Rights Act 1998. Their technique was to set out (differing) lists of bodies which were to be regarded as public authorities, either for all purposes or in respect of certain functions. The Race Relations Act thus lists various Royal Colleges (Anaesthetists, General Practitioners, Nursing, Surgeons, etc), the Bank of England and the BBC, the General Council of the Bar and the Law Society each "in respect of its public functions", as well as a large number of other bodies generally. Neither Act includes in its list any private company or organisation offering services comparable to those rendered by Southern Cross, though that is, as stated, of little relevance in view of their different contexts. Of some interest is however a power conferred on the Secretary of State by section 5 of the Freedom of Information Act to designate as a public authority for the purposes of the Act any person not listed who either "(a) appears ….. to exercise functions of a public nature, or (b) is providing under a contract made with a public authority any service whose provision is a function of that authority". The careful distinction between (a) and (b) highlights the point that a person with whom a public authority contracts for a service which it is the function of that authority to provide is not axiomatically exercising a function of a public nature. Under the Freedom of Information Act, there might be reason to extend the benefit of the Act to such a person. But section 6(3)(b) of the Human Rights Act only extends the concept of a public authority to a person within (a).</p>
