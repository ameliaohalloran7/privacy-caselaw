<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;157.&nbsp;&nbsp;The flexible approach of the English courts was approved by the European Court in <i>Gregory v United Kingdom </i>25 EHRR 577 which I discuss below.  There the careful directions of the judge were held to be sufficient to guarantee that the jury's deliberations would ultimately be impartial, even though there had been a suggestion of racial prejudice in the earlier stages of those deliberations.  Even in <i>Sander v United Kingdom </i>(2000) 31 EHRR 1003, which is not easy to reconcile with <i>Gregory</i>, the majority found that there had been a breach of article 6(1), not because of the general approach of English law to dealing with racist remarks and similar improprieties during a trial, but because they were not satisfied that the directions given by the judge would have cured the problem in the particular circumstances.  Sir Nicolas Bratza's dissenting opinion makes a persuasive case for the opposite view.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;158.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the appellant Mirza, the steps taken by the trial judge and by counsel to deal with the possible prejudice are not criticised.  The contention in the appeal is that, despite them, when the jurors came to deliberate on their verdict, they displayed racial prejudice against the appellant in various ways, including disregarding what they had been told about the use of the interpreter.  The appeal therefore centres around the allegations of misconduct during the jurors' deliberations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;159.&nbsp;&nbsp;In advancing their submissions, counsel for the appellants acknowledged that, when jurors deliberate on their verdict, their discussions should in principle be confidential.  Contrary to what is sometimes suggested, confidentiality is not maintained for fear that letting in daylight upon magic would reveal the jury as an unjust and irrational institution.  Rather, confidentiality is maintained to help juries to do their work efficiently.  And that work is of social significance, for the jury acts as "an absorber of the discontent of citizens whose everyday affairs are subjected to the control of the courts":  L Green, <i>Judge and Jury</i> (1930), p 376.  For this purpose the very simplicity of the jury's verdict, guilty or not guilty, is crucial.  Therein lies its value - not in the process by which the jurors believe they arrived at it:  cf <i>R v Armstrong </i>[1922] 2 KB 555, 568 per Lord Hewart CJ.  This characteristic would be compromised if the views and reasons of individual jurors became known and could subsequently be debated.  When at one time that looked like happening, Parliament enacted section 8 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 to ward off the danger.  Even more importantly, perhaps, the confidentiality of the jurors' deliberations ensures that they can discuss the case freely, without any fear that individuals' views, whether provisional or final, should later become known and make them the butt of public criticism and ridicule, or worse.  Not surprisingly, therefore, a recognition of the importance of maintaining this confidentiality runs through the British and Commonwealth authorities that Lord Hope of Craighead has cited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;160.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the appellants base their argument, in part at least, on article 6(1) of the Convention, it is especially important to notice the approach of the European Court in <i>Gregory v United Kingdom</i>.  The applicant, Mr Gregory, who was black, was tried for robbery in the Crown Court.  After the jury had been deliberating for about two hours, a note was passed from the jury to the judge, saying "Jury showing racial overtones.  One member to be excused."  The judge showed the note to the prosecution and the defence.  He then recalled the jury and gave them a careful direction on the need for them to put any form of prejudice out of their minds and to decide the case, in accordance with their oath, on the evidence.  Mr Gregory was convicted and his appeal against conviction was dismissed.  Holding that there had been no breach of article 6(1), the European Court said, 25 EHRR 577, 593 - 594, para 44:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The Court observes that it was not disputed that there was no evidence of actual or subjective bias on the part of one or more jurors.  It was also accepted by both the applicant and the Government that it was not possible under English law for the trial judge to question the jurors about the circumstances which gave rise to the note.  The Court acknowledges that the rule governing the secrecy of jury deliberations is a crucial and legitimate feature of English trial law which serves to reinforce the jury's role as the ultimate arbiter of fact and to guarantee open and frank deliberations among jurors on the evidence which they have heard."<p></p></ul>
<p>In other words, faced with a situation where the rule that jurors' deliberations had to be kept secret made it impossible for the trial judge to find out what had given rise to the note, the European Court acknowledged that that rule was not only a legitimate, but a "crucial", feature of English trial law which served worthwhile objectives.  Thus the incorporation of article 6 of the Convention into our domestic law can be regarded as reinforcing, rather than as calling into question, the rule that jury deliberations should be kept secret.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;161.&nbsp;&nbsp;The perceived need to maintain the confidentiality of the deliberations of the jury has been a vital element in the response of appeal courts to allegations by one or more jurors - made after the verdict - that during their deliberations jurors displayed bias against a defendant, did not apply the judge's directions on law or otherwise failed to consider the issues properly.  To protect that confidentiality, the courts have held that evidence as to what was said during the jurors' deliberations is inadmissible.  <i>Phipson on Evidence,</i> 15th ed (2000), para 24-32 states the law succinctly:  "Jurors may not give evidence of discussions that took place in the jury box or jury room concerning the case in which they were acting."  See also <i>Walker and Walker,</i> <i>The Law of Evidence in Scotland, </i>2nd ed (2000), para 13.20.3.  This is a clear and well-settled rule as to the admissibility of such evidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;162.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, on the other hand, the allegation is that the jury has been subjected to some improper influence from outside, such as bribery or intimidation, appeal courts have been prepared to admit evidence relating to that allegation, investigate the matter and set aside the jury's verdict if the allegation is made out.  Since proof of the improper extrinsic influence will be sufficient by itself to make the jury's verdict unsafe, no question of admitting evidence as to actual deliberations of the jurors need arise.  For the most part at least, such cases are relatively easy to deal with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;163.&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly, the rule that evidence about jurors' deliberations is inadmissible can provoke the kinds of criticism which my noble and learned friend, Lord Steyn, has articulated so effectively.  At first sight indeed, that rule might seem to involve a conflict between two competing objectives of the legal system, maintaining the confidentiality of the jury's deliberations and ensuring a fair trial.  But, in deliberately adopting this rule, the courts have proceeded on the basis that the defendant's right to a fair trial is indeed respected.  In that connexion they have relied on two familiar features of the public part of any jury trial:  the judge's directions to the jurors on the law they are to apply and the foreman's declaration of the verdict in the presence and hearing of all the jurors.  In the absence of any overt indication to the contrary, such as returning inconsistent verdicts on different counts on the indictment, the law assumes that the jurors will have duly applied the judge's directions.  So, if the judge gets the directions wrong in a material respect, the jury's verdict must usually be quashed.  The law proceeds on the view that, if a juror who can hear the foreman's words makes no objection when the verdict is announced, he or she must be taken to have assented to the verdict as accurately reflecting the proper conclusion of the jurors' deliberations.  Accordingly, when duly announced, the verdict is regarded as the authentic expression of the outcome of the jury's deliberations on the issues in the case, in the light of the directions given by the judge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;164.&nbsp;&nbsp;These assumptions are not peripheral but central to the idea of jury trial as fair trial.  While they are not easily tested by research, they have been tested by the experience of generations of judges, lawyers, parties and jurors.  Thus scrutinised, jury trial has won a degree of respect in the community that would be unthinkable if there were real reason to believe that in their secret deliberations jurors generally failed to discharge their duties conscientiously and so returned wayward verdicts.  I refer in general to the observations of Lord Hope of Craighead, citing a number of overseas authorities, in <i>Montgomery v HM Advocate </i>[2003] 1 AC 641, 673F - 674F.  Occasionally - as in the case of Rollock -  when the foreman announces the verdict, one or more jurors immediately indicate that he has got it wrong.  The situation is then clarified.  Since jurors do in fact intervene in this way when something goes wrong, there is a sound basis for inferring that, in cases where the jurors remain silent, it is because the verdict is acceptable to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;165.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, even though invited from time to time to reconsider their approach, the highest appeal courts have consistently refused to entertain appeals based on the allegation of a juror, made later, that during their deliberations other jurors showed bias, failed to apply the judge's directions or otherwise acted improperly.  If that was indeed the juror's view, then the time to make it known was before the verdict was returned - either by sending a note to the judge, or by speaking to the jury bailiff or by declaring the objection in open court.  At that stage matters can be investigated and any appropriate remedy given.  Once returned, however, the verdict becomes the verdict of the jury as a whole and, as such, it cannot be impugned by any of the individual jurors who have publicly assented to it.  To hold otherwise would not only call into question the entire status and authority of the jury's verdict but would also expose jurors to pressure, especially from convicted defendants and their associates, to make such allegations.  The rule that evidence of alleged impropriety during the jurors' deliberations is inadmissible is thus based both on principle and on practical experience.  Counsel suggested, however, that some jurors, at least, might be unaware of the position and therefore would not know that they could, and in an appropriate case should, take steps to make their views known.  I accept that this may be so.  Steps should therefore be taken to minimise that risk.  This could be done, for instance, by explaining the position in suitable terms in any guidance sent to jurors when they are summoned for jury service and again in the information video which they are shown when they come to court.  I respectfully associate myself with Lord Hobhouse's suggestions in this regard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;166.&nbsp;&nbsp;The deemed assent of the jurors to the verdict announced by the foreman is of significance when considering another kind of case that is found in the books:  a juror subsequently alleges that one or more of the jurors decided on their verdict by drawing lots, tossing a coin or using a ouija board - the precise mechanism is of no importance.  That is not an allegation about the way those jurors deliberated on their verdict but about them reaching their "verdict" by a totally different, illegitimate and irrational process.  Therefore, the policy of the law that jurors' deliberations should be kept confidential is no obstacle to admitting such evidence.  The objection is, rather, that, if the jurors really reached their verdict in that way, the juror who later makes the complaint should not have stayed silent and assented to the verdict - and he cannot subsequently undermine it.  The factors in favour of upholding that objection are powerful.  Since, however, one of the two policies underlying the rule against admitting evidence of what allegedly went on in the jury room is not in play, the case against admitting such evidence is correspondingly weaker in these cases.  I would accordingly reserve my opinion on the point, which does not arise for determination in these appeals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;167.&nbsp;&nbsp;Counsel submitted that, while the approach enshrined in the rule against admitting evidence about jurors' deliberations might have been good enough in the past, it did not meet the standards that an appeal court should apply today:  when allegations were made about their deliberations, it should be open to the court, in a suitable case, to admit the evidence and investigate the matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;168.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not immediately obvious why the rule should be changed today.  The law has always been concerned that trials should be fair.  So nothing has altered in that respect.  Neither article 6(1) of the Convention nor the jurisprudence of the European Court suggests, far less mandates, a different approach.  Indeed it supports the policy behind the existing rule.  Nor should today's jurors readily be regarded as so much less scrupulous, less conscientious, less intelligent, less well educated or less articulate than their predecessors that all former assumptions must pass away and a new régime be introduced for investigating their deliberations.  On the contrary, when Parliament progressively widened the pool from which jurors were to be chosen, it must have been on the assumption that, as a rule, all would be equally capable of serving properly.  The underlying considerations that have shaped the law have not changed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;169.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is even less obvious how, exactly, it is said that the law should be modified.  In attractive submissions counsel for the appellants invited the House to open the door of the jury room just enough to deal with the particular allegations of impropriety in these cases - on the implied assurance that this would not mean having to open it as widely or more widely in other cases.  Mr Fitzgerald QC just wanted the Court of Appeal to be able to investigate allegations of racial prejudice.  But it is impossible to single out one among many types of prejudice that, left unchecked, could potentially infect jurors' deliberations.  Similarly, Mr Gledhill QC just wanted the Court of Appeal to be able to investigate the allegation that, to save time, the jurors had failed to apply the judge's directions on the need to consider the case against each of the appellants separately.  But, again, it is impossible to single out the failure to apply one particular kind of direction.  In reality the logic of counsel's submissions was that the House should hold that, except where manifestly incredible or unreliable, any evidence as to material impropriety or irregularity in a jury's deliberations should be admitted.  The House would have to reverse the present rule that such evidence is inadmissible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;170.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Steyn considers that he has identified a middle way.  He is concerned to uphold the general rule that evidence about jury deliberations is inadmissible, but at the same time to admit "cogent evidence demonstrating a real risk that the jury was not impartial and that the general confidence in jury verdicts was in the particular case ill reposed".  It respectfully appears to me that this is not a tenable solution.  The rules on the admissibility of evidence rest on general policy considerations and apply to categories of evidence, irrespective of the apparent cogency in any given case of evidence falling within the category.  So, for example, in a criminal trial defence counsel cannot lead hearsay evidence of a conversation, however cogent or favourable to the defendant's case the witness's evidence might appear to be.  The judge has no discretion to hold a voire dire and then to admit the evidence if it appears to him or her to be cogent.  Similarly, I see no proper basis for introducing an exception of the kind envisaged by Lord Steyn to a general rule that the evidence of a juror about the jury's deliberations is inadmissible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;171.&nbsp;&nbsp;The unpalatable truth is that there is no sure touchstone for deciding whether the allegation of a juror, considered in isolation, is truly cogent.  What at first appeared cogent might look very different if the matter were fully investigated and evidence taken from the other jurors.  Conversely, the allegation of a less articulate juror, which at first appeared weak, might look more cogent after investigation.  In any event, it would be impossible to allow an appeal - as Lord Steyn envisages in the case of Mirza - simply on the basis of the written statement of one juror, however apparently cogent, without testing it and without ascertaining the position of the other jurors.  Respect for their reputations and interests, as well as the wider interests of justice, would demand nothing less.  So, in reality, Lord Steyn's approach, too, would soon dismantle the general rule that evidence relating to jurors' deliberations is inadmissible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;172.&nbsp;&nbsp;If it were indeed possible to devise a workable exception which would not eat up the rule, then that might be the ideal solution.  But over the years judges of the highest authority have considered the matter and have not found such a solution.  They have therefore affirmed the rule that evidence about jurors' deliberations should not be admitted.  The opinions of Lord Goff of Chieveley in <i>Lalchan Nanan v The State</i> [1986] AC 860, 872, a capital case, ("not excluding altogether the possibility") and of Lord Bingham  of Cornhill CJ in <i>R v Millward</i> [1999] 1 Cr App R 61, 65 ("save in quite extraordinary circumstances") can stand for all.  Unfortunately, in formulating the law judges today can claim no greater skill or knowledge than their distinguished predecessors.  They cannot draw lines or make distinctions which those predecessors rightly felt unable to draw or to make.  Significantly, when Parliament stepped into the arena in section 8 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981, it was to strengthen, rather than to water down, the protection for the confidentiality of jurors' deliberations.  I respectfully agree with what Lord Hope of Craighead says about the construction of that provision.  But, as the High Court of Justiciary pointed out in <i>Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission, Petitioners </i>2001 SLT 1198, 1202, para 15, even if that provision leaves the appeal court with the necessary powers to investigate jurors' deliberations, this does not mean to say that the court would use those powers in cases like the present.  The rule against admitting evidence about the jurors' deliberations stands in the way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;173.&nbsp;&nbsp;The law on this matter is well settled.  But, of course, despite the endorsement of their approach by Parliament and by the European Court, it may be that the courts have attached undue weight to the confidentiality of jurors' deliberations.  Or, for some other reason, the law as laid down in the authorities may not be well suited to conditions today.  If that is found to be so, it should, of course, be changed - as some respected critics have indeed suggested.  Notably, in the Report of his Review of the Criminal Courts of England and Wales (2001), Chapter 5, para 98 Lord Justice Auld recommended that the Court of Appeal should be able to inquire into alleged impropriety by a jury, whether in the course of their deliberations or otherwise.  This would involve a substantial, if not complete, departure from the present law and from its underlying policies.  There is, as yet, no sign that the Government intend to bring forward legislation to implement the recommendation.  Any such far-reaching reform of the law on this topic must, however, be a matter for Parliament rather than for this House in its judicial capacity.  Only Parliament is in a position to weigh the competing policy arguments and, if so advised, to produce a new and suitably sophisticated solution.  Unless and until that happens, the existing law must be applied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;174.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, the evidence of the allegations in the letters by the former jurors in these cases is not admissible and is not a basis for concluding that the verdicts of the juries were unsafe.  I would accordingly dismiss the appeals.</p>
