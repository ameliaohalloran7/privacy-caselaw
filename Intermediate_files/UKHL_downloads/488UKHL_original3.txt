<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;55. I find nothing in the 1847 Act to require an extended meaning. On the contrary section 3 gives an express definition to the word "owner" "when used in relation to goods" which extends the ordinary meaning to include a number of other people including the consignor, the consignee and the shipper as well as the owner.  It does not give any definition of "owner" in relation to a vessel.  That seems to me to be an indication that no extended meaning is intended. I do not consider that goods here can include a vessel.  The express restriction of the application of the definition to goods must reflect a distinction between goods and vessels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;56. Section 74 makes a clear distinction between the absolute liability of the owner and the wilful act or negligence of "the master or person having the charge of such vessel or float of timber".  On the face of it the provision for absolute liability seems to refer to the real owner as distinct from any charterer who may have charge of the vessel.  The First Division put particular significance on the proviso to section 74, although it would be strange if the effect of a proviso were to be such as to determine the meaning of the principal part of the section.  The proviso to section 74 seeks to make an exception to the liability of the owner while the vessel is under compulsory pilotage.  What it says is that the owner, which I define as the real owner, is not to bear liability for "such damage", that is, damage to "the harbour, dock, or pier, or the quay or works connected therewith" as set out earlier in the section, "where such vessel shall at the time when such damage is caused be in charge of a duly licensed pilot whom such owner or master is bound by law to employ and put his vessel in charge of".  It is argued that the person who has control of the vessel is the one who would otherwise be liable for the acts of a pilot and so the proviso supports the view that the word "owner" refers to the person having charge of the vessel, which would include a demise charterer.  But the language is "such owner or master".  The word "master" is defined in section 3 as meaning in relation to any vessel "the person having the command or charge of the vessel for the time being". The word "such" in the phrase "such owner or master" simply takes one back to the earlier parts of the section where the owner referred to is "the owner of every vessel or float of timber" and the master is referred to in the phrase "the master or person having the charge of such vessel or float of timber".  The person who employs the pilot might be the owner, or the master or someone else who had command or charge of the vessel.  The effect of the proviso to my mind is that where a compulsory pilot has to be employed, whether by the true owner or the master or anyone having the command or charge of the vessel, the liability which the section imposes on the true owner is not to arise.  The proviso to my mind is perfectly consistent with the definition of "owner" as meaning the true owner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;57. Sections 75 and 76 also seem to me to support the conclusion that it is the real owner who is to be saddled with liability.  The vessel may under section 74 be detained until sufficient security has been given for the amount of the damage.  Under section 75 provision is made for the vessel to be distrained or kept and if necessary sold in order to pay the amount of the due damages.  The compulsory sale of the vessel does not seem to me to fit well with the idea that the person liable is someone other than the true owner.  Section 76 provides for the owner to recover the amount of damages paid by him from the person who actually did the damage.  There is the less need for that provision if "the owner" means or includes a demise charterer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;58. So far as the case law is concerned such indications as there are seem to me to support the view that by the term "owner" is meant the actual owner, the proprietor.  In <i>River Wear Commissioners v Adamson</i> (1877)  LR 2 HL 743 mention was made of the difficulty for the undertakers of the harbour of investigating whom to pursue when damage was done to their harbour works by a vessel, whether as Lord Cairns LC said, at p 751, "the fault has been the fault of the owner, or of the charterer, or of the persons in charge".  The solution devised by Parliament was in my view not only to impose a liability without proof of fault, but to pin the liability on one person who could be readily identified, namely the registered owner.  Lord Blackburn observed, at pp 768-769:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It seems to have occurred to those who framed the statute, that in most cases where an accident occurs, it is from the fault of those who were managing the ship - and in most cases those are the servants of the owners - but that these were matters which in every case must be proved, and consequently that there was a great deal of litigation incurred before the owner, though he really was liable, could be fixed: and with a view to meet this, the remedy proposed was that the owner, who was generally really liable (though it was difficult and expensive to prove it), should be liable without proof either that there was negligence, or that the person guilty of neglect was the owner's servant, or proving how the mischief happened…."<p></p></ul>
<p>In <i>Great Western Railway Co v Mostyn (Owners)</i> [1928]  AC 57 it was recognised that the Act imposed liability on the owners qua owners.  As Lord Shaw of Dunfermline put it, at p 86 "the liability imposed is not a liability ex delicto, nor is it a liability quasi ex delicto; but it is expressly a liability ex dominio".  Lord Blanesburgh, at p 103, in talking of the position of the owner, contrasts him with "anyone else - the hirer, the ship repairer, any one on board but not in charge".  In <i>Workington Harbour and Dock Board v Towerfield (Owners)</i> [1951]  AC 112, 157 Lord Radcliffe observed that once it had been decided in  <i>The Mostyn</i> that the shipowner's liability:</p>
<p></p><ul>"did not depend on any imputation of default to him or to others who might be in charge of the ship, it was plain that the section was conceived in the interests of the dock or harbour authority and was calculated to produce on occasions what might be very rough justice indeed."<p></p></ul>
<p>It appears to me that throughout these cases their Lordships were proceeding upon the basis that it was the registered owner and not any hirer or any charterer who was fixed with liability under the Act.  It is of course correct to notice that in none of these cases was the House concerned with the question before us, whether "owner" means or includes a demise charterer, but it seems to me that the assumption behind the decisions was that the reference to "owner" was a reference to the true owner and not a charterer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;59. For these reasons I consider that the reference to "owner" in section 74 is a reference to the proprietor or true owner, and that it does not mean nor include any charterer, not even a bareboat charterer.</p>
<i><p>Prescription</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60. As I have already mentioned the action against Transport was not served until 28 September 1995, which was more than five years after the date of the incident giving rise to the claim.  In this action the defender has tabled a plea of prescription.  The defender makes no reference to the statutory basis for the plea in his defences but it is common ground that the case is susceptible to the operation of section 6(1) of the Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1973. That subsection provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"If, after the appropriate date, an obligation to which this section applies has subsisted for a continuous period of five years - <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul><ul>"(<i>a</i>) without any relevant claim having been made in relation to the obligation, and<p></p></ul></ul>
<p></p><ul><ul>"(<i>c</i>) without the subsistence of the obligation having been relevantly acknowledged,<p></p></ul></ul>
<p></p><ul><ul>then as from the expiration of that period the obligation shall be extinguished…."<p></p></ul></ul>
<p>The obligation to make reparation falls within Schedule 1 so that by virtue of section 6(2) it qualifies as an obligation to which the section applies.  The "appropriate date" is in terms of section 6(3) the date when the obligation became enforceable.  That date in the present case is 1 March 1990 when there occurred both the injuria and the damnum for which reparation is claimed.  That is the terminus a quo for the running of the five-year period. There is no question here of any relevant acknowledgement having been made.  The expression "relevant claim" means, according to section 9, a claim made by or on behalf of the creditor in appropriate proceedings.  That last expression is somewhat imprecisely defined in section 4 and was taken, for the purposes of the present case, to be the date of service of a summons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;61. BP however in its pleadings expressly found upon section 6(4) of the Act.  That subsection provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In the computation of a prescriptive period in relation to any obligation for the purposes of this section - <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul><ul>"(a) any period during which by reason of -<p></p></ul></ul>
<p></p><ul>(i) fraud on the part of the debtor or any person acting on his behalf, or<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(ii) error induced by words or conduct on the part of the debtor or any person acting on his behalf,<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>the creditor was induced to refrain from making a relevant claim in relation to the obligation, …..<p></p></ul>
shall not be recognised as,  or as part of, the prescriptive period. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided that any period such as in mentioned in paragraph (a) of this subsection shall not include any time occurring after the creditor could with reasonable diligence have discovered the fraud or error, as the case may be, referred to in that paragraph."</p>
<p>Section 6(5) provides that any period excluded from the calculation of the period by virtue of section 6(4) is not to be regarded as separating the time immediately before it from the time immediately after it.  A continuity in the time building up to the five year period can thus be secured.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;62. Before the First Division 2000 SLT 1374 the ground on which BP proceeded was to the effect that but for the error induced by Shipping on behalf of Transport they would have made a relevant claim on or about 21 February 1995 within, but only about a week before the expiry of, the five year period.  That approach was rejected by the First Division.  It was pointed out that BP could not be said to be refraining from making a claim when, at least after the apparent disclosure of the error on 18 August 1995, BP was actively taking steps towards making a claim against Transport.  It was further held that once the error was removed the time immediately started to run again and there was no room to imply some extension of the excluded period to cover the time reasonably taken in connection with the raising of proceedings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;63. Before this House however a somewhat different approach was taken.  It was argued that it was not necessary to embark on what was described as a hypothetical course of proving the date on which or by which the creditor would have raised proceedings had he not been in error.  What has to be identified is the period during which by reason of the error the creditor was induced to refrain from making the claim.  The error originated in the earliest communications with those acting for Transport in 1990 and it lasted all the time up until Transport withdrew its admission that it was the owner in August 1995.  On that basis there is no question of the five years having run before the summons was served.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;64. There is a question whether this approach is within the scope of BP's pleadings.  The pleadings state that but for the error it would have raised proceedings:</p>
<p></p><ul>"at the latest on the date when, in the event, they raised proceedings against Chevron Shipping, to wit 21 February 1995.  Accordingly, they were induced to refrain from making a relevant claim for at least the period between that date and the date when the present proceedings were raised."<p></p></ul>
<p>On the approach now taken BP can accept that the prescriptive period starts to run again when the error was disclosed, so that the period between that date and the actual making of the claim does not require to be excluded.  In that respect the submission now presented cuts across the pleadings.  But on the other hand BP has left open the period prior to 21 February 1995 in averring that it would have raised proceedings "at latest" on that date and that the period when it were induced by the error to refrain from making the claim ran "at least" from that date.  In my view it would be taking too technical a view of the pleadings to hold that the presentation now made is excluded by the averments in reply to the plea of prescription.  The factual averments relating to the correspondence by which BP was misled remain untouched.  It avers that representations were made to it "throughout the said correspondence" that Shipping and not Tankers were responsible for the conduct of the vessel.  The substance of the case now presented is within the scope of the present pleadings and the defenders have sufficient notice of it.  Obviously on the argument now presented there are some averments which are misleading and unnecessary.  On the approach which is now, in my view rightly, taken by BP it is unnecessary for it to aver and prove any particular date on which it might have raised proceedings had it not been misled.  Nor is it correct to include in the period during which it says it was induced to refrain from action the period after it learned what appears now may be the truth.  The pleadings now seem distinctly untidy but I do not consider that it is for us to delete any part of them.  I turn to the substantial point of the construction of section 6(4).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;65. The language of subsection (4) is not entirely happy.  The word "induced" is used twice in the critical passage, first to refer to the error as having been induced by the debtor and secondly to refer to the creditor being induced to refrain.  The word implies a more vigorous connection than a merely causal one, although that element must be embodied in it.  But the causal element is also brought in by the words "by reason of".  Putting it shortly, the case expressed in the subsection is one where the creditor is induced to refrain from claiming by reason of error induced by the debtor.  Error induced by the debtor must be something short of fraud, because that kind of case is dealt with expressly in paragraph (a). So the word "induced" does not necessarily carry with it any sinister overtone.  The debtor may have been acting entirely innocently and in good faith, but nevertheless has led the creditor to believe something different from the truth.  In my view what is meant is that the debtor has led the creditor into error by his, or his agent's, words or conduct and because of the error the creditor has been brought into the position of refraining from making a claim.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66. The word "refrain" also requires consideration.  The Inner House took the dictionary definition of to "stop oneself from doing something".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;67. But that phrase may be too restrictive to serve as an adequate explanation if it is taken in the sense that one can only stop oneself from doing something if you know that you could do that thing.  But one can in the ordinary use of words refrain from doing something without consciously holding back or abstaining from it.  In the present context the creditor is under error, and is necessarily not conscious of the right which he has to raise proceedings or of the necessity to raise them without delay.  So it would be too narrow a definition of the word in this context to confine it to a conscious stopping from doing something.  If the narrow view was adopted then there would be no protection for the period in which the creditor did not know that there was a possibility of his making a claim at all.  On the narrow view a creditor who was deceived into thinking that he was negotiating with the only person who might be liable to him would have no protection against the running of the prescriptive period, because he had not consciously held himself back, had not stopped himself, from making a claim against the true debtor.  That cannot have been the intention of the Act.  In the present context it seems to me that in substance the word means simply that the creditor did not raise proceedings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;68. This more generous approach to the construction of the subsection is in my view supported by reference to the policy which lies behind the exception.  That policy was clearly stated by Lord President Inglis in <i>Caledonian Railway Co v Chisholm</i>  13 R 773, 776 in the context of the old Act of 1579 (Triennial Prescription Act, c 83) providing for the former triennial prescription.  He said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The statute assumes that the creditor is in a position to sue, and it is because of his failure to sue - because of his negligence in putting off the making of his claim - that the statute imposes the penalty upon him.  It is clear to my mind, therefore, that whenever a case of this kind can be made, that the failure to sue is due to the conduct of the defender (whether it amount to fraud or not), to concealment on the part of the defender, or to the bringing forth of pretences which are false in fact, whether fraudulent or not, the pursuer cannot be visited by the penalty of the statute, because there is no negligence upon his part, but the sole cause of the delay in bringing forward his claim and raising the action is the conduct of the defender."<p></p></ul>
<p>In my view that is the philosophy which lies behind section 6(4) and it should be construed in the light of that philosophy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;69. This approach accords with the view which was taken by Lord Murray in <i>Thorn EMI Ltd v Taylor Woodrow Industrial Estates Ltd </i> (unreported) 29 October 1982.  In that case it was held that section 6(4) should not be narrowly construed so as to relate only to the deterring of court proceedings which would otherwise have gone ahead, or the abandoning of proceedings already under way.  Lord Murray held that:</p>
<p></p><ul>"there is nothing in subsection (4) in its context in the Act to circumscribe the scope of the words 'induced to refrain from making a relevant claim' so that they fail to cover the case of a creditor who is induced or deflected from making any claim at all as well as a creditor who would have proceeded to a relevant claim but for the debtor's words or conduct."<p></p></ul>
<p>He then referred to the common law defence available to bar the operation of the old triennial prescription and concluded:</p>
<p></p><ul>"That common law defence was not narrowly conceived in terms of the submission for the defenders, and I see nothing in the words used by Parliament to compel the conclusion that section 6(4) was intended to provide a novel and greatly restricted remedy for circumstances of this kind."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70. So far as this chapter of the appeal is concerned it seems to me that BP is entitled to argue the defence to the plea of prescription along the broader line which it introduced in this House and that section 6(4) should be given a more generous construction than seems to have been permitted  by the First Division.</p>
<i>Conclusion
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;71. In the action against Shipping BP averred that Shipping was the owner of the vessel.  BP also averred, on the basis of the various communications between the parties and the original admission in the defences, that Shipping is now personally barred from asserting that it was not the owner.  The case of personal bar has been allowed to go to proof.  Even if Shipping was not the real owner the case against it under section 74 may conceivably be open on the basis of the personal bar.  It does not seem to me that that case can be excluded from inquiry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72. In the action against Tankers BP avers that the Tankers was the owner of the vessel and that is admitted.  On the view  which I have taken of section 74 the statutory case in this action should go to inquiry.  The defenders have tabled a plea of prescription in this action but it is agreed that that plea should be admitted to proof.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73. Finally, in the action against Transport, BP avers that Transport was the bareboat charterer of the vessel and on that basis in condescendence 9 plead a case under section 74.  On the view which I have taken that ground of liability is not open in this action.  The First Division sustained the defenders' plea of prescription in this case and dismissed the action.  On the revised approach to the issue of prescription and on the view which I have taken of the construction of section 6(4) that action should be allowed to go to inquiry, subject to the exclusion from probation of condescendence 9 and of the two sentences in condescendence 10 to which Lord Hope has referred.  In short, I would allow the appeals in all three actions and subject to that exclusion in the case of Transport I consider that a proof before answer in all three cases would be appropriate.</p>
<p><b>LORD HOBHOUSE OF WOODBOROUGH</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74. The three appeals before your Lordships' House concern three separate actions.  In each BP Exploration Operating Co Ltd ("BP") is the pursuer.  In the first, the defender is Chevron Shipping Co ("Shipping"), in the second, Chevron Tankers (Bermuda) Ltd ("Tankers") and, in the third, Chevron Transport Corporation ("Transport").  Each action is concerned with the damage alleged to have been done by the Liberian steam turbine, 196,334 tons gross, tanker 'Chevron North America' to Jetty No.4 at Sullom Voe on 28 February 1990.  The causes of action relied upon are in contract, in delict and in statutory debt under the Zetland County Council Act 1974 which incorporates, among other provisions, section 74 of the Harbours, Docks and Piers Clauses Act 1847.  S.74 provides that the "owners" of every vessel shall be answerable for any damage done by the vessel to the harbour works.  Under s.6 of the Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1973, the period of negative prescription for all the claims is 5 years.  For reasons which are not before your Lordships and which it must be recognised may not redound to the merit of BP, the proceedings in the first action were not raised until 21 February 1995.  This has enabled the defenders to adopt procedural tactics which have so far met with a measure of success which must have surprised even them.  Having at first taken no point that Shipping was not the right party to be sued, the defenders revised their pleading to rely upon the fact that Tankers and not Shipping was the owner of the vessel.  Accordingly, BP then raised proceedings against Tankers.  The defenders then took the point that Tankers was also not the right party to sue, revealing for the first time the existence of a demise charterparty in favour of Transport which they said was operative at the material time and, when proceedings were then accordingly raised against Tankers as well, the defenders responded with the prescription defence.  These procedural tactics appear to have no inherent merit whatsoever as between commercial groups of international companies and it cannot be allowed to pass without comment that an international oil corporation should consider that this is an appropriate way in which to resolve whatever is the real dispute between the respective insured interests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75. It is, thus, the delay of the pursuers and the procedural tactics adopted by the defenders which have necessitated the decision by your Lordships of questions of the construction of the 1973 and 1974 Acts.  I have had the benefit of reading in draft the speeches of my noble and learned friends Lord Hope of Craighead and Lord Clyde.  I gratefully adopt Lord Hope's recitation of the procedural history and their treatment of the points which have arisen under the 1973 Act.  I agree with what they have said and their reasons for allowing the appeals of BP.  It falls to me to deal more fully with the points arising under the 1974 and 1847 Acts. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76. It is not in dispute that at all material times the registered owner of the vessel was in fact Tankers.  Tankers is a company incorporated under the laws of Bermuda.  It is the defenders' pleaded case that Tankers had transferred the possession of the vessel to Transport under a bareboat demise charterparty dated 11 May 1988.  The defenders contend that Transport was the employer of the crew and solely responsible for the navigation of the vessel including any liability that may have arisen under the 1974 Act.  Transport is another company in the Chevron group.  It is incorporated under the laws of Liberia with its registered office at 80 Broad Street Monrovia.  The defenders have produced a copy of the charterparty upon which they rely but it remains in issue whether this document was in force at the relevant time and whether the Liberian company, Transport, was in truth at the material time the employer of the crew and in possession of the vessel, though this is of course the basis on which the claim against Transport has been made in the third action.  Shipping are a Californian operating company in the Chevron group with which the pursuer dealt because (as the pursuer alleges) Shipping represented that it, Shipping, was the owner of the vessel and was accepting responsibility for her operation and for the acts and omissions of her crew.  The case of Shipping is that it was no more than the manager of the vessel as part of the Chevron Shipping Company fleet.  The claim against Shipping is accordingly put substantially on the basis of personal bar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77. The issue of law which arises upon the 1974 Act is whether, if the vessel doing the damage has been demise chartered, the statutory debt attaches to the registered owner or to the demise charterer or to both of them.  If it is only the registered owner, it will give a basis of claim against Tankers and, by personal bar, against Shipping but not against Transport.  If it is only the demise charterer, it will be Transport and Shipping but not Tankers.  If it can be both, then liability under the 1974 Act can potentially be raised in all three actions.  The Lord Ordinary held that the liability was the owner's alone.  The First Division held that the liability was that of the demise charterer to the exclusion of the owner.</p>
<i></i><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Demise Charterparty</i>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78. The charterparty document dated 11 May 1988 upon which the defenders rely is of a kind which is broadly typical.  It "lets" the vessel to the charterer for a period of about 4½ to 5½ years.  The charterer is required to maintain the vessel and keep her in a seaworthy state of repair.  The charterer is to "man, fuel, victual, supply and operate [the] vessel at charterer's sole risk and expense" (cl.4).  The effect of the charterparty is that the charterer is to have the possession of the vessel.  The charterer has the right to choose how the vessel shall be used and takes upon itself all the relevant risks.  The profits and losses belong solely to the charterer.  The charterer must insure the vessel and give the owner the benefit of the insurance as a co-insured and pay the owner the proceeds of any claim for a total loss.  The charterer must indemnify the owner against all liabilities incurred as a result of its use of the vessel and gives the owner the right to join in the defence of any significant claim against the vessel.  Such a clause is necessary because many of the claims which may arise from the trading of the vessel are claims for which the claimant has a maritime or statutory lien upon the vessel itself and, therefore, although no claim <i>in personam</i> may lie against the owner, the property of the owner, and, specifically, the vessel itself, may be arrested and sold to satisfy the claim.  Thus, if the charterer's crew navigate the vessel negligently and cause the vessel to collide with and damage, say, another vessel, the chartered vessel may be arrested at the suit of the injured party, judgment may be given condemning the vessel in the amount of the judgment and, if the judgment is not satisfied, the value of the vessel may be realised and sufficient to satisfy the judgement paid over to the claimant.</p>
