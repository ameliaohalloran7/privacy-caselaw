<p align="right"><a href="norris-4.htm">(back to preceding text)</a></p>

<p class="para">99.&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the very tentative indication of view by the Divisional Court in <i>R v Secretary of</i> <i>State for the Home Department, Ex p Norgren</i> [2000] QB 817, we consider that, for the reasons which Duff J gave in <i>Re Collins</i>, section 137(2)(b) of the 2003 Act must be interpreted and applied in the way that he indicated.  If, then, we ignore the adventitious circumstances connected with the conduct alleged against Mr Norris in counts 2 to 4 of the indictment and concentrate instead on the essence of his alleged acts, the substance of the criminality charged against him is not that he obstructed the criminal investigation into price fixing in the carbon products industry being carried out by the Pennsylvania grand jury, but that he obstructed the criminal investigation into that matter being carried out by the duly appointed body.  Making the necessary changes, we would have to translate counts 2 to 4 into counts of obstructing in England a criminal investigation into price-fixing in the carbon products industry being conducted by the appropriate investigatory body in this country.</p>
<p class="para">100.&nbsp;&nbsp;But Mr Sumption’s point goes deeper.  We have held that price fixing in itself is not an offence under English law.  He submitted that, since there could, accordingly, never have been a criminal investigation into price fixing in this country, Mr Norris could not have been guilty of an offence of obstructing justice by interfering with such an investigation.  We reject that submission.  While price fixing in itself is not an offence under English law, Mr Norris accepts that, when combined with other elements such as deliberate misrepresentation, it can lead to various offences such as fraud or conspiracy to defraud.  What the exact outcome of any investigation will be cannot be determined when it is in progress.  Destroying documents to prevent them falling into the hands of the investigators may well affect the outcome of that investigation and is, indeed, intended to do so.  So the mere fact that the result of the investigation in Mr Norris’ case was a charge of simple price fixing, which does not constitute an offence under English law, is no reason to hold that it would not have been an offence under English law to obstruct the progress of an equivalent investigation by the appropriate body in this country.</p>
<p class="para">101.&nbsp;&nbsp;Approaching the matter in that way, we are satisfied that, if Mr Norris had done in England what he is alleged to have done in counts 2 to 4, with the intention of obstructing an investigation being carried out into possible criminal conduct, in regard to fixing prices in the carbon products industry, by the duly appointed body in the United Kingdom, he would indeed have been guilty of offences of conspiring to obstruct justice or of obstructing justice, which could have attracted a sentence of twelve months’ imprisonment.  It follows that offences 2 to 4 on the indictment are “extradition offences” in terms of section 137(2)(b) of the 2003 Act.</p>
<p class="paraleft">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The application of section 82 of the 2003 Act</i></p>
<p class="para">102.&nbsp;&nbsp;Counts 2 to 4 relate to alleged events between April 1999 and August 2001.  On 31 December 2004 the warrant for Mr Norris’ arrest was issued in England at the request of the United States Government and the contested hearing before the district judge took place in May 2005.</p>
<p class="para">103.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 82 of the 2003 Act (at the relevant time, although since amended) provided:</p>
<p class="qt">“A person’s extradition to a category 2 territory is barred by reason of the passage of time if (and only if) it appears that it would be unjust or oppressive to extradite him by reason of the passage of time since he is alleged to have committed the extradition offence or since he is alleged to have become unlawfully at large (as the case may be).”</p>
<p class="para">104.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is common ground that “unjust” in section 82 is directed primarily at the risk of prejudice to the accused in the conduct of any trial by reason of the passage of time:  <i>Kakis v Government</i> <i>of the Republic of Cyprus</i> [1978] 1 WLR 779, 782H, per Lord Diplock; <i>R v Governor of Pentonville</i> <i>Prison</i>, <i>Ex p Narang</i> [1978] AC 247, 272D, per Viscount Dilhorne.</p>
<p class="para">105.&nbsp;&nbsp;The submission for Mr Norris was that, due to the time that had elapsed since the events alleged in counts 2 to 4, there was a risk that Mr Norris would be prejudiced in the conduct of any trial of those counts.  It was not possible to quantify the risk unless the United States authorities provided details of the evidence on which they intended to rely in support of these counts.  The district judge should accordingly have asked them to provide that information.</p>
<p class="para">106.&nbsp;&nbsp;The period between the alleged conduct in counts 2 to 4 and the arrest of Mr Norris is not strikingly long.  Indeed, in our view, it is not such as to make it prima facie likely that significant relevant witnesses or documents might no longer be available.</p>
<p class="para">107.&nbsp;&nbsp;The system of extradition under Part 2 of the 2003 Act does not require the requesting state to provide details of the evidence (witnesses, documents etc) on which the prosecution would rely at trial.  Nor does the district judge have any occasion to inquire into it.  It is also well settled that, consistently with that approach, in extradition proceedings the accused has no right to disclosure of the kind that would be available in domestic proceedings:  <i>Wellington v Governor of Belmarsh</i> <i>Prison</i> [2004] EWHC 418 (Admin) and <i>Jenkins  v Government of United States of America; Benbow v Government of United States of America</i> [2005] EWHC 1051 (Admin).  While the district judge has power to request further information from the requesting state, the same underlying considerations mean that such requests will be exceptional.  In <i>R (Government of the United States of America) v Bow Street Magistrates’ Court</i> [2006] EWHC 2256 (Admin); [2007] 1 WLR 1157, the Divisional Court indicated that such a request might be appropriate where the judge considered that an abuse of process might have occurred.  But, again, such cases are likely to be exceptional.  Moreover, Mr Norris does not suggest that there has been any abuse of process in the present proceedings.</p>
<p class="para">108.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Norris does contend, however, that the present case should be treated as being analogous to a case of abuse of process.  So, in order to assess whether it would be unjust to extradite him by reason of the lapse of time, the judge should request the United States to provide further information about the evidence on which the prosecution would rely in any trial of counts 2 to 4.  The district judge rejected the submission.  The Divisional Court upheld that decision.  We agree.</p>
<p class="para">109.&nbsp;&nbsp;Assume that it might be appropriate for a district judge to request further information in a case where he considered that, due to the lapse of time, there was reason to think that the accused might not be able to have a fair trial.  Nevertheless, as we have said, by itself, the relevant period of time in this case does not justify an inference that Mr Norris would not be able to have a fair trial.  He has provided no specification of the supposed risk - on the basis that he cannot do so without the information.  But the counts in the indictment contain an indication of the type of conduct alleged against him, and of the places where, and the dates when, it is said to have taken place.  Armed with that information, he must know who were his colleagues and opposite numbers at the relevant time and is in a position to instruct his lawyers and others to look into the matter.  Even such a preliminary investigation might be expected to reveal any grounds for considering that the lapse of time might have caused substantial prejudice to his right to a fair trial.  But he has put forward none and really relies on speculation.  In that situation, there is no basis whatever for the judge to make a request to the United States authorities for further information.  Doubtless, if it turned out on further investigation that there was reason to believe that, due to the loss of some significant evidence, Mr Norris could not have a fair trial, he would be able to raise that matter in any proceedings in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p class="paraleft">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Disposal</i></p>
<p class="para">110.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 87(1) of the 2003 Act requires the extradition judge to decide whether a person’s extradition would be incompatible with his Convention rights scheduled to the Human Rights Act 1998.  This calls for a judgment on the proportionality of an order of extradition in all the circumstances, having regard to the defendant’s rights under article 8 and any other relevant article.  In the present case the district judge considered that question and resolved it adversely to Mr Norris.  But he exercised his judgment on a basis different from that which now pertains, namely that Mr Norris was to be extradited on the main price-fixing count, and not merely the subsidiary counts.  It was suggested that the House should itself consider this question, and the question was raised whether it had power to remit the matter for re-consideration by the district judge.  But resolution of this question might well call for the evidence of witnesses, which the House is unaccustomed to receive; adoption of this procedure would deprive Mr Norris of the possibility of effective appeal; and we have no doubt that the House has an inherent power to remit determination of an issue to an inferior tribunal where the interests of justice so require, and that is a power which nothing in the 2003 Act purports to abrogate.</p>
<p class="para">111.&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to counts 2-4 the House will remit the matter to a district judge to decide the question raised by section 87(1) of the Act.  Depending on his answer, he will act in accordance with either subsection (2) or subsection (3) of that section.</p>
<p class="para">112.&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties are invited to make written submissions on costs within 14 days.</p>
