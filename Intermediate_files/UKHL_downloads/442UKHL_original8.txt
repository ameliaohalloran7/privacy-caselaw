<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;128. As Lord Reid noted ([1956] AC 613, 620), there was nothing new in the idea that the pursuer required to prove no more than that the defenders' wrongful act had materially contributed to his injury.  Although he did not refer to it, there was ample authority for the proposition in both English and Scots law.  For instance, in <i>Senior v Ward</i> (1859) 1 El &amp; El 385, 392, where the owner of a coal mine who superintended its operation had failed to test the cable of a cage as required by statutorily approved rules, Lord Campbell CJ, sitting in the Queen's Bench, would have held him liable, even though the banksman had also been at fault, because the mine owner's own negligence had "materially contributed to the death of the deceased."  In fact, however, the court held that the plaintiff's action failed because the deceased's own negligence had "materially contributed to his death".  In <i>Wakelin v London and South Western Railway Co</i> (1886) 12 App Cas 41, 47 Lord Watson stated that the liability of a defendant must rest in the first place on there being</p>
<p></p><ul>"some negligent act or omission on the part of the company or their servants which materially contributed to the injury or death complained ofâ€¦.  Mere allegation or proof that the company were guilty of negligence is altogether irrelevant;  they might be guilty of many negligent acts or omissions, which might possibly have occasioned injury to somebody, but had no connection whatever with the injury for which redress is sought, and therefore the plaintiff must allege and prove, not merely that they were negligent, but that their negligence caused or materially contributed to the injury."<p></p></ul>
<p>Similarly, in <i>Craig v Glasgow Corporation</i> 1919 SC(HL) 1, 6 where the pursuer sought damages for personal injuries caused by a tramcar driven by one of the defenders' employees, Lord Buckmaster said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is a common and familiar principle that in an action seeking such relief it is incumbent upon the pursuer to prove both that the defenders were guilty of negligence, and that such negligence caused, or materially contributed to, the injuries received."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;129. The idea of liability based on wrongful conduct that had materially contributed to an injury was therefore well established long before <i>Wardlaw</i>.  But <i>Wardlaw</i> became a convenient point of reference, especially in cases of industrial disease.  In such cases this basis of liability is of considerable importance.  Since it is enough that the defendant's wrongful act materially contributed to the claimant's injury, the law is not applying the <i>causa sine qua non</i> or "but for" test of causation.  In <i>Wardlaw</i>, for instance, the pursuer did not need to prove that, but for the dust from the swing hammers, he would not have developed pneumoconiosis  All he needed to prove was that the dust from the swing hammers contributed materially to the dusty atmosphere which he breathed and which caused his illness.  As will be seen below, in the Court of Session in <i>McGhee</i> the judges lost sight of this important point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;130. The House quickly applied this approach in two Scottish appeals that were heard one after the other:  <i>Quinn v Cameron &amp; Roberton Ltd</i> [1958] AC 9, 23 per Viscount Simonds, 34 per Lord Morton of Henryton, and <i>Nicholson v Atlas Steel Foundry and Engineering Co Ltd</i> [1957] 1 WLR 613.  The second is of particular importance for present purposes.  The action was at the instance of the relatives of a workman who had died from pneumoconiosis.  The man had worked in the defenders' dressing shop where there was a pneumatic hammer the operation of which, lawfully at the time, gave rise to siliceous dust in the atmosphere.  There were also two swing grinders, but it was unclear on the evidence whether they had given off dust.  The House therefore proceeded on the basis that all the dust in the atmosphere had been caused by the lawful operation of the pneumatic hammer.  It was proved, however, that the ventilation in the dressing shop was inadequate in terms of the relevant statutory provisions.  As a result the dust remained in the atmosphere for longer than would have been the case if the ventilation had met the statutory requirements.  The House followed the decision in <i>Wardlaw</i> and held the defenders liable on the ground that the inadequate ventilation had materially contributed to the man's pneumoconiosis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;131. Viscount Simonds, with whom Lord Oaksey and Lord Morton of Henryton concurred, set out his approach in these terms ([1957] 1 WLR 613, 618):</p>
<p></p><ul>"My Lords, I do not think that it can be wrong to approach this question from the angle that, if the statute prescribes a proper system of ventilation by the circulation of fresh air so as to render harmless, so far as practicable, all fumes, dust and other impurities that may be injurious to health, generated in the course of work carried on in the factory, and if it is proved that there is no system or only an inadequate system of ventilation, it requires little further to establish a causal link between that default and the illness, due to noxious dust, of a person employed in the shop.  Something is required as was held in <i>Wardlaw</i>'s case.  I was a party to that decision and would not in any way resile from it.  But it must not be pressed too far.  In the present case there was, in my opinion, ample evidence to support the appellants' case.  The appellants rightly or wrongly by their pleadings assumed the burden not only of proving that there was a causal link between default and disease but also of proving that it was practicable for the respondents to have reduced the risk by the provision of additional roof ventilators and openings in the walls for the admission of fresh air."<p></p></ul>
<p>Viscount Simonds thus firmly adhered to the decision in <i>Wardlaw</i>, that there could be no question of reversing the burden of proof which lay on a pursuer to establish the necessary causal link between the employer's default and his illness.  Nevertheless, he considered that, where a statutory provision prescribed a system of ventilation to remove elements in the atmosphere that might be injurious to health and the employer had no ventilation or only an inadequate system, these factors were relevant in considering how much more the pursuer required to prove in order to establish the causal link between the employer's default and the pursuer's disease due to noxious dust.  In other words, these factors were relevant to <i>what</i> or <i>how much </i>the pursuer had to prove in order to establish the causal link, rather than to the attitude that the court should take when assessing the evidence adduced for that purpose.  Viscount Simonds went on to consider whether it was practicable for the defenders to have provided a better system of ventilation.  He concluded that it was.  Therefore the dust containing dangerous particles had hung about in the air in a concentrated form for longer than it would have done if there had been that better system of ventilation.  He continued ([1957] 1 WLR 613, 620):</p>
<p></p><ul>"It follows that owing to the default of the respondents the deceased was exposed to a greater degree of risk than he should have been, and, though it is impossible, even approximately, to quantify the particles of dust which he must, in any event, have inhaled and those which he inhaled but need not have, I cannot regard the excess as something so negligible that the maxim 'de minimis' is applicable.  Accordingly, following the decision in <i>Wardlaw</i>'s case, I must hold the respondents liable."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;132. Similarly Lord Cohen said ([1957] 1 WLR 613, 622):</p>
<p></p><ul>"The respondents are admittedly not to blame for the generation of this cloud, but any failure to provide proper ventilation must, I think, lengthen the period during which the cloud remains intense.  It seems to me to follow that the respondents' failure to provide adequate ventilation must increase the risk to which the workmen are exposed.  Reading the evidence as a whole, I think it establishes that (to use the language of Lord Reid in <i>Wardlaw</i>'s case) 'on a balance of probabilities the breach of duty caused or materially contributed to' the injury."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;133. Questions of the risk or increased risk of causing harm are more frequently considered in relation to issues of foreseeability and fault.  But these passages are important precisely because they show that the House was proceeding on the basis that, in considering whether the pursuers in <i>Nicholson</i> had proved that the defenders had materially contributed to the deceased's condition, it was relevant to consider whether the defenders' wrongful act had exposed him to an increased risk of disease.  In other words, in that case proof of increased risk of harm to the deceased was relevant to proof of causation of that harm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;134. In <i>McGhee</i> Lord Simon of Glaisdale suggested ([1973] 1 WLR 1, 8H) that the same had been said in the opinion of the Lord Ordinary (Kilbrandon) in another dermatitis case, <i>Gardiner v Motherwell Machinery and Scrap Co Ltd </i>1961 SC(HL) 1, 3.  Lord Kilbrandon recorded the argument on behalf of the pursuer in these terms:</p>
<p></p><ul>"that the washing facilities which were provided were inadequate and primitive, and that, if they had been up to standard, the risk of dermatitis would have been very much reduced."<p></p></ul>
<p>As Lord Simon noted, Lord Kilbrandon accepted that argument.  He did so towards the end of his opinion (1961 SC(HL) 1, 4):</p>
<p></p><ul>"In my opinion, the defenders neglected to supply reasonable washing facilities in the circumstances, and thereby exposed the pursuer to an enhanced risk of contracting industrial dermatitis.  They are accordingly liable to him in damages."<p></p></ul>
<p>It appears, however, that, both when recording the argument and when giving his decision on it, Lord Kilbrandon was concerned with fault rather than with causation, since he had already held (1961 SC(HL) 1, 3), on the basis of the dermatologists' evidence, that the pursuer had established the necessary causal link between his work with the defenders and the onset of his dermatitis.  In these later passages Lord Kilbrandon seems to have been making the point that the defenders' failure to provide adequate washing facilities amounted to legally relevant fault where it was foreseeable that this would lead to an enhanced risk of dermatitis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;135. Be that as it may, the statements in the speeches of Viscount Simonds and Lord Cohen in <i>Nicholson</i> had stood unchallenged for some 15 years when the House came to consider <i>McGhee v National Coal Board</i>, again an appeal from the Court of Session.  The case involved a claim for dermatitis which the pursuer had developed after working in a hot and dusty atmosphere, pulling bricks out of the defenders' kiln.  At the relevant time there were no showers at the works and so, when his working day was over, the pursuer had to cycle home without washing the sweat, dust and grit from his body.  As indeed often happens, the point upon which the decision was ultimately to turn emerged only after the Lord Ordinary had rejected much of the rest of the pursuer's case.  The pursuer began the proof before answer with both a common law and a statutory case to the effect that the defenders should have provided a system of ventilating the kiln.  He disclaimed the statutory case at the hearing on evidence.  The Lord Ordinary (Kissen) rejected the common law case.  He also rejected the pursuer's case that the defenders should have taken reasonable care to see that the kiln had cooled sufficiently before the pursuer and his colleagues were sent to work in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;136. The pursuer had a further common law case which he set out at the end of article 3 of condescendence in these terms:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It was their duty to take reasonable care to provide adequate washing facilities including showers, soap and towels to enable men to remove dust from their bodies.  In each and all of said duties the defenders failed and so caused said disease.  Had the defenders fulfilled said duties incumbent on them the pursuer would not have contracted said disease."<p></p></ul>
<p>The final averments in this passage relate, of course, to the alleged failure by the defenders to perform all the common law duties averred by the pursuer, including those that the Lord Ordinary had rejected.  The Lord Ordinary held that the pursuer had indeed contracted his dermatitis in the course of his work in the brick kiln and as a result of his exposure to dust and ashes there (1973 SC(HL) 37, 39).  He also held that the defenders were at fault in not providing showers but that the pursuer had failed to prove on the balance of probabilities that this fault on the part of the defenders had caused or materially contributed to his injury (1973 SC(HL) 37, 42 - 43).  Lord Kissen put the point in this way:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Dr Hannay's evidence was that he could not say that the provision of showers would probably have prevented the disease.  He said that it would have reduced the risk materially but he would not go further than that.  Dr Ferguson said that washing reduces the risk.  Pursuer's counsel maintained that a material increase in the risk of contracting a disease was the same as a material contribution to contracting the disease and that Dr Hannay established this by his evidence.  I think that defenders' counsel was correct when he said that the distinction drawn by Dr Hannay was correct and that an increase in risk did not necessarily mean a material contribution to the contracting of the disease.  The two concepts are entirely different.  A material increase in risk may refer only to possibilities and may not make a possibility into a probability.  It may strengthen the possibility but that cannot mean that in all such cases the possibility has become a probability.  What the pursuer has to show is that, <i>as he avers</i>, he would not have contracted the disease but for the defenders' breach of duty.  He has to show that this was probable and the degrees of risk have no relevance unless they make the contraction of the disease more probable than not contracting the disease.  He cannot succeed if the only inference from the evidence is that lack of shower baths is a possibility as a cause of his having contracted the disease and that the provision of shower baths would have increased the possibility but not made it a probability.  That is the only inference which I can draw from Dr Hannay's evidence and that was the best evidence for the pursuer.  Causal connection between fault and the contraction of the disease has not been established" (emphasis added).<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;137. The pursuer reclaimed but the First Division (Lord President Clyde, Lord Migdale and Lord Johnston) refused the reclaiming motion.  The Division proceeded on the basis that, in accordance with his averments in article 3 of condescendence, the pursuer had to prove that the provision of showers would have prevented his dermatitis (1973 SC(HL) 37, 43 per the Lord President, 46 - 47 per Lord Migdale).  They also took the view that the effects of the heat and dust had come to an end when the pursuer left the kiln so that the failure to provide washing facilities could have played no part in the development of the pursuer's condition (1973 SC(HL) 37, 44 per Lord President Clyde, 47 per Lord Migdale, with whom Lord Johnston somewhat hesitantly agreed).  Since all the damage had been done in the kiln, a shower could not have obviated or lessened that damage (1973 SC(HL) 37, 48 per Lord Migdale).  In addition, however, in a passage (1973 SC(HL) 37, 45) that Lord Salmon was specifically to disapprove ([1973] 1 WLR 1, 11E - F) the Lord President held that</p>
<p></p><ul>"Even if the pursuer had established (as he did not) that the absence of washing facilities increased the risk of the pursuer getting dermatitis, that would clearly not prove that the absence of these facilities caused the disease, nor indeed would it go any distance towards proving it.  For risk of dermatitis and causation of dermatitis are two quite separate matters."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;138. This House analysed both the evidence and the pursuer's case rather differently from the Court of Session.  The medical witnesses were agreed that the defenders' failure to provide washing facilities increased the risk of the pursuer developing dermatitis.  In this sense, and in this sense only, the abrasion to the pursuer's skin was cumulative:  "the longer a subject is exposed to injury the greater the chance of his developing dermatitis" ([1973] 1 WLR 1, 3H - 4A per Lord Reid).  The fact that the risk did increase in this way if no washing facilities were provided was important because it showed that, contrary to the view taken by the First Division, the pursuer had not left behind the causes which made him liable to develop dermatitis when he left the brick kiln ([1973] 1 WLR 1, 4H - 5A per Lord Reid).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;139. On the other hand, the evidence did not show just how the type of dermatitis affecting the pursuer began.  Lord Reid summarised the effect of the evidence in this way ([1973] 1 WLR 1, 4F - G):</p>
<p></p><ul>"It suggests to me that there are two possible ways.  It may be that an accumulation of minor abrasions of the horny layer of the skin is a necessary precondition for the onset of the disease.  Or it may be that the disease starts at one particular abrasion and then spreads, so that multiplication of abrasions merely increases the number of places where the disease can start and in that way increases the risk of its occurrence.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>I am inclined to think that the evidence points to the former view.  But in a field where so little appears to be known with certainty I could not say that it is proved.  If it were, then this case would be indistinguishable from <i>Wardlaw</i>'s case."<p></p></ul>
<p>In this passage Lord Reid goes into more of the detail of the medical evidence than either the Lord Ordinary or the First Division.  From what he says here and elsewhere ([1973] 1 WLR 1, 3G) it is clear, of course, that the pursuer's condition would not have developed but for his work in the kiln.  It was there that he was exposed to the heat that made him sweat profusely and so softened his skin and made it easily injured.  It was there also that he was exposed to the cloud of brick dust, with the result that the particles adhered to his skin.  Exertion then caused the dust to injure the horny layer of his skin and so exposed the tender cells below to injury or infection.  The most significant exertion would, presumably, have occurred while the pursuer was working in the kiln, pulling out the bricks.  But the pursuer would also have exerted himself while cycling home and, perhaps, when he got home.  So any abrasions on his softened skin could have been caused either by the exertion in the kiln or else by the exertion during his ride home or by a combination of the two.  For the consequences of the exertion in the kiln alone the defenders would not have been liable since they were not at fault in that respect.  For the consequences of the exertion during his cycle ride, the defenders would, on the other hand, have been liable since the pursuer would not have been open to injury due to dust on his skin at that stage if the defenders had fulfilled their duty to provide showers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;140. On this analysis the pursuer could succeed in his claim only if he could connect his dermatitis with his ride home while unwashed, rather than simply with his work in the kiln.  Lord Reid pointed out, however, that the pursuer's pleadings in respect of the duty to provide showers were potentially misleading ([1973] 1 WLR 1, 4C).  He did not elaborate the point, but he clearly had in mind the standard-form averment at the end of article 3 of condescendence in which the pursuer offered to prove that, if the defenders had fulfilled their duty to provide showers, he would not have contracted dermatitis.  Even though both the Lord Ordinary and the First Division had judged his case on that basis, the pursuer's self-imposed goal was too tough.  He did not need to go that far.  It would be sufficient and relevant in law if the pursuer showed that the defenders' failure had materially contributed to the development of his dermatitis, whether or not the dermatitis would have developed but for that failure.  So, despite the terms of the pursuer's averment, Lord Reid considered his case by simply asking whether the defenders' failure to provide showers had materially contributed to the development of the pursuer's dermatitis.  It was at this point that the difficulty in the case came into focus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;141. According to the medical evidence, the pursuer's dermatitis might have occurred either as a result of an accumulation of abrasions or as a result of a single abrasion.  If the former were the case, then one could say that the accumulation of abrasions had resulted from the effects of the pursuer's exertions as a whole.  Just as it had been right in <i>Wardlaw</i> to consider the effects of the cloud of dust as a whole and not to break it down into "innocent" and "guilty" particles, so in <i>McGhee</i> it would have been right to consider the effects of the exertion as a whole acting on the dust particles on his skin and not to break the exertion down into "innocent" exertion in the kiln and "guilty" exertion on the way home.  Provided that the exertion on the way home was material, it would be proper to hold that the effects of that exertion on the dust still on his unwashed skin materially contributed to cause the pursuer's illness.  But the pursuer had only proved that the accumulation of abrasions was one possible mechanism for triggering his dermatitis.  The evidence showed that another possibility was that the disease had started from a single abrasion.  If that were the case, liability could not be based on the cumulative effect of the pursuer's exertions in producing an accumulation of abrasions.  So the analogy of <i>Wardlaw</i> would not apply.  But, furthermore, the pursuer could not prove that this hypothetical single abrasion had been caused by his exertion when riding home with the dust adhering to his skin, rather than by his exertions in the kiln.  The defenders argued that the pursuer's case must therefore fail because he had not proved, and could not prove, that the defenders' failure to provide showers had caused or materially contributed to the onset of his illness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;142. Lord Reid dealt with that argument in this way ([1973] 1 WLR 1, 4G - 5B):</p>
<p></p><ul>"But I think that in cases like this we must take a broader view of causation.  The medical evidence is to the effect that the fact that the man had to cycle home caked with grime and sweat added materially to the risk that this disease might develop.  It does not and could not explain just why that is so.  But experience shows that it is so.  Plainly that must be because what happens while the man remains unwashed can have a causative effect, though just how the cause operates is uncertain.  I cannot accept the view expressed in the Inner House that once the man left the brick kiln he left behind the causes which made him liable to develop dermatitis.  That seems to me quite inconsistent with a proper interpretation of the medical evidence.  Nor can I accept the distinction drawn by the Lord Ordinary between materially increasing the risk that the disease will occur and making a material contribution to its occurrence.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>There may be some logical ground for such a distinction where our knowledge of all the material factors is complete.  But it has often been said that the legal concept of causation is not based on logic or philosophy.  It is based on the practical way in which the ordinary man's mind works in the everyday affairs of life.  From a broad and practical viewpoint I can see no substantial difference between saying that what the defender did materially increased the risk of injury to the pursuer and saying that what the defender did made a material contribution to his injury."<p></p></ul>
<p>Lord Reid holds that, even though the evidence leaves open the two possible causes of his illness, the pursuer succeeds because the court takes a broader view of causation.  There is nothing whatever to suggest that, in reaching this conclusion, Lord Reid was simply adopting a robust and pragmatic approach to the primary facts and holding that it could somehow be inferred - in the face of the expert evidence which he had just narrated and which gave rise to the very problem that had to be resolved - that, if the pursuer's dermatitis was caused by a single abrasion, that particular abrasion was caused by his exertion while riding home.  What Lord Reid does, rather, is to accept that the pursuer must prove that the defender's conduct materially contributed to the onset of his illness but also, like Viscount Simonds and Lord Cohen in <i>Nicholson</i>, he considers what it is that the pursuer must prove in order to establish that material contribution.  Taking the "broader view of causation", he holds that, in these particular circumstances, there is no substantial difference between saying that what the defenders did materially increased the risk of injury to the pursuer and saying that it made a material contribution to his injury.  This is his decision on the point of law posed in the case.  Proof that the defenders' failure to provide showers had materially increased the risk that the pursuer would develop dermatitis would therefore be, as a matter of law, sufficient to prove that the defenders had materially contributed to the onset of his condition.  And, of course, the pursuer had actually proved that their failure had increased that risk.  Lord Reid accordingly allowed the appeal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;143. My Lords, I have analysed the leading speech of Lord Reid at considerable length.  Happily, it is unnecessary to go into the other speeches in the same detail, since it is in my view clear that Lord Wilberforce, Lord Simon of Glaisdale and Lord Salmon all took essentially the same approach as Lord Reid.  They were prepared to hold, under reference to the speeches of Viscount Simonds and Lord Cohen in <i>Nicholson</i>, that in the particular circumstances, by proving that the defenders' negligent failure to provide showers had increased the risk that he would develop dermatitis, the pursuer had proved that the defenders' failure had materially contributed to his dermatitis.  I do not take up space by repeating the relevant passages, all of which have been set out by Lord Bingham of Cornhill.  I refer in particular to the long passage towards the end of the speech of Lord Wilberforce ([1973] 1 WLR 1, 6G - 7F), which is by no means predicated on the reference to a possible reversal of the onus of proof that the House detected and disapproved in <i>Wilsher</i> [1988] AC 1074, 1087G.  In <i>McGhee</i> indeed any reference to the possibility of proof by the defenders was necessarily obiter since, ex hypothesi, there was no relevant medical evidence which they could have led.  Despite his reference to "sufficient prima facie evidence", Lord Simon's approach is similar ([1973] 1 WLR 1, 8D - 9B).  The same goes for two passages in Lord Salmon's speech where he specifically rejects the distinction between materially increasing the risk of contracting industrial disease and materially contributing to causing it ([1973] 1 WLR 1, 11H - 12A, 12G - 13A).  Although Lord Kilbrandon reached the same conclusion as the rest of the House, his exact approach is harder to determine.  Like the judges in the Court of Session, however, he appears to have taken the view that the pursuer needed to prove that, but for the defenders' failure to provide showers, he would not have contracted dermatitis ([1973] 1 WLR 1, 10G).  For present purposes it is unnecessary to investigate his minority view in more detail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;144. While Lord Wilberforce's observations on the burden of proof have been disapproved, the decision itself in <i>McGhee</i> has not been overruled.  Nor indeed did counsel for the respondents suggest that it should now be overruled.  It may well be that in <i>McGhee</i> the members of the House could have proclaimed more clearly and more openly that they were stating a new principle.  If so, the possible virtues of a certain reticence in such matters were famously recognised by Lord Devlin (<i>The Judge</i> (1979), p 12).  But the risk was, of course, that opinions couched in this way might be misconstrued.  As, in my view, did indeed happen.  In <i>Wilsher v Essex Area Health Authority</i> [1988] AC 1074 the House examined <i>McGhee</i> and came to the conclusion that the decision rested not on any legal principle but on nothing more than "a robust and pragmatic approach" to the facts of the case.  In my respectful opinion, that conclusion was inconsistent with the terms of the speeches in <i>McGhee</i>.</p>
