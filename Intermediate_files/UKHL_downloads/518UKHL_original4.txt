<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88.	In <i>Caffoor v Income Tax Commissioner </i>[1961]  AC 584 the Board of Review constituted under the Ceylon Income Tax Ordinance 1932 had decided on an appeal by the appellants in respect of an assessment for the year 1949-50 that trust income was exempt from income tax on the ground that the trust was of a public character established solely for charitable purposes.  When assessments to income tax were again made on the trust for the years 1950-51 to 1954-55, it was held that the respondent was not estopped by the decision of the Board of Review from challenging the appellants' claim to exemption for subsequent years.  Lord Radcliffe, who delivered the judgment of the Board, said at p. 598:</p>


<p></p><ul>"The critical thing is that the dispute which alone can be determined by any decision given in the course of these proceedings is limited to one subject only, the amount of the assessable income for the year in which the assessment is challenged.  It is only the amount of that assessable income that is concluded by an assessment or by a decision on an appeal against it. . .  Although, of course, the process of arriving at the necessary decision is likely to involve the consideration of questions of law, turning upon the construction of the Ordinance or of other statutes or upon the general law, and the tribunal will have to form its view on those questions, all these questions have to be treated as collateral or incidental to what is the only issue that is truly submitted to determination. . ."<p></p></ul>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89.	I would apply that reasoning to the present case.  The Ceylon Ordinance was closely modelled on the legislation that applies in the United Kingdom.  The purpose of an appeal under section 31 of the 1970 Act is to challenge the amount charged to tax by an assessment.  The finality that attaches to the determination of the appeal by the General Commissioners or by the Special Commissioners or to the settling of the appeal by agreement relates only to the amount chargeable under that assessment.  The question as to the amount of any reliefs carried forward to subsequent periods remains open for examination as the assessment for each subsequent period is issued. This is because the Taxes Acts do not provide any means by which that amount may be determined conclusively, whether by appeal or by agreement, for any period other than that to which the assessment relates.</p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90.	For these reasons I would hold that an agreement made under section 54 has no wider effect upon the position of either party than that which has been provided for by the statute.  As Carnwath J indicated, [1997] STC 1103, 1133E-F, the issue turns simply and solely upon the machinery which the Taxes Acts provide for determining the amount in question between the Commissioners and the taxpayer.  That machinery is limited to determining conclusively the amount of tax chargeable for the year of assessment.  It does not enable such determinations to be made, either on appeal or by agreement, as to the amounts of tax chargeable in future years.</p>


<p><b>LORD HUTTON</b></p>


<p>My Lords,</p>


<p>91.	I have had the advantage of reading in draft the speeches of my noble and learned friends Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead and Lord Hoffmann.  I agree that the appeal of the Crown should be dismissed for the reasons which they give, and I add a few observations of my own on the application of the <i>Ramsay</i> principle to the present case.</p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92.	The submission of the Crown is that, applying the <i>Ramsay</i> principle, there have been no payments of yearly interest within the meaning of section 338(1) and (3) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 because all that has taken place is a pre-ordained artificial circulation of funds, which had no commercial purpose apart from the gaining of a tax advantage.  Accordingly the payments should be disregarded and do not constitute payments within the meaning of section 338.</p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93.	I consider that an essential element of a transaction to which the <i>Ramsay</i> principle is applicable is that it should be artificial. The requirement that there must be artificiality, and the importance of distinguishing between the real world and the world of make-belief, between a real gain (or loss) and a contrived and unrealistic gain (or loss) have been stressed in a number of judgments of the House where the application of the <i>Ramsay</i> principle have been considered.  In his judgment in <i>Ramsay</i> itself [1982] AC 300, 326D Lord Wilberforce said:</p>


<p></p><ul>"The capital gains tax was created to operate in the real world, not that of make-belief.  As I said in <i>Aberdeen Construction Group Ltd v Inland Revenue Commissioners</i> [1978]  AC 885, it is a tax on gains (or I might have added gains less losses), it is not a tax on arithmetical differences."<p></p></ul>


<p>In <i>Inland Revenue Commissiioners v Burmah Oil Co Ltd</i> (1981) 54 TC 200, 221H  Lord Fraser of Tullybelton stated:</p>


<p></p><ul>"If the argument for Burmah is right, this would be one more case in which the taxpayer had achieved the apparently magic result of creating a tax loss that was not a real loss.  In my opinion they have not achieved that result because, in the same way as in <i>Ramsay's</i> case, when the scheme was carried through to completion there was here no real loss and no loss in the sense contemplated by the legislation."<p></p></ul>


<p>The same theme was stated by Lord Goff of Chieveley in <i>Craven v White</i> [1989]  AC 398, 519F:</p>


<p></p><ul>"What the courts have established, however, is that certain tax avoidance schemes, although not shams in the sense of not being what they purport to be, are nevertheless unacceptable because they embrace transactions which are not 'real' disposals or do not generate 'real' losses (or gains) and so are held not to attract certain fiscal consequences which would normally be attached to disposals or losses (or gains) under the relevant statute."<p></p></ul>


<p>Lord Goff of Chieveley reiterated this theme in <i>Ensign Tankers (Leasing) Ltd v Stokes</i> [1992]  1 AC 655, 681C: </p>


<p></p><ul>"Unacceptable tax avoidance typically involves the creation of complex artificial structures by which, as though by the wave of a magic wand, the taxpayer conjures out of the air a loss, or a gain, or expenditure, or whatever it may be, which otherwise would never have existed.  These structures are designed to achieve an adventitious tax benefit for the taxpayer, and in truth are no more than raids on the public funds at the expense of the general body of taxpayers, and as such are unacceptable."<p></p></ul>


<p>And in his speech in <i>Inland Revenue Commissioners v McGuckian</i> [1997]  1 WLR 991, 998C Lord Browne-Wilkinson laid emphasis on the need to identify artificial steps and said that under the <i>Ramsay</i> principle:</p>


<p></p><ul>"the statutory provisions are to be applied to the substance of the transaction, disregarding artificial steps in the composite transaction or series of transactions inserted only for the purpose of seeking to obtain a tax advantage.  The question is not what was the effect of the insertion of the artificial steps but what was its purpose.  Having identified the artificial steps inserted with that purpose and disregarded them, then what is left is to apply the statutory language of the taxing Act to the transaction carried through stripped of its artificial steps."<p></p></ul>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94.	Therefore I<i> </i>turn to the facts of this case to see whether the Crown can contend that the payments of interest claimed as allowances by Westmoreland Investments Limited ("Westmoreland") are artificial or  unreal or conjured out of the air.  In my opinion they are not because the obligation undertaken by Westmoreland to pay interest on the sums it had been lent by the scheme trustees was a genuine one which existed in the real world.</p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95.	The Special Commissioners found [1997] STC 1103, 1116G that:</p>


<p></p><ul>"all the loans made to the taxpayer company from 1980 onwards were real loans and the taxpayer company used them for real purposes, viz the discharge of real earlier outstanding loans and the payment of real accrued interest…. "<p></p></ul>


<p>Therefore by undertaking to pay the interest Westmoreland had incurred the economic burden which Parliament intended should give rise to the allowances given by section 338, and I consider that Westmoreland was entitled to take steps to obtain the advantage which Parliament gave to it in respect of that burden.  As Lord Templeman said in <i>Ensign Tankers (Leasing) Ltd v Stokes</i> at page 676D:  "the taxpayer is entitled to any reduction in tax which Parliament has attached to each transaction."  </p>


<p>This was not a case, as in <i>Inland Revenue Commissioners v McGuckian</i>, where a tax payer was on the point of incurring a tax liability and took an artificial step to avoid the liability:  rather this was a case where Westmoreland had incurred a genuine loss for tax purposes and then took a step to enable it to claim the tax allowance for that loss.  Accordingly I am in respectful agreement with Peter Gibson LJ ([1998] STC 1131, 1143B) that:</p>


<p></p><ul>"In the present case the accrued interest liability was real and always possessed the potentiality of being converted into a charge on income by payment.  What occurred was the crystallisation of the tax loss through payment of the accrued interest." <p></p></ul>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96.	The fact that in order to pay the accrued interest so as to claim the allowances given by section 338 Westmoreland had to use money lent to it by the trustees of the scheme who had lent it the capital sums on which the interest was to be paid, does not mean, in my opinion, that the payment of the interest was not a genuine payment.  In <i>Ensign Tankers (Leasing) Ltd v Stokes</i> [1989]  1 WLR 1222, 1241, Millett J stated:</p>


<p></p><ul>"Money raised by borrowing belongs to the borrower.  It is as much his money as any other money of his.  Expenditure is incurred by the taxpayer whatever the source of the finance with which he intends to meet it."<p></p></ul>


<p>And in <i>Customs and Excise Commissioners v Faith Construction Ltd</i> [1990]  1 QB 905, 921G Bingham LJ said:</p>


<p></p><ul>"If the payments are to be disregarded the commissioners would, I think, have to show them to be a sham, and this they have not sought to do.  If, as I have concluded, these were in law good contractual payments, then I do not think we are entitled to disregard their legal effect and treat them as something else."<p></p></ul>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97.	Therefore I consider that the payment of interest by Westmoreland was a real payment and not an artificial transaction, and accordingly that the <i>Ramsay</i> principle is not applicable to it.  Accordingly I would dismiss the appeal. </p>


<p><b>LORD HOBHOUSE OF WOODBOROUGH</b></p>


<p>My Lords,</p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98.	I agree that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann.</p>
