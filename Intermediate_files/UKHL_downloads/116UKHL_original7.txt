<p class="para">136.&nbsp;&nbsp;S.72 of the VAT Act 1994 creates a criminal offence of considerable width, which may lead to a court ordering a penalty of up to three times the VAT evaded and/or imprisonment. In so far as the evasion of VAT - which Total in combination with other companies is alleged to have been concerned in or to have taken steps with a view to - took place in England, it is arguable, and I am ready for present purposes to assume, that the principle of territoriality of criminal legislation would not preclude the application of s.72 to Total. But s.72 is capable of co-existing with the common law offence of cheating the revenue (cf <i>R v. Mavji </i>cited in para. 113 above), and I see nothing in the existence of either of these criminal offences to exclude or preclude the use of ordinary civil law remedies, if otherwise available. The practicalities, the ease of pursuit, the aims and results and the enforcement of civil and criminal proceedings all differ radically. There are under the VAT Act 1994 provisions whereby a conviction under s.72 or for cheating the revenue will preclude the assessment of a penalty under s.60 or s.63 (see s.60(6) and s.63(11)(a)), and the assessment of a penalty under s.60 will preclude the assessment of a penalty under s.63 (see s.63(11)(b)). But I see no inconsistency or even incongruity in it being possible, despite the conviction of one conspirator under s.72, to pursue a common law remedy in tort against another conspirator. I do not think that the conspirator who has been convicted can be regarded as having escaped liability. The likelihood is, if anything, that s/he will suffer a considerably heavier penalty, including it may well be a financial penalty in excess of any loss that the Revenue could claim to have suffered in civil proceedings.</p>
<p class="para">137.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is of course the case that, if a common law claim against Total is possible, it will be pursued through the courts, and the statutory rules, procedures and mechanisms relating to such matters as limitation, appeals against assessments and mitigation of penalties will not apply. But, as I have already noted, the Commissioners might have a claim for conspiracy against persons such as financial and legal advisers, against whom the statutory scheme could not afford any right to recover the VAT or VAT repayment in issue. If such persons have by a successful conspiracy caused the Commissioners to pay out a false VAT credit to other conspirators, is it to be said that the statute precludes any civil claim against them? Further, it is of the essence of any such civil claim that it is brought to recoup any loss that the Commissioners may ultimately suffer after all statutory remedies reasonably available have been exhausted. The Commissioners have to mitigate their loss by taking reasonable steps in that regard. A court assessing damages will have to take into account the Commissioners’ statutory rights and, so far as they have not been exhausted and enforced, make an assessment as to their value. That is a different exercise from any which a tax tribunal will have to undertake. Parallel, though different, exercises of this nature have not infrequently to take place in various legal contexts, where all connected proceedings cannot be combined, and I do not see their possibility as any indication that the statutory scheme should be treated as precluding the Commissioners’ claiming damages for conspiracy at common law.</p>
<p class="para">138.&nbsp;&nbsp;The possibility under s.70(1) of a tax tribunal reducing a penalty imposed under the statute (though not by reference to any of the matters specified in s.70(4)) appears to me irrelevant. As I have already said, the sanction of a penalty is conceptually distinct from the compensation afforded by a common law claim for damages. There is no call or basis in the case of a common law claim for reducing whatever the court may find to be the properly recoverable loss suffered by a claimant. </p>
<p class="para">139.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, I would, in common with Lords Scott and Walker, answer issue (a)(ii) in the Commissioners’ favour, by holding that there is nothing in the statutory scheme to preclude the Commissioners’ pursuit of a common law claim for conspiracy against Total. It follows that I would allow the Commissioners’ appeal on issue (b) and hold that the Commissioners’ common law conspiracy claim based on unlawful means can as pleaded exist in law, while I would dismiss Total’s cross-appeal on issue (a) and hold that the pursuit of such a claim is not precluded by either the Bill of Rights or the statutory scheme of the Value Added Tax Act 1994. </p>
<p class="paraleft">LORD NEUBERGER OF ABBOTSBURY</p>
<p class="paraleft">My Lords, </p>
<i><p class="paraleft">Introductory</p>
</i><p class="para">140.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commissioners’ pleaded case raises a claim for damages against Total based on the tort of conspiracy. The core allegation is that Total was party to a so-called carousel fraud, which resulted in the Commissioners not recovering VAT which they should have recovered, or paying an alleged VAT credit which they should not have paid. The preliminary issue to be determined is whether the Commissioners “have, as a matter of law, a cause of action” against Total “as pleaded in [their] Consolidated and Amended Particulars of Claim".</p>
<p class="para">141.&nbsp;&nbsp;The preliminary issue proceeds on the assumption that the Commissioners will make out the factual allegations which they have pleaded. These allegations have been very clearly set out and explained by my noble and learned friends, Lord Hope of Craighead, and Lord Scott of Foscote, in paras 3 to 10 and paras 49 and 51 of their respective opinions, which I have had the privilege of seeing in draft.</p>
<p class="para">142.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commissioners put their case on conspiracy on two bases. The first involves accepting the carousel transactions, as summarised by Lord Hope in para 7 and by Lord Scott in para 51, as effective for VAT purposes, on the ground that each transaction constituted an economic activity within the meaning of article 4(2) of the Sixth Directive (77/388/EEC). On this basis, the loss suffered by the Commissioners is the output tax that ought to have been paid by Redlaw, but was not. The second basis involves treating the carousel transactions as deceitful shams falling outside the ambit of article 4(2) of the Sixth Directive. On this basis, the Commissioners’ loss arises from the credit claimed by and accorded to Alldech in respect of input tax, which was paid by the Commissioners.</p>
<p class="para">143.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the arguments which have been advanced before your Lordships, it seems to me that the issues which need to be resolved are as follows:</p>
<p class="paraleft">a.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether, even if otherwise justified, the Commissioners’ claim based on conspiracy must fail because: </p>
<p class="paraleft">i.&nbsp;&nbsp;The claim falls foul of Article 4 of the Bill of Rights 1688 (“the Bill of Rights issue”); </p>
<p class="paraleft">ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Value Added Tax Act 1994 constitutes a regime which excludes the claim (“the complete code issue”); </p>
<p class="paraleft">b.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the claim cannot in any event be made out on the Commissioners’ pleaded case (“the conspiracy tort issue”).</p>
<p class="para">144.&nbsp;&nbsp;I set out the issues in this way, because it appears to me that the Bill of Rights issue and the complete code issue are to some extent connected. The conspiracy tort issue involves a rather different argument, which, if successful, may have the same effect. Before considering those three issues, which raise points of difficulty and significance, it is convenient briefly (a) to summarise the relevant provisions of the Value Added Tax Act 1994 (“the 1994 Act”), as they play such a crucial part in the arguments on the first two issues, and (b) to consider the viability of the Commissioners’ two ways of putting their case in the light of the Sixth Directive, which is, of course, the overarching legislative code relating to VAT. All references to sections and schedules hereafter are to those of the 1994 Act unless the contrary is stated.</p>
<i><p class="paraleft">The Value Added Tax Act 1994</p>
</i>
<p class="para">145.&nbsp;&nbsp;Part I of the 1994 Act is concerned with the “Charge to Tax” and it identifies the items upon which tax is chargeable, the persons who are chargeable, and when they are chargeable. Section 24(1) defines “input tax” as VAT on the supply to a taxpayer of goods or services or on the acquisition by him of goods from another member state. Section 24(2) defines “output tax” as VAT on the supply by a taxpayer of goods and services or on the acquisition by him of goods from another member state. Section 25(1) effectively requires a taxable person to account for and pay output tax by reference to “accounting periods", in accordance with regulations. Sections 25(2) and 26 entitle a taxable person to credit for input tax, again in accordance with regulations. Those regulations enable a taxpayer whose input tax exceeds his output tax to recover the difference from the Commissioners. </p>
<p class="para">146.&nbsp;&nbsp;Part II of the 1994 Act, which deals with “Reliefs, Exemptions and Repayments", and Part III, which is concerned with “Application of [the 1994 Act] in Particular Cases", are not relevant for the purposes of this appeal. </p>
<p class="para">147.&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IV of the 1994 Act is entitled “Administration, Collection and Enforcement” and is of significance in the present context. Section 58 provides that schedule 11 shall have effect “with respect to the administration, collection and enforcement of VAT". The functions of the Commissioners are defined in para 1 of schedule 11. Until 2005, this provided that VAT should be “under the care and management of the Commissioners". This was amplified by section 6(2) of the Customs and Excise Management 1979 (“the 1979 Act”) which charged the Commissioners with “the duty of collecting and accounting for, and otherwise managing, the revenues of customs and excise". (In 2005, section 6 of the 1979 Act was repealed by the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005 (“the 2005 Act”), and para 1 of schedule 11 was amended so that it states that the Commissioners are “responsible for the collection and management of VAT".)</p>
<p class="para">148.&nbsp;&nbsp;Paras 2 to 4 of schedule 11 concern procedures for accounting for and paying VAT. They include obligations to register for VAT and to make periodic returns, and to pay VAT, by certain dates. Para 5(1) provides that “VAT due from any person shall be recoverable as a debt due to the Crown", and it has further provisions dealing with the recovery of VAT. Paras 6 to 13 are concerned with taxpayers’ duties to keep records and the like, and the Commissioner’s powers to inspect etc.</p>
<p class="para">149.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 59(1) makes provision for a default surcharge where a taxable person fails to make a return on time or to pay tax on time. The amount is specified in subsections (4) to (6) and is calculated by reference to the amount of the outstanding VAT. By subsection (7), no surcharge is payable if the person concerned satisfies the Commissioners “or, on appeal, a tribunal” either that the return or VAT was despatched in time or that he had “a reasonable excuse". By subsection (9), any penalty under section 69 for the same default is to be credited against any section 59 liability.</p>
<p class="para">150.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 60 (1) provides: </p>
<p class="qt">“In any case where-</p>
<p class="paraleft">(a) for the purpose of evading VAT, a person does any act or omits to take any action, and (b) his conduct involves dishonesty (whether or not it is such as to give rise to criminal liability), </p>
<p class="qt">he shall be liable, subject to subsection (6) below, to a penalty equal to the amount of VAT evaded or, as the case may be, sought to be evaded, by his conduct". </p>
<p class="para">Section 60(2) gives an extended meaning to “evading VAT", so that it includes “obtaining…a VAT credit…in circumstances where the person concerned is not entitled to that sum", and section 60(3)(a) states that a “VAT credit” extends to an amount “falsely claimed by way of credit for input tax". Section 60(6) excludes the application of section 60(1) where “by reason of conduct falling within subsection (1) above, a person is convicted of an offence". </p>
<p class="para">151.&nbsp;&nbsp;(It has not been suggested that section 60(1) can be relied on by the Commissioners against a person, such as Total, who was not liable for the VAT evaded or sought to be evaded. As a matter of language, there may be an argument for saying that section 60(1) is capable of bearing such a meaning, although, apart from anything else, the way in which subsection (2) is worded may well call the argument into question. In any event, for present purposes, one must proceed on the common assumption of the parties, which I am inclined to think is right, namely that the section cannot be relied on by the Commissioners against Total.)</p>
<p class="para">152.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 61 states that, where Section 60 applies and the person concerned is a company, its directors can, in some circumstances, be liable for the penalty. Section 62 provides for a penalty where a person gives an invalid certificate in relation to zero rating, Section 63(1) provides for a penalty (in addition to the VAT recoverable) where a person’s VAT return contains a “mis-declaration” - i.e. it understates his liability for VAT or overstates his entitlement to a VAT credit in a single accounting period, in excess of an amount specified in succeeding subsections. Section 63(10) provides that such a penalty can be avoided if “there is a reasonable excuse” for the mis-declaration. Section 63 is disapplied by subsection (11) where the person concerned is penalised under section 60, or convicted, in respect of the mis-declaration.</p>
<p class="para">153.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 64(1) provides for a penalty, specified in subsection (3) for “repeated mis-declarations", and, like section 63, it is disapplied where the mis-declarations have been the subject of a section 60 penalty or a criminal conviction - see section 64(6). Section 65 to 69 also provide for specified penalties for various other defaults, including (in sections 65 and 66) failure to comply with rules relating to EC sales statements, (in section 67) failure to register for VAT or to comply with the rules relating to invoices, and (in section 69) failure to comply with various other regulatory provisions in the 1994 Act. They include exoneration provisions if the person concerned satisfies “the Commissioners or, on appeal, a tribunal that there is a reasonable excuse” for the default, and disapplication provisions if a penalty has been exacted under other sections (e.g. section 60) or there has been a criminal conviction (see for instance subsections (8) and (9) of section 69).</p>
<p class="para">154.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 70 entitles the Commissioners or, on appeal, the VAT Tribunal, to mitigate any penalty levied under sections 60, 63, 64 or 67. However the grounds set out in section 70(4) are specifically excluded from being taken into account. Those grounds include (a) “the insufficiency of…funds available", (b) “in the case in question or in that case taken with any other cases…no significant loss of VAT", and (c) the person liable for the penalty “has acted in good faith".</p>
<p class="para">155.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 72 (1) is in these terms:</p>
<p class="qt">“If any person is knowingly concerned in, or in the taking of steps with a view to, the fraudulent evasion of VAT by him or any other person, he shall be liable-</p>
<p class="paraleft">(a) on summary conviction, to a penalty of the statutory maximum or of three times the amount of the VAT, whichever is greater, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both; or </p>
<p class="paraleft">(b) on conviction on indictment, to a penalty of any amount or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years or to both.” </p>
<p class="para">Section 72 (2) gives a wide meaning to “evasion of VAT", and it includes, in para (a), “the obtaining of ... the payment of a VAT credit", and the reference to VAT credit is extended by subpara (i) to an “amount (if any) falsely claimed by way of credit for input tax". Subsections (8) and (10) of section 72 create further offences, in connection with the production of false documents, and dealings with goods and services upon which VAT was evaded; conviction of such offences can give rise to substantial fines as well as imprisonment.</p>
<p class="para">156.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 73(1) empowers the Commissioners to make assessments for VAT where a person makes no or “incomplete or inaccurate” returns or fails to maintain satisfactory records. Section 73(2) enables the Commissioners to assess a person who transpires to have wrongly received a refund of VAT or a VAT credit. Section 73(6) imposes a time limit of two years (or, if later, one year after sufficient facts come to the attention of the Commissioners) for such assessments. Section 73(7B), added in 1996, enables the Commissioners to assess a person who removed goods, on which VAT had not been paid, from certain types of warehouse. Section 74 entitles the Commissioners to interest on sums recovered under section 73, and it is normally subject to a three-year maximum. </p>
<p class="para">157.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 75(1) enables the Commissioners to assess “a person who…was not a taxable person” for VAT in cases involving the import of certain classes of goods from other member states. Subsection (2) imposes similar time limits to those in section 73(6). Section 76 enables the Commissioners to make assessments of amounts due, where a person is liable for a surcharge under section 59, for a penalty under sections 60 to 69, or for interest under section 74.</p>
<p class="para">158.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 77 provides for certain time limits within which the Commissioners have to bring claims and make assessments. The period in question is normally three years (although it is sometimes two years) in relation to assessments under sections 73 and 76, but, where the assessment is based on section 60(1), or is made in circumstances where section 67 applies, the period is twenty years. Section 80 enables overpayments of VAT to be recovered from the Commissioners by  a taxpayer, albeit usually subject to a limitation period of six years.</p>
<p class="para">159.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 77A was introduced by the Finance Act 2003, and was therefore not in force when the events in this case occurred. It applies where, at the time of a taxable supply of telecommunication goods, the taxable person to whom the supply was made “knew or had reasonable grounds to suspect” that VAT would go unpaid on that supply “or on any previous or subsequent supply of those goods". It enables the Commissioners to recover such unpaid VAT from that person notwithstanding the fact that he would not otherwise be liable. The section appears to have been specifically designed to ensure that, in the case of a carousel fraud, the Commissioners could recover any VAT not just from the person who would normally be liable, but from many of the other parties involved in transactions in the carousel. However, as my noble and learned friend Lord Mance points out, it would appear that the new section would not catch a party such as Total. </p>
<p class="para">160.&nbsp;&nbsp;Part V of the 1994 Act is concerned with “Appeals". Section 82 incorporates Schedule 12, which establishes and sets out the procedures of VAT Tribunals. Under para 9, the Lord Chancellor is empowered to make rules including provisions “(a) for limiting the time within which appeals may be brought” and for other purposes. Section 83 sets out a list of over thirty different types of matter on which an appeal lies to such a tribunal.

</i>
<p class="para">161.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have mentioned, the Commissioners have pleaded and argued their case on two alternative bases, which I have summarised in para [142] above. On the first basis, the Commissioners allege no tort other than the conspiracy involving Total, Redlaw, and Alldech (and, quite possibly, some or all of the other parties to the carousel transactions). The second basis additionally involves an allegation of deceit, most specifically on the part of Alldech when it claimed the VAT credit from the Commissioners. The way the Commissioners put this point is that, by claiming a VAT credit from the Commissioners, Alldech deceitfully, if impliedly, represented that the transactions to which it was party had a genuine economic purpose.</p>
<p class="para">162.&nbsp;&nbsp;In their written cases, the parties did not give much consideration to the viability of these two ways of putting the Commissioners’ case in the light of the provisions of the Sixth Directive. And they gave even less consideration to that aspect in their oral submissions. In view of the difficulties thrown up by the three points on which the preliminary issue was treated as focussing, and the time available for the hearing, this is scarcely surprising, and is not meant as a criticism. However, it does seem to me that this aspect requires some discussion, albeit of a limited nature, given that domestic courts should not proceed on a basis which conflicts with the provisions of the Sixth Directive.</p>
<p class="para">163.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, it is necessary to consider the decision of the European Court of Justice in <i>Optigen Ltd v Customs and Excise Commissioners </i>[2006] Ch 218.<i> </i>The effect of that decision was that the fact that a transaction was a step in a carousel fraud did not prevent an innocent party to the transaction contending that it constituted a supply and a genuine economic activity, so that it was within the ambit of the Sixth Directive and subject to the VAT regime. </p>
<p class="para">164.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the remarks of the ECJ in paras 46 and 51 (quoted by Lord Scott in para 55 of his opinion), it seems to me that the reasoning and conclusion in <i>Optigen </i>may very well only apply to traders in a carousel fraud who are innocent of any involvement in the fraud, as was assumed in relation to the traders in that case. Further, it may be difficult to reconcile the suggestion that the reasoning in <i>Optigen</i> applies to parties to the fraud with the conclusion reached by the ECJ in a case decided a month later, <i>Halifax plc v Customs and Excise Commissioners </i>[2006] Ch 387. If, as was held in that latter case, the steps in an honest but “abusive” scheme designed to avoid VAT should be “redefined” in relation to the parties to the scheme so that VAT is not avoided, it is not easy to see why each step in a dishonest and “abusive” scheme designed to evade VAT should be treated, in effect, as genuine and effective in relation to the parties to the dishonesty.</p>
<p class="para">165.&nbsp;&nbsp; In my opinion, it is therefore well arguable that each of the two ways in which the Commissioners seek to put their case against Total is consistent with the Sixth Directive. So far as the first basis is concerned, the assumption that the transactions constituting the carousel fraud in the present case are similarly effective for VAT purposes, even in relation to a party to the fraud, such as Total, may well be right (and, indeed, it appears to have been assumed by the legislature when enacting section 77A). However, that conclusion does not necessarily follow from <i>Optigen</i>, as already explained. Even if the transactions could be treated as a sham, which is the assumption made by the second basis, it seems to me that, at least as a matter of domestic law, it is open to a victim of the sham transaction to treat the transaction as genuine if he wishes to do so. The parties to a sham transaction must, I would have thought, be estopped from raising the argument that it was a sham, at the very least where, as here, the person seeking to treat the transaction as genuine has suffered loss in the belief that it was genuine. Nonetheless, it may conceivably be the case that such an estoppel argument could not be relied on under the Sixth Directive as interpreted by the ECJ. </p>
<p class="para">166.&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the second basis, it appears to me likely, at least in the absence of compelling authority to the contrary, that, if a transaction in a carousel fraud involves a party to the fraud, it should be possible to allege against him that the transaction is a sham not merely for domestic law purposes but for VAT purposes as well. A carousel transaction is not so much one of a pre-ordained set of transactions: it is, in reality, not a transaction at all. It is merely a chimera which is used as an excuse or a front to justify the creation of one of several purported invoices, which are brought into existence by the parties to the fraud to obtain money dishonestly from the Commissioners. However, whether that argument is correct in the light of the Sixth Directive is not entirely clear, in the light of the reasoning in <i>Optigen </i>(and see especially the reasoning of the Advocate-General at para 28 of his opinion).</p>
<p class="para">167.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reasons I have given, at least on the basis of the arguments that have been put before your Lordships’ House, I would not regard it as clear that both the ways in which the Commissioners put their case would withstand scrutiny under Community law. However, it may very well be that they both would withstand such scrutiny, and, as at present advised, I think that at least one of them must do so. I do not regard it as necessary to consider the question further, at least at this stage. Your Lordships are only concerned with a preliminary point, which throws up the three issues identified above, and, in view of the analysis just undertaken, I am prepared to proceed for that purpose on the basis that each of the two ways in which the Commissioners put their case is strongly arguable as a matter of Community law.</p>
