<p class="para">68.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, a type of case that straddles Lord Hope’s (a) and (b). Traditional features of judicial review challenges to decisions taken by public authorities are that they must be brought in the High Court, that they cannot be brought unless permission to bring them is first obtained and that that permission is not usually given where the challenge raises and depends upon disputed issues of fact.  I am not clear whether permission is invariably, or merely usually, refused in these disputed fact cases.  Nor am I clear why normal judicial review procedure should not be adjusted so as to enable issues of fact to be judicially resolved where such resolution is necessary in order to enable the challenge to the decision in question to be fairly disposed of.  But it does appear to be the case that permission to bring judicial review proceedings is sometimes, or perhaps usually, refused where the challenge, if it is to succeed, has to dispute facts on which the local authority relies in justification of its decision.  A good example is <i>Connors</i>.  The <i>Connors </i>family had for some seventeen years occupied a plot on a local authority gypsy site under a licence which allowed them to do so provided they did not cause a “nuisance".  The licence was terminable on notice and notice was given by the local authority.  Under the ordinary domestic law, the Connors became trespassers on the site.  In the ensuing possession proceedings the local authority justified their decision to serve the notice by asserting that members of the Connors family, in breach of the licence conditions, had been making a nuisance of themselves.  The applicant disputed the nuisance allegations and applied for judicial review of the Council’s decision to terminate his licence.  But permission for a judicial review was refused and the Council, in the possession proceedings, did not attempt to prove the truth of its nuisance allegations but simply asserted a right to possession on the ground that the notice to quit having expired the Connors family had become trespassers.  The Strasbourg court, as I have already said, did not accept that this procedure sufficed to satisfy the requirements of article 8.2.  The procedural deficiencies relating to judicial review which had prevented the applicant’s challenge to the facts, on which the local authority had relied in deciding to serve the notice to quit, from being judicially determined could be regarded as constituting deficiencies in the law, thus bringing the case within Lord Hope’s gateway (a).  But the perceived procedural deficiencies are surely curable by a simple procedural adjustment enabling a challenge to the public authority’s decision to terminate the occupier’s tenancy or licence to be part of the occupier’s defence to the possession claim (i.e. gateway (b) and see <i>Winder</i>), thus enabling any factual disputes that needed to be resolved to be dealt with in the ordinary way in the course of the proceedings.  One way or another it must be open to a person in the position of the site occupier in <i>Connors</i>, or, for that matter, the site occupiers in the present case, to challenge the lawfulness of the decision of the local authority owner to recover possession of the property, whether on conventional public law grounds or by challenge to the factual allegations (if any) made against them by the local authority, and to do so by way of defence in the possession proceedings.  The respect for the “home” to which each home occupier is entitled under article 8 requires that that be so and paragraph 110 of Lord Hope’s opinion in <i>Kay </i>and <i>Price </i>recognises that that is so.  It would, of course, be for the court in each case to decide whether the defence put forward, i.e. the challenge to the local authority’s decision, was seriously arguable and, if it was not, to deal with the case summarily.</p>
<p class="para">69.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is worth noticing that gateway (b) and a challenge to the lawfulness of the decision by the property owner to recover possession of the property from its “home” occupier, is of no relevance whatever to possession proceedings brought not by public authority owners but by private owners.  If private owners are entitled to recover possession of their property under the ordinary domestic law, whether common law, statute or a combination, their reasons for deciding to recover possession are irrelevant.  Private owners are entitled to take decisions about their own property to suit themselves unless and to the extent that statute has fettered that entitlement.  Their property rights are recognised and protected by the Convention (see article 1 of the 1st Protocol to the Convention).  Trespassers who have established a “home” on the property of a private owner are entitled to no more respect for their home from the owner on whose land they are trespassing than the law prohibiting forcible entry or eviction without a court order affords.  Home occupiers whose contractual and statutory rights to remain on the property have come to an end are in no different state.  Such balance as is required to be struck between the rights of home occupiers and the rights of the private owners of the properties on which the homes have been established has been struck by the domestic law and, unless a gateway (a) attack on the domestic law can be sustained, e.g. an attack based on discrimination as in <i>Connors</i>, article 8.2 has no further part to play.  <i>Qazi </i>established that that was so and its authority in that respect remains unaltered.  But public authorities, and in particular local authorities, are in a different position.  Their decision making powers are subject to the constraints of <i>Wednesbury </i>reasonableness, and they must not act in a way that is incompatible with Convention rights (section 6 of the 1998 Act).  But those public law constraints strike, in my opinion, the balance that article 8.2 requires (see the penultimate sentence of Lord Hope’s para.110).</p>
<p class="para">70.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in considering the effect and implications of Lord Hope’s paragraph 110 in <i>Kay </i>and <i>Price</i>, it is worth pointing out how narrow was the area of disagreement between the views of the four in the majority and those of the three in the minority.  In paragraph 39 Lord Bingham of Cornhill, with whose opinion Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead and Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe agreed, summarised his view of the position with six propositions</p>
<p class="qt">“The practical position, in future, in possession proceedings can be briefly summarised as follows.  (1)  It is not necessary for a local authority to plead or prove in every case that domestic law complies with article 8.  Courts should proceed on the assumption that domestic law strikes a fair balance and is compatible with article 8.  (2)  If the court, following its usual procedures, is satisfied that the domestic law requirements for making a possession order have been met the court should make a possession order unless the occupier shows that, highly exceptionally, he has a seriously arguable case on one of two grounds.  (3)  The two grounds are: (a) that the law which requires the court to make a possession order despite the occupier’s personal circumstances is Convention-incompatible; and (b) that, having regard to the occupier’s personal circumstances, the local authority’s exercise of its power to seek a possession order is an unlawful act within the meaning of section 6.  (4)  Deciding whether the defendant has a seriously arguable case on one or both of these grounds will not call for a full-blown trial.  This question should be decided summarily, on the basis of an affidavit or of the defendant’s defence, suitably particularised, or in whatever other summary way the court considers appropriate.  The procedural aim of the court must be to decide this question as expeditiously as is consistent with the defendant having a fair opportunity to present his case on this question.  (5)  If the court considers the defence sought to be raised on one or both of these grounds is not seriously arguable the court should proceed to make a possession order.  (6)  Where a seriously arguable issue on one of these grounds is raised, the court should itself decide this issue, subject to this: where an issue arises on the application of section 3 the judge should consider whether it may be appropriate to refer the proceedings to the High Court.” </p>
<p class="paraleft">The only proposition which is in any respect inconsistent with the majority opinions is proposition 3(b) and the inconsistency there is slight though important.  Proposition 3(a) covers the same ground as Lord Hope’s paragraph 110 gateway (a).  But proposition 3(b) attributes to the occupier’s personal circumstances a central importance that the majority opinions did not accept.  The view of the majority, as expressed by Lord Hope in his gateway (b), was, as I have explained, that a local authority’s decision to recover possession would be open to challenge on public law grounds and that the challenge could be raised as a defence in the possession proceedings.  The personal circumstances of the defendant might well be a factor to which, along with the other factors relevant to its decision, a responsible and reasonable local authority would need to have regard.  The question for the court would be whether the local authority’s decision to recover possession of the property in question was so unreasonable and disproportionate as to be unlawful. </p>
<i><p class="paraleft">The application of gateways (a) and (b) in the present case</p></i>
<p class="para">71.&nbsp;&nbsp;Much of the difficulty of the present case has, in my opinion, been produced by the fact that at the time when the defence of the appellant and the other defendants to the respondent Council’s possession claim was pleaded (22 June 2004), at the time when the issue as to whether the defendants had a “reasonable prospect of successfully defending the claim” (see the order made by District Judge Savage on 24 June 2004) was heard by H.H.Judge McKenna (21 October 2004)  and at the time when the judge delivered his reserved judgment (20 December 2004), the <i>Kay </i>and <i>Price </i>appeals had not yet come before the House.  Neither counsel who had settled the Defence nor counsel who had appeared before the judge nor the judge himself had had the advantage of their Lordships’ opinions in <i>Kay </i>and <i>Price </i>and, in particular, of Lord Hope’s paragraph 110.  It should not be a surprise, therefore, that the pleaded defence did not in terms challenge the Council’s decision to serve the Notice to Quit but simply opposed the making of an order of possession.</p>
<p class="para">72.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a case where, as in <i>Connors</i>, the Council’s decision to serve the Notice to Quit in order to terminate the right of the Doherty family to remain on the caravan site had been taken on account of allegations of misbehaviour on their part.  Paragraph 4(d) of the Council’s Particulars of Claim For Possession had set out the Council’s reasons for seeking possession of the caravan site including, of course, the defendants’ plots.  The pleaded reasons, in short, were that the Council intended to redevelop the site so as to provide sanitation and other facilities, so as to reduce fire risks, and in order to re-wire electricity supplies to the caravan plots, and, after the re-development, to manage the site “as a temporary accommodation for travellers” coming into Birmingham.  The only reference in the pleaded reasons to the Doherty family is a pleading that the proposed re-development</p>
<p class="qt">“… will protect Public Health and Safety and make the site available for genuine travellers, who are currently deterred from going on the site because of the presence of the Defendants, as a result of which the site is severely under utilised and this causes unauthorised encampments in the city” (see para.4(iv))</p>
<p class="paraleft">It is possible that this passage was intended as an implicit allegation of anti-social behaviour or misconduct on the part of members of the Doherty family but I would not, speaking for myself, so read it.  It is a well known rule of pleading that if the pleader is intending to allege misconduct the allegation should be made expressly and not be left simply as a possible inference.  Be that as it may, the defendants in their Defence denied being guilty of any anti-social behaviour or of causing damage to the site (para.9 (iii)(c) and (d)).  If the Council did intend to allege the contrary, there is an unresolved issue as to the truth of the allegation.</p>
<p class="para">73.&nbsp;&nbsp;The defendants’ main ground of defence, as pleaded, was that the making of a possession order against them would be neither reasonable nor proportionate (paras.8 and 9).  Para.9, in a number of sub-paragraphs, amplified this contention.  Thus, the need for the Council to obtain vacant possession of the whole site in order to enable the proposed improvement works to be carried out was challenged; the reasonableness of the Council’s proposal to transform the whole site into a temporary stopping place for travellers was challenged; the personal difficulties that the Council’s proposals would produce for the Doherty family were prayed in aid.  All of these were matters which might have been pleaded as the grounds of a public law challenge to the lawfulness of the Council’s decision to serve the Notice to Quit and although the defendants’ Defence does not in terms challenge the lawfulness of that decision, the thrust of the pleading is to that effect.  And a challenge of that character as a defence to a local authority’s possession claim is franked by Lord Hope’s paragraph 110 gateway (b).</p>
<p class="para">74.&nbsp;&nbsp;Judge McKenna was aware that a public law challenge to the Council’s decision to seek possession could have been mounted by the defendants (see para.38 of his judgment); he observed, in para.43, that “judicial review would be able to check the fairness and legality of the decision".  But he was not aware that that challenge could be raised as a defence in the possession proceedings, made no ruling as to whether those matters pleaded in the defence that could be read as constituting the defendants’ grounds for challenging the decision provided any real prospects of success and simply ordered a stay of execution of the order of possession for 14 days to enable the defendants, if so advised, to apply for judicial review.  The defendants did not so apply but instead, pursued the route of appealing against the possession order.</p>
<p class="para">75.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the case reached the Court of Appeal in November 2006, the House’s decision in <i>Kay </i>and <i>Price </i>had been reported and the procedural propriety of a challenge to the lawfulness of the Council’s decision to serve the Notice to Quit being put forward as a defence in the possession proceedings had been put beyond doubt.  So the Court of Appeal examined the issue whether the matters pleaded in the Defence would enable that challenge to have any prospects of success.  The Court’s conclusion is to be found in paragraph 61 of the judgment of the Court delivered by Carnwath LJ:</p>
<p class="qt">“61. …..In our view this case is distinguishable from <i>Connors </i>because the authority’s decision depended, not on a factual allegation of nuisance or misconduct, or ‘the bald ground that the family were trespassers’ (in Lord Brown’s words), but on an administrative judgment about the appropriate use of its land in the public interest.  It is true that one aspect was an issue about whether the Doherty’s [sic] presence ‘deterred’ others.  However, this was not in the context, as in <i>Connors</i>, of an allegation of breach of a licence condition (analogous to a private law cause of action), but simply one part of its overall assessment of the various factors in play.  That seems to us well within the margin of appreciation allowed by the Strasbourg jurisprudence in the exercise of an administrative discretion … Under gateway (b) the council’s action was open to challenge on conventional judicial review grounds, but not on the grounds that it was contrary to Article 8.  We recognise that the judge did not rule out the possibility of a successful judicial review challenge, and that he was wrong in any event to hold that such a defence could not be taken in the county court.  However, we see no purpose in remitting the matter for him to redetermine that issue.  On the pleadings, we can see no arguable basis for asserting that the decision could have been successfully challenged under gateway (a).  Accordingly, the appeal must fail.”</p>
<p class="para">76.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two criticisms I would respectfully make of the passage cited above.  First, the sentence “Under gateway (b) the council’s action was open to challenge on conventional judicial review grounds, but not on the grounds that it was contrary to Article 8” suggests a disharmony between “conventional judicial review grounds” on the one hand and Article 8 on the other hand that I do not accept.  The Council as the owner of the caravan site has the power and the duty to manage the site in the interests of the public.  In deciding whether or not to redevelop the site and, if the decision is to redevelop, in deciding what steps need to be taken to implement that decision, the Council must take into account and balance a number of conflicting interests.  The interests of the Doherty family, and of any other long term occupants of plots on the site, would need to have been taken into account, but there would have been other interests and imperatives as well to which the Council, acting reasonably and responsibly, would have had to have regard.  “Conventional judicial review grounds” on which the Council’s decisions regarding the redevelopment might be challenged would include the paying of insufficient regard or attributing insufficient weight to the interests of the Doherty family.  But the court, bearing in mind the multiplicity of interests and considerations to which a responsible local authority would need to have regard, would not conclude that the Council’s decision to serve the Notice to Quit had been unlawful unless the court considered that the decision was one to which the Council could not reasonably have come.  If the court did not so conclude, the public law challenge to the Council’s decision would, therefore, fail.  If that were so, the requirements of Article 8.2 would, in my opinion, have been satisfied.  The recovery of possession by the Council would have been shown to be, for Article 8.2 purposes, necessary and proportionate. </p>
<p class="para">77.&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Carnwath LJ’s reference in the penultimate sentence of the cited passage to “gateway (a)” ought, I think, to have been a reference to “gateway (b)".  If it was intended to be a reference to gateway (b), and to a challenge by the appellant to the lawfulness of the Council’s decision to seek possession of his and his family’s plots, it is regrettable that the Court of Appeal did not give any reasons for their conclusion that the challenge was, on the pleadings, unarguable.  As I have explained Judge McKenna had not attempted to deal with this challenge and it is not clear what, if any, relevant evidence, other than the pleadings themselves with their requisite Statements of Truth, were before the Court of Appeal.  None is referred to in the judgment.  It may be that the challenge is, as the Court of Appeal concluded, unarguable but that that is so cannot, in my opinion, simply be assumed from the pleadings.  I would, on this point, in agreement with Lord Hope (see the second sentence of his para.56), remit the case to the High Court for the issue whether for CPR Part 24 purposes a public law challenge to the Council’s decision has any prospects of success to be re-considered.</p>
<p class="para">78.&nbsp;&nbsp;As to Lord Hope’s gateway (a), this is not a case where the respondent Council’s reasons for terminating the licence depended to any significant extent, if at all, on allegations of fact that were in dispute.  This was not in that respect a <i>Connors </i>case.  It was, however, a case in which the discrimination point present in <i>Connors </i>was present.  If the site had been a privately owned site and the owners had desired to obtain possession of the site, they would have come up against the security of tenure given by the Mobile Homes Act 1983 to residents on privately owned sites.  But this security of tenure had been deliberately withheld by Parliament from residents on local authority owned sites, and the United Kingdom’s attempted justification of that state of the law had not been accepted by the Strasbourg court in <i>Connors</i>.</p>
<p class="para">79.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Luba submitted that in these circumstances the court dealing with the possession claim should mould the common law so as to provide the Doherty family with, in effect, the security of tenure withheld from them by Parliament.  I am unable to agree with that submission for all the reasons give by my noble and learned friend Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe whose opinion I have had the advantage of reading in draft.  The moulding of the common law suggested by Mr Luba would constitute the judicial amendment of an Act of Parliament so as to include a provision which had been deliberately omitted by Parliament.  To do such a thing would be inconsistent with the sovereignty of Parliament and inconsistent also with section 6(2) of the 1998 Act.</p>
<p class="para">80.&nbsp;&nbsp;The question has arisen whether, in these circumstances, a declaration of incompatibility should be made.  My Lords,  I understand that this question has now, with the enactment of the Housing and Regneration Act 2008, become moot but, in any event, the case for a declaration of incompatibility had not, in my opinion, been made out. First, I do not accept that the domestic law, as explained in <i>Kay </i>and <i>Price</i>, had any incompatibility with article 8 Convention rights.  The Strasbourg court’s conclusion in <i>Connors </i>that the domestic law provided insufficient protection for those in the position of the <i>Connors </i>family was, having regard to what had happened in the domestic courts, understandable but was in my respectful opinion, at least since the <i>Kay </i>and <i>Price </i>decision in this House, mistaken.  First, the domestic courts in <i>Connors </i>had failed to provide a procedural opportunity for a judicial examination and resolution of the facts in dispute between the parties (see para.92 of the court’s judgment).  This opportunity could have been and ought to have been provided (see <i>Kay </i>and <i>Price</i>).  Second, a public law challenge to the lawfulness of the local authority’s decision to terminate the licences under which the Connors family occupied their plots could have been and ought to have been relied on as a defence to the possession claim (again, see <i>Kay </i>and <i>Price</i>).  In both these respects the procedural deficiencies identified by the Strasbourg court in <i>Connors </i>did not form part of the domestic legal framework properly understood and as explained in <i>Kay </i>and <i>Price </i>and<i> </i>are not to be found in the present case.  Third, the security of tenure given by the 1983 Act to occupiers of plots on privately owned caravan sites but denied to occupiers of plots on local authority owned sites is balanced by the ability of an occupier of a plot on a local authority owned site to challenge on public law grounds the lawfulness of a decision by the local authority owner to terminate the occupier’s licence, an ability that the domestic law does not afford to occupiers of plots on privately owned sites.  The legal frameworks applicable to privately owned caravan sites and publicly owned caravan sites respectively were different from one another, but it is difficult to say which provided the more satisfactory degree of protection to the plot occupiers.  Be that as it may, I find it impossible to stigmatise either framework as having been incompatible with article 8.  In my opinion, each framework provided protection to licensed plot occupiers that required regard to be had to their personal circumstances and represented a balance struck by the domestic law that is well within the margin of appreciation that must be afforded to signatory States.</p>
<p class="para">81.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the making of a declaration of incompatibility is discretionary and the main purpose of doing so is surely to draw the attention of Parliament and the government to the existence of an inconsistency between domestic law and the law necessary to enable effect to be given to the Convention right or rights in question.  But the government was, and had been since the <i>Connors </i>decision, aware of the security of tenure point and an amending Bill was already before Parliament (see para 30 of Lord Hope’s opinion on this appeal).  It seems to me therefore that, whether I am right or wrong in the view expressed in the last preceding paragraph, a declaration of incompatibility was unnecessary and would have served no useful purpose.  In my opinion, gateway (a) does not in this case lead to any defence of which the appellants can avail themselves.  However, for the reasons I have given and in broad agreement with the opinions of my noble and learned friends Lord Hope of Craighead and Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe I would allow this appeal and remit the case to the High Court.</p>
<i><p class="mylords">Addendum</p></i>
<p class="para">82.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since preparing this opinion I, and the other members of the Appellate Committee, have been supplied with a copy of the judgment of the Fourth Section of the European Court of Human Rights in <i>McCann v The United Kingdom </i>delivered on 13 May 2008 and, also, with written submissions from the respective parties to the present appeal on the effect of the <i>McCann </i>judgment on the issues arising in the appeal.  Mr Luba QC, in reliance on the <i>McCann </i>judgment, has renewed the submission, made in his original printed Case, that the House’s decision in <i>Kay </i>and <i>Price </i>regarding article 8 as a defence to possession proceedings should be reconsidered (see para.60 above).  He, and Mr Sales QC for the Secretary of State, have now, in reliance on the <i>McCann </i>judgment, invited your Lordships to approve the approach to article 8 of the three members of the Appellate Committee in <i>Kay </i>and <i>Price </i>who constituted the minority.  My Lords, I am not prepared to accept that invitation.  Leaving aside the oddity of a committee of five assuming to set aside the majority opinion of a committee of seven (see para.61 above), I am not prepared to do so because I consider the <i>McCann </i>judgment to be based on a mistaken understanding of the procedure in this country whereby proceedings brought by a local authority owner of residential property for the purpose of recovery of possession of the property from a defendant who has, or had had, his home on the property can be defended by reliance on article 8.  I consider, also, that the <i>McCann </i>judgment discloses a misunderstanding of the various factors that would have been taken into account by the domestic court that dealt with the possession application in concluding that the defendant, Mr McCann, had no arguable article 8 defence.  It is, perhaps, unfortunate that the Fourth Section did not receive any oral submissions or argument from the parties but dealt with the case with the assistance only of written submissions.  The essential facts of the <i>McCann </i>case are set out in paragraphs 15 and 16 of the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Hope of Craighead and I gratefully adopt his recital.</p>
