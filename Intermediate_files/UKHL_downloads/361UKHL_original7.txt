<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;166. In deciding that holding a trial would not have involved any violation of the defendant's article 6(1) rights, the Court of Appeal attached importance to the fact that the reasonable time guarantee in article 6(1) applies to civil as well as to criminal proceedings:  <i>Attorney General's Reference (No 2 of 2001) </i>[2001] 1 WLR 1869, 1875, para 19.  Lord Bingham has noted, in paragraph 21 of his speech, that the Court of Appeal were right to recognise that a rule of automatic termination of proceedings on breach of the reasonable time requirement cannot sensibly be applied in civil proceedings.  I agree.  Where the Court of Appeal were in error, however, was in ever supposing that under the Convention a breach of article 6(1) would have triggered an automatic termination of such civil proceedings.  It should scarcely be necessary to repeat that the Convention contains no rule requiring the proceedings to be stopped where article 6(1) is violated.  All it requires is for the national authorities to provide an effective remedy for the violation - perhaps, for example, by awarding damages for the delay in holding the hearing.  The supposed illogicality and nonsense to which the Court of Appeal referred are not to be found in the Convention.  The argument resting on them is accordingly unsound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;167. So far as criminal proceedings are concerned, Lord Steyn put his finger on the point in <i>HM Advocate v R </i>[2003] 2 WLR 317, 322H, para 14 when he said that Hardie Boys J's comment in <i>Martin v Tauranga District Court </i>[1995] 2 NZLR 419, 432 neatly exposed "[t]he fallacy in the proposition that a breach of the reasonable time guarantee <i>automatically </i>triggers a right not to be prosecuted" (emphasis added).  In the words of Lord Bingham, at paragraph 24 of his speech in the present case, in Convention terms, for such a breach the courts must simply afford such remedy as may be "effective, just and proportionate".  I respectfully agree with those views as to what the Convention requires.  Moreover, I regard them as fundamental to any consideration of the scheme of remedies which the 1998 Act introduced into the domestic law of the United Kingdom.</p>
<p><i>Remedies for violations of the Convention under the 1998 Act</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;168. Section 57(2) of the Scotland Act 1998 provides that a member of the Scottish Executive:</p>
<p></p><ul>"has no power … to do any … act, so far as the … act is incompatible with any of the Convention rights or with Community law."</ul><p></p>
<p>The Lord Advocate is a member of the Scottish Executive.  He is also the head of the prosecution system in Scotland and prosecutions for serious crimes run in his name.  So, in <i>HM Advocate v R</i> [2003] 2 WLR 317 the accused argued that, since the trial of certain of the charges against him could not take place within a reasonable time due to a failure on the part of the prosecution, the Lord Advocate "had no power" to continue with the prosecution on those charges.  By a majority, the Privy Council held that continuing with the prosecution would indeed involve a violation of the reasonable time guarantee.  In those circumstances, they upheld the defence submission that by virtue of section 57(2) of the Scotland Act it was ultra vires for the Lord Advocate to continue with the prosecution on the charges in question and they accordingly dismissed them.  For better or for worse, there was no room for any other remedy, given the terms of section 57(2) of the Scotland Act.  No issue arose under section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act and the majority were therefore careful to base their decision squarely on section 57(2) of the Scotland Act and not to express any view on what the position would have been under the (different) terms of section 6(1) of the 1998 Act.  That is, of course, the question which your Lordships' House has to confront in this case.  Your Lordships can do so, however, without having to look back to what the majority in <i>HM Advocate v R </i>said about matters of remedy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;169. Section 6(1) of the 1998 Act provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right."</ul><p></p>
<p>If going on with a prosecution and holding a trial would violate, ie, be incompatible with, the Convention, then section 6(1) makes them unlawful.  That much is clear.  Although this is not spelled out in Lord Bingham's speech, he proceeds on the basis that, if these actings were indeed unlawful, then a court would have no option but to stay the proceedings since it could not itself do, nor could it permit the prosecutor to do, anything that was unlawful.  Lord Hobhouse makes the point explicitly in paragraphs 122-124.  This is "the direful spring of woes unnumbered":  to avoid that conclusion the majority are forced to adopt an interpretation of article 6(1) which allows them to say that going on with the prosecution and holding a trial do not involve any violation of article 6(1).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;170. I acknowledge the force of the majority's view as to the interpretation and application of section 6(1).  After all, it is the business of courts to act lawfully themselves and, where appropriate, to stop others from acting unlawfully.  Applying that straightforward approach but adopting my view of the breach of article 6(1), one would then simply hold that, since any trial would be unlawful, none could be held after the expiry of an unreasonable time.  That would certainly encourage the relevant authorities to comply with the article 6(1) guarantee.  Moreover, it should cause few problems in practice if - as is surely to be expected - the authorities do normally comply.  Nor would it be unprecedented for Parliament to provide such a spur.  In section 65(4)(b) of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 Parliament enacted that failure to meet the statutory time-limits would result in the accused being "for ever free from all question or process for that offence".  The majority's interpretation and application of section 6(1) of the 1998 Act would therefore produce a result of a kind that would be quite familiar to judges and practitioners in Scotland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;171. I am not satisfied, however, that section 6(1) should be interpreted in this way.  It is not designed to deal specifically with breaches of article 6(1) but is of general application.  It therefore requires to be considered in the context of the overall scheme of the 1998 Act.  In that scheme, making acts of public authorities that are incompatible with the Convention unlawful is not an end in itself.  They are made unlawful so that the courts should be able to provide victims of Convention violations with a just and appropriate remedy.  Section 6(1) is there to act as the key to unlock these remedies.  This can be seen both from the pre-legislative material and from the terms of the 1998 Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;172. In the White Paper "Rights Brought Home:  The Human Rights Bill" (1997) (Cm 3782) the Government set out proposals for the legislation which eventually passed into law as the 1998 Act.  The relevant aspects of the Act do not differ significantly from those of the original Bill that followed the White Paper.  In paragraph 1.18 the Government expressed the view that the time had come "to enable people to enforce their Convention rights against the State in the British courts".  In other words people were going to be given remedies in our domestic courts for the breach of their Convention rights.  The Government went on to say, in paragraph 2.6:</p>
<p></p><ul>"A public authority which is found to have acted unlawfully by failing to comply with the Convention will not be exposed to criminal penalties.  But the court or tribunal will be able to grant the injured person any remedy which is within its normal powers to grant and which it considers appropriate and just in the circumstances.  What remedy is appropriate will of course depend both on the facts of the case and on a proper balance between the rights of the individual and the public interest.  In some cases, the right course may be for the decision of the public authority in the particular case to be quashed.  In other cases, the only appropriate remedy may be an award of damages."</ul><p></p>
<p>This passage contains a number of signposts.  First, it confirms that, when commending the Bill to Parliament, the Government's intention was that, if a public authority acted unlawfully in terms of section 6(1), the court or tribunal should be able to grant the injured person any remedy which was within its normal powers and which it considered appropriate and just in the circumstances.  Secondly, what was appropriate by way of remedy was to depend on the facts of the case and on a proper balance between the rights of the individual and the public interest.  Therefore, finally, even though an act of a public authority that was incompatible with the Convention would always be unlawful, this did not mean that it would always have to be quashed.  In some cases the appropriate remedy would be an award of damages and nothing more.  In short, the Bill was to mirror the Convention and, as a general rule, it would not prescribe any specific remedy for a violation.  Like the Convention, the Bill would leave it to the courts to choose the appropriate remedy in the circumstances.  Moreover, nothing suggests that, exceptionally, the Government envisaged that the courts would always have to grant a stay or equivalent administrative law remedy to prevent a future act in violation of the Convention, even though the courts would not have had to quash the self-same act if it had once occurred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;173. According to the long title, the 1998 Act was enacted "to give further effect to rights and freedoms guaranteed under the European Convention on Human Rights".  Section 1(2) provides that the articles set out in Schedule 1 to the Act are to have effect "for the purposes of this Act" subject to any designated derogation or reservation.  These provisions indicate that Parliament's intention was that the measures in the Act were to give (further) effect to the rights and freedoms guaranteed under the Convention.  As the White Paper had foreshadowed, these rights were to have effect in a way that had not previously been possible in our domestic law, viz the national courts were to have power to grant victims remedies in terms of the Act for violations of their rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;174. Parliament achieved this by first making it unlawful, under section 6(1), for public authorities to act incompatibly with the Convention rights and by then providing in section 8(1):</p>
<p></p><ul>"In relation to any act (or proposed act) of a public authority which the court finds is (or would be) unlawful, it may grant such relief or remedy, or make such order, within its powers as it considers just and appropriate."</ul><p></p>
<p>Section 6(1) makes acts which are incompatible with the Convention unlawful simply so that the courts can grant a remedy in terms of section 8(1).  In other words, taken together, these provisions make up the mechanism by which our courts are to grant remedies for breaches of people's Convention rights.  Indeed, as I emphasised in <i>HM Advocate v R </i>[2003] 2 WLR 317, 365C - D, para 142, unless an act or proposed act is incompatible and hence unlawful, no remedy is available under the Act.  The very particular, Convention, focus of this unlawfulness created by section 6(1) is shown by the fact that no-one can bring proceedings for judicial review of a public authority's unlawful act unless he is, or would be, a victim of that act for the purposes of article 34 of the Convention in proceedings before the European Court:  section 7(3) and (7).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;175. Section 8(1) confers on the courts a discretionary power to grant a remedy.  In this respect the court is in the same position as a court entertaining an application for judicial review.  Furthermore, the court's power is to grant the relief or remedy that it considers just and appropriate in the circumstances.  Since the aim of the Act is that the domestic courts, rather than the Strasbourg court, should be able to remedy violations of the Convention, it can readily be inferred that a remedy will be just and appropriate if it constitutes the kind of effective remedy required by article 13 of the Convention.  That inference is confirmed by other provisions of the Act.  In section 8(3) Parliament is careful to say that no award of damages is to be made unless, taking certain matters into account, the court is satisfied that the award is necessary "to afford just satisfaction to the person in whose favour it is made".  This language is a deliberate echo of the wording of article 41 of the Convention, empowering the European Court, where necessary, to "afford just satisfaction to the injured party."  Moreover, in section 8(4) Parliament further directs that, in determining whether to award damages and, if so, for how much, the court must take into account the principles applied by the European Court in fixing compensation under article 41.  These provisions indicate that the courts are meant to mould their remedies for unlawful acts to fit in with the requirements of the Convention.  By contrast, there is nothing to suggest that Parliament ever intended that under the 1998 Act the British courts should be obliged to grant a specific remedy for a particular kind of violation where that remedy was not specified by the Convention or where that remedy would not be just and appropriate in the circumstances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;176. Thus interpreted, the scheme of the 1998 Act allows our domestic courts to give full and faithful effect to the Convention rights.  In effect they enjoy the same wide powers to choose the appropriate remedy for any violation as the South African courts enjoyed under section 7(4)(a) of the interim Constitution of the Republic of South Africa:  <i>Sanderson v Attorney General, Eastern Cape </i>1997 (12) BCLR 1675, 1691-1693, paras 38-42, per Kriegler J;  <i>Wild v Hoffert NO </i>1998 (3) SA 695, 708-711, paras 26-7, per Kriegler J.  On that approach the supposed problems which Lord Bingham envisages (in paragraphs 20-22) as resulting from an automatic stay simply do not arise.  By contrast, on their interpretation, the majority assume that, by making future violations of article 6(1) unlawful, Parliament intended that our courts should not have power to choose the appropriate remedy for such violations.  They were always to grant a stay in such cases, even though there is nothing in the Convention or in the jurisprudence of the European Court to require this and even though it would be unjust and inappropriate for the court to grant the stay.  Neither the mischief prompting the 1998 Act, nor its legislative history, nor its wording, nor any comparative material suggests, far less compels, that perverse conclusion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;177. I would therefore hold that, when a court is faced with a situation where going on with a prosecution and holding a trial would lead to a hearing after the lapse of a reasonable time, it should not hesitate to say that these steps would violate article 6(1) and, hence, would be unlawful in terms of section 6(1) of the 1998 Act.  Then, in terms of section 8(1), the court should go on to consider what relief or remedy would be "just and appropriate" for this unlawful act of violating the reasonable time guarantee.  For the reasons given by Lord Bingham, in most cases the court would conclude that a declaration or a reduction in sentence or an award of damages, as the case might be, would be the just and appropriate remedy for this unlawful act.  Unless the court had assessed the position incorrectly, that remedy would also constitute an effective remedy for the violation of article 6(1) in terms of article 13 and, by granting it, the court would fulfil the United Kingdom's international obligation under the Convention.  In these circumstances nothing in the Convention or elsewhere compels the court to go further and grant a stay.  Indeed it would be contrary to section 8(1) for the court to grant a stay where a stay would not be the just and appropriate remedy.  And, as Lord Bingham suggests, it will only be in rare cases that the just and appropriate remedy for an unreasonable delay will be a stay.  Only in those rare cases need, or indeed should, the court grant such a stay under section 8(1).  In other cases the trial can proceed and the defendant will get the appropriate remedy at the proper time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;178. For these reasons I would respectfully dissent from the majority's interpretation and application of both article 6(1) of the Convention and section 6(1) of the 1998 Act.  Despite this, on the basis that I have set out, I agree with what Lord Bingham says in paragraph 24 of his speech about the approach that courts should adopt when a trial cannot be held within a reasonable time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;179. Having set out my reasons for taking a different view, I acknowledge, of course, that the view of the majority of your Lordships now settles the question in the law of England and Wales.  As is obvious, the reasoning behind that decision is inconsistent with the reasoning of the majority on the equivalent point in <i> HM Advocate v R</i> [2003] 2 WLR 317.<i>  </i>While that is unfortunate, it causes no problems for the courts in England and Wales.  In Scotland the decision has no formal effect on the position in criminal cases but its impact will undoubtedly be felt there.  If the point is reopened before the Scottish courts in the context of a devolution issue, the Privy Council will doubtless be called upon to determine it.  At this stage I do not consider that it would be helpful to say more.</p>
