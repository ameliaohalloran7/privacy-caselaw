<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109. I must respectfully dissent from the view of the majority that criminal proceedings may be stayed on the ground that there has been such a violation only (a) if a fair hearing is no longer possible or (b) if it is for any compelling reason unfair to try the defendant.  The holding of a trial in such circumstances would, of course, be incompatible with the article 6(1) guarantee that in the determination of any criminal charge against him everyone is entitled to a hearing that is fair.  I agree that, if those are the circumstances, the proceedings should be stayed.  But I consider that the situation which is described in branch (a) of that finding refers to a different situation from that which we have been asked to consider in this case, which relates to the guarantee that the determination of the criminal charge will take place within a reasonable time.  In my opinion that is a separate and independent guarantee which does not require the victim to show that a fair hearing is no longer possible.  Branch (b) is open to the same criticism.  It uses language which suggests that the test which has to be applied is whether a trial would be unfair.  It concentrates, as does branch (a), on a breach of the fair trial guarantee as the test of whether or not a stay should be ordered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110. I would answer the first point of law referred by the Attorney General in the affirmative.  In my opinion criminal proceedings may be stayed on the ground that there has been a violation of the reasonable time requirement in article 6(1) of the Convention in circumstances where the accused cannot demonstrate that he will suffer any prejudice arising from the delay at his trial.  It is arguable that a stay of the proceedings is the ordinary and appropriate remedy where this guarantee has been breached.  That is the position which the Court of Appeal in New Zealand has adopted, it is consistent with what the Judicial Committee has held to be right for Mauritius and it is the position which has been adopted also by the High Court of Justiciary.  But, as it is open to the court under section 8(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998 to make such order within its powers as it considers just and appropriate, I would not go so far as to say that it was the inevitable remedy.  I would hold that the proceedings may be stayed if, in all the circumstances, the court considers this to be the appropriate remedy.</p>
<p><b>LORD HOBHOUSE OF WOODBOROUGH</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111. I would dismiss the appeal for the reasons given by my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill.  But, having since read and considered the Opinions of my noble and learned friends Lord Hope of Craighead and Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, I realise that to confine myself to such a response would not do full justice to the opinions they express.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112. The first question raised by the appeal has two elements: the first, the correct understanding of Article 6 (1) of the European Convention on Human Rights; and, the second, the question of remedy (s.6(1) and s.8 of the Human Rights Act 1998).  Both Lord Hope and Lord Rodger take a different view of the first element but, because of the view they take of the second element, are able to agree with your Lordships that the appeal should be dismissed.  It may be thought that this does not matter as, for England, the outcome is the same.  But this would be wrong.  The difference on the first element is of general importance and on the second element, by distinguishing <i>HM Advocate v R</i> [2002] UKPC D3, [2003] 2 WLR 317, they have raised a question of the English law of judicial review which, if they are correct, could have far reaching consequences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 6(1):</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113. The directly relevant wording of the Article is:</p>
<p></p><ul>"&nbsp;&nbsp;In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law."</ul><p></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phrase under consideration on this appeal is "within a reasonable time".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114. The view of Lord Hope and Lord Rodger is that this phrase is correctly understood as expressing one of the necessary <i>characteristics</i> of the hearing to which everyone is entitled.  Thus, Lord Rodger says in paragraph 147 of his Opinion that one of the characteristics of the hearing is that "it must take place within a reasonable time"; and refers to "holding a hearing that lacked this characteristic".  Lord Hope at paragraph 70 expressly adopts the same analysis:  "What it says [is] that in the determination of any criminal charge against him the hearing is to have certain characteristics." (See also paragraph 93). They appear to find support from the language used (in a slightly different context) by Lord Bingham at paragraphs 20 and 24 where he refers to the Article 6(1) right as requiring the hearing "to have certain characteristics", one of which is that the "criminal charge be determined at a hearing within a reasonable time".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115. The same reasoning is implicit in the majority Opinions in '<i>R</i>' and is probably most explicitly stated in that of Lord Rodger at paragraphs 148-150 from which it also appears that the point may have been conceded by the Crown.  The inevitable result was that the holding of a hearing outside the limits of a reasonable time was a breach of Article 6(1) and further, as soon as such a breach had become unavoidable, the inevitable breach involved in holding a hearing must be restrained under the Scotland Act 1998.  (See also Lord Hope at paragraphs 76-8.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116. This reasoning depends, as I have said, on categorising the <i>within a reasonable time</i> obligation as referring to a characteristic of the hearing or determination just as are the fair, "public", "independent", "impartial" and "tribunal established by law" requirements.  It is this categorisation which I suggest is fundamentally wrong.  A <i>within a reasonable time</i> obligation relates to a quality of the performance, not to the attributes of the service or article - here the hearing or determination - to be provided by the person under the obligation.  This may all sound over-sophisticated but it can be simply demonstrated both as a matter of the ordinary use of language and by reference to basic principles of the law of obligations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117. As a matter of the ordinary use of language, one can sensibly talk about a fair hearing or a public hearing or an impartial hearing or about an independent or impartial determination or a determination by a tribunal established by law.  All this use is just the use of adjectives or an adjectival phrase to describe the characteristics of the hearing or tribunal itself.  But one cannot sensibly or grammatically talk about a <i>within a reasonable time</i> hearing or determination.  It is not adjectival; it is adverbial.  But it does make sense when it is used in relation to the delivery of the hearing or determination - the performance of the obligation by the person under the obligation.  Thus, 'When must I have done this by?' - 'You must do it within a reasonable time'.  This is different from 'what sort of hearing must there be?' - 'A fair hearing'.  The Opinions of my noble and learned friends recognise and stress the difference between breaches of a time obligation and breaches of other obligations: the expiry of a reasonable time can never be reversed; the clock can only move in one direction; a situation can be arrived at when one can accurately say it is impossible that there can ever be a determination within a reasonable time.  But they do not otherwise recognise that the character of the time obligation is different from that of the other obligations under Article 6(1). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118. Turning to the law of obligations, the main answers to the problems raised were worked out in the 19th century and completed in the 20th.  Where opportunities for codification arose, they were incorporated in legislation, most notably the Sale of Goods Act 1893.  There have been landmark judgments such as that of Devlin J in <i>Universal Cargo Carriers v Pedro Citati</i> [1957] 2 QB 401, [1957] 1 Lloyds  174.  It suffices to quote from the summary of the law provided by Lord Diplock in <i>United Scientific v Burnley Council</i> [1978] AC 904 at 928: </p>
<p></p><ul>"&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not take up time in repeating here what I myself said in [<i>Hongkong Fir v KKK</i>, [1962] 2 QB 26] except to point out that by 1873:</ul><p></p>
(1) <p></p><ul>Stipulations as to the time at which a party was to perform a promise on his part were among the contractual stipulations which were not regarded as "conditions precedent" if his failure to perform that promise punctually did not deprive the other party of substantially the whole benefit which it was intended that he should obtain from the contract;</ul><p></p>
(2) <p></p><ul>When the delay by one party .... had become so prolonged as to deprive the other party of substantially the whole benefit ....... it did discharge that other party from the obligation to continue to perform any of his own promises ..... ;</ul><p></p>
(3) <p></p><ul>Similar principles were applicable to determine whether the parties' duties to one another to continue to perform their mutual obligations were discharged by frustration ....... ." </ul><p></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Diplock stated these rules as of general application in the law of obligations.  It will be noted that the breach of the punctual performance obligation does not necessarily nor automatically put an end to the obligations of either party to continue to perform.  There has been a breach which may call for a remedy in damages for the consequences of that breach; but there still is an obligation to perform the substantive obligation.  By a parity of reasoning, the failure to perform within a reasonable time does not relieve the provider from his obligation to provide a fair trial nor the party not in breach from being required to undergo a fair trial, unless the delay has made a fair trial impossible or has very seriously prejudiced the relevant party.  This is effectively the test, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, which the Court of Appeal applied in the present case and the majority of your Lordships would adopt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119. But, it will be said, this is an argument based on domestic law not upon the construction of an international convention.  There would be force in this objection if the Convention pointed in a different direction.  It does not.  Article 5 deals with the right to liberty.  One of the categories dealt with is persons arrested on reasonable suspicion of having committed a criminal offence: paragraph (1)(c).  Paragraph (3) then provides that such persons shall be promptly brought before a judge "and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial" subject to "guarantees to appear for trial".  This Article therefore expressly contemplates, and implicitly permits, a trial after a reasonable time has elapsed.  The same inference is to be drawn from Article 6 (1) itself since it covers civil as well as criminal proceedings: "In the determination of his civil rights and obligations".  Is a civil claimant, or cross-claimant, to be deprived of the upholding of his rights merely because a more than reasonable time has elapsed?  He may have a right to a remedy for the delay, say by the award of interest or by an assessment of whether his damages have been increased by the delay, but the parties cannot be denied a determination of the claim unless the delay and the role of the parties comes into the exceptional category of having made a fair determination impossible or the action abusive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120. Further, a basic principle of human rights law is the principle of proportionality.  The appellants' argument flies in the face of this principle.  They would read Article 6 (1) as prohibiting any trial after the lapse of a reasonable time.  This is essentially a mechanical approach.  Suppose that the reasonable time is held to have been 't'; an elapsed time of 't' + 1 is a breach and, on the appellants' argument, would involve holding the trial to be a breach.  This is an exorbitant construction to place upon Article 6 (1).  Again, it might be a plausible, though heterodox, argument if there was any support for it in the Strasbourg jurisprudence.  But again, there is not.  I will not repeat the citation of the relevant decisions.  The judgments proceed logically from first making a finding of an identified breach and then to the consideration of the remedy for that breach.  None of the judgments contain a finding that the holding of the trial was a breach as opposed to the occurrence of the delay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121. For these reasons as well as those given by Lord Bingham and to be given by my noble and learned friend Lord Millett, and in disagreement with Lord Hope and Lord Rodger, I do not accept the appellants' argument on the construction and effect of Article 6 (1).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The section 6 and 8 point:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122. This is a question of English law.  It proceeds from the premise that holding the trial was a breach of the defendant's Convention rights and therefore "unlawful".  The difference of opinion derives from attaching different meanings to the use of this word.  It touches upon a familiar difficulty of the law of judicial review which too combines the finding that an act or omission is unlawful and/or <i>ultra vires</i> with discretionary remedies.  What is the legal status of an act which is unlawful or <i>ultra vires</i>?  Does its legal status change if a court refuses an applicant a remedy on judicial review?  There is a paradox, the illegal act which the court nevertheless does not restrain, the <i>ultra vires</i> act which is nevertheless effective.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123. I discussed this paradox in my judgment in <i>Credit Suisse v Allerdale BC</i> [1997] QB 306, CA, pp. 350 <i>et seq</i>, and reviewed the authorities as they stood at that date.  The starting point is <i>Anisminic v Foreign Compensation Commission</i> [1968] 2 QB 862 where Diplock LJ held that the illegality of administrative decisions and actions arose from exceeding the powers given, <i>ie</i>, <i>ultra vires</i>.  (See also<i> Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service</i> [1985] AC 374 at 410 per Lord Diplock).  The combination of this analysis with the discretionary or limited remedy of judicial review gives rise to the paradox.  The applicant may be out of time or there may be other reasons for refusing the applicant a remedy by way of judicial review.  A striking example of the paradox can be found in an employment case where it was held that there was an unlawful dismissal in breach of the obligation of natural justice (and, therefore, the relevant act was <i>ultra vires</i> and unlawful) but there was no order that the employee (a chief constable) be reinstated as if he had never been dismissed: <i>Ridge v Baldwin</i> [1964] AC 40.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;124. The authoritative statement of the law, particularly in relation to criminal proceedings is now provided by <i>Boddington v British Transport Police</i> [1999] 2 AC 143. Lord Browne-Wilkinson again drew attention to the paradox: p.164.  But all members of the House were at one in emphasising that <i>ultra vires</i> acts by a public authority are unlawful.  Thus Lord Slynn said, at p.164:  "For magistrates to be required to convict when they are satisfied that an administrative act is unlawful is unacceptable."  The main discussion was in the judgment of Lord Steyn at pp.170-2.  Thus, Lord Steyn said:  "The rule of law requires a clear distinction to be made between what is lawful and what is unlawful."  He quoted the observation of Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <i>ex parte Page</i> [1993] AC 682 at 701: </p>
<p></p><ul>"&nbsp;&nbsp;The fundamental principle [of judicial review] is that the courts will intervene to ensure that the powers of public decision-making bodies are exercised lawfully."</ul><p></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and from Dr Forsyth in "'The Metaphysics of Nullity' - Invalidity, Conceptual Reasoning and the Rule of Law", <i>Forsyth and Hare, The Golden Metwand and the Crooked Cord</i> (1998) at p. 159, referring to the fact that someone may find that he has relied upon the void and unlawful administrative act of another:</p>
<p></p><ul>"&nbsp;&nbsp;The crucial issue to be determined is whether that second actor has legal power to act validly notwithstanding the invalidity of the first act.  And it is determined by an analysis of the law against the background of the familiar proposition that an unlawful act is void."</ul><p></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their Lordships accordingly held that a person charged with an offence under an <i>ultra vires</i> bye-law prohibiting smoking on trains could defend himself by contending that the bye-law was unlawful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125. Three points of particular relevance emerge -</p>
<p></p><ul>(a) An <i>ultra vires</i> act by a public authority is unlawful.  There is no room for distinguishing between the law of Scotland and the law of England in this regard.</ul><p></p>
<p></p><ul>(b) A person charged with a criminal offence can defend himself by challenging the lawfulness of any matter essential to his prosecution on that charge. </ul><p></p>
<p></p><ul>(c) The challenge can be made at the trial and on appeal.  That it has not been made by way of judicial review is irrelevant as is the fact that, on judicial review, a remedy might have been refused. </ul><p></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;126. It follows that if, contrary to my view, delay in bringing the case to trial amounting to a breach of the "within a reasonable time" obligation in Article 6(1) renders it unlawful to hold the trial, the person charged can have the indictment quashed and/or the proceedings stayed.  It is <i>a fortiori</i> from the decision and reasoning in <i>Boddington</i> that an unlawful trial cannot be held and that any conviction resulting from such a trial must as of right be quashed on appeal.  The trial court lacked jurisdiction to try the accused.  The flexibility of the remedies afforded on judicial review and the remedial position in Strasbourg cannot survive the hypothesis that the trial and conviction are unlawful under s.6(1).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;127. The appellants fail on the first element in the main question.  The construction of Article 6(1) for which they contend and which my noble and learned friends Lord Hope and Lord Rodger support and <i>HM Lord Advocate v R</i> upheld is in my respectful opinion clearly wrong.  Further the distinction it is sought to make between the law of Scotland and English law regarding the second element is in my respectful opinion clearly unsustainable as a matter of English law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Second Question: When does a person become a person charged with a criminal offence? </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;128. There is no division of opinion on this question.  It depends upon the structure of the law and practice of the relevant individual member country.  In England it must be decided in accordance with English law.  The problem is when does the investigation of a suspected commission of a criminal offence become the prosecution of a person charged with a criminal offence.  So far as English law is concerned the answer is provided by Parts III and IV of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 which draw a clear line between the investigating/arresting stage by the investigating police officers and the decision by a different independent police officer, the custody officer, whether a particular person should be charged and, if so, charging him: s.37 and Code C.16 (since amended).</p>
<p><b>LORD MILLETT</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;129. I have had the advantage of reading in draft the speeches of my noble and learned friends Lord Bingham of Cornhill and Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead. I am in complete agreement with them, and add a very few words of my own to explain why I find it impossible to accept the reasoning of my noble and learned friends Lord Hope of Craighead and Lord Rodger of Earlsferry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;130. Section 57(2) of the Scotland Act provides that the members of the Scottish Executive have no power to act incompatibly with a Convention right. Section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998 makes it unlawful for a public authority to act incompatibly with a Convention right. When Parliament wishes to proscribe an act it traditionally adopts the formula: "it shall be unlawful" to commit the prohibited act. Whatever the position in relation to past acts, in relation to proposed future acts there is no difference between the position in Scotland and that in England. In Scotland the Scottish Executive has no power to act incompatibly with the defendant's Convention rights; in England the authorities are expressly prohibited from doing so. If (i) it is proposed to hold a trial after the expiry of a reasonable time <i>and </i>(ii) the holding of such a trial is incompatible with the defendant's right to a trial within a reasonable time, then in Scotland there is no power to hold the trial and in England the trial cannot lawfully be held. In either case the proceedings cannot be allowed to proceed to trial. But the second condition must be satisfied as well as the first. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;131. My difficulty with Lord Hope's reasoning is that it proceeds from the assumption that the question is one of domestic law and is "essentially a question of remedy". This begs the question, for it assumes that the second condition is satisfied, that is to say that it is a breach of the defendant's Convention right to hold a trial after the expiry of a reasonable time. This is the very question to be decided, and it is not a question of domestic law at all. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;132. Before remedial questions can be considered, the breach must be identified. The essential question in the present case is whether breach of the reasonable time requirement consists <i>only</i> of the failure to hold the trial within a reasonable time (a sin of omission) or consists also of the holding of the trial itself after a reasonable time has expired (a sin of commission). This is the question to which I now turn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;133. Article 6(1) of the Convention confers four distinct and independent rights (i) to a fair and (ii) public hearing (iii) within a reasonable time (iv) by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. Several of your Lordships have commented upon the differences between the right to a hearing within a reasonable time and the other Article 6 rights. As Lord Rodger has observed, if the hearing is not fair or public or is not by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law, it will usually be possible for the authorities to hold another hearing which satisfies the requirements of the Convention. But where the hearing is not held within a reasonable time, the violation is irreversible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;134. But this is not, with respect, the only or the most important distinction between the reasonable time requirement and the other requirements of Article 6. The fundamental distinction and the one which is directly relevant to the present issue is that a failure to comply with the other requirements of Article 6 puts the verdict itself in doubt. If the hearing is not fair, or is before a tribunal which is not independent and impartial or does not sit in public, then the correctness of the tribunal's decision is brought into question. The object of these rights is to secure to the individual a just determination of the dispute or criminal charge which is as far beyond challenge as human justice can make it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;135. But the object of the reasonable time guarantee is different. The failure to hold the hearing within a reasonable time does not <i>in itself</i> ("automatically") cast doubt on the verdict. There is nothing wrong with the trial and the verdict is not suspect. The defendant cannot and does not challenge the propriety of the verdict on this ground. He can only say in effect: "you were right to convict me, but you should have done so sooner." The vice lies in the delay itself, with all its harmful consequences to the defendant. This is what Article 6 prohibits and for which a remedy must be found. The vice does not lie in the holding of the trial itself; and it is a misreading of Article 6 to think that it prohibits it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;136. Thus I agree with Lord Rodger's statement, in paragraph 148, that "everyone has a right to have his case heard fairly, publicly and in a reasonable time. If his case is not heard fairly, there is a breach; if his case is not heard publicly, there is a breach; and if his case is not heard within a reasonable time, there is a breach". Where I part company with him is in his conclusion that the three rights and the three breaches are parallel. In my opinion the third right is very different. In that case, and that case alone, the conduct of the hearing itself may be beyond reproach. This difference ought to be, and in my opinion is, reflected by an Article which confers a positive right to a hearing (being a hearing which is fair and held in public within a reasonable time), and a right not to be subjected to a hearing which is unfair or held in private; but no right not to be subjected to a late (but otherwise irreproachable) hearing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;137. This is a matter of right, not remedy. It marks the scope of the reasonable time requirement; it is not concerned with the nature of the remedy for breach. This is amply demonstrated by the jurisprudence of the Strasbourg court, which habitually accepts a reduction of sentence as sufficient reparation for breach of the reasonable time requirement. A mere reduction of sentence could not sensibly be regarded as sufficient reparation for conviction and sentence after a hearing which should never have taken place. The Strasbourg court cannot, of course, quash the conviction; but if the national court has failed to do so one would expect it to require reparation to be made for the wrongful conviction and sentence. The only rational conclusion from its failure to do so is that the hearing and sentence themselves are not incompatible with Article 6, and that the only violation consists of the delay. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;138. My Lords, it is essential to keep in mind the difference between what the state authorities ought to do and what they are entitled to do. They <i>ought</i> to hold the trial within a reasonable time, and if they fail to do so they commit a breach of the defendant's Convention rights. But they remain <i>entitled</i> to hold the trial after the reasonable time has expired, though they must make adequate reparation for their failure to hold it sooner; and they do not act incompatibly with the defendant's Convention rights by doing so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;139. It follows that it is not unlawful (in England) or ultra vires (in Scotland) to proceed to trial despite the unreasonable delay.</p>
<p><b>LORD SCOTT OF FOSCOTE</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;140. I am in complete and respectful agreement with the opinions of my noble and learned friends Lord Bingham of Cornhill, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough and Lord Millett and would answer the two questions put by the Attorney General in the manner Lord Bingham has proposed.</p>
<p><b>LORD RODGER OF EARLSFERRY</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;141. In this appeal your Lordships must deal with two issues.  One concerns the starting point of the period to be considered for the purposes of the reasonable time guarantee in article 6(1) of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms ("the Convention").  On that matter I respectfully agree with what my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill has said and I have nothing to add.</p>
