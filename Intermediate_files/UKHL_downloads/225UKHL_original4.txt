<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81.&nbsp;&nbsp;The most recent case, on this part of the appeal, is <i>Sidabras and Dziautas v Lithuania</i> Application Nos 55480/00 and 59330/00, (27 October 2004).  The applicants had been KGB officers and as such were debarred from holding any post in the public sector, and from many responsible jobs in the private sector.  The ECHR held that their complaint fell within the ambit of article 8 (respect for private life) and observed (para 49):</p>
<p></p><ul>"in the instant case there is more at stake for the applicants than the defence of their good name.  They are marked in the eyes of society on account of their past association with an oppressive regime.  Hence, and in view of the wide-ranging scope of the employment restrictions which the applicants have to endure, the Court considers that the possible damage to their leading a normal personal life must be taken to be a relevant factor in determining whether the facts complained of fall within the ambit of article 8 of the Convention."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ban was disproportionate and the claim under article 14 in conjunction with article 8 (respect for private life) was successful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Monaghan submitted that since the concept of respect for private and family life is so wide and multifaceted, your Lordships should be ready to conclude, in considering a complaint under article 14, that any alleged act of discrimination is within the ambit of article 8.  But if that were right virtually every act of discrimination on grounds of personal status (gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, and so on) would amount to a breach of article 14, since these are all important elements in an individual's private life.  There would be little or no need for the wider prohibition in article 1 of the Twelfth Protocol on discrimination in the enjoyment of any legal right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, in my opinion that is not the effect of the Strasbourg case law which I have attempted to summarise.  The ECHR has taken a more nuanced approach, reflecting the unique feature of article 8 to which I have already drawn attention: that it is concerned with the failure to accord <i>respect</i>.  To criminalise any manifestation of an individual's sexual orientation plainly fails to respect his or her private life, even if in practice the criminal law is not enforced (<i>Dudgeon; Norris</i>); so does intrusive interrogation and humiliating discharge from the armed forces (<i>Smith and Grady; Lustig-Prean and</i> <i>Beckett</i>).  Banning a former KGB officer from all public sector posts, and from a wide range of responsible private-sector posts, is so draconian as to threaten his leading a normal personal life (<i>Sidabras and</i> <i>Dziautas</i>).  Less serious interference would not merely have been a breach of article 8; it would not have fallen within the ambit of the article at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84.&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly the cases in which article 14 has been considered in conjunction with the family life limb of article 8 were all (whichever way they were ultimately decided) concerned with measures very closely connected with family life: <i>Petrovic</i> (parental leave); <i>Estevez </i>(social security benefit for surviving spouse); <i>Frette </i>(adoption).  By contrast <i>Logan</i> (the CSA case) is an example of unsuccessful reliance on a much more remote link (financial resources to visit absent children).</p>
<i><p><i>The first issue: conclusions on family life and private life</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85.&nbsp;&nbsp;All three members of the Court of Appeal rejected the argument that the method of calculation of Ms M's maintenance assessment under the 1991 Act and the Regulations fell within the ambit of the right to respect for the family relationship between Ms M and her two children by her marriage to her ex-husband; Sedley LJ at paras 36-39, Neuberger LJ at paras 97-100, and Kennedy LJ at paras 155-166.  In my opinion they were right to do so.  Ms M is of course entitled to respect for her continuing relationship with her children.  But she is not complaining of being deprived of all contact with her children, or of being deprived of contact with them at her home where her same-sex partner lives.  On the contrary, they spend part of the time with her at her home.  She is complaining because she considers that she should be paying less towards their maintenance.  As Neuberger LJ said (para 99) her article 14 complaint has nothing to do with respect for her relationship with her children.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms M's stronger argument (as regards family life) depends on her present relationship with her same-sex partner.  Kennedy LJ held (in the passage already referred to) that <i>Estevez</i> is still good law at Strasbourg, and that our domestic law has not moved further forward.  Sedley and Neuberger LJJ held that domestic law has moved further forward, although that bald summary does not do justice to their careful reasoning (at paras 40-49 and 108-133 respectively, relying heavily on <i>Fitzpatrick v Sterling Housing Association</i> [2001]  1 AC 27 and <i>Ghaidan v Godin-Mendoza</i> [2004]  2 AC 557). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not go into their reasoning because I am content to assume that the unit consisting of Ms M, her new partner and (especially when living with them) their children by their former marriages should be regarded as a family for article 8 purposes.  I would also accept that the complicated formulae employed by the 1991 Act and the Regulations are intended to strike a fair balance between the competing demands (on often limited financial resources) of the children (when living away from the new home) and the new household. To that extent the legislation is intended, in a general sort of way, to be a positive measure promoting family life (or, it might be more accurate to say, limiting the damage inevitably caused by the breakdown of relationships between couples who have had children).  But I do not regard this as having more than a tenuous link with respect for family life.  I do not consider that this way of putting Ms M's case brings it within the ambit of respect for family life under article 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion Ms M's case on respect for private life also fails, for similar reasons.  There has been no improper intrusion on her private life.  She has not been criminalised, threatened or humiliated.  The Tribunal respectfully recorded that she and her partner "were living in a very close, loving and monogamous relationship."  Her complaint is that the state has calculated her liability to contribute to her children's maintenance under a formula which is different from (and on the particular facts of her case, more onerous than) that which would have been used if she had been in a heterosexual relationship.  The link with respect for her private life is in my view very tenuous indeed.  </p>
<i><p><i>The first issue: article 1FP</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can deal with this issue briefly as I am in full agreement with the majority of the Court of Appeal (Sedley LJ at paras 52-53 and Kennedy LJ at paras 169-172).  Sedley LJ quoted from the Commission in <i>Burrows v United Kingdom </i>App No 27558/95 that article 1FP was</p>
<p></p><ul>"primarily concerned with the formal expropriation of assets for a public purpose, and not with the regulation of rights between persons under private law unless the State lays hands—or authorises a third party to lay hands—on a particular piece of property for a purpose which is to serve the public interest."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sedley LJ added,</p>
<p></p><ul>"Child support is neither a tax nor a form of expropriation: it is an allocation of private financial responsibility, and an expansive approach to [article 1FP] is in my view to be resisted."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90.&nbsp;&nbsp;Neuberger LJ fastened on the words "or authorises a third party to lay hands" as indicating that article 1FP has a wide scope.  But those words are needed to cover cases such as <i>James v United Kingdom </i> (1986)  8 EHRR 123 (leasehold enfranchisement).  In this case the CSA is concerned as an official intermediary, but it is enforcing a personal obligation of the absent parent.  It is no more expropriating property than (in an analogy suggested in argument) when the civil justice system enforces a private contract by converting a contract debt into a judgment debt which can be recovered by the process of execution.</p>
<i><p><i></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
The second issue</i> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore allow this appeal on the first issue.  I would also allow it on the second issue, if the case gets that far, on the ground that Parliament has acted with reasonable promptness, and within its margin of appreciation, in the complex process of legislative change which has resulted in the 2004 Act.  The United Kingdom government was criticised by the ECHR for dilatoriness in <i>Goodwin </i>(decided in July 2002) but it has since been engaged in a necessarily time-consuming process of deliberation and consultation (initiated by the consultation document: Civil Partnership, a framework for the legal recognition of same-sex couples published in June 2003) leading to the preparation and enactment of the 2004 Act.  It is a massive piece of legislation extending to 264 sections and 30 schedules.  It received the Royal Assent on 18 November 2004 and came into force, as already noted, on 5 December 2005.  The delay in bringing it into force was necessary in order to make far-reaching administrative changes including the adaptation of computer systems, the training of staff, and so on.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92.&nbsp;&nbsp;The enactment of the 2004 Act was possible only because of the profound cultural change which has occurred in most of Europe, within the last two generations, in attitudes towards homosexuality.  Many people (and not only homosexuals) would say that that change has taken far too long, and they would be right ("They are taking him to prison for the colour of his hair … For the nameless and abominable colour of his hair" wrote Housman in a poem not published for many years after it was written).  Nevertheless two generations is not a long time in which to change prejudices which have been deeply ingrained for many centuries.  In Europe, where the Christian religion has provided the cultural matrix for two thousand years, male homosexual activity was regarded as a grave sin, at one time punishable as a form of heresy; it was also for centuries a capital crime under the secular law of many European countries; other world religions also condemned it, and many still do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93.&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent article, "Homosexual Rights", Child and Family Law Quarterly (2004) vol. 16, p.125 my noble and learned friend Baroness Hale of Richmond has commented on the evolutionary process of legal change:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is a fair hypothesis, advanced by Kees Waaldijk, that 'most countries, at different times and at different paces, go through a standard sequence of legislative steps recognising homosexuality.'  The first steps are taken by the criminal law: permitting homosexual acts between male adults and then removing age and other distinctions between same-and opposite-sex sexual activity.  The next steps are taken by the civil law: prohibiting discrimination against homosexuals in employment, and in the provision of goods, education, housing and other services.  The final steps are taken by family law, extending laws applicable to unmarried heterosexual couples to homosexual couples, recognising the parental relationship between homosexual parents and their own, their partners' and even other people's children, providing for registered civil partnerships, and finally providing for civil marriage."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sequence can be seen in our domestic law: the main steps being the Sexual Offences Act 1967, the beginning of specific anti-discrimination legislation in the 1970s (though with some back-sliding over clause 28), and now sweeping changes in family law.  The United Kingdom may have been following the lead of other states within the Council of Europe, but it has not been so far behind as to go outside its margin of appreciation, except in relation to transsexuals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>R (Hooper) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions</i> [2005]  1 WLR 1681, 1699, para 62 Lord Hoffmann said, in the course of discussing <i>Walden v Liechtenstein</i> App No 33916/96,</p>
<p></p><ul>"I can quite understand that if one has a form of discrimination which was historically justified but, with changes in society, has gradually lost its justification, a period of consultation, drafting and debate must be included in the time which the legislature may reasonably consider appropriate for making a change.  Up to the point at which that time is exceeded, there is no violation of a Convention right.  But there is no suggestion in the report of <i>Walden v Liechtenstein</i> that the discrimination between married couples was ever justified and I find it hard to see why there was no violation of Convention rights as long as the old law remained in place."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both sides sought to draw some comfort from that passage.  <i>Hooper</i> recognised that until a date in 2001 (I need not go into the significance of the precise date) the United Kingdom social security law had favoured widows in a way that could be justified as positive discrimination.  No right-minded person would now suggest that discrimination against homosexuals was ever justifiable, and so Lord Hoffmann's observations about the need for consultation, drafting and debate are not (Ms Monaghan submitted) in point.  But that is to my mind a deeply unrealistic approach, and one that is at odds with the realistic approach of the ECHR in cases such as <i>Estevez</i>.  Although discrimination against homosexuals could never have been justified, by today's standards, the fact is that for centuries a homosexual couple living together were (even if they escaped criminal sanctions and social ostracism) regarded as quite different from a married couple, or a heterosexual unmarried couple.  Profound cultural changes do take time: as Sir Thomas Bingham MR said in <i>R v Ministry of Defence Ex p Smith </i>[1996]  QB 517, 554:</p>
<p></p><ul>"A belief which represented unquestioned orthodoxy in year X may have become questionable by year Y and unsustainable by year Z."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion it was within the United Kingdom's margin of appreciation, down to the preparation, enactment and coming into force of the 2004 Act, whether to treat a same-sex couple (for social security purposes, and the allied purposes of the 1991 Act) as a family unit or as two individuals.</p>
<i><p><i>The third issue</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97.&nbsp;&nbsp;The third issue (the possible application of section 3 of the 1998 Act) does not therefore arise, and I think it better to say nothing about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons I would allow the appeal, set aside the orders below and remit the matter to the Tribunal for any necessary adjustments to be made to the maintenance assessment. </p>

BARONESS HALE OF RICHMOND
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Civil Partnership Act 2004 came into force on the day we began to hear this case. It grants to same sex couples the same legal recognition that the law grants to opposite sex couples. It allows them to contract into a formal status with virtually identical legal consequences to those of marriage. It treats those couples who choose not to enter such a partnership, but live together as if they were civil partners, in the same way as it treats opposite sex couples who choose not to marry, but live together as if they were married. Before then, the law had generally treated same sex couples as if they were two separate individuals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100.&nbsp;&nbsp;In practical terms, many same sex couples will benefit from the change; but many others will not. Indeed, they will be worse off. This is because our means tested welfare benefit systems generally assume that a couple needs less to live on than two single people. They also assume that couples share both their resources and their expenditure. So the resources of both are brought into the calculation, but their combined needs are set at a lower level than they would be if they were two individuals. These systems also treat unmarried couples in the same way as married couples so as not to make marriage less attractive (in the old parlance 'less eligible') than living together.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101.&nbsp;&nbsp;Government policy-makers, of course, knew full well that there were snakes as well as ladders involved in applying the same legal rules to same sex couples as were applied to opposite sex couples. So too did those in the lesbian and gay community who were campaigning for the change. To people who have traditionally been excluded by society and the law, what matters most is equal dignity, being taken seriously on the same terms as the traditionally included, unless there is a good reason for making a difference. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102.&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the 2004 Act came into force, the child support scheme adopted the same approach as the welfare benefits system, although there is no necessary connection between the two. In calculating the liability of a non-resident parent to maintain her children, parents living in same sex relationships were treated as two individuals whereas parents living in opposite sex relationships were treated as a single unit. As with the welfare benefits system, this had some advantages for same sex couples, about which opposite sex couples might wish to complain, and some disadvantages, about which same sex couples might wish to complain. The issue in this case is whether this difference in treatment breached the parents' right under article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights. This requires that 'the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race . . .' and a number of other named characteristics ' . . . or other status'. It is agreed that sexual orientation is such a ground. Indeed, it falls within the list of specially suspect grounds, where 'particularly serious reasons' are required if a difference in treatment is to be justified and 'the margin of appreciation afforded to member states is narrow': see <i>Karner v Austria</i> (2003) 38 EHRR 528, paras 37 and 41.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also agreed that article 14 is not an open-ended guarantee of non-discrimination: see, for example, <i>Botta v Italy </i>(1998) 26 EHRR 241, 249, para 31, quoted by my noble and learned friend, Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe, at para 56 above. It does not require member states to secure the equal protection of all the laws to everyone within its jurisdiction. That is required by the 12th Protocol to the Convention, which came into force on 5 April 2005, but has not yet been signed or ratified by the United Kingdom. This is closely modelled on article 26 of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights, which itself is quite closely modelled on the 14th amendment to the United States Constitution. Article 14 is limited to discrimination in the enjoyment of the Convention rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104.&nbsp;&nbsp;The rights in question here are those protected by article 8 of the Convention itself and by article 1 of the First Protocol to the Convention. Article 8 gives everyone 'the right to respect for [her] private and family life, [her] home and [her] correspondence' and limits the circumstances in which a public authority may interfere with the exercise of that right. Article 1 of the First Protocol gives every natural and legal person 'the right not to be deprived of [her] possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided by law and by the general principles of international law'. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is also agreed that there can be a breach of article 14 even if there is no breach of a substantive Convention right: see <i>Abdulaziz and others v United Kingdom</i> (1985) 7 EHRR 471. Ms Monaghan, appearing for the mother, does not suggest that her rights under article 8 or article 1 of the First Protocol have actually been violated. She accepts that there is a threshold below which the effect of an interference is not so severe as to infringe her rights. She is wise to do so. It is completely unrealistic to isolate one feature of the child support scheme and complain of its unfavourable effects when there are other features of the scheme which have favourable effects. The scheme has to be looked at as a whole, with its ladders as well as its snakes. It must also be borne in mind that the same will apply to opposite sex couples. Sometimes treating them as a couple will be a good thing from their point of view, sometimes it will not. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence the complaint is not about the way that the scheme treated the mother and her partner as such. Had the scheme treated everyone in the same way there could have been no complaint. The complaint is that some couples were treated differently from others. If article 14 is read literally, the first question is whether the difference in treatment impacts upon the enjoyment of their Convention rights. The trouble with that reading is that almost anything might be said to have some impact upon the enjoyment of Convention rights, especially a broadly framed right such as that in article 8. The European Court of Human Rights has put it rather differently: does the subject matter of the disadvantage 'constitute one of the modalities of the exercise of a right guaranteed', or is it 'linked to the exercise of a right guaranteed,' or, more commonly, does it 'fall within the ambit' of a Convention right: see, for example, <i>Frette v France</i> (2004) 38 EHRR 438, para 31? However, it does not follow from the fact that there has not been a sufficiently severe interference to breach article 8 or article 1 of the First Protocol that the subject matter does not fall within the ambit, reach or grasp of the right in question. Nor does it follow from the fact that an interference or lack of respect can be justified under article 8(2) that a difference in treatment does not require to be justified under article 14. That was the whole point of <i>Abdulaziz and others v United Kingdom</i> (1985) 7 EHRR 471. The refusal to let husbands join their wives here was justified by the right of the United Kingdom to control immigration. But the difference in treatment between the husbands of wives settled here and the wives of husbands settled here had still to be justified under article 14. And it was not.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107.&nbsp;&nbsp;The child support scheme is clearly capable of affecting the enjoyment of the right to respect for the family life of the mother and father and their children. There is no doubt that family life was established between this mother, this father and their children. There is equally no doubt that the family life of the mother and her children did not come to an end when the parents separated and divorced. Most children whose parents do not live together do not see themselves as living in 'single parent families'. They see themselves as having two parents, indeed sometimes more than two, who happen not to be living in the same household. These children actually spent two and a half days each week living with their mother and her partner. In the family courts such arrangements are increasingly reflected either in a shared residence order, which recognises that the children have two homes and divide their time between the two, or in no order at all, which leaves it to the parents to make their own arrangements about how the children will divide their time. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108.&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the operation of the child support scheme fall within the ambit of the mother's right to respect for her family life with her children? In my view, it clearly does. It is one aspect, among many others, of the state's support for family life. The United Kingdom argued as much before the European Commission of Human Rights in <i>Logan v United Kingdom</i>, App No 24875/94, 6 September 1996<i>.</i> Mr Sales, for the Agency, argued that it is simply the state's way of enforcing the private obligation of parents to support their children. That, of course, was the very point that I was making in my dissenting opinion in <i>R (Kehoe) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions</i> [2005] UKHL 48, [2006] AC 42. There is a private law obligation upon every parent to support their children and a private law right of the parent looking after those children to receive that money for the benefit of the children (and sometimes there is an express private law right for the children to receive it directly). But there is also a public law obligation upon every parent to support their children, currently expressed in section 78(6) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. The child support scheme is the state's way of enforcing both of these obligations - the obligation owed to the children and the obligation owed to the state to prevent the children becoming a charge on the state. Before the child support scheme was instituted, the private law obligation was enforced through the family courts, no doubt not as efficiently as the state would have liked, but then neither is the child support scheme conspicuous in its efficiency. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal rejected this way of putting the case, because they could not see how the operation of scheme impacted upon the mother's family life with her children. But there are many ways in which it may do so. In <i>Logan</i> the complaint was that the mandatory child support payments meant that the father could not visit his children as often as he was entitled under the court's order to do. The complaint of a direct breach of article 8 failed because he could not show that the impact upon his family life was sufficiently grave, but in another case it might have been. There was no complaint under article 14. A more common complaint might be that the mandatory payments did not leave the parent in a shared residence situation with enough money to support the children while they were with her. It may be unlikely that any of these complaints would reach the minimum level of severity of impact required to breach article 8. But that the scheme falls within the reach of the parent's right to respect for her family life with her children seems to me clear. <i>Petrovic v Austria</i> (2001) 33 EHRR 307 was concerned, not with the right to parental leave to look after the child, but the right to a parental leave allowance to facilitate that leave. No-one was preventing or interfering with the father's decision to look after the child. The state was simply not supporting him in doing so. There was no breach of article 8 because there was no positive obligation to provide such an allowance. But its existence demonstrated the state's respect for family life. That was sufficient to engage article 14. In <i>Frette v France</i> (2004) 38 EHRR 438, there was no breach of article 8, because the right to respect for family life presupposes the existence of a family and the refusal to allow the applicant to adopt a child 'could not be considered to infringe his right to the free expression and development of his personality or the manner in which he led his life, in particular his sexual life' (para 31). Nevertheless, the subject matter was sufficiently within the ambit of article 8 for the state to be required to justify a difference in treatment based on sexual orientation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110.&nbsp;&nbsp;Test it this way. The private law of child maintenance used to discriminate <i>systematically</i> between mothers and fathers. There was power to order a father to pay maintenance to the mother for the benefit of the children when there was no power to order the mother to pay maintenance to the father. The enforcement of the obligation to maintain one's children was one of the ways in which the state respected and facilitated the family life of both parents and children. Had the system continued to discriminate between mothers and fathers, this would surely have been sufficient to engage article 14. Whether or not the difference in treatment could be justified (as it was in both <i>Petrovic</i> and <i>Frette</i>) is another matter.</p>
