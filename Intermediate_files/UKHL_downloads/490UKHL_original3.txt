<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;67. The solicitor should obtain from the bank any information he needs.  If the bank fails for any reason to provide information requested by the solicitor, the solicitor should decline to provide the confirmation sought by the bank.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;68. As already noted, the advice which a solicitor can be expected to give must depend on the particular facts of the case.  But I have set out this 'core minimum' in some detail, because the quality of the legal advice is the most disturbing feature of some of the present appeals.  The perfunctory nature of the advice may well be largely due to a failure by some solicitors to understand what is required in these cases.<i></i></p><i>
</i>
<i><p>Independent advice</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;69. I turn next to the much-vexed question whether the solicitor advising the wife must act for the wife alone.  Or, at the very least, the solicitor must not act for the husband or the bank in the current transaction save in a wholly ministerial capacity, such as carrying out conveyancing formalities or supervising the execution of documents and witnessing signatures.  Commonly, in practice, the solicitor advising the wife will be the solicitor acting also for her husband either in the particular transaction or generally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70. The first point to note is that this question cannot be answered by reference to reported decisions.  The steps a bank must take once it is put on inquiry, if it is to avoid having constructive notice of the wife's rights, are not the subject of exposition in earlier authority.  This is a novel situation, created by the <i>O'Brien</i> decision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;71. Next, a simple and clear rule is needed, preferably of well nigh universal application.  In some cases a bank deals directly with a husband and wife and has to take the initiative in requiring the wife to obtain legal advice.  In other cases, a bank may deal throughout with solicitors already acting for the husband and wife.  The case of <i>Bank of Baroda v Rayarel</i> [1995]  2 FLR 376 is an example of the latter type of case.  It would not be satisfactory to attempt to draw a distinction along these lines.  Any such distinction would lack a principled base.  Inevitably, in practice, the distinction would disintegrate in confusion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72. Thirdly, here again, a balancing exercise is called for.  Some features point in one direction, others in the opposite direction.  Factors favouring the need for the solicitor to act for the wife alone include the following.  Sometimes a wife may be inhibited in discussion with a solicitor who is also acting for the husband or whose main client is the husband.  This occurred in <i>Banco Exterior Internacional v Mann</i> [1995]  1 All ER 936: see the finding of the judge, at p 941F-G.  Sometimes a solicitor whose main client is the husband may not, in practice, give the same single-minded attention to the wife's position as would a solicitor acting solely for the wife.  Her interests may rank lower in the solicitor's scale of priorities, perhaps unconsciously, than the interests of the husband.  Instances of incompetent advice, or worse, which have come before the court might perhaps be less likely to recur if a solicitor were instructed to act for the wife alone and gave advice solely to her.  As a matter of general understanding, independent advice would suggest that the solicitor should not be acting in the same transaction for the person who, if there is any undue influence, is the source of that influence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73. The contrary view is that the solicitor may also act for the husband or the bank, provided the solicitor is satisfied that this is in the wife's best interests and satisfied also that this will not give rise to any conflicts of duty or interest.  The principal factors favouring this approach are as follows.  A requirement that a wife should receive advice from a solicitor acting solely for her will frequently add significantly to the legal costs.  Sometimes a wife will be happier to be advised by a family solicitor known to her than by a complete stranger.  Sometimes a solicitor who knows both husband and wife and their histories will be better placed to advise than a solicitor who is a complete stranger.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74. In my view, overall the latter factors are more weighty than the former.  The advantages attendant upon the employment of a solicitor acting solely for the wife do not justify the additional expense this would involve for the husband.  When accepting instructions to advise the wife the solicitor assumes responsibilities directly to her, both at law and professionally.  These duties, and this is central to the reasoning on this point, are owed to the wife alone.  In advising the wife the solicitor is acting for the wife alone.  He is concerned only with her interests.  I emphasise, therefore, that in every case the solicitor must consider carefully whether there is any conflict of duty or interest and, more widely, whether it would be in the best interests of the wife for him to accept instructions from her.  If he decides to accept instructions, his assumption of legal and professional responsibilities to her ought, in the ordinary course of things, to provide sufficient assurance that he will give the requisite advice fully, carefully and conscientiously.  Especially so, now that the nature of the advice called for has been clarified.  If at any stage the solicitor becomes concerned that there is a real risk that other interests or duties may inhibit his advice to the wife he must cease to act for her.<i></i></p><i>
<p>Agency</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75. No system ever works perfectly.  There will always be cases where things go wrong, sometimes seriously wrong.  The next question concerns the position when a solicitor has accepted instructions to advise a wife but he fails to do so properly.  He fails to give her the advice needed to bring home to her the practical implications of her standing as surety.  What then?  The wife has a remedy in damages against the negligent solicitor.  But what is the position of the bank who proceeded in the belief that the wife had been given the necessary advice?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76. Mr Sher contended that, depending on the facts, the solicitor should be regarded as the agent of the bank.  Commonly, what happens is that the bank asks the solicitor acting for the husband to undertake the conveyancing formalities on behalf of the bank.  The bank also asks the solicitor to undertake the further task of explaining the nature and effect of the documents to the wife, and then confirming to the bank that he has done so.  In carrying out these requested tasks, it was submitted, the solicitor is acting for the bank.  The bank requires the solicitor to advise the wife, not for her benefit, but for the benefit and protection of the bank.  Any deficiencies in the advice given to the wife should be attributed to the bank.  In this regard, it was submitted, the solicitor's knowledge is to be imputed to the bank.  A certificate furnished by the solicitor to the bank should not prejudice the position of the wife when, as happened in several cases, the contents of the certificate are untrue.  If the solicitor has not given the wife any advice, her rights should not be diminished by the solicitor telling the bank that she has been fully advised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77. I cannot accept this analysis.  Confirmation from the solicitor that he has advised the wife is one of the bank's preconditions for completion of the transaction.  But it is central to this arrangement that in advising the wife the solicitor is acting for the wife and no one else.  The bank does not have, and is intended not to have, any knowledge of or control over the advice the solicitor gives the wife.  The solicitor is not accountable to the bank for the advice he gives to the wife.  To impute to the bank knowledge of what passed between the solicitor and the wife would contradict this essential feature of the arrangement.  The mere fact that, for its own purposes, the bank asked the solicitor to advise the wife does not make the solicitor the bank's agent in giving that advice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78. In the ordinary case, therefore, deficiencies in the advice given are a matter between the wife and her solicitor.  The bank is entitled to proceed on the assumption that a solicitor advising the wife has done his job properly.  I have already mentioned what is the bank's position if it knows this is not so, or if it knows facts from which it ought to have realised this is not so.</p>
<i><p>Obtaining the solicitor's confirmation</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79. I now return to the steps a bank should take when it has been put on inquiry and for its protection is looking to the fact that the wife has been advised independently by a solicitor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the unsatisfactory features in some of the cases is the late stage at which the wife first became involved in the transaction.  In practice she had no opportunity to express a view on the identity of the solicitor who advised her.  She did not even know that the purpose for which the solicitor was giving her advice was to enable him to send, on her behalf, the protective confirmation sought by the bank.  Usually the solicitor acted for both husband and wife.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the bank is looking for its protection to legal advice given to the wife by a solicitor who, in this respect, is acting solely for her, I consider the bank should take steps to check <i>directly with the wife</i> the name of the solicitor she wishes to act for her.  To this end, in future the bank should communicate directly with the wife, informing her that for its own protection it will require written confirmation from a solicitor, acting for her, to the effect that the solicitor has fully explained to her the nature of the documents and the practical implications they will have for her.  She should be told that the purpose of this requirement is that thereafter she should not be able to dispute she is legally bound by the documents once she has signed them.  She should be asked to nominate a solicitor whom she is willing to instruct to advise her, separately from her husband, and act for her in giving the necessary confirmation to the bank.  She should be told that, if she wishes, the solicitor may be the same solicitor as is acting for her husband in the transaction.  If a solicitor is already acting for the husband and the wife, she should be asked whether she would prefer that a different solicitor should act for her regarding the bank's requirement for confirmation from a solicitor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The bank should not proceed with the transaction until it has received an appropriate response directly from the wife.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Representatives of the bank are likely to have a much better picture of the husband's financial affairs than the solicitor.  If the bank is not willing to undertake the task of explanation itself, the bank must provide the solicitor with the financial information he needs for this purpose.  Accordingly it should become routine practice for banks, if relying on confirmation from a solicitor for their protection, to send to the solicitor the necessary financial information.  What is required must depend on the facts of the case.  Ordinarily this will include information on the purpose for which the proposed new facility has been requested, the current amount of the husband's indebtedness, the amount of his current overdraft facility, and the amount and terms of any new facility.  If the bank's request for security arose from a written application by the husband for a facility, a copy of the application should be sent to the solicitor.  The bank will, of course, need first to obtain the consent of its customer to this circulation of confidential information.  If this consent is not forthcoming the transaction will not be able to proceed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;Exceptionally there may be a case where the bank believes or suspects that the wife has been misled by her husband or is not entering into the transaction of her own free will.  If such a case occurs the bank must inform the wife's solicitors of the facts giving rise to its belief or suspicion.</p>
<p>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;The bank should in every case obtain from the wife's solicitor a written confirmation to the effect mentioned above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80. These steps will be applicable to future transactions.  In respect of past transactions, the bank will ordinarily be regarded as having discharged its obligations if a solicitor who was acting for the wife in the transaction gave the bank confirmation to the effect that he had brought home to the wife the risks she was running by standing as surety.</p>
<i><p>The creditor's disclosure obligation</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81. It is a well-established principle that, stated shortly, a creditor is obliged to disclose to a guarantor any unusual feature of the contract between the creditor and the debtor which makes it materially different in a potentially disadvantageous respect from what the guarantor might naturally expect.  The precise ambit of this disclosure obligation remains unclear.  A useful summary of the authorities appears in <i>O'Donovan and Phillips on the Modern Contract of Guarantee</i>, 3rd ed (1996), at pp 122-130.  It is not necessary to pursue these difficult matters in this case.  It is sufficient for me to say that, contrary to submissions made, the need to provide protection for wives who are standing as sureties does not point to a need to re-visit the scope of this disclosure principle.  Wives require a different form of protection.  They need a full and clear explanation of the risks involved.  Typically, the risks will be risks any surety would expect.  The protection needed by wives differs from, and goes beyond, the disclosure of information.  The <i>O'Brien</i> principle is intended to provide this protection.<i></i></p><i>
</i>
<i><p>A wider principle</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82. Before turning to the particular cases I must make a general comment on the <i>O'Brien</i> principle.  As noted by Professor Peter Birks QC, the decision in <i>O'Brien </i>has to be seen as the progenitor of a wider principle: see 'The Burden on the Bank', in Restitution and Banking Law (ed Rose, 1998), at p 195.  This calls for explanation.  In the <i>O'Brien </i>case the House was concerned with formulating a fair and practical solution to problems occurring when a creditor obtains a security from a guarantor whose sexual relationship with the debtor gives rise to a heightened risk of undue influence.  But the law does not regard sexual relationships as standing in some special category of their own so far as undue influence is concerned.  Sexual relationships are no more than one type of relationship in which an individual may acquire influence over another individual.  The <i>O'Brien</i> decision cannot sensibly be regarded as confined to sexual relationships, although these are likely to be its main field of application at present.  What is appropriate for sexual relationships ought, in principle, to be appropriate also for other relationships where trust and confidence are likely to exist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83. The courts have already recognised this.  Further application, or development, of the <i>O'Brien</i> principle has already taken place.  In <i>Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland NV v Burch</i> [1997]  1 All ER 144 the same principle was applied where the relationship was employer and employee.  Miss Burch was a junior employee in a company.  She was neither a shareholder nor a director.  She provided security to the bank for the company's overdraft.  She entered into a guarantee of unlimited amount, and gave the bank a second charge over her flat.  Nourse LJ, at p 146, said the relationship 'may broadly be said to fall under [<i>O'Brien</i>]'.  The Court of Appeal held that the bank was put on inquiry.  It knew the facts from which the existence of a relationship of trust and confidence between Miss Burch and Mr Pelosi, the owner of the company, could be inferred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84. The crucially important question raised by this wider application of the <i>O'Brien</i> principle concerns the circumstances which will put a bank on inquiry.  A bank is put on inquiry whenever a wife stands as surety for her husband's debts.  It is sufficient that the bank knows of the husband-wife relationship.  That bare fact is enough.  The bank must then take reasonable steps to bring home to the wife the risks involved.  What, then, of other relationships where there is an increased risk of undue influence, such as parent and child?  Is it enough that the bank knows of the relationship?  For reasons already discussed in relation to husbands and wives, a bank cannot be expected to probe the emotional relationship between two individuals, whoever they may be.  Nor is it desirable that a bank should attempt this.  Take the case where a father puts forward his daughter as a surety for his business overdraft.  A bank should not be called upon to evaluate highly personal matters such as the degree of trust and confidence existing between the father and his daughter, with the bank put on inquiry in one case and not in another.  As with wives, so with daughters, whether a bank is put on inquiry should not depend on the degree of trust and confidence the particular daughter places in her father in relation to financial matters.  Moreover, as with wives, so with other relationships, the test of what puts a bank on inquiry should be simple, clear and easy to apply in widely varying circumstances.  This suggests that, in the case of a father and daughter, knowledge by the bank of the relationship of father and daughter should suffice to put the bank on inquiry.  When the bank knows of the relationship, it must then take reasonable steps to ensure the daughter knows what she is letting herself into.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85. The relationship of parent and child is one of the relationships where the law irrebuttably presumes the existence of trust and confidence.  Rightly, this has already been rejected as the boundary of the <i>O'Brien</i> principle.  <i>O'Brien</i> was a husband-wife case.  The responsibilities of creditors were enunciated in a case where the law makes no presumption of the existence of trust and confidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86. But the law cannot stop at this point, with banks on inquiry only in cases where the debtor and guarantor have a sexual relationship or the relationship is one where the law presumes the existence of trust and confidence.  That would be an arbitrary boundary, and the law has already moved beyond this, in the decision in <i>Burch</i>.<i>  </i>As noted earlier, the reality of life is that relationships in which undue influence can be exercised are infinitely various.  They cannot be exhaustively defined.  Nor is it possible to produce a comprehensive list of relationships where there is a substantial risk of the exercise of undue influence, all others being excluded from the ambit of the <i>O'Brien</i> principle.  Human affairs do not lend themselves to categorisations of this sort.  The older generation of a family may exercise undue influence over a younger member, as in parent-child cases such as <i>Bainbrigge v Browne</i>, 18 Ch D 188 and <i>Powell v Powell</i> [1900]  1 Ch 243.  Sometimes it is the other way round, as with a nephew and his elderly aunt in <i>Inche Noriah v Shaik Allie Bin Omar</i> [1929]  AC 127.  An employer may take advantage of his employee, as in<i> Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland NV v Burch</i> [1997]  1 All ER 144.  But it may be the other way round, with an employee taking advantage of her employer, as happened with the secretary-companion and her elderly employer in <i>In re Craig, Decd</i> [1971]  Ch 95.  The list could go on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87. These considerations point forcibly to the conclusion that there is no rational cut-off point, with certain types of relationship being susceptible to the <i>O'Brien</i> principle and others not.  Further, if a bank is not to be required to evaluate the extent to which its customer has influence over a proposed guarantor, the only practical way forward is to regard banks as 'put on inquiry' in every case where the relationship between the surety and the debtor is non-commercial.  The creditor must always take reasonable steps to bring home to the individual guarantor the risks he is running by standing as surety.  As a measure of protection, this is valuable.  But, in all conscience, it is a modest burden for banks and other lenders.  It is no more than is reasonably to be expected of a creditor who is taking a guarantee from an individual.  If the bank or other creditor does not take these steps, it is deemed to have notice of any claim the guarantor may have that the transaction was procured by undue influence or misrepresentation on the part of the debtor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88. Different considerations apply where the relationship between the debtor and guarantor is commercial, as where a guarantor is being paid a fee, or a company is guaranteeing the debts of another company in the same group.  Those engaged in business can be regarded as capable of looking after themselves and understanding the risks involved in the giving of guarantees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89. By the decisions of this House in <i>O'Brien</i> and the Court of Appeal in <i>Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland NV v Burch</i> [1997]  1 All ER 144, English law has taken its first strides in the development of some such general principle.  It is a workable principle.  It is also simple, coherent and eminently desirable.  I venture to think this is the way the law is moving, and should continue to move.  Equity, it is said, is not past the age of child-bearing.  In the present context the equitable concept of being 'put on inquiry' is the parent of a principle of general application, a principle which imposes no more than a modest obligation on banks and other creditors.  The existence of this obligation in all non-commercial cases does not go beyond the reasonable requirements of the present times.  In future, banks and other creditors should regulate their affairs accordingly.</p>
<i><p>The particular cases</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90. I have had the advantage of reading in draft a copy of the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Scott of Foscote.  He has summarised the facts in the eight appeals.  My views on the particular cases are as follows.<i></i></p><i>
</i>
<i><p>(1) Midland Bank Plc v Wallace </p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I would allow this appeal.  The bank was put on inquiry, because this was a case of a wife standing as surety for her husband's debts.  As the evidence stands at present, Mr Samson's participation in the transaction does not assist the bank.  He was not Mrs Wallace's solicitor.  Deficiencies in the advice given by a solicitor do not normally concern the bank.  That is the position where the solicitor is acting for the wife, or where the solicitor has been held out by the wife to the bank as her solicitor.  But where the solicitor was not acting for the wife, the bank is in the same position as any person who deals with another in the belief that the latter is acting on behalf of a third party principal when in truth he is not.  Leaving aside questions of ostensible authority or the like, the alleged principal is not bound or affected by the acts of such a stranger.  The remedy of the bank lies against the (unauthorised) 'agent'.  If the bank has suffered provable loss, it has a claim for damages for breach of implied warranty of authority.  This action should go to trial.</p>
<i></i><p><i>(2)</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Barclays Bank Plc v Harris</i></p><i>
</i><p>This is another interlocutory appeal, against an order striking out Mrs Harris' defence.  It is common ground that for striking out purposes Mrs Harris has an arguable case on undue influence.  The bank was put on inquiry, because Mrs Harris was standing as surety for the debts of the company, S T Harris (Powder Coatings Consultant) Ltd.  I consider Mrs Harris has an arguable case that Wragge &amp; Co never acted for her.  In this respect the case is similar to <i>Wallace</i>.  This case should go to trial.</p>

<i><p>(3) UCB Home Loans Corporation Ltd v Moore </p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is another interlocutory appeal.  For the reasons given by my noble and learned friend Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough, I would allow this appeal.</p>
<i><p>(4) Royal Bank of Scotland v Etridge, (5) National Westminster Bank Plc v Gill, (6) Barclays Bank Plc v Coleman, (7) Bank of Scotland v Bennett, and (8) Kenyon-Brown v Desmond Banks &amp; Co.</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Lord Scott that, for the reasons he gives, the appeals of Mrs Bennett and Desmond Banks &amp; Co should be allowed.  The appeals of Mrs Etridge, Mrs Gill and Mrs Coleman should be dismissed.</p>
<p><b>LORD CLYDE</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91. I have had the opportunity of reading in draft the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead and agree with it. I add a few observations of my own because of the importance of the appeals which we have heard. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92. I question the wisdom of the practice which has grown up, particularly since <i>Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA v Aboody</i> [1990]  1 QB 923 of attempting to make classifications of cases of undue influence.  That concept is in any event not easy to define.  It was observed in <i>Allcard v Skinner </i>(1887)  36 Ch D 145 that "no court has ever attempted to define undue influence" (Lindley LJ, at p 183).  It is something which can be more easily recognised when found than exhaustively analysed in the abstract. Correspondingly the attempt to build up classes or categories may lead to confusion.  The confusion is aggravated if the names used to identify the classes do not bear their actual meaning.  Thus on the face of it a division into cases of "actual" and "presumed" undue influence appears illogical.  It appears to confuse definition and proof.  There is also room for uncertainty whether the presumption is of the existence of an influence or of its quality as being undue.  I would also dispute the utility of the further sophistication of subdividing "presumed undue influence" into further categories.  All these classifications to my mind add mystery rather than illumination. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93. There is a considerable variety in the particular methods by which undue influence may be brought to bear on the grantor of a deed.  They include cases of coercion, domination, victimisation and all the insidious techniques of persuasion.  Certainly it can be recognised that in the case of certain relationships it will be relatively easier to establish that undue influence has been at work than in other cases where that sinister conclusion is not necessarily to be drawn with such ease.  English law has identified certain relationships where the conclusion can prima facie be drawn so easily as to establish a presumption of undue influence.  But this is simply a matter of evidence and proof.  In other cases the grantor of the deed will require to fortify the case by evidence, for example, of the pressure which was unfairly applied by the stronger party to the relationship, or the abuse of a trusting and confidential relationship resulting in for the one party a disadvantage and for the other a collateral benefit beyond what might be expected from the relationship of the parties.  At the end of the day, after trial, there will either be proof of undue influence or that proof will fail.  and it will be found that there was no undue influence.  In the former case, whatever the relationship of the parties and however the influence was exerted, there will be found to have been an actual case of undue influence.  In the latter there will be none.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94. The second point relates to the steps which were suggested in  <i>Barclays Bank plc v O'Brien</i> [1994]  1 AC 180 as being appropriate for the lender to escape constructive notice of the wrongdoing in question.  I agree that what was suggested in the case was not intended to be prescriptive.  So far as past cases were concerned it was said (Lord Browne-Wilkinson, at p 196) that the creditor "can reasonably be expected to take steps to bring home to the wife the risk she is running by standing as surety and to advise her to take independent advice".  Those two courses of action were reflected in the Scottish case of <i>Smith v Bank of Scotland</i> 1997  SC(HL) 110, 122 by the suggestion which I made in relation to the corresponding situation under Scots law that "it would be sufficient for the creditor to warn the potential cautioner of the consequences of entering into the proposed cautionary obligation and to advise him or her to take independent advice".  That statement echoed what was understood to be the existing practice recognised by banks and building societies and it seemed to me that steps of that kind ought to be enough to enable the creditor to counter any allegation of bad faith.  But Lord Browne-Wilkinson proposed more stringent requirements for the avoidance of constructive notice in England for the future.  These were that the creditor should insist</p>
<p></p><ul>"that the wife attend a private meeting (in the absence of the husband) with a representative of the creditor at which she is told of the extent of her liability as surety, warned of the risk she is running and urged to take independent legal advice" (see p 196). <p></p></ul>
<p>He also recognised, at p 197, that there might be exceptional cases where undue influence was not simply possible but was probable and advised that in such cases the "the creditor to be safe will have to insist that the wife is separately advised".</p>
