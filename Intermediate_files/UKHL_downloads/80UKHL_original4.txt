<p align="right"><a href="norris-3.htm">(back to preceding text)</a></p>

<p class="para">76.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is Mr Norris’s central contention that in enacting section 137 Parliament deliberately eschewed the approach adopted in the 1989 Act and instead chose language mirroring the 1967 Act.  The 1967 Act spoke of “the act or omission constituting the offence", the 2003 Act of “an offence constituted by the conduct".  Both Acts, he submits, focus on that part of the conduct which constitutes the foreign offence, not the other parts which are extraneous to it but which may be alleged in documents supporting the extradition request: the court can have regard only to such conduct as would prove the essential ingredients of the foreign offence, nothing more.  In short, Mr Norris contends for the offence test, not the conduct test.</p>
<p class="para">77.&nbsp;&nbsp;In support of this approach Mr Norris points to a fundamental (and somewhat controversial) feature of the 2003 Act regime, the abolition in relation to designated territories of the requirement to establish even a prima facie case against the accused.  If, therefore, the wider conduct test is adopted, a mere allegation of conduct sufficient to constitute ingredient D (taking Lord Bridge’s illustration in <i>Aronson</i>), the ingredient of dishonesty in the present case, would suffice even though no prima facie case, let alone proof, of it will ever be required in either country—even though, indeed, the prosecution might theoretically choose to advance an allegation, say of fraud or dishonesty, which perhaps a grand jury in the USA have considered and rejected.  If, of course, the offence test were adopted, at least that allegation would  have to be proved in the foreign state before a conviction could be secured.</p>
<p class="para">78.&nbsp;&nbsp;Plainly these are serious arguments but so too are the arguments the other way.  Prominent amongst these is the unlikelihood that Parliament, having legislated across the board in 1989 to adopt the conduct test, as earlier expounded by Lord Diplock, should then in 2003, when plainly intent on making the extradition process simpler rather than more difficult, have chosen instead to adopt the offence test.  The 2003 Act, it must be noted, adopts the same formula with regard to double criminality in Part 1 as in Part 2 (save only that in Part 1 the requirement is assumed rather than required to be satisfied in the case of European framework list offences).  For non-listed offences, sections 64(1)(a) and 64(3) are in materially identical terms to sections 137(1)(a) and 137(2).  Against the legislative background to the Act, it would be  surprising if the district judge, in deciding whether the conduct constitutes an extradition offence, has to consider in detail the elements of the foreign offence for which extradition is sought, and, indeed, such authorities as bear upon the question suggest that he does not.</p>
<p class="para">79.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Office of the King’s Prosecutor, Brussels v Cando Armas</i> [2006] 2 AC 1 concerned in part the requirement in section 65(2)(a) of the 2003 Act (section 65 rather than section 64 because it was a “conviction” case, not an “accusation” case) that “the conduct occurs in the category 1 territory and no part of it occurs in the United Kingdom".  Lord Bingham of Cornhill said (at p14):</p>
<p class="qt">“16. I would accept the submission of . . . the prosecutor that ‘the conduct’ in section 65 means the conduct complained of or relied on in the warrant.  Such a reading is consistent with the language and purpose of the Framework Decision, obviates the need for an undesirable inquiry into the niceties of a foreign law and is consistent, so far as that is relevant, with the earlier decision of the House in <i>In re</i> <i>Nielsen</i> . . .</p>
<p class="qt">17. . . . It is enough, under subsection (3)(a), if some of the conduct complained of or relied on occurred in the category 1 territory.”</p>
<p class="para">80.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Hope of Craighead similarly said (para 30 at p18):</p>
<p class="qt">“The judge need not concern himself with the criminal law of the requesting state when he is addressing the question whether the offence specified in the Part 1 warrant is an extradition offence.  But he does have to consider where the conduct which is alleged to constitute the offence took place.”</p>
<p class="para">Since some of the conduct complained of and relied on in the warrant had occurred in the United Kingdom, the section 65(2)(a) condition was found not to be satisfied (although Mr Norris fell to be extradited under section 65(3)).  </p>
<p class="para">81.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was because of the decision in <i>Cando Armas</i> that leading counsel for the appellants in <i>R</i> <i>(Bermingham and others) v Director of the Serious Fraud</i> <i>Office</i> [2007] QB 727 (the so-called “NatWest Three”) abandoned their submission “that there had to be a strict correspondence between the ingredients of the crime alleged in the request and an equivalent crime acknowledged by the law of England, if the former was to qualify as an extradition offence” (para 81).  Mr Norris argues that they were wrong to have done so.</p>
<p class="para">82.&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly by reference to <i>Cando Armas</i>, Auld LJ in the Divisional Court in the present case held (at para 126):</p>
<p class="qt">“In the case of the United States and Part 2 offences, the analogue of the warrant, is the request, whether or not it includes more than is required for prosecution of the offence indicated in the Part 2 territory.”</p>
<p class="para">83.&nbsp;&nbsp;A month after the Divisional Court’s judgment in the present case  the House decided <i>Dabas</i> <i>v High Court of Justice in Madrid, Spain</i> [2007]  2 AC 31.  This raised an issue under section 64(3)(c) of the Act on the basis that part of the conduct relied on by the respondent state in seeking the appellant’s extradition for trial, for conspiracy leading to the Madrid train bombings in March 2004, occurred before the equivalent English conduct of conspiring to support terrorism became an offence in February 2001.  Lord Hope of Craighead (with whose opinion on this issue each member of the Committee agreed) said (at p 52):</p>
<p class="qt">“47.  It is not obvious from the narrative of the circumstances set out in the arrest warrant . . . that the date when the relevant conspiracy is alleged to have begun was as early as ‘before the year 2000'.  The essence of the allegation is that the appellant was involved in a conspiracy which led up to the train bombings in Madrid on 11 March 2004.  Mention is made of the appellant’s activities during an earlier period, but this part of the narrative appears to have been included simply as background. </p>
<p class="qt">48.  In the light of this narrative I would have been willing to hold, had it been necessary to do so [it was in fact unnecessary since four members of the Committee concluded that the appellant’s conduct also constituted an extradition offence under the framework list provision], that throughout the period of the conduct which is said to constitute the offence in this case the requirement of double criminality was satisfied.  A narrative of events prior in date to the conduct relied on will not be objectionable if it is included merely in order to set the scene . . . [I]t is the conduct for which extradition is sought, not any narrative that may be included in the Part 1 warrant simply by way of background, that must satisfy the test of double criminality.”</p>
<p class="para">Lord Hope then (at paras 53 and 54) expressly reaffirmed what he had said in <i>Cando Armas</i>: that “the judge need not examine the text of the foreign law in order to decide whether the conditions set out in section 64(3) are satisfied.”</p>
<p class="para">84.&nbsp;&nbsp;The final judgment requiring mention in this connection is that of Sedley LJ in the Divisional Court in <i>Edwards v Government of the United States of America</i> [2007]  EWHC 1877 (Admin), [2007] All ER (D) 501 (Jul) which, in reliance principally upon para 48 of Lord Hope’s speech in <i>Dabas</i>, disagreed with the Divisional Court’s judgment in the present case—that “the analogue of the warrant is the request”—and continued:</p>
<p class="qt">“22. Here, as in <i>Dabas</i>, the question is what is ‘the conduct’ which has to amount to an extradition offence?  Is it the conduct asserted in the indictment or the conduct recounted as giving rise to it?  Consonantly with what Lord Hope said in terms in the last sentence at para 48 of <i>Dabas</i>, it seems to me that the policy and objects of the 2003 Act point clearly towards the former meaning.  The Act limits the requisite documentation, albeit leaving it open to requesting states to add more.  But if the evaluation of the request is not confined to the required materials, there is no apparent limit to what further documentation can be introduced, and a statutory process designed to be lean and schematic will become expansive and porous … . </p>
<p class="qt">24. I conclude that ‘the conduct’ referred to in section 137 is confined to the facts alleged in ‘the offence specified in the request', the phrase used in sections 70 and 78.  In a normal US case such as the present one this will limit the inquiry into dual criminality to, on the one hand, the indictment and any document incorporated by reference into it and, on the other, the criminal law of England and Wales.”</p>
<p class="para">85.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Norris unsurprisingly seeks to rely on <i>Edwards</i>; the respondent submits that it was wrongly decided.  As Mr Perry QC for the respondent points out, one of its difficulties is that it would require courts to conduct the very inquiry into foreign law which, in both <i>Cando Armas</i> and <i>Dabas</i>, the House firmly rejected.  In <i>Cando Armas</i>, moreover, Lord Bingham in terms approved the approach which was consistent with <i>Nielsen</i>—the very embodiment of the conduct test.  It seems impossible to escape the conclusion that the Divisional Court in <i>Edwards</i> misunderstood para 48 of Lord Hope’s speech in <i>Dabas</i>: the distinction being drawn there was between mere narrative background and the main conduct for which extradition was sought.  Lord Hope was not in that passage addressing or answering the question whether the conduct test or the offence test should apply under the 2003 Act, still less the question where to look for the description of the relevant conduct—whether, in other words, under Part 2 of the Act the analogue of the warrant is the request (as Auld LJ concluded) or “the indictment and any document incorporated by reference into it” (as Sedley LJ held).</p>
<p class="para">86.&nbsp;&nbsp;So much for the existing case law bearing on the double criminality test under the 2003 Act.  Taken as a whole it plainly favours the respondent.  Is the language of section 137 nevertheless, as Mr Norris submits, consistent only with the construction adopted by the majority in <i>Aronson</i> of the broadly similar language used in the 1967 Act?  At the very least, Mr Norris submits, there is ambiguity as to the meaning of section 137 and accordingly, as a criminal statute, it should bear the construction more favourable to the liberty of the subject—the approach favoured by each member of the majority in <i>Aronson</i> towards the 1967 Act.  Against this, however, there is telling authority the other way.  La Forest J, sitting in the Supreme Court of Canada, noted in <i>United States of America v McVey</i> [1992]  3 SCR 475, 513:</p>
<p class="qt">“Consistent with the general principle that extradition laws should be liberally construed so as to achieve the purposes of the Treaty, a much less technical approach to extradition warrants and to common law warrants has been adopted  …”</p>
<p class="para">Similarly, in <i>In re Ismail</i> [1999] 1 AC 320, 326-327, Lord Steyn said that “a broad and generous construction” should be given to extradition statutes “intended to serve the purpose of bringing to justice those accused of serious crimes.  There is a transnational interest in the achievement of this aim.”</p>
<p class="para">87.&nbsp;&nbsp;The language of section 137 is in our opinion consistent with either test.  Whether the conduct consists solely of those acts or omissions necessary to establish the foreign offence, or the accused’s conduct as it may have been more widely described in the request, both the foreign offence and the corresponding English offence would still be “constituted” by it (as required respectively by section 137(1)(a) and 137(2)(b)).  Which construction, therefore, should it be given?</p>
<p class="para">88.&nbsp;&nbsp;As noted in para 70 above, really nothing “startling” follows from adopting the wider construction.  On the contrary, it accords entirely with the underlying rationale of the double criminality rule: that a person’s liberty is not to be restricted as a consequence of offences not recognised as criminal by the requested state—the position of the notional co-accused contemplated in Lord Bridge’s illustration and, indeed, the position of Mr Norris himself, as we would hold.</p>
<p class="para">89.&nbsp;&nbsp;The wider construction furthermore avoids the need always to investigate the legal ingredients of the foreign offence, a problem long since identified as complicating and delaying the extradition process—see, for example, besides the passages cited above from <i>Cando Armas</i>  and <i>Dabas</i>, La Forest J’s judgment in <i>McVey</i> (at p 528):</p>
<p class="qt">“[T]o require evidence of foreign law beyond the documents now supplied with the requisition could cripple the operation of the extradition proceedings. . . . Flying witnesses in to engage in abstruse debates about legal issues arising in a legal system with which the judge is unfamiliar is a certain recipe for delay and confusion to no useful purpose, particularly if one contemplates the joys of translation and the entirely different structure of foreign systems of law.”</p>
<p class="para">90.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the wider construction would place the United Kingdom’s extradition law on the same footing as the law in most of the rest of the common law world.  The broad conduct approach—the examination of all the conduct on which the requesting state relies—is that almost universally followed.  To take just two examples: the United Nations’ “Model Treaty on Extradition", adopted by the General Assembly in 1991, by article 2 (b) stipulates that it shall not matter whether “under the laws of the Parties, the constituent elements of the offence differ, it being understood that the totality of the acts or omissions as presented by the requesting State shall be taken into account.”  Similarly, the 1997 Treaty between Australia and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region provides by article 3(3):</p>
<p class="qt">“For the purposes of this Article, in determining whether an offence is an offence punishable under the laws of both Parties the totality of the acts or omissions alleged against the person whose surrender is sought shall be taken into account without reference to the elements of the offence prescribed by the law of the requesting Party.”</p>
<p class="para">91.&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee has reached the conclusion that the wider construction should prevail.  In short, the conduct test should be applied consistently throughout the 2003 Act, the conduct relevant under Part 2 of the Act being that described in the documents constituting the request (the equivalent of the arrest warrant under Part 1), ignoring in both cases mere narrative background but taking account of such allegations as are relevant to the description of the corresponding United Kingdom offence.  Had Mr Norris’s appeal failed on the first issue the extradition order on count 1 would have stood.</p>
<p class="paraleft">B. COUNTS 2-4</p>
<p class="paraleft">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The construction and application of section 137(2)(b) of the </i></p><i>
<p class="paraleft">&nbsp;&nbsp;2003 Act</p>
</i>
<p class="para">92.&nbsp;&nbsp;Counts 2 to 4 on the indictment allege various forms of obstruction of justice, all relating to the criminal investigation into price fixing in the carbon products industry which was being conducted by the grand jury in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.  On behalf of Mr Norris, Mr Sumption QC contended that, in terms of section 137(2)(b) of the 2003 Act, these are not extradition offences since the conduct would not have constituted an offence under English law if it had occurred in England.  In other words, it would not have been an offence under English law for Mr Norris to conspire in England to obstruct the criminal investigation into price fixing being carried out by the grand jury in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p class="para">93.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sumption sought support for that approach in <i>R v Secretary of State for the Home</i> <i>Department, Ex p Norgren</i> [2000] QB 817.  The case concerned an extradition request for offences of insider dealing on the New York and Pacific Stock Exchanges.  One of the contentions for Mr Norgren was that, if that course of conduct had occurred in England, it would not have constituted offences contrary to the Company Securities (Insider Dealing) Act 1985.  Although the Divisional Court did not need to decide the point, Lord Bingham CJ said, at p 835A-C:</p>
<p class="qt">“Having heard the competing contentions of the parties, and helpful submissions on behalf of the United States Government, we have inevitably formed tentative views on the likely outcome if the matter were to proceed before the magistrate.  Since the Act of 1985 proscribes only insider dealing in listed securities on the London Stock Exchange, it would appear doubtful whether the applicant’s dealing on the New York and Pacific Stock Exchanges, even if conducted in England and Wales, would constitute a crime punishable under the law of this country.  But it may be that for present purposes the Act of 1985 is to be read as having a broader and less domestic application.”</p>
<p class="para">94.&nbsp;&nbsp;An exercise in transposition has been an essential part of the law since the enactment of section 10 of the Extradition Act 1870 (quoted at para 66 above).  It is the means by which Parliament gives effect to a policy that, before there can be extradition, there should have been criminality according to both the law of the requesting state and English law.  As Mr Perry emphasised, the proper interpretation of the current provision in section 137(2)(b) of the 2003 Act is essential to the smooth functioning of the system of extradition under Part 2.</p>
<p class="para">95.&nbsp;&nbsp;The most recent and authoritative guidance on the way that section 10 of the 1870 Act was to be applied is to be found in the opinion of Lord Millett in <i>R (Al Fawwaz)</i> <i>v Governor of  Brixton Prison</i> [2002] 1 AC 556.  The United States sought the extradition of Al Fawwaz on charges of conspiring to murder American citizens, officials, diplomats and others, both in the United States and elsewhere.  He had never been in the United States.  Lord Millett explained, at p 596, paras 109-110:</p>
<p class="qt">“Given that the court is concerned with an extradition case, the crime will not have been committed in England but (normally) in the requesting state.  So the test is applied by substituting England for the requesting state wherever the name of the requesting state appears in the indictment.  But no more should be changed than is necessary to give effect to the fact that the court is dealing with an extradition case and not a domestic one.  The word ‘mutandis’ is an essential element in the concept; the court should not hypothesise more than necessary.</p>
<p class="qt">110.  The one point to which I would draw attention is that it is not sufficient to substitute England for the territory of the requesting state wherever that is mentioned in the indictment.  It is necessary to effect an appropriate substitution for every circumstance connected with the requesting state on which the jurisdiction is founded.  In the present case the applicants are accused, not merely of conspiring to murder persons abroad (who happen to be Americans), but of conspiring to murder persons unknown because they were Americans.  In political terms, what is alleged is a conspiracy entered into abroad to wage war on the United States by killing its citizens, including its diplomats and other internationally protected persons, at home and abroad.  Translating this into legal terms and transposing it for the purpose of seeing whether such conduct would constitute a crime ‘in England or within English jurisdiction', the charges must be considered as if they alleged a conspiracy entered into abroad to kill British subjects, including internationally protected persons, at home or abroad.”</p>
<p class="paraleft">Changing all those elements which required to be changed, Lord Millett translated the American charge of conspiracy abroad to kill United States citizens, including internationally protected persons, at home or abroad, into a charge of conspiracy abroad to kill British citizens, including internationally protected persons, at home or abroad.</p>
<p class="para">96.&nbsp;&nbsp;Support for that approach is to be found, over a century ago, in the decision of Duff J in the Canadian case, <i>Re Collins (No 3)</i> (1905) 10 CCC 80.  The United States sought the extradition of Collins on a charge of perjury which was alleged to have taken place when he made an affidavit containing a wilfully false statement of fact in the course of an action of alimony in California.  A whole host of technical points against the proposed extradition were raised and rejected.  The key argument was to this effect.  Under section 2(b) of the Canadian Extradition Act, the extradition crime might mean any crime, “which, if committed in Canada, or within Canadian jurisdiction, would be one of the crimes described in the first schedule” to the Act.  The judge was satisfied that perjury was indeed a crime described in that schedule.  According to the Californian Penal Code, the offence of perjury was committed by someone who lied after having taken an oath “that he will testify, declare, depose, or certify truly before any competent tribunal, officer, or person ...”  There was nothing, however, in the law of Canada, which made it perjury to make a false deposition before any competent <i>Californian</i> tribunal or officer.  Therefore, it was said, the crime for which Collins’ extradition was sought was not a crime which, if committed in Canada, would be one of the crimes described in the first schedule to the Extradition Act.  It followed that it was not an “extradition crime” within the meaning of section 2(b) of that Act.</p>
<p class="para">97.&nbsp;&nbsp;Duff J rejected that argument.  On the basis that the approach to be applied was to conceive the accused, and the acts of the accused, transported to Canada, he said, at pp 100-101:</p>
<p class="qt">“It is contended by the applicant that on these authorities to which I have referred, you have to go through the conduct upon which the criminal charge is based, and you have to come to the conclusion that his identical acts, if done in this country, would have constituted a crime in accordance with the law of Canada.  Taken with due qualifications, we need not quarrel with that; but it is obvious from the outset that there must be some qualification.  In the first place, the treaty itself, which, after all, is the controlling document in the case, speaks not of the acts of the accused, but of the evidence of ‘criminality,’ and it seems to me that the fair and natural way to apply that is this - you are to fasten your attention not upon the adventitious circumstances connected with the conduct of the accused, but upon the essence of his acts, in their bearing upon the charge in question.  And if you find that his acts so regarded furnish the component elements of the imputed offence according to the law of this country, then that requirement of the treaty is complied with.  To illustrate, I apprehend that in the case of perjury, the accused cannot be heard to say, ‘the oath on which the charge is based was administered by A.B., an officer who had no authority to administer oaths in Canada (although duly authorized in the place where the oath was taken); and, consequently, if I had done here the identical thing I did there (viz.:  the taking of an oath before A.B.), perjury could not have been successfully charged against me.’  The substance of the criminality charged against the accused is not that he took a false oath before A.B, but that he took a false oath before an officer who was authorized to administer the oath.  Any other view would, I conceive, simply make nonsense of the treaty.”</p>
<p class="para">Another passage from Duff J’s judgment is also helpful.  Proceeding again on the same basis, he said, at p 103:</p>
<p class="qt">“... if you are to conceive the accused as pursuing the conduct in question in this country, then along with him you are to transplant his environment; and that environment must, I apprehend, include, so far as relevant, the local institutions of the demanding country, the laws effecting the legal powers and rights, and fixing the legal character of the acts of the persons concerned, always excepting, of course, the law supplying the definition of the crime which is charged.”</p>
<p class="paraleft">While Duff J referred specifically to the terms of the particular extradition treaty between the United States and Canada, his reasoning has been adopted in subsequent cases in relation to the Canadian extradition legislation - for instance, by Sharpe JA giving the opinion of the Court of Appeal of Ontario in <i>Germany v</i> <i>Schreiber</i> (2006) 206 CCC (3rd) 339, 361, at para 42.</p>
<p class="para">98.&nbsp;&nbsp;In Australia the same general approach can be seen in the judgment of Gibbs CJ, and Wilson and Dawson JJ in <i>Riley v Commonwealth of Australia</i> (1985) 159 CLR 1.  The definition of “extradition offence” in the relevant Australian extradition statute required inter alia that “any equivalent act or omission, would, if it took place in” the relevant part of Australia, “constitute an offence against the law in force in that part of Australia....”  Their Honours said, at p 8:</p>
<p class="qt">“The reference in the sub-section to an ‘equivalent act or omission’ is to an act or omission which would be the same as the act or omission which is an element of the offence against the law of the foreign state were it not for the fact that the law of the foreign state requires (whether or not for reasons of jurisdiction) that the act or omission should have occurred <i>in or in relation to some place or thing in or connected with the foreign state. </i> For example, the act of importing narcotics into Australia is an ‘equivalent act’ to the act of importing narcotics into the United States” (emphasis added).</p>
