<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it needs to be stressed that the facts in <i>Connors</i> were entirely different from those in <i>Qazi</i>.  There was no need in <i>Qazi's </i>case to give special consideration to the needs of gypsies and their different lifestyles, and the background to the local authority's decision to seek a possession order was that a valid notice to quit had been served on the local authority by one of the tenants of the tenancy.  <i>Connors </i>does not resolve the problem as to how the need to give special consideration to cases of that kind where the law itself is defective - and I do not confine this category to gypsies - can be fitted in to the domestic system which requires that orders for possession must be sought in the county court.  So I do not think that the decision in <i>Connors</i> is incompatible with the view of the majority in <i>Qazi</i> that there is no need for a review of the issues raised by article 8(2) to be conducted in the county court if the case is of a type where the law itself provides the answer, as in that situation a merits review would be a pointless exercise.  In such a case the article 8 defence, if raised, should simply be struck out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons I do not think that the reasoning of the majority in <i>Qazi </i>should be departed from.  But I accept that the reasoning needs to be clarified.  In the light of the subsequent Strasbourg cases I would now place greater emphasis on the need for the court to provide a remedy in those special cases of a kind not considered in <i>Qazi</i> where it is seriously arguable that the right to possession which is afforded by domestic law violates the Convention right.  Lord Millett suggested in para 109 of his speech in <i>Qazi </i>that judicial review would provide the appropriate remedy.  On balance I think that it would be better for the issue to be dealt with by way of defence to the proceedings in the county court, to the extent that the limits on the jurisdiction of that court permit it to do so: see paras 86, 110.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114.&nbsp;&nbsp;There may, however, be cases like <i>Connors </i>where the incompatibility with the article 8 Convention right lies in primary legislation which the county court is being asked to apply to the case by the public authority: see para 86, above.  In such a case it would be open to the High Court to make a declaration of incompatibility, if it was not possible to read or give effect to the legislation under section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998 in a way which was compatible with the Convention right.  But the legislation would nevertheless still have to be enforced, unless the decision of the public authority to seek to enforce it when faced with that incompatibility could be said, when judicially reviewed, to be arbitrary, unreasonable or disproportionate.  The decision could not be held in the county court to be an unlawful act within the meaning of section 6 of the 1998 Act: see section 6(2)(b).  The fact that the question of incompatibility that was raised in <i>Connors </i>was not capable, under the domestic system, of being dealt with effectively in the county court because of the limits on its jurisdiction reinforces, rather than detracts from, the proposition that a defence which is raised in that court under article 8 should be struck out unless the legislation can be read and given effect in a way that is compatible or it raises an issue as to its incompatibility that ought to be considered in the High Court.</p>
<i><p><i>Conclusion in the Lambeth appeal</i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reasons given by my noble and learned friend Lord Scott of Foscote I would reject the arguments which Mr Luba advanced on the private law issue.  The appellants' right to continue in occupation of premises over which they never had any rights granted to them by the landowner was brought to an end by the operation of law when Lambeth gave notice terminating the leases to LQHT.  They have no right to remain there indefinitely, which would be the effect of denying to Lambeth its unqualified right to possession of the premises on the ground that to give effect to this right would be incompatible with article 8.  Their interests will be sufficiently protected by the fulfilment of the formal requirements for the eviction, which demand proof by the public authority landowner of its entitlement to obtain an order for possession in the exercise of its property rights.  I would dismiss this appeal.</p>
<i><p><i></i></p>
<p><i>Conclusion in the Leeds appeal</i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116.&nbsp;&nbsp;These appellants had been present on the recreation ground for only two days when proceedings were taken against them for the making of the possession order.  Unlike the applicant and his family in <i>Connors</i>, they never had any right of any kind to make their home there.  They were trespassers.  They are, of course, gypsies who are in a vulnerable position as a minority.  But they had not established the links with the place which they were occupying that were needed for it to be considered as their home within the meaning of article 8(1).  Even if it was, such consideration as ought to be given to their needs and their different lifestyle under article 8(2) is met, on the facts of their case, by requiring proof by the public authority of its entitlement as the owner of the land to obtain an order for possession in the exercise of its property rights.  I would dismiss this appeal also.</p>
<p><b>LORD SCOTT OF FOSCOTE</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<i><p>Introduction</p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117.&nbsp;&nbsp;An Appellate Committee of seven has heard two appeals together in each of which the main issue for decision is the scope that should be given to article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118.&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 8, entitled "Right to respect for private and family life", provides that</p>
<p></p><ul>"1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence."<p></p></ul>
<p>and, in 8(2), imposes a bar on interference by a public authority with that right:</p>
<p></p><ul>"2.&nbsp;&nbsp;There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119.&nbsp;&nbsp;The article 8(1) "right to respect" covers, potentially, a very wide spectrum of personal interests (see Lester &amp; Pannick, Human Rights Law and Practice, 2nd ed (2004), para 4.8.2), but these appeals are concerned only with the article 8 right of a person to respect for his home.  It is contended by the appellants, against whom possession orders have been made, that whenever an owner of land takes legal proceedings to recover possession of the land from an occupier who has his home on the land, the action taken by the owner constitutes, <i>prima facie</i>, an interference with the occupier's right to respect for his home, and, consequently, that an order for possession cannot properly be made unless the article 8(2) conditions are satisfied.  It may be, of course, that the occupier has some ground under ordinary domestic law for resisting the possession application.  In that case reliance by the occupier on article 8 rights will be unnecessary.  But in a case in which the occupier is a trespasser with no right under ordinary domestic law to resist the landowner's possession application, article 8(2), it is said, provides a further ground for resistance and obliges the judge who hears the application to be satisfied, before making an order for possession, that the order is necessary and proportionate in furthering one or other of the legitimate aims referred to in article 8(2).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Harrow London Borough Council v Qazi</i> [2004]  1 AC 983 this House by a majority rejected that contention and held that "contractual and proprietary rights to possession cannot be defeated by a defence based on article 8" (per Lord Hope of Craighead at para 84).  If that is right, both these appeals must fail.  But the issue has come back before the House, this time with an Appellate Committee of seven, because in <i>Connors v United Kingdom</i> [2004]  40 EHRR 189 the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg held that the eviction of a gypsy family and their caravan from a local authority gypsy site on which the family had no contractual or proprietary right to remain constituted a violation of their article 8 right to respect for their home.  It is submitted that the decisions in the <i>Qazi </i>case and the <i>Connors </i>case are irreconcilable and your Lordships are asked to follow the latter case, reverse the former case, and hold that the possession orders made against the appellants violated their article 8 rights.  The main issue for your Lordships is whether or not to accede to that submission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121.&nbsp;&nbsp;In both the cases now before the House the lower courts held themselves bound to follow <i>Qazi </i>notwithstanding the later decision of the Strasbourg Court.  The question has been raised whether the requirement imposed by section 2(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998, that a domestic court determining a question which has arisen in connection with a Convention right must take into account "any judgment, decision, declaration or advisory opinion" of the Strasbourg court, relieved the domestic courts of their obligation to follow the prior ruling of your Lordships in <i>Qazi.  </i>This, too, is an important issue regardless of whether on these appeals your Lordships conclude that the <i>Connors </i>decision requires the conclusion that the <i>Qazi </i>ruling was wrong.  On both these two important issues the First Secretary of State has intervened and, through Mr Philip Sales, has assisted your Lordships with written and oral submissions.  As to the issue of precedent, I am in complete agreement with what my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill has said in paras 40 to 45 of his opinion and to which there is nothing that I can usefully add.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, however, there is a domestic private law issue which arises in the <i>Lambeth </i>appeal.  The<i> </i>appellants contend that they were entitled to be treated by Lambeth Borough Council ("Lambeth") as tenants, not as trespassers.  If that is right, it is common ground that the tenancies under which they say they are entitled to occupy the properties in question were never terminated and the possession orders made against them must be set aside.  It is convenient to deal with this private law issue before grappling with the article 8 issue.  First, however, I should refer to the essential facts of the two cases.</p>
<i><p>The facts in the Leeds case</p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appellants are the Maloney family.  There are five of them.  They are travellers, whose home is in one or more caravans, often on the move from one place to another.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;124.&nbsp;&nbsp;The respondent is Leeds City Council ("Leeds").  Leeds is the owner of a recreation ground at Spinkwell Lane in Leeds.  On or about 24 May 2004 a number of travellers with their caravans entered the recreation ground and parked their caravans there.  This was without Leeds' permission.  After a few days the first group of travellers moved on, but others took their place.  On 13 June 2004 the Maloneys moved on to the recreation ground.  Two days later, on 15 June, Leeds commenced proceedings in the Leeds County Court for possession of the recreation ground.  The particulars of claim said that the travellers were trespassers and refused to vacate the recreation ground.  24 June 2004 was the return date specified on the claim form.  The Maloney family were the only occupiers of the recreation ground to attend court on that date and contest the possession application.  They were formally joined as defendants.  The case was adjourned to be heard on 18 October.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125.&nbsp;&nbsp;Leeds' claim to possession was based on its ownership of the recreation ground which was not in dispute.  Nor was it in dispute that the Maloneys were trespassers who had entered onto and remained on the land without any licence or consent from Leeds.  They sought to defend by relying on article 8 and by contending that Leeds was in breach of its statutory obligations to provide suitable sites where gypsies could park their caravans.  They said, also, that their personal circumstances were "exceptional" in that several members of the family suffered from medical and psychiatric problems, three members of the family were school age children and in the twelve months preceding their entry onto the recreation ground the family had been evicted or forced to move under threat of eviction more than fifty times.  Leeds responded by notifying the family that their status as unintentionally homeless and in priority need was accepted and by accepting a duty to help them obtain accommodation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;126.&nbsp;&nbsp;On 22 September the case was transferred to the High Court.  The article 8 issue was dealt with as a preliminary issue and, on 25 October, His Honour Judge Bush, sitting as a deputy judge of the High Court, following <i>Qazi</i>, held that contractual and proprietary rights to possession could not be defeated or qualified by reliance on article 8.  So he made an order for possession forthwith.  He refused a stay of execution but gave leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;127.&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the order for possession and the refusal of the stay of execution the Maloneys and their caravans left the recreation ground.  But, nonetheless, they gave notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal. The appeal seems to have been prosecuted simply for the purpose of ventilating the article 8 issue.  Important though this issue undoubtedly is, it seems to me a misuse both of public money and of court time to have prosecuted on appeal a point that had become moot.  No one has suggested that an appellate court would have had power to order Leeds to permit the Maloneys and their caravans to re-enter the recreation ground, trespassers again as they had been before.  No one has suggested that any monetary award should be made in favour of the Maloneys and against Leeds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;128.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a further point to be made on the facts of the Leeds case.  Whether the approach to article 8 taken in <i>Qazi </i>be right or wrong, it is common ground that the article does not give any protection to the occupation of land or a building unless the land or building is the occupier's "home".  If a traveller with his caravan enters as a trespasser upon a piece of land, by what process does the small area of land on which he happens to station his caravan and, presumably, a few square yards surrounding that small area of land, become identified as his "home"?  If a homeless person enters an unoccupied building, places his few possessions in one of the rooms and spends the next night or two there, does the room become his "home" in relation to which he is entitled to an article 8 "right of respect"?  The answer must, I think, be 'No'.  It is clearly possible for a trespasser to establish a "home" in property that belongs to someone else but whether and when he has done so must be matters of degree.  In <i>Buckley v United Kingdom</i> (1996)  23 EHRR 101  the Strasbourg commission, in para 63, said that</p>
<p></p><ul>"whether or not a particular habitation constitutes a 'home' which attracts the protection of article 8(1) will depend on the factual circumstances, namely, the existence of sufficient and continuous links."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;129.&nbsp;&nbsp;It could not, in my opinion, credibly be suggested that in the two days between the entry by the Maloneys on the recreation ground and the commencement by Leeds of possession proceedings the Maloneys had established "sufficient and continuous links" with the piece of land on which their caravan stood so as to constitute that singular piece of land their article 8(1) "home".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;130.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, the <i>Leeds</i> case was a very bad one to choose for the purpose of revisiting the correctness of <i>Qazi </i>since, whether the appellants' arguments be right or wrong, it is grotesque to suppose that the Maloneys could claim that the commencement by Leeds of possession proceedings to recover its recreation ground was an interference with their right to respect for a "home" that they had established on Leeds' land.  Be that as it may, the <i>Lambeth </i>case, by contrast, seems to me a very good test case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;131.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Judge Bush and the Court of Appeal, following <i>Qazi</i>, rejected the Maloneys' reliance on article 8.</p>
<i><p>The facts in the Lambeth case</p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;132.&nbsp;&nbsp;This case involves residential premises as opposed to open spaces on which caravans may be parked.  The properties in question are owned by Lambeth and are mostly in the area of Rushcroft Road London SW2.  They are, and have been for several years, occupied by the appellants and it is common ground that they constitute the appellants' homes for article 8 purposes.  The properties are part of Lambeth's "short life" housing stock, that is to say, they "are not in a condition suitable for normal housing use or capable of being rendered so suitable within finances available to Lambeth" (per Auld LJ at para 7 of his Court of Appeal judgment).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;133.&nbsp;&nbsp;London and Quadrant Housing Trust ("LQHT") is a charitable housing trust.  In 1979 Lambeth and LQHT came to an informal arrangement under which Lambeth licensed "short life" premises to LQHT for LQHT to make the premises available as accommodation for persons who were homeless but to whom Lambeth owed no statutory duty to arrange accommodation.  LQHT purported to grant licences to those whom it allowed into occupation.  Each of the appellants is a person who was allowed by LQHT into occupation of a Lambeth owned short life property under a purported licence granted by LQHT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;134.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1986 the informal arrangement between Lambeth and LQHT was replaced by a formal licence agreement which reflected the previous informal arrangements.  On 4 December 1995, however, Lambeth granted LQHT a ten year lease of the short life properties.  Clause 2 of the lease gave Lambeth the right to determine the ten year terms on the expiry of six months and one week's notice in writing to LQHT stating that Lambeth required possession of the demised properties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;135.&nbsp;&nbsp;On 24 June 1999 this House announced its decision in <i>Bruton v LQHT</i>, now reported in [2000] 1 AC 406.  The House held that the "licence" arrangement between LQHT and Mr Bruton, who had been allowed by LQHT into occupation of one of the properties that had been subject to the 1986 licence arrangements and, since 4 December 1995, subject to the 1995 lease, had created as between LQHT and Mr Bruton a relationship of landlord and tenant and not, as LQHT had supposed, a relationship of licensor and licensee.  It followed from the <i>Bruton</i> decision that each of the occupiers who had been allowed by LQHT to occupy properties on similar terms to those under which Mr Bruton occupied was a tenant of LQHT, not a licensee.  So each of the appellants in the <i>Lambeth </i>case was a tenant of LQHT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;136.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lambeth's response to the <i>Bruton</i> decision was to give notice to LQHT to terminate the 1995 lease.  The notice was given on 23 November 1999.  Lambeth then notified the occupiers that they were, or would soon become, trespassers vis-à-vis Lambeth and would have to leave their respective residences.  Six actions were commenced over the period between July 2000 and the end of that year.  In each action Lambeth claimed possession of a property of which LQHT had been the lessee under the 1995 lease.  The possession claim was made against the occupier of the property.  Each occupier, who had, as a result of <i>Bruton</i>, been a tenant of LQHT, responded by claiming to have become, on the determination of the 1995 lease, a tenant of Lambeth.  And, in addition, each occupier claimed that his article 8 right to respect for his home gave him an alternative defence to Lambeth's possession claim.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;137.&nbsp;&nbsp;Judge Roger Cooke, in the county court, and the Court of Appeal followed <i>Qazi</i> and rejected the occupiers' reliance on article 8.  As to the private law tenancy defence, that too was rejected both at first instance and on appeal.  A number of grounds in support of the tenancy defence that were relied on in the courts below were not relied on here.  Two grounds only have been relied on here and to those I now turn.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are the appellants tenants of Lambeth?</p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;138.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first of the two grounds relied on starts with the proposition that the grant of the 1995 lease by Lambeth to LQHT involved, by necessary implication, a surrender by LQHT of the licence it had been granted by Lambeth in 1986.  But, it is said, it was not open to LQHT to surrender the tenancies that, as <i>Bruton </i>had held, LQHT had granted to the appellants.  So, the argument proceeds, the appellants' <i>Bruton </i>tenancies must have survived the surrender by LQHT of its 1986 licence and have become, in the <i>scintilla temporis </i>between the surrender of the licence and the grant of the 1995 lease, tenancies held directly of Lambeth.  Lambeth thereby became, and has remained, bound by the tenancies.  The grant of the 1995 lease to LQHT interposed LQHT once more between Lambeth and the appellants but could not detract from the rights that the occupiers had already, in the <i>scintilla temporis</i>, acquired against Lambeth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;139.&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively, it is said that when Lambeth served notice on LQHT to determine the 1995 lease, the only effect of the notice, as between Lambeth and the appellants, was to clear away LQHT's intermediate estate.  The notice could not affect the appellants' rights under their tenancies which predated the grant of the 1995 lease.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;140.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purpose of both these arguments the appellants rely on the principle established by <i>Mellor v Watkins</i> (1874) LR 9 QB 400, namely, that where A has granted a tenancy to B and B has granted a sub-tenancy to C, a surrender by B to A of B's tenancy does not determine C's sub-tenancy but has the effect that A becomes C's landlord i.e. C holds his tenancy directly from A.  The principle was explained by Blackburn J at p 405:</p>
<p></p><ul>"[B] had no power to derogate from his landlord's [A's] rights.  Subject to those rights, he had a right to sub-let; and by doing that he could not prevent the landlord from giving a notice to quit in invitum, which would have determined both [B's] and the defendant's [C's] interest.  But no voluntary act on the part of [B], by which his own interest might be determined, could put an end to the interest which he had created in the defendant.  [B's] tenancy was put an end to as far as he was concerned, as between him and [A], by the voluntary surrender of his lease; but the defendant's [C's] tenancy … still remained, until determined by a proper notice to quit."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;141.&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why this principle is applicable where an intermediate tenant who has granted a sub-tenancy surrenders his tenancy to his landlord is that the sub-tenancy is a derivative interest created by the intermediate landlord out of the interest created by the head landlord.  The sub-tenancy belongs to the sub-tenant, not to the intermediate landlord.  It is an item of property that cannot be given away by someone to whom it does not belong.  It follows that it cannot be surrendered by the intermediate landlord.  A surrender is a consensual transaction between landlord and tenant.  It derives its effect from the terms of that transaction, not from the terms of the lease or tenancy that is surrendered.  The rights of a sub-tenant cannot be reduced or terminated by a transaction to which the sub-tenant is not a party (see <i>Barrett v Morgan</i> [2000] 2 AC 264 per Lord Millett at 271 D - E).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;142.&nbsp;&nbsp;If, on the other hand, the termination of the lease is provided for in the terms of the lease itself, e.g. a provision in the lease enabling the landlord or the tenant to give a week's notice terminating the lease, a sub-tenancy cannot, absent statutory intervention, survive the termination of the tenancy by such a notice.  The interest of the sub-tenant was created out of the term created by the lease and was, therefore, always subject to termination in accordance with the terms of the lease.  <i>Pennell v Payne</i> [1995]  QB 192 is a recent re-affirmation by a strong Court of Appeal of this principle and was approved by this House in <i>Barrett v Morgan </i>at 274B.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;143.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the <i>Mellor v Watkins </i>principle and the <i>Pennell v Payne </i>principle can have no relevance to a case in which a tenancy has been granted by someone without any estate in the land in question.  The <i>Bruton </i>tenancies are all of that character.  LQHT was, when it granted the <i>Bruton</i> tenancies, merely a licensee of Lambeth.  The tenancies were not granted by Lambeth and were not carved by LQHT out of any estate that Lambeth had granted to LQHT.  They were not derivative estates.  LQHT, prior to the grant of the 1995 lease, had no estate in the land.  It merely had a contractual licence.  In these circumstances the <i>Mellor v Watkins </i>point that the intermediate landlord cannot by a consensual surrender give away an interest that belongs to a sub-tenant has no substance.  True it is that LQHT could not by a surrender of its licence give away or prejudice the rights of the <i>Bruton </i>tenants against itself, LQHT.  But these rights never were enforceable against Lambeth.  Once the LQHT licence had been terminated the appellants were trespassers as against Lambeth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;144.&nbsp;&nbsp;An analogous situation would arise if a person not the owner of land but in adverse possession of it were to grant a tenancy of the land to another.  As between the grantor and grantee there would be a valid "non-estate" tenancy.  But unless and until the adverse possession had continued for the requisite 12 years the tenancy would not bind the true owner of the land.  An agreement by the adverse possessor to deliver up the land to the true owner would not affect the rights of his tenant against him, the landlord, but equally could not turn the tenant into the true owner's tenant or give the tenant any rights against the true owner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;145.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, too, the consensual termination of LQHT's contractual licence from Lambeth could not, in my opinion, turn the <i>Bruton</i> "non-estate" tenants into estate tenants of Lambeth.  I agree with Mr Luba, counsel for the appellants, that the <i>Bruton </i>tenants were not bound by a transaction between Lambeth and LQHT to which they were not parties. But the contended for conclusion that they therefore became tenants of Lambeth is a non-sequitor.  They never were <i>sub</i>-tenants holding, via a grant from LQHT, an interest created by Lambeth.  They were tenants of LQHT holding an interest created by LQHT.  The <i>Mellor v Watkins </i>principle has, in my opinion, no application to such a case.</p>
