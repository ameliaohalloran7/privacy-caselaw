<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;42. I agree that the appeal should be allowed on the terms stated in the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill with which I agree.  This appeal has not involved any disputed question of principle but has turned upon the application of established principles to the factual complexities of international multi-party disputes as exemplified by the facts of this particular case.  It is because we are exceptionally differing from the Court of Appeal on a question of discretion that I will briefly add my own reasons for doing so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;43. The case has two aspects.  The primary aspect is whether Mr Donohue should be granted the 'anti-suit' injunction for which he has asked the court to restrain proceedings in New York or anywhere else other than in London.  This ultimately turns upon the exercise of the court's discretion.  The Court of Appeal were undoubtedly right to conclude (at p.588) that, as the judge had made an error in holding that Armco Inc was not bound by the exclusive jurisdiction clause and had construed the clause as not having a wide enough scope to cover the disputes being raised in New York against Mr Donohue, this meant that his exercise of the discretion was wrongly based and the Court of Appeal were obliged to address the exercise of the discretion afresh.  By a majority, the Court of Appeal decided to grant the injunction in a limited form, limited to the first three defendants and excluding claims in relation to the 'collection agreement' and the trust funds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;44. The second aspect involves the subsidiary question whether Mr Rossi and Mr Stinson and their two companies, the four of the so-called 'PCCs', should be joined as plaintiffs in Mr Donohue's English action and, if so, likewise granted an injunction.  Formally, I agree that the question of joinder was dealt with by the majority of the Court of Appeal only after they had decided the primary question of whether Mr Donohue should be granted an injunction and that therefore it could be said, and the respondents so argued before this House, that the reversal of the Court of Appeal's decision on the second aspect would not invalidate their decision on the primary question.  This however faces the respondents and the Court of Appeal with a dilemma.  A central factor in the exercise of the discretion whether or not to grant any injunction was an assessment of what will be the position in New York and London if an injunction is granted.  (If no injunction is granted the position is simple: the proceedings in New York will continue and there will be no proceedings, anyway at this stage, in London.)  If the Court of Appeal have arrived at their decision of the primary question without fully carrying out that assessment they have been in error; they have left out of account a material factor.  On the other hand, if they did carry out that assessment but made an error in doing so, proceeding on the basis that the four PCCs on would have to be sued in London and not in New York, their exercise of the discretion is likewise open to attack.  I will therefore take the joinder issue first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;45. The London action was an action brought by Mr Donohue.  It was an action based upon the contractual right given by that clause to hold the other parties to that contract, and those claiming through them, to their promise only to sue Mr Donohue in England.  Mr Donohue was entitled to sue and serve the first three defendants in accordance with that clause.  Those defendants as they were bound to do acknowledged service and placed solicitors on the record to act on their behalf in the action.  The four PCCs (and CISHL and Wingfield, who are not relevant for this purpose) then applied to be joined in the action.  They simply relied upon the ground: "The basis of the application is that England is the most appropriate forum for the resolution of the disputes between the applicants and the defendants."  Such an application is made by issuing and serving a summons or "Application Notice" asking the court to order such joinder.  The summons/notice had to be served on the existing parties by sending the summons to their solicitors on the record.  No problem of service arises at that stage.  But in order to obtain an order (save by the consent of all parties) for their joinder the applicants have to make out a case for their joinder.  If they say, as did the four PCCs, that they should be joined because they too wish to claim 'anti-suit' injunctions against the existing defendants, they must be able to show that they could properly have brought proceedings against the defendants claiming that relief.  It is at this stage that their application became unsustainable.  The four PCCs had no procedural or contractual right to sue the defendants in the English jurisdiction; the English courts had no natural jurisdiction over the defendants.  The applicants could not satisfy the tests laid down in <i>Spiliada v Cansulex</i> [1987]  AC 460.  They could not show that London was clearly <i>the</i> appropriate forum (in contrast to New York) so as to justify them in commencing proceedings against the defendants in London (<i>Spiliada</i> at p.481).  Further, by the same token, they could not show that they had any viable claim to an anti-suit injunction against the defendants based upon the contention that the defendants' chosen forum, New York, was a <i>forum non conveniens</i> to such a degree that it was vexatious for them to have sued the PCC parties there (<i>SNI Aerospatiale v Lee</i> [1987]  AC 871).  New York was not an inappropriate forum (cf. <i>Spiliada</i>, p.477) nor could they show that they needed an injunction to protect proceedings in this country: <i>Airbus Industrie v Patel</i> [1999]  1 AC 119.  The application by these parties to be joined in the action was misconceived and should have been refused.  The majority of the Court of Appeal seem to have considered that the joinder and the grant of an anti-suit injunction to them followed from their decision to grant Mr Donohue an injunction.  This was not correct.  The position of a party who has an exclusive English jurisdiction clause is very different from one who does not.  The former has a contractual right to have the contract enforced.  The latter has no such right.  The former's right specifically to enforce his contract can only be displaced by strong reasons being shown by the opposite party why an injunction should <i>not</i> be granted.  The latter has to show that justice requires that he should be granted an injunction.  The Court of Appeal should have refused the application of the four PCCs to be joined and should likewise have refused their application for an injunction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;46. The Court of Appeal clearly had in mind that some proceedings would continue in New York, including some involving Mr Donohue himself.  The limitations which they included in the injunction both as regards parties and as regards subject matter demonstrate this.  The correct decision on the application of the four PCCs - that it should be dismissed - would have added to this prospect.  The true balance between New York and London, therefore, was not that which must have been visualised by the majority of the Court of Appeal.  The arguments in favour of refusing Mr Donohue the injunction for which he was applying would have been very materially strengthened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;47. The Court of Appeal rightly attached importance to the fact that in New York Mr Donohue would be subject to 'RICO' claims and a liability in triple damages.  To be protected against such a possibility was a legitimate concern of Mr Donohue to which a court should give weight in considering how to exercise its discretion.  Lord Grabiner QC for the defendants recognised this and met it by offering the undertaking to which my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham has already referred.  The offer of this undertaking does alter the position and indeed a court could have met the point by imposing equivalent terms upon the defendants as a condition of refusing to grant Mr Donohue an unqualified injunction.  This too has changed the balance between the two jurisdictions and should be taken into account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;48. Lord Grabiner took his argument one step further.  He acknowledged that some breaches of the exclusive jurisdiction clause have taken place and will continue, if the appeal is allowed and the injunction refused, and he likewise recognised that, if this leads to Mr Donohue incurring a greater liability or being put to a greater expense (<i>eg</i>, for unrecovered costs) in New York than would have been the case in London, Mr Donohue may have a claim in damages against the defendants for breach of contract - breach of the exclusive jurisdiction clause.  This does not appear to have been a point put to the Court of Appeal and it was only raised by Lord Grabiner in this House during his reply, no doubt as a result of his further consideration of the RICO point.  I am prepared to accept this submission and proceed on the basis that, if Mr Donohue can hereafter show that he has suffered loss as a result of the breach of the clause, the ordinary remedy in damages for breach of contract would be open to him.  I say no more than this since the position is complex.  The litigation in New York includes parties who are not parties to the jurisdiction agreement and against whom, and in relation to whom, Mr Donohue is not entitled to rely upon the clause.  Further, when the issues of fact have been fully tried in New York, a situation may be established whereby Mr Donohue's right to rely upon the contract as against the defendants may be affected or situations of circuity of action may arise.  That is not presently the position but Lord Grabiner's point has merit and relevance in this exceptional and finely balanced case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;49. The basis on which the exercise of the discretion has to be exercised is different from that before the Court of Appeal.  In part this is because of a wrong decision on the joinder question and in part because of further arguments advanced by the defendants before this House.  In my judgment in this case they exceptionally suffice to justify the House in deciding that the discretion should be exercised afresh by your Lordships and against the grant of the injunction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50. I therefore agree that the appeal should be allowed on the terms proposed.</p>
<p><b>LORD SCOTT OF FOSCOTE</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;51. I have had the advantage of reading in draft the opinion of my noble and learned friend, Lord Bingham of Cornhill, and gratefully adopt his recital of the relevant facts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;52. There seem to me to be two main issues that must be decided in the present case.  They to some extent overlap one another.  They are (i) whether the contractual exclusive jurisdiction clauses, contained in the transfer agreements dated 3 September 1991 under which AFSIL and AFSEL transferred their respective shares in the BNIG to CISHL and in the sale and purchase agreement of the same date under which AFSIL and AFSEL transferred their shares in CISHL to Wingfield, should be enforced by injunction so as to bar proceedings in New York that fall within the scope of those clauses, properly construed;  and (ii) if the answer to issue (i) is "yes", whether an injunction should be granted in order to bar also the prosecution in New York of proceedings that are not themselves caught by the exclusive jurisdiction clauses but are closely associated with those that are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;53. The principles to be applied in order to decide on the one hand whether an exclusive jurisdiction clause should be enforced by an injunction and on the other hand whether the commencement or continuation of foreign proceedings which are not caught by an exclusive jurisdiction clause should be barred by an injunction seem now well settled and have not been the subject of any real disagreement before your Lordships.  It is accepted that a contractual exclusive jurisdiction clause ought to be enforced as between the parties to the contract unless there are strong reasons not to do so.  Prima facie parties should be held to their contractual bargain:  see <i>The Fehmarn</i> [1958]  1 WLR 159;  <i>The Chaparral</i> [1968]  2 Lloyd's Rep 158;  <i>The El Amria</i> [1981]  2 Lloyd's Rep 119;  <i>The Sennar (No 2)</i> [1985]  1 WLR 490;  <i>The Angelic Grace</i> [1995]  1 Lloyd's Rep 87.  If, on the other hand, there is no contractual bargain standing in the way of the foreign proceedings, "the . . . court will, generally speaking, only restrain the plaintiff from pursuing proceedings in the foreign court if such pursuit would be vexatious or oppressive":  per Lord Goff of Chieveley in <i>Société Nationale Industrielle Aérospatiale v Lee Kui Jak</i> [1987]  AC 871, 896. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;54. There has been some debate before your Lordships as to the order in which the two issues referred to above should be considered but it seems to me convenient to start with the exclusive jurisdiction clauses and to try and decide what part, if any, of the New York proceedings the clauses cover, who is and who is not entitled to their benefit and who is and who is not bound by them.</p>
<i><p><i>The exclusive jurisdiction clauses</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;55. In the transfer agreements, the parties to which were AFSIL and AFSEL, as transferors, and CISHL, as transferee, the exclusive jurisdiction clause said, simply, that "each party submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Judicature of England" (para 15.2).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;56. In the sale and purchase agreement the exclusive jurisdiction clause said that:</p>
<p></p><ul>"the parties hereby irrevocably submit themselves to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts to settle any dispute which may arise out of or in connection with this agreement."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;57. The parties to the sale and purchase agreement, in addition to AFSIL, AFSEL and Wingfield, included AFSC, Mr Atkins and Mr Donohue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;58. The terms of the sale and purchase agreement clause are very wide, "any dispute which may arise out of or in connection with this agreement," but it has not been suggested that the terms of the clauses in the transfer agreements should be given any lesser scope.  So I propose to concentrate on the sale and purchase agreement clause and treat it as applicable also to any dispute arising out of or in connection with the transfer agreements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;59. Armco Inc. was not a party to any of these agreements but, on the dissolution of AFSEL, the assets of AFSEL, including its assignable choses in action, became vested, as I understand it, in Armco.  It is accepted, rightly in my opinion, that, in respect of any causes of action vested in Armco as successor of AFSEL, Armco is subject to the same contractual inhibitions under the exclusive jurisdiction clause as AFSEL was subject to.  But in respect of causes of action to which Armco is entitled in its own right, i e, otherwise than as successor to AFSEL, Armco is not bound by the exclusive jurisdiction clause, whether or not the causes of action relate to a dispute arising out of or in connection with one or other of the agreements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60. There is a point of construction of the exclusive jurisdiction clause that it is convenient to deal with at this point.  It is accepted that the clause is not restricted to contractual claims.  A claim for damages for, for example, fraudulent misrepresentation inducing an agreement containing an exclusive jurisdiction clause in the same form as that with which this case is concerned would, as a matter of ordinary language, be a claim in tort that arose "out of or in connection with" the agreement.  If the alleged fraudulent misrepresentation had been made by two individuals jointly, of whom one was and the other was not a party to the agreement, the claim would still be of the same character, although only the party to the agreement would be entitled to the benefit of the exclusive jurisdiction clause.  The commencement of the claim against the two alleged tortfeasors elsewhere than in England would represent a breach of the clause.  The defendant tortfeasor who was a party to the agreement would, absent strong reasons to the contrary, be entitled to an injunction restraining the continuance of the foreign proceedings.  He would be entitled to an injunction restraining the continuance of the proceedings not only against himself but also against his co-defendant. The exclusive jurisdiction clause is expressed to cover "<i>any dispute</i> which may arise out of or in connection with" the agreement.  It is not limited to "any claim against" the party to the agreement.  To give the clause that limited construction would very substantially reduce the protection afforded by the clause to the party to the agreement.  The non-party, if he remained alone as a defendant in the foreign proceedings, would be entitled to claim from his co-tortfeasor a contribution to any damages awarded.  He could join the co-tortfeasor, the party entitled to the protection of the exclusive jurisdiction clause, in third party proceedings for that purpose.  The position would be no different if the claim were to be commenced in the foreign court with only the tortfeasor who was not a party to the exclusive jurisdiction clause as a defendant.  He would be able, and well advised, to commence third party proceedings against his co-tortfeasor, the party to the exclusive jurisdiction clause.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;61. In my opinion, an exclusive jurisdiction clause in the wide terms of that with which this case is concerned is broken if any proceedings within the scope of the clause are commenced in a foreign jurisdiction, whether or not the person entitled to the protection of the clause is joined as defendant to the proceedings.  An injunction restraining the continuance of the proceedings would not, of course, be granted unless the party seeking the injunction, being someone entitled to the benefit of the clause, had a sufficient interest in obtaining the injunction.  It would, I think, be necessary for him to show that the claim being prosecuted in the foreign jurisdiction was one which, if it succeeded, would involve him in some consequential liability.  It would certainly, in my opinion, suffice to show that if the claim succeeded he would incur a liability as a joint tortfeasor to contribute to the damages awarded by the foreign court.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;62. This point is of direct relevance in the present case.  In the New York proceedings, which I must analyse more fully in a moment, several claims are made but most of them are based upon the allegation that Mr Donohue, Mr Atkins, Mr Rossi and Mr Stinson conspired together fraudulently to extract in various ways substantial sums of money from the Armco group of companies.  If the allegations can be made good, the liability of the conspirators would be  a joint and several liability.  There are substantial issues as to which of the claims fall within the language of the exclusive jurisdiction clause but I think it is clear that some of them do.  Of the four alleged conspirators only Mr Donohue and Mr Atkins are contractually entitled to the benefit of the exclusive jurisdiction clause.  Mr Atkins has settled with Armco, so it was Mr Donohue alone who commenced an action in this country for an injunction enforcing the clause.  If Mr Donohue is entitled to an injunction enforcing the clause he is entitled, in my opinion, to an injunction that bars the continuance of the claims in question not only against himself but also against Mr Rossi and Mr Stinson with whom he is jointly and severally liable.  If claims against Mr Donohue are within the clause, then so too are the corresponding claims against Mr Rossi and Mr Stinson.  Mr Rossi and Mr Stinson are not contractually entitled to enforce the clause, but Mr Donohue is, in my opinion, entitled to ask the court to enforce it by restraining the prosecution in New York of all claims within its scope in respect of which Mr Donohue would be jointly and severally liable.</p>
<i><p><i>The New York proceedings</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;63. It is necessary to analyse with some care the nature of the claims made in the New York proceedings in order to decide which of them are caught by the exclusive jurisdiction clause and which are not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;64. The amended complaint filed in New York describes the parties and then, in paragraphs 25 to 63 sets out the "Facts".  Under the sub-heading "The Secret Agreement" it is alleged that the four individual defendants entered into a secret agreement under which Mr Rossi and Mr Stinson, who owed Armco fiduciary duties as directors and were responsible on behalf of Armco for negotiating with Mr Donohue and Mr Atkins the terms under which the latter would purchase from Armco the BNIG, became secret partners with them in that purchase.  It is alleged that pursuant to the secret agreement Mr Rossi and Mr Stinson agreed on behalf of Armco to excessive sums being injected into CISHL before its shares were sold to Wingfield.  Recovery of the sums is sought.  This claim seems to me a fairly clear example of a "dispute arising out of or in connection with" the sale and purchase agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;65. The amended complaint goes on to allege that "other aspects of the sale were similarly tainted by the fraud" (para 41).  Reference is made, as an example, to the extraction of sums of money from two trust funds that had been established in the United States to support insurance liabilities of NAIC.  I find it difficult to follow how this dispute could be brought within the exclusive jurisdiction clause.  The only "connection" seems to me to be that if the BNIG had not been purchased the scheme for milking the trust funds would not have been implemented.  It is a causa sine qua non, a "but for", connection and I doubt whether that is enough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66. The amended complaint alleges, also, that "as part of their secret agreement" the four conspirators extracted funds from APL via a debt collection agreement between APL, acting by Mr Rossi, and NPV, acting by Mr Donohue and Mr Stinson, under which NPV obtained unjustifiably inflated rates of commission.  I cannot see any basis on which the claims based on this debt collection agreement can be regarded as falling within the exclusive jurisdiction clause.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;67. In respect of each of the claims to which I have referred the plaintiffs in the New York proceedings claim punitive as well as compensatory damages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;68. In addition it is alleged that the defendants' conduct constituted racketeering, wire fraud and mail fraud for the purpose of the RICO Act (Federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act 18 USC §1962(c)).  Under the RICO Act claims triple damages are sought.  In so far as the RICO Act claims are based on conduct in connection with the transfer agreements or the sale and purchase agreement, it might seem that they, too, fall within the language of the exclusive jurisdiction clause.  But it is common ground that a RICO Act claim could not be brought in an English court.  It cannot, in my opinion, be supposed that in submitting to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts the parties had in mind claims which an English court would have no jurisdiction to entertain.  The contractually expressed purpose of the submission to the English courts was "to settle any dispute which may arise", etc.  How can this language be sensibly thought apt to cover a dispute that the English courts would be jurisdictionally unable to settle?  The choice of law provision that, in the sale and purchase agreement, immediately preceded the exclusive jurisdiction clause, in my opinion, underlines the point:  "this agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with" English law.  The parties could not have intended that RICO Act claims would be governed by English law.  English law does not recognise such claims.  Nor can it be supposed that the parties, by the use of a fairly commonplace choice of law provision and exclusive jurisdiction clause, were intending to contract out of any RICO Act liability that might be connected with the agreement.  In my opinion, any such contractual intention would need to be clearly expressed.  Accordingly, in my opinion, as a matter of construction of the exclusive jurisdiction clause, the RICO Act claims are not caught.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;69. The amended complaint included also breach of fiduciary duty claims against Mr Rossi and Mr Stinson.  These claims arise in part out of conduct of Mr Rossi and Mr Stinson in negotiating the terms of the sale by Armco of its BNIG.  But I do not think a claim by Armco against its own officers for breach of fiduciary duty represents a "dispute" caught by the exclusive jurisdiction clause.  "Dispute" in the clause means, in my opinion, a dispute in respect of which there is, on each side, a party, or a person claiming through a party, to the agreement.  A claim by Armco for breach of fiduciary duty by its directors is, in my opinion, no more caught than would be a claim by Armco for negligence by its lawyers whether or not the conduct complained of related to the transfer agreements or the sale and purchase agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70. There are, in addition, other claims made in the New York proceedings but most of them are different formulations of the claims to which I have already referred.  I think I have mentioned all those that bear upon the issues that arise on this appeal.</p>
<i><p><i>Should injunctions be granted?</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;71. Virtually all the claims in the New York proceedings are based upon the alleged secret agreement between the four individual defendants.  Some of the claims, those made against Mr Donohue and those relating to the allegedly excessive funds injected into CISHL, are within the scope of the exclusive jurisdiction clause.  Others seem to me to be plainly outside the scope of the clause.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72. The Court of Appeal granted injunctions restraining the continuance of claims "to the extent that the claims arise out of or are connected with the management buy-out".   The injuncted claims included the RICO Act claims in so far as so arising or so connected.  They included the breach of fiduciary duty claims against Mr Rossi and Mr Stinson in so far as so arising or so connected.  For the reasons I have given I do not think that any of these claims were within the scope of the exclusive jurisdiction clause on its true construction.  But the injuncted claims did not include the claims relating to the alleged milking of the trust funds nor those relating to the APL/NPV debt collection agreement.  The Court of Appeal's refusal to extend the injunction so as to bar these claims is not the subject of any cross-appeal and it is accepted by Mr Donohue that the prosecution in New York of these claims against him and the other defendants will continue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73. So the injunction as granted by the Court of Appeal has left the alleged secret agreement to be litigated both in the New York courts and in England.  The possibility of inconsistent conclusions on the facts is plain.  The injunction has barred the prosecution in New York of a part of the RICO Act claim.  The claim cannot be litigated in England and it follows that the part of the RICO Act claim that arises out of or in connection with the "management buy-out" cannot be litigated anywhere.  The injunction has required Armco, an American company, to prosecute in England a claim against its officers, Mr Rossi and Mr Stinson, for breach of the fiduciary duty that they owe under Armco's domestic law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74. Many of the claims made in the New York proceedings, including the RICO Act claims and the breach of fiduciary claims in so far as they do not arise out of or in connection with the management buy-out as well as all the trust fund claims and the debt-collection agreement claims, will be proceedings in New York in any event.  The common sense in all the claims based on the alleged secret agreement being dealt with in the same court and at the same time seems to me overwhelming.  There are undoubted disadvantages to Mr Donohue in being sued in New York instead of in England. These have been referred to by Lord Bingham.  And the prosecution in New York of the claims, not only against Mr Donohue but against Mr Rossi and Mr Stinson as well, that fall within the exclusive jurisdiction clause constitutes a breach of a contractual term that Mr Donohue is prima facie entitled to require to be observed.  It is relevant to take into account, however, that the New York claims that do fall within the exclusive jurisdiction clause on its true construction are somewhat peripheral, if measured against the sort of contractual and tortious claims that the parties might reasonably be supposed to have had in mind when agreeing to that clause.  The conspiracy constituted by the alleged secret agreement was aimed at extracting money from the Armco group by using, or misusing, the authority of two of Armco's own officers who had become co-conspirators.  It is one thing to conclude that those claims based upon the conspiracy that arise out of or in connection with the management buy-out are caught by the exclusive jurisdiction clause properly construed;  it is quite another to suppose that the parties would have had claims of that sort in mind when agreeing to the clause.</p>
