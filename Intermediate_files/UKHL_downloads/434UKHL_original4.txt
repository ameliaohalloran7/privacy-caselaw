<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)&nbsp;&nbsp;Should an uplift be assessed by reference to the risk in the particular case, or on a more general, and if so what, basis?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)&nbsp;&nbsp;Should uplift levels be conditioned, and if so how, by public interest considerations?"  </p>
<p>Issues (1) to (5) relate to the ATE premium; issues (6) to (10) relate to the success fee.</p>
<p align="left"><u>The ATE premium</u></p>
<i><p><i>Issue (1) - The ATE policy and prematurity</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106. The prematurity issue was dealt with at [2001] 1 WLR 2112, 2130-2134, in paragraphs 80 to 100 of the first Court of Appeal judgment in relation both to the time at which a claimant could reasonably enter into a CFA and to the time at which he could reasonably take out ATE insurance.  The Court of Appeal's approach to the prematurity issue is expressed at p 2132,  para 91 of the judgment:</p>
<p></p><ul>"we consider that, from the viewpoint of both the claimant and his solicitor, it will normally be reasonable for a CFA to be concluded and ATE cover taken out on the occasion that the claimant first instructs his solicitors.  What we have to decide is whether, having regard to the statutory provisions, (i) The cost of the success fee and (ii) the ATE premium, when incurred at that early stage, can be recovered."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107. I agree with the Court of Appeal's proposition that it is reasonable for a claimant to enter into a CFA with his solicitor at their first meeting and before the defendant's reaction to the claim is known.   It was not contended before your Lordships that Mr Callery instructed Amelans prematurely.  It was plainly reasonable for him to instruct solicitors to pursue his claim and for them then to notify Mr Gray of his claim.  And it was reasonable for him, having instructed Amelans, immediately to enter into a CFA with regard to their fees.  After all, the fees clock begins ticking as soon as a solicitor is instructed.  The issues for your Lordships regarding the success fee relate, in my opinion, not to the time when the CFA was entered into but to the size of the success fee and the manner in which its reasonableness should be assessed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108. It is otherwise with an ATE policy.  The main issue, indeed I think the only real issue before the House, is whether it is reasonable, in a cost assessment context, for a claimant to take out an ATE policy at a time when litigation is highly unlikely.  The purpose of an ATE policy is to protect the claimant against adverse costs orders.  But the risk of such orders cannot arise unless and until the claimant commences litigation to pursue his damages claim.  The CFA is needed as soon as he instructs his solicitors.  But the ATE policy is not needed unless there is going to be litigation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109. The circuit judge, Judge Edwards, interpreted CGU's reply of 19 May 2000 to Amelans' letter of 4 May as a denial of liability.  This led him to conclude that it had been reasonable for Mr Callery to take out ATE insurance cover at an early stage "because a contest was looming".  The Court of Appeal, rightly in my opinion, did not accept that view of the letter of 19 May.  They commented, at [2001] 1 WLR 2112, 2139-2140,in para 131 of the first judgment:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In view of that letter, the claimant's solicitors would not be justified in continuing to investigate and prepare the case on liability.  Their sole concern after the letter was to establish the extent of the damages.  Thereafter all that was required of the claimant's solicitors was that they should proceed in accordance with the protocol to obtain a medical report and investigate the question of damages.  From a practical point of view, this was, as Mr Birts contends on behalf of the defendant, a very, very low risk case."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110. I would respectfully agree with this analysis of the letter of 19 May and how matters stood after it had been received.  But the content of the letter was not the reason why the ATE policy was taken out.  The policy had been taken out well before Amelans' receipt of the 19 May letter.  Indeed, it was taken out before either Mr Gray or CGU could have received the letter of 4 May notifying them of the claim.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111. It is apparent, therefore, that the Court of Appeal's conclusion that it had been reasonable for Mr Callery to take out the ATE insurance policy on 4 May immediately on instructing Amelans was not based on any perception that, on what was then known, the policy was a reasonable precaution to be put in place in order to protect Mr Callery against the possibility of an adverse costs order in litigation.   No one in Amelans was contemplating that litigation might be needed in order to obtain the payment of a satisfactory sum of damages for Mr Callery; it was not completely impossible that litigation might be needed, but it was very unlikely indeed.  On what then was the Court of Appeal's conclusion based?  It seems to me to have been based on the evidence placed before the court about the ATE insurance market and the Court of Appeal's concern that unless premium recovery under costs orders were allowed in such commonplace, minimal risk cases as Mr Callery's, the market in ATE insurance policies might wither.  The Court of Appeal was told that if claimants in road traffic accident cases postponed taking out cover until a litigation contest seemed likely, the premiums charged would rise steeply, putting at risk the ability of those who needed the cover in risky or speculative litigation to obtain it and thereby impeding their access to justice.  The Court referred, in particular, to  evidence from Mr Ward, managing director of Abbey Legal Protection, whose firm ran the Law Society's Accident Line Protect conditional fee insurance scheme.  Under this scheme, nominated solicitors were given delegated authority to offer clients ATE insurance cover once agreement on a CFA had been reached.  But, in order to ensure that the principle of "the many paying for the few" was observed, solicitors who wished to offer the Accident Line Protect cover to their clients had to do so at the time the CFA was entered into and before notifying the proposed defendant, or his insurers, of the claim (see p 2129, para 70 of the first Court of Appeal judgment commenting on Mr Ward's evidence).  As to the policy of Temple, Mr Callery's insurers, paragraph 74 of the first judgment said this:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Mr Wait [underwriting director of Temple] told us that most of the ATE insurance schemes available on the market today can only provide insurance if cover is in place before the initial letter of claim is sent.  Again, the practice follows the basic insurance principle that 'the many pay for the few.'"<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112. It may be noticed how, in the ATE insurance context, the "many pay for the few" insurance principle has become distorted.  The principle means that the "many", all those who take out policies and pay premiums but many of whom do not suffer an insured risk, build up a premium fund by means of which the "few", who likewise take out policies and pay premiums but who do suffer an insured risk, can have their insured losses met.  In the ATE insurance field, however, the "many", ie the defendants who are to be called upon to meet the premiums that build up the premium fund from which the insured losses of the few can be met, do not take out policies at all.  The premium fund is not built up for their benefit or protection.  It has been suggested that defendants, as well as claimants, benefit from ATE insurance because, in the event of costs orders in favour of a defendant being made, the claimant's insurance cover will provide a means by which this liability can be met.  In view of the number of exclusions likely to be found in a typical ATE policy (see paragraphs 1, 2, 7 and 8 of the exclusions clause in Mr Callery's policy), I doubt whether this will be of much practical comfort to defendants.   More importantly, the policy will come into play only in the event of litigation and in a case, such as the present, where the prospect of litigation was always highly remote, the suggested benefit to the defendant seems to me theoretical and illusory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113. Your Lordships cannot know what will be the consequence for the ATE insurance market if premiums payable under ATE policies that have been taken out where there is no real risk of litigation, and therefore no real risk of the occurrence of the event insured against, are ruled to be irrecoverable from defendants.  I would for my part be prepared to accept that, if recovery of premiums is restricted to those premiums paid in respect of policies taken out where there is at least a fair likelihood that litigation in pursuit of the damages claim will be needed, the size of premiums will rise.  But I would certainly not be prepared to accept that cover will be unavailable.  In any event, however, it is, in my opinion, contrary to principle for the reasonableness of the premature taking out of ATE insurance to be judged by reference to arguments about the impact on the ATE insurance market if recovery of premiums in commonplace cases such as Mr Callery's is not allowed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114. The correct approach for costs assessment purposes to the question whether an item of expenditure by the receiving party has been reasonably incurred is to look at the circumstances of the particular case.  The question whether the paying party should be required to meet a particular item of expenditure is a case specific question.  It is not a question to which the macro economics of the ATE insurance market has any relevance.  If the expenditure was not reasonably required for the purposes of the claim, it would, in my opinion, be contrary to long-established costs recovery principles to require the paying party to pay it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115. Section 29 of the 1999 Act allows recovery of ATE insurance premiums:  "…. the costs payable to him may ... include costs in respect of the premium …." (my emphasis).  The section does not mandate the inclusion of costs in respect of the premium.  And whether a particular ATE insurance premium, or part of it, should be included in the costs ordered to be paid in a particular case should be tested and answered by reference to the same principles of reasonableness that apply under the rules and practice directions to all other items of expenditure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116. There is, I think, no dispute that the likelihood of litigation being necessary in order to pursue Mr Callery's damages claim was always very remote.  Amelans, with their experience in the field, knew this.  They offered ATE insurance to their client on 4 May, before notifying the defendant of the claim and obtaining his reaction to it, not on the footing that their client would be likely to need it, but because it had become their practice to do so.  The offer was no doubt made on the footing that it would not be he who would have to pay the premium. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117. The argument advanced by the respondent, both in the Court of Appeal and before your Lordships, is, in effect, that defendants to claims which are bound to succeed and where litigation to pursue the claims is highly unlikely, must bear the cost of ATE insurance cover that is not needed in order to enable ATE insurance cover in cases where it is needed to be offered by insurers at lower rates than would otherwise be commercially possible.  The clear principles on which costs recovery is based, both before and after the 1999 Act, are in my opinion hostile to this argument.  In my opinion, the Court of Appeal fell into error in accepting it and in adopting an approach to the ATE premium that was not case specific but was based on the evidence about the ATE insurance market to which I have referred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118. Submissions made to the House on behalf of the Lord Chancellor's Department have contended that "access to justice would be restricted if claimants could not insure against liability for costs from the point they instructed a solicitor" (para 13 of the written case).  This, in my opinion, misses the point.  There is nothing to prevent claimants from taking out ATE policies as soon as they instruct a solicitor.  The question is whether this is a reasonable step to take vis-à-vis the defendant who they expect to bear the burden of paying the premium.  If there is no real risk of litigation or of adverse costs orders, the absence of an ATE policy will not discourage access to justice for the claimant in question.  If, despite the absence of any such real risk, the claimant wants to take out the policy, he can do so but cannot then reasonably expect the defendant to pay for it.  To describe this state of affairs as restricting access to justice seems to me unwarranted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119. Paragraph 13 of the Lord Chancellor's case continues by referring to:</p>
<p></p><ul>"the Department's policy objective … that successful claimants would ordinarily be able to recover the cost of ATE premiums from unsuccessful defendants even though the policy was entered into before the defendant's response to the claim was known."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120. The paragraph does not say that it is the Department's policy objective that claimants would ordinarily be able to recover ATE premiums even though there was never any likelihood that litigation in which adverse costs orders might be made would be necessary.  If that is or was the Department's policy, I would expect your Lordships to be unimpressed by it.  In any event, it is Parliament's policy underlying section 29, not the Department's policy, that the House should take account of and, as to that, there is nothing to lead one to suppose that expenditure on ATE premiums was, for costs purposes, to be approached differently from any other item of potentially recoverable expenditure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121. Moreover, if general policy considerations are to be brought into account, they tend strongly, in my opinion, against allowing recovery of this ATE premium.  One of the main purposes of Lord Woolf's civil justice reforms was to reduce the cost and the complexity of pursuing legal remedies and an important step in that direction was the introduction of pre-action protocols.  These set out steps which parties are intended to take before the commencement of litigation so as to confine litigation, as a means of dispute resolution, to cases where the dispute cannot be resolved without it.  Under pre-action protocols the claimant must write a letter to the proposed defendant giving the outline of the claim and an opportunity to the defendant to respond.  Various key documents, eg a medical report in accident cases, should be supplied to the defendant. This correspondence enables the parties to ascertain what, if anything, is in issue between them and whether, or on what issues, litigation will be necessary.  If litigation is shown to be unnecessary, because the defendant admits the claim and the parties can agree terms of settlement, the expense of unnecessary litigation is, by the parties' observance of the pre-action protocol requirements, avoided.  And if a claimant fails to observe the requirements of the relevant pre-action protocol and commences litigation prematurely, the court may, even if his claim succeeds, deprive him of costs or order him to pay the defendant's costs (see paras 2.2 and 2.3 of the Protocol Practice Direction:  Civil Procedure, 2000, vol 1, C1-002, p 1303).  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122. In the present case, Amelans' letter of 4 May 2000 corresponded with the relevant pre-action protocol requirements.  So did CGU's response on 19 May.  So did their ensuing correspondence which led, by early August, to a settlement agreement.  Litigation was not necessary to pursue Mr Callery's claim.  The pre-action protocol had served its purpose.  In these circumstances the proposition that the defendant should have to pay by way of costs for an item of Mr Callery's expenditure that related exclusively to the litigation that the parties had succeeded in avoiding seems to me inconsistent with the purpose of the pre-action protocol.  If during the pre-action protocol period the claimant incurs expenditure for the purpose of litigation that, in the event, never happens, there are, in my opinion, very sound policy reasons, consistent with those that underlie the civil justice reforms, for leaving the claimant to bear the cost of what, in the event, is useless expenditure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123. For all these reasons I would give the answer "No" to the question posed in issue (1) and allow the appeal to that extent.</p>
<i><p>Issues (2), (3) and (4)</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;124. Issues (2) and (3) are fact dependent reasonableness issues.  Your Lordships should not, in my opinion, second guess the courts below on issues such as these unless their decisions are plainly unreasonable or unless some evident error has been made.  In the present case, the Court of Appeal, in the second judgment, [2001] 1 WLR 2142, 2159, para 70, concluded that the amount of the premium was not manifestly disproportionate to the risk being under taken and was reasonable.  But in reaching this conclusion the Court of Appeal was proceeding under a misapprehension as to the basis on which the premium had been calculated.  The court thought that Temple had fixed the amount of the premium, £350, having regard to the facts of this particular case.  Counsel are agreed that this was an error.  The £350 premium was in fact a uniform premium charged by Temple for ATE insurance cover in respect of every claim which carried a prospect of success of better than 50 per cent (see para 22 of the second judgment).  This was a "block rating" case, not an individual assessment case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125. The factual basis, therefore, on which the Court of Appeal concluded that the £350 premium was reasonable in amount was erroneous.  The Court of Appeal did not address the question whether in a case, like the present, where the percentage prospect of success is at the least in the mid 90s, it was reasonable to charge a premium calculated on a block basis for all cases with a percentage prospect of success of better than 50.  Your Lordships do not know what answer the Court of Appeal would have given.  It is at this point that issue (4) becomes relevant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;126. The injunction in CPR 44.4 (2)(b) that requires the court to resolve doubts about reasonableness or proportionality in favour of the paying party does not mean that in every case where a decision as to reasonableness or as to proportionality is a difficult one to reach, with something to be said on each side, the paying party must win.  The costs judge must endeavour to reach a conclusion on the issue, taking account of all the circumstances and of the factors that the rules and practice directions require to be taken into account.  If, having done so, the costs judge remains uncertain whether the item of costs under review is reasonable and proportionate, then the paying party should win.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;127. In the present case, where a block rate calculated for use in cases with a prospect of success of above 50 per cent, has been applied to a case with a prospect of success of well over 90 per cent, there cannot, in my opinion, be other than doubt as to the reasonableness of the charge.  It might be over-simplistic to conclude that a charge reasonable for a case with a prospect of success of, say, 70 per cent, must be too high for a case with a prospect of success of, say, 95 per cent.  But at least there must be doubt.  So CPR 44.4 (2)(b) comes into play and requires that the doubt be resolved in favour of the paying party.  The £350 premium, and the £17.50 tax, should, in my opinion, have been disallowed on this ground as well.</p>
<i><p><i>Issue 5</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;128. This issue relates to adverse costs orders made against a claimant where (a) the claimant has failed to beat a CPR Part 36 offer; or (b) the claimant has lost on some discrete issue and been ordered to pay the costs of that issue; or (c) there has been some other adverse exercise of costs discretion in the defendant's favour.  It is contended that recovery of the part of an ATE premium that relates to adverse costs orders of the sort described ought not to be allowed.  It is put almost as a point of public policy.  The burden of adverse costs orders that reflect the court's disapprobation of some aspect of the manner in which a claimant has conducted his case ought not to be shifted to the defendant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;129. Counsel for the appellant accepts that a premium, or more likely part of a premium, paid to protect a claimant against the risk of liability under these adverse costs orders is within the scope of section 29 but submits that it cannot be reasonable to require the defendant, who has presumably been unsuccessful on the main issue in the case and who has had a normal order for costs made against him, to reimburse the claimant for that premium, or that part.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;130. If  it is reasonable for a claimant to take out ATE insurance cover in order to protect himself against incurring a costs liability in litigation, whether in respect of the other side's costs or his own costs, I can, for my part see no reason why any distinction should be drawn between the types of adverse costs orders that might be made or the circumstances in which the orders might be made.  If the claimant becomes entitled to costs and the expenditure has been reasonably incurred and is reasonable in amount, the expenditure, in my opinion, ought in principle to be included in the costs to be paid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;131. In my view, for the reasons already expressed, the expenditure on the ATE premium was not reasonably incurred.  If, on the other hand, it was reasonably incurred, and is reasonable in amount, I do not think there is any principle that could justify subtracting from the recoverable premium some part of it notionally attributable to the risk of the adverse costs orders described.</p>
<p align="left"><u>The Success Fee</u></p>
<i><p><i>Issue 6</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;132. The full contractual uplift of 60 per cent was reduced by the district judge to 40 per cent and then further reduced by the Court of Appeal to 20 per cent.  The full uplift was held to be not recoverable.  There has been no cross appeal on the point and this issue does not, therefore, arise.</p>
<i><p><i>Issues (7) and (8)</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;133. These issues are fact dependent reasonableness issues.  Your Lordships should not, in my opinion, interfere with the decision of the Court of Appeal that 20 per cent represented a reasonable uplift.  The appellant has submitted that the 20 per cent was unduly high for "a very, very low risk case".  I think this may be so, but it is not, in my opinion, sufficiently out of line to justify your Lordships in interfering.  It is reasonable, for the reasons I have given, for a would-be claimant to enter into a CFA with his solicitors as soon as he instructs them.  The amount of the success fee must be stated in the CFA and, therefore, fixed before it is possible for the solicitors to know for certain what part, if any, of their client's story the defendant will accept.</p>
<i><p><i>Issue 9</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;134. I am in no doubt but that a success fee should be assessed by reference to the risk in the particular case.  As I have said already, a costs assessment process should be case specific.  I agree with the appellant that the costs rules and practice directions reflect a case specific approach.  If the risk of a claim failing is minimal then, in my opinion, the success fee should be correspondingly low.</p>
<i><p><i>Issue 10</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;135. This is too general a question to enable a useful answer to be given.  I would simply repeat that, in my opinion, the reasonableness of a success fee is a case specific issue.</p>
<i><p><i>Conclusion</i></p>
