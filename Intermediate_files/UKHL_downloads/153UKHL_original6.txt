<p class="para">125.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not, however, think that it is open to us to wash our hands of such difficult issues on the ground that this is a matter for Parliament. For better or worse, Parliament has entrusted us with the task of deciding whether its legislation is compatible with the Convention rights. If it is not, it is our duty to say so. The fact that the issue raises moral questions on which views may legitimately differ does not let us off the hook. <i>Bellinger v Bellinger </i>[2003] UKHL 21, [2003] 2 AC 467 raised a difficult moral issue about the rights of trans people to be recognised in their reassigned gender identity. <i>Goodwin v United Kingdom </i>(2002) 35 EHRR 447<i> </i>had left the House in no doubt that UK law was incompatible with the Convention rights. The House made a declaration to that effect. <i>Ghaidan v Godin-Mendoza</i> [2004] UKHL 30, [2004] 2 AC 557<i> </i>raised a difficult moral issue about the rights of same sex couples to be treated in the same way as opposite sex couples. The Court of Appeal correctly anticipated the position which Strasbourg would soon after take in <i>Karner v Austria </i>[2003] 2 FLR 623. The only real question for the House was whether the incompatibility could be interpreted away or whether we would have to declare the legislation incompatible. When we can make a good prediction of how Strasbourg would decide the matter, we cannot avoid doing so on the basis that it is a matter for Parliament. Strasbourg will be largely indifferent to which branch of government was responsible for the state of the domestic law.</p>
<p class="para">126.&nbsp;&nbsp;But when we can reasonably predict that Strasbourg would regard the matter as within the margin of appreciation left to the member states, it seems to me that this House should not attempt to second guess the conclusion which Parliament has reached. I do not think that this has to do with the subject matter of the issue, whether it be moral, social, economic or libertarian; it has to do with keeping pace with the Strasbourg jurisprudence as it develops over time, neither more nor less: see <i>R</i> (<i>Ullah) v Special Adjudicator</i> [2004] UKHL 26, [2004] 2 AC 323, para 20 . </p>
<p class="para">127.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, I seriously doubt whether Strasbourg would regard the right to hunt wild animals with hounds as falling within either article 8 or article 11; but if it did, I believe that the ban would fall within the margin of appreciation it would allow to the United Kingdom on a matter such as this. Even if I were eventually to be proved wrong on both points, I would not think that the 1998 Act now required us to declare the Hunting Act 2004 incompatible.</p>
<p class="para">128.&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the interference with property rights, much the same applies. This is not a confiscatory measure. It does not deprive anyone of his possessions. It does restrict the use to which certain property can be put. It has also resulted in a diminution in business for certain trades and may result in some loss of jobs. There is no Convention right to continue to enjoy a particular level of trade. There is no Convention right to retain one’s job beyond the “right to a job” which is recognised by domestic law. The Convention does not guarantee the right to acquire property: see <i>J A Pye (Oxford) Ltd v United Kingdom</i> (App no 44302/02) (unreported) 30 August 2007, para 61.<i> </i>All sorts of laws may reduce demand for particular services and thus affect the profits of the self-employed or the job security of employed people. They do not in my view usually have to be justified under article 1 of the protocol no 1, although that should not be difficult.</p>
<p class="para">129.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the claimants have been restricted in the use to which they can put their property. They cannot use their own land or horses or dogs for proscribed hunting, and they cannot allow others to do so. Given the number of uses to which they still can put their property, I would regard this as a very limited control of use. Control of use can be limited in the general interest and this is not a taxing standard to meet. Even in the context of deprivation of property the Strasbourg court has said that “finding it natural that the margin of appreciation available to the legislature in implementing social and economic policies should be a wide one [the Court] will respect the legislature’s judgment as to what is ‘in the public interest’ unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation": <i>Jahn v Germany</i> (Application nos 46720/99, 72203/01 and 72552/01) (unreported) 30 June 2005, quoted in <i>Pye v United Kingdom</i>, above, at para 71. In determining whether a fair balance has been struck between the demands of the general interest and the interest of the individuals concerned, in control of use cases, “the Court recognises that the State enjoys a wide margin of appreciation with regard both to choosing the means of enforcement and to ascertaining whether the consequences of enforcement are justified in the general interest for the purpose of achieving the object of the law in question": <i>AGOSI v United Kingdom</i> (1986) Series A, no 108, quoted in <i>Pye v United Kingdom</i>, above, at para 75. On that basis, protecting wild animals from avoidable compromise to their welfare seems to me to fall well within the general interest and the means chosen to strike a fair balance. The fact that the same principles might have justified a wider ban does not mean that a narrower ban cannot be justified.</p>
<p class="para">130.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sake of completeness, I should add that even where the ban falls within the ambit of a Convention right, membership of the hunting community is not in my view another “status” for the purpose of article 14, for the reasons given in <i>R (Clift) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </i>[2006] UKHL 54, [2007] 1 AC 484, especially at paras 52 to 62. </p>
<p class="para">131.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the EC law claims I have nothing to add to the opinion of Lord Bingham. If, which is certainly not clear, either article 28 or article 49 is engaged by the hunting ban, then the ban is justified. As Lord Bingham points out (at para 50 above), this was a measure of social reform, not directed at the regulation of commercial activity, of which any impediment to intra-Community provision of goods and services was a minor and unintended consequence, and which bears more hardly on  those within this country than outside it. The suggestion that the EC claimants might succeed while the human rights claimants did not would be illogical and unjust and fuel the fires of anti-communitarian sentiment in a quite unnecessary way.</p>
<p class="para">132.&nbsp;&nbsp;For as long as the treaties of the European Community and European Convention on Human Rights remain part of our law, the courts cannot shrink from telling Parliament when it has infringed the rights which those treaties protect. We cannot abdicate the role which Parliament itself has given us, even if we would prefer to leave certain kinds of question to the Parliamentarians. But when we judge the compatibility of recent legislation we do not have to invent rights which the European institutions have never recognised; still less do we have to reject the justifications which the European institutions would be likely to accept. This is the world in which fundamental human rights and representative democracy can happily co-exist. </p>


<p class="lawlord">LORD BROWN OF EATON-UNDER-HEYWOOD</p>
<p class="mylords">My Lords,</p>
<p class="para">133.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunting has long been a controversial subject, the call for a ban heard first many years ago. I use the term hunting in this judgment for simplicity’s sake to refer to the traditional form of mounted foxhunting with a pack of hounds. Some, whether they themselves hunt, strongly support it; others equally strongly condemn it. Each of your Lordships doubtless knows people on both sides of the divide. The supporters genuinely believe that hunting promotes rather than impairs the welfare of foxes; those opposed no less genuinely believe it to be cruel. It seems to me absurd to regard either side as acting dishonourably in the dispute. To my mind both views seem entirely respectable. No doubt there are those with unworthier motives in play but their existence, whether amongst hunt supporters or those opposed, cannot affect the outcome of this appeal.</p>
<p class="para">134.&nbsp;&nbsp;The central question for the decision of the House is whether Parliament was entitled by legislation to give effect to the preference of one side of the debate (the majority) to ban hunting. That, of course, depends critically in the first place upon whether the hunters (or at least some of them) can establish a right to hunt which cannot be denied them except for good reason. If they cannot first establish such a right then Parliament can do whatever it likes whether for good reason or none and your Lordships would be powerless in the matter. When I say that Parliament can do whatever it likes I mean, of course, provided always that it follows a proper parliamentary process. That was the point at issue in the first challenge to the hunting ban: was the Parliament Act 1949 of full legal effect so as (by its amendments to the Parliament Act 1911) to provide a lawful means of enacting the Hunting Act 2004 without the consent of the House of Lords? The House held that it was: <i>R (Jackson) v Attorney General</i> [2006] 1 AC 262.</p>
<p class="para">135.&nbsp;&nbsp;The hunters seek to establish a prima facie right to hunt either under the European Convention on Human Rights or under the Treaty establishing the European Community. As I have said, unless they can show that the ban engages some specific right under one or both of these treaties, that is an end of the matter: they can call for no justification whatever for the ban.</p>
<p class="para">136.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before, therefore, turning to consider what might constitute good and sufficient justification for a ban (itself to my mind dependent upon which, if any, of the asserted rights is engaged) and what consequences would flow from any failure by the respondent to establish such justification, I propose first to address the particular rights for which the appellants variously contend. I shall touch upon them comparatively briefly: others of your Lordships have already considered them much more fully.</p>
<p class="hditl">The European Convention on Human Rights</p>
<p class="hditl">Article 8</p>
<p class="para">137.&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 8(1) provides that: “Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.”</p>
<p class="para">138.&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot hope to improve upon the careful analysis of the ECtHR’s (and domestic) jurisprudence on article 8 made by my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill (paragraphs 10-14 of his opinion) nor upon the reasons he gives in paragraph 15 for concluding that the appellants’ claims cannot in the light of present authority reasonably be held to fall within article 8.</p>
<p class="para">139.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I strongly wish that it were otherwise and for my part would hope to see the jurisprudence governing the scope of article 8 further developed by the Strasbourg Court. Why should it not encompass a broad philosophy of live and let live (or, in Mrs Pretty’s case, let die: <i>Pretty v United Kingdom</i> (2002) 35 EHRR 1)? Why should people not be free to engage in whatever pursuits they wish—pursuits, that is, central to their wellbeing, as hunting was recognised in the courts below to be in the lives of some of these appellants (“a core part”)— unless there is good and sufficient reason (as, indeed, was found in Mrs Pretty’s own case) to forbid it? Article 8’s protection is recognised to extend to a right to identity and to personal development and, as <i>Pretty</i> first articulated, the notion of personal autonomy. It encompasses almost any aspect of a person’s sexuality and a good deal else that is clearly personal. But why should respect for private life not encompass also wider concepts of self-fulfilment? The traditional culture and lifestyle of gipsies and Lapps is protected under article 8 because each is recognised as an ethnic group with its own particular identity: see <i>Buckley v United Kingdom</i> (1996) 23 EHRR 101 and <i>G and E v Norway</i> (1983) 35 DR 30. But why should these groups alone have their way of life safeguarded? Why not others too? Of course the hunting community is in no sense ethnically based nor, indeed, comparably identifiable as a defined group. But it may be doubted whether many gipsies are any more wedded to their particular lifestyle than are numbers of keen huntsmen to theirs. Many people in a real sense live for some particular activity, whether their profession or their recreation. In a real sense it defines them. Often it provides them with their feelings of identity, self-esteem and position in the community.</p>
<p class="para">140.&nbsp;&nbsp;Take music or dance; or chess or bridge; or polo or golf; or climbing or canoeing. Should not a human rights convention ideally operate to ensure that all such activities could only be banned for good reason. Some perhaps may be regarded as more personal than others, carried out in circumstances of greater intimacy. But why should that be critical? All of them are activities to which people may choose to devote much of their lives and which for some are all-important. The alternative, clearly, is that any or all of these activities could be banned, perhaps by some Taliban-like administration, and that those affected, amateurs or professionals, however fundamentally, would have no right to call for a justification for the ban and no redress in the courts were none afforded. The government enacting such legislation would, of course, be politically accountable to the electorate. But if a majority in the country favoured such a ban, prompted, say, by feelings of prejudice or jealousy towards a wealthy or intellectual elite, there might in fact be political advantage in it.</p>
<p class="para">141.&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally I have considered whether this House ought itself properly to construe and apply article 8(1) sufficiently widely to encompass some at least of these appellants. But I conclude not. It is one thing to say that Member States have a margin of appreciation, perhaps a wide margin, when it comes to striking any balance that falls to be struck under article 8(2) (or, for that matter, in respect of any other qualified right); quite another to say that a comparable margin exists for determining whether the qualified right (here article 8(1)) is engaged in the first place. The reach of article 8 must be for the Strasbourg Court itself  to develop. </p>
<p class="hditl">Article 11</p>
<p class="para">142.&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 11(1) provides that: “Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association with others, including the right to form and join trade unions for the protection of his interests.”</p>
<p class="para">143.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have the greatest difficulty in understanding how this article is engaged in the present case. All those affected by the ban continue to be entitled to assemble and associate with others to their hearts’ content.  Obviously the ban prevents their hunting together once they have done so and obviously, therefore, they will be the less likely to exercise their article 11(1) rights than in times past. But it is not the right itself that has been restricted, only hunting.</p>
<p class="para">144.&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost any activity ban is likely to bring in its wake a reduced exercise of article 11(1) rights by those previously engaged in it. Ban music and concert halls will close. Ban bridge and bridge clubs will close. In each case, of course, there is nothing to stop those banned from assembling and associating with others, not least to protest vigorously about the ban. Indeed, my recollection is that many of those affected by the hunting ban did just that.</p>
<p class="hditl">Article 14</p>
<p class="para">145.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the Convention’s (limited) non-discrimination provision. For the reasons given by Lord Bingham, the appellants’ claim under this article cannot succeed in the light of the recent decisions of the House in <i>R (S) v Chief Constable of the South Yorkshire Police</i> [2004] 1 WLR 2196 and <i>R (Clift) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</i> [2007]  1 AC 484. </p>
<p class="hditl">Article 1 of the First Protocol</p>
<p class="para">146.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the protection of property provision which I need not set out again. On this issue too I agree completely with what Lord Bingham says at paragraphs 20 and 21 of his opinion. This article plainly is engaged.</p>
<p class="hditl">The Treaty of the European Community  </p>
<p class="para">147.&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the relevant provisions of the EC Treaty, articles 28 (quantitive restrictions on imports) and 49 (restrictions on freedom to provide services).</p>
<p class="para">148.&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems at first blush (indeed, at second blush too) highly surprising that either of these articles should be engaged by so obviously a non-commercially oriented and non-discriminatory measure as the hunting ban. By the nature of things, few measures have no effect whatever on trans-border trade: just as the hunting ban inevitably reduces the demand in England for Irish-bred hunters and the demand on the Continent for English hunting services, so too, for example, must the handgun ban (the subject of challenge in Strasbourg, but not Luxembourg, in cases like <i>Denimark v United Kingdom</i> (2000) 30 EHRR CD 144 and <i>Ian Edgar (Liverpool) Ltd v United Kingdom </i>(Reports of Judgments and Decisions 2000-I, p 465) have reduced the demand for, say, Mauser and Beretta pistols, and no doubt various handgun-related services too. Is it really to be said that every such restrictive measure derogates from the fundamental principle of the free movement of goods and services so as to call for a public policy justification? I would have thought not. </p>
<p class="para">149.&nbsp;&nbsp;As Lord Bingham has explained, however, the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice is not yet clear on the point. In the past, almost any measure which to any degree operates to inhibit trans-border trade has been found to engage one or other of articles 28 and 49. The question, at least with regard to article 28, is presently under consideration by a Grand Chamber of the ECJ in Case C-110/05, <i>Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic</i> (concerning Italian legislation prohibiting mopeds from towing trailers). It may be hoped that the Court will decide upon a narrower approach to these articles, introducing perhaps, in the case of non-discriminatory measures, a remoteness test or <i>de minimis</i> requirement. The arguments for this are to my mind very powerful. The outcome, however, cannot be taken for granted.</p>
<p class="hditl">Justification and Proportionality</p>
<p class="para">150.&nbsp;&nbsp;What was the aim of the majority of the House of Commons in banning hunting? It was described by the Divisional Court, and accepted by the Court of Appeal, as follows:</p>
<p class="qt">“The legislative aim of the Hunting Act 2004 is a composite one of preventing or reducing unnecessary suffering to wild mammals, overlaid by a moral viewpoint that causing suffering to animals for sport is unethical….”</p>
<p class="para">151.&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the ban on foxhunting had two aims: one, to reduce unnecessary suffering to foxes; the other, to give effect to the view of those opposed to hunting that causing suffering to animals for sport is unethical. Although the appellants strongly dispute the evidential basis for the Court’s discernment of this second aim, I for my part have no doubt that some at least of those seeking (and voting for) the ban were indeed thus motivated.</p>
<p class="para">152.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is before your Lordships a mass of material, the Burns Report prominent amongst it, bearing on all aspects of animal welfare in connection with the hunting ban. It is sufficient for present purposes to state two conclusions which appear to me to emerge plainly from this abundance of evidence. First, that hunting causes at least some degree of suffering to foxes—it “compromises [their] welfare” as the Burns Report put it. Secondly, whether or not it causes <i>unnecessary</i> suffering to foxes (by which I mean more suffering than would result from the additional trapping and shooting—and thereby in some cases wounding instead of killing—of foxes consequent on a ban) can neither be proved nor disproved.    </p>
<p class="para">153.&nbsp;&nbsp;This second conclusion to my mind substantially undermines the purported justification for the first of the stated aims of the ban: if the ban cannot be shown to reduce unnecessary suffering it is difficult to see how it furthers that aim. Indeed there is a case (equally unproven, of course) for saying that the ban will increase the suffering of foxes generally. It was clearly for this reason that the courts below laid such emphasis on the ban’s second aim: to put a stop to the causing of suffering to foxes for sport which the majority of those engaged in the dispute thought unethical. As the Court of Appeal put it at paragraph 123: “Once that objection [the moral objection] is identified, and is regarded as a legitimate basis for legislation, then a total ban was clearly a proportionate response.”</p>
<p class="para">154.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is such an objection, however, “a legitimate basis for legislation?” The answer to that question to my mind depends crucially upon what (if any) rights are being interfered with by the legislation. If the only rights impaired here are the appellants’ property rights only under article 1 of Protocol 1, that is one thing. If, however, contrary to my view, but as I would have wished, the ban does engage the appellants’ article 8 right to respect for their private lives, that would seem to me quite another thing. Let me explain.</p>
<i>
<p class="para">Article 1 of Protocol 1— justification</p>
</i>
<p class="para">155.&nbsp;&nbsp;The justification required for depriving someone of their possessions is merely that this be in the public interest. Similarly the use of people’s property can be controlled by the state if that is deemed necessary in the public interest. The state must establish a legitimate aim in the public interest and the deprivation involved must be proportionate to that aim. A fair balance must be struck between the demands of the general interest of the Community and the need to protect the individual’s property rights, a balance that will not be found if the individual has to bear an excessive burden. There is, however, as the ECtHR made clear in <i>James v United Kingdom</i> (1986) 8 EHRR 123 at para 51, no test of strict necessity to be found in this article. That being so, and the interference with the appellants’ property rights here being comparatively slight, I am prepared to regard the moral objection of the majority as a sufficient public interest justification.</p>
<p class="hditl">Article 8— justification</p>
<p class="para">156.&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrast the position under article 1 of Protocol 1 with the justification required for an interference with article 8 rights. Article 8(2) permits such interference only if this is “necessary in a democratic society” which clearly <i>does</i> constitute a test of strict necessity. A convenient, but by no means novel, statement of the position is to be found in <i>Chassagnou v France</i> (1999) 29 EHRR 615 at para 112:</p>
<p class="qt">“The Court reiterates that in assessing the necessity of a given measure a number of principles must be observed. The term ‘necessary’ does not have the flexibility of such expressions as ‘useful’ or ‘desirable.’ In addition, pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness are hallmarks of a ‘democratic society.’ Although individual interests must on occasion be subordinated to those of a group, democracy does not simply mean that the views of a majority must always prevail: a balance must be achieved which ensures the fair and proper treatment of minorities and avoids any abuse of a dominant position. Lastly, any restriction imposed on a Convention right must be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.”</p>
<p class="para">157.&nbsp;&nbsp;I readily accept, as Lord Bingham suggests at para 45 of his opinion, that a degree of respect should be accorded to the decision of a majority of the country’s democratically elected representatives reached after intense debate. I am unpersuaded, however, that this is “pre-eminently” a case for such respect and I confess to some difficulty with my Lord’s suggestion that: “The democratic process is liable to be subverted if, on a question of moral and political judgment, opponents of the Act achieve through the courts what they could not achieve in Parliament.”</p>
<p class="para">158.&nbsp;&nbsp;The democratic process is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the protection and vindication of human rights. Sometimes the majority misuses its powers. Not least this may occur when what are perceived as moral issues are involved. Take the Irish legislation criminalising homosexuality considered in <i>Norris v Ireland</i> (1988) 13 EHRR 186. True, it had been enacted as long ago as 1885 and was no longer enforced. But the Irish government was asserting in 1989 that it continued to serve a legitimate aim, the protection of morals. Whilst acknowledging that national authorities enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in matters of morals, the ECtHR pointed out that this is not unlimited and in the event held that there was no pressing social need for the legislation:</p>
<p class="qt">“Although members of the public who regard homosexuality as immoral may be shocked, offended or disturbed by the commission by others of private homosexual acts, this cannot on its own warrant the application of penal sanctions when it is consenting adults alone who are involved.” (para 46)</p>
<p class="para">Or consider the UK Government’s ban on gays in the military which was only ended after successful article 8 challenges were brought in Strasbourg.</p>
