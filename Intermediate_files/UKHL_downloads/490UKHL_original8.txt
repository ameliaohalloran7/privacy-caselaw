<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;191. My Lords I think, given the regrettable length of this opinion, I should try and summarise my views about the principles that apply and the practice that should be followed in surety wife cases.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue as between the surety wife and the lender bank is whether the bank may rely on the apparent consent of the wife to the suretyship transaction.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the bank knows that the surety wife's consent to the transaction has been procured by undue influence or misrepresentation, or if it has shut its eyes to the likelihood that that was so, it may not rely on her apparent consent.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the wife's consent has in fact been procured by undue influence or misrepresentation, the bank may not rely on her apparent consent unless it has good reason to believe that she understands the nature and effect of the transaction.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless the case has some special feature, the bank's knowledge that a solicitor is acting for the wife and has advised her about the nature and effect of the transaction  will provide a good reason for the purposes of 3 above.  That will also be so if the bank has a reasonable belief that a solicitor is acting for her and has so advised her.  Written confirmation by a solicitor acting for the wife that he has so advised her will entitle the bank to hold that reasonable belief.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, too, a sufficient explanation of the nature and effect of the transaction given by a senior bank official would constitute good reason for the purposes of 3 above.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are any facts known to the bank which increase the inherent risk that the wife's consent to the transaction may have been procured by the husband's undue influence or misrepresentation, it may be necessary for the bank to be satisfied that the wife has received advice about the transaction from a solicitor independent of the husband before the bank can reasonably rely on the wife's apparent consent.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the bank has not taken reasonable steps to satisfy itself that the wife understands the nature and effect of the transaction, the wife will, subject to such matters as delay, acquiescence, change of position etc., be able to set aside the transaction if her consent was in fact procured by undue influence or misrepresentation.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to special instructions or special circumstances, the duty of a solicitor instructed to act for a wife proposing to stand as surety, or to give security, for her husband's debts is to try and make sure that she understands the nature and effect of the transaction.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;In all surety wife cases the bank should disclose to the surety wife, or to the solicitor acting for her, the amount of the existing indebtedness of the principal debtor to the bank and the amount of the proposed new loan or drawing facility.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to 9 above, a creditor has no greater duty of disclosure to a surety wife than to any other intending surety.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;192. I am in full agreement with the analysis of the applicable principles of law and with the conclusions expressed in the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead.  I believe the analysis I have sought to give in this opinion and my conclusions are consistent with them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;193. I must now turn to the individual cases.</p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<i><p><i>Royal Bank of Scotland Plc v Etridge</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;194. This case comes to the House after a full trial before Judge Behrens, sitting as a judge in the Queen's Bench Division.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;195. Judge Behrens held that even if Mrs Etridge's consent to the bank's charge had been procured by the undue influence of Mr Etridge, the bank had had no notice, constructive or otherwise, of the undue influence.  The Court of Appeal upheld him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;196. The relevant facts were these:</p>
<p>In August 1988 Mr and Mrs Etridge were living in Harewood House, Longparish, Hampshire.  The property stood in Mrs Etridge's sole name.  It was subject to a charge to the bank to secure the indebtedness to the bank of Anthony Thomas &amp; Co, a company owned and controlled by Mr Etridge.  A firm of solicitors, Memery Crystal, had acted for Mr and Mrs Etridge in connection both with the purchase and with the bank's charge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;197. By August 1988 Mr Etridge had an overdraft facility with the bank of £100,000.  He had also borrowed £195,000 from the trustees of a private trust (the Ambetta trustees).  This debt was not secured on Harewood House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;198. In August 1988 Mr and Mrs Etridge decided to sell Harewood House and purchase in its place The Old Rectory, Laverstoke, Hampshire.  Mr Etridge was the contracting purchaser of The Old Rectory.  The purchase price was £505,000.  It was his and Mrs Etridge's intention that The Old Rectory would, on completion of the purchase, be conveyed to Mrs Etridge alone.  Memery Crystal were instructed to act in the sale of Harewood House but another firm, Robert Gore &amp; Co, were instructed by Mr Etridge to act in the purchase of The Old Rectory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;199. The purchase of The Old Rectory was to be financed partly out of the proceeds of the sale of Harewood House and partly out of new money to be advanced by the bank.  In addition, money was to be advanced by the Ambetta trustees.  The financial arrangements were fairly complex and were negotiated by Mr Etridge.  Mrs Etridge played no part in the negotiations.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;200. The sale price of Harewood House was £240,000.  The net proceeds, after the Anthony Thomas &amp; Co overdraft charged on Harewood House had been repaid, were £142,000 or thereabouts. On the day of completion of the purchase of The Old Rectory, Mr Etridge drew £261,956 odd from the bank, thereby creating an overdraft of £119,915 odd.  The £261,956, plus a further advance of £200,000 from the Ambetta trustees, enabled the amount due on completion to be paid. The debts owing both to the bank and to the Ambetta trustees were to be secured by charges over The Old Rectory.  As between the two chargees, it was agreed that the bank would have priority in respect of £100,000 and interest thereon.  Next would come the debt owing to the Ambetta trustees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;201. On 27 September 1988, the bank had instructed Robert Gore &amp; Co to act for the bank in connection with the charge that the bank was to be granted over The Old Rectory.  The letter of instructions said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Re:&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs S R Etridge<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Purchase of The Old Rectory, Laverstoke,<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Hampshire.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>We understand you act for the above and would advise that as security for existing facilities we require to take a First Legal Charge over the above property.  For Land Registry purposes we are relying on the Legal Charge to the extent of £100,000.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>We enclose the documents detailed below and would ask that you act on our behalf in the completion of our security.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Legal Charge<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Prior to execution, please ensure the property details are correct and inserting further details as may be required.  Please explain the contents and effects of the document to Mrs Etridge, confirming she understands the same by signing the legal advice clause prior to witnessing her signature."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;202. Similar instructions were given to Robert Gore &amp; Co by the Ambetta trustees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;203. On 3 October 1988 Mr and Mrs Etridge attended the offices of Robert Gore &amp; Co and saw Mr Ellis, an employed solicitor with the firm.  Mrs Etridge signed all the documents relating to the acquisition of The Old Rectory, including the bank's charge and the Ambetta trustees' charge.  The bank's charge was expressed to be a security for Mr Etridge's liabilities to the bank and was unlimited in amount.  The Ambetta trustees' charge was expressed to be a security for Mr Etridge's liabilities to the trustees subject to a limit of £395,000.  Mrs Etridge's signature was witnessed by Mr Ellis who endorsed the bank's charge with the words:</p>
<p></p><ul>"I hereby confirm that prior to the execution of this document I explained the contents and effect thereof to [Mrs Etridge] who informed me that he/she understood the same."<p></p></ul>
<p>The Ambetta charge was endorsed with words to the same effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;204. In fact, Mr Ellis gave Mrs Etridge no advice of any kind as to the nature or content of the documents she was signing.  She signed the documents without reading them or seeking any explanation of them.  Her evidence to Judge Behrens was that she did so, trusting her husband and quite unaware that she was creating charges over The Old Rectory.  She said that she was wholly unaware of the extent of Mr Etridge's borrowings.  Judge Behrens accepted this evidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;205. The transfer of The Old Rectory to Mrs Etridge and the two charges were completed on 4 October 1988.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;206. In April 1990 the bank, and in August 1991 the Ambetta trustees, demanded repayment of their respective secured loans.  Both then commenced proceedings for, among other things, possession of The Old Rectory with a view to its sale.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;207. Mrs Etridge's defence was that her signature to the charges had been procured by the undue influence of her husband, that the bank and the Ambetta trustees must be taken to have had constructive notice that that was so and that in consequence she was not bound by the charges.  She contended, also, that the bank had constituted Robert Gore &amp; Co its agents for the purpose of giving her advice about the charges and that Mr Ellis' knowledge that he had not done so should, therefore, be attributed to the bank.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;208. As well as defending the proceedings brought against her by the bank and the Ambetta trustees, Mrs Etridge sued Robert Gore &amp; Co for negligence.  The three claims were tried together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;209. Judge Behrens held that even if there had been undue influence by Mr Etridge in procuring Mrs Etridge to agree to the grant of the two charges, notice of that impropriety could not be attributed either to the bank or to the Ambetta trustees.  He held that both the bank and the Ambetta trustees had been entitled to rely on the confirmation, given by Mr Ellis by means of the endorsements on the charges, that Mrs Etridge had had the effect and contents of the charges explained to her (see p 19 of his judgment).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;210. The judge held, also, that "on the evidence before me there was no actual undue influence . . . . ".  He followed this finding, however, by holding that "subject to the manifest disadvantage point there was presumed undue influence within category 2B".  As to manifest disadvantage, he held that there was no manifest disadvantage to Mrs Etridge in the charge granted to the bank.  This was because the liabilities secured by the charge included £100,000 advanced by the bank to Mr Etridge to enable the purchase of The Old Rectory to be completed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;211. The judge held, however, that there was manifest disadvantage to Mrs Etridge in the charge granted to the Ambetta trustees because only £200,000 of the £395,000 secured by the charge had been advanced to enable the purchase of The Old Rectory to be completed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;212. It appears, therefore, that, subject to the judge's conclusion on constructive notice, he would have held that Mrs Etridge was bound by the bank charge but not bound by the Ambetta trustees' charge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;213. As to Mrs Etridge's breach of duty claim against Robert Gore &amp; Co the firm admitted liability to Mrs Etridge for breach of duty but was satisfied on the evidence of Mrs Etridge herself that she would have signed the two charges even if she had had a complete and full explanation of their contents and effect.  So he awarded her only £2 nominal damages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;214. On Mrs Etridge's appeal, the Court of Appeal rejected her challenge to the judge's finding that there had been no actual undue influence but agreed that, subject to manifest disadvantage, there was presumed undue influence within category 2B.  The Court of Appeal agreed, also, that notwithstanding that the bank charge secured Mr Etridge's indebtedness to an unlimited amount, the charge was not to Mrs Etridge's manifest disadvantage.  The Ambetta trustees did not challenge the judge's conclusion that their charge was to the manifest disadvantage of Mrs Etridge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;215. On the constructive notice issue, too, the Court of Appeal agreed with the judge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;216. Mrs Etridge appealed against the judge's conclusion that she was entitled only to nominal damages against Robert Gore &amp; Co.  The Court of Appeal dismissed her appeal on 28 April 1999 [1999] PNLR 839.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;217. In the period during which the appeal to this House has been pending, terms of settlement have been reached between Mrs Etridge and the Ambetta trustees.  So it is only her appeal in the bank's proceedings that is before the House for decision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;218. My Lords, the manner which first Judge Behrens and then the Court of Appeal dealt with the presumption of undue influence and with the part to be played by manifest disadvantage demonstrates, in my opinion, the tangle that the case law in this area has got into.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;219. The presumption of undue influence, whether in a category 2A case, or in a category 2B case, is a rebuttable evidential presumption.  It is a presumption which arises if the nature of the relationship between two parties coupled with the nature of the transaction between them is such as justifies, in the absence of any other evidence, an inference that the transaction was procured by the undue influence of one party over the other.  This evidential presumption shifts the onus to the dominant party and requires the dominant party, if he is to avoid a finding of undue influence, to adduce some sufficient additional evidence to rebut the presumption.  In a case where there has been a full trial, however, the judge must decide on the totality of the evidence before the court whether or not the allegation of undue influence has been proved.  In an appropriate case the presumption may carry the complainant home.  But it makes no sense to find, on the one hand, that there was no undue influence but, on the other hand, that the presumption applies.  If the presumption does, after all the evidence has been heard, still apply, then a finding of undue influence is justified.  If, on the other hand, the judge, having heard the evidence, concludes that there was no undue influence, the presumption stands rebutted.  A finding of actual undue influence and a finding that there is a presumption of undue influence are not alternatives to one another. The presumption is, I repeat, an evidential presumption.  If it applies, and the evidence is not sufficient to rebut it, an allegation of undue influence succeeds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;220. As to manifest disadvantage, the expression is no more than shorthand for the proposition that the nature and ingredients of the impugned transaction are essential factors in deciding whether the evidential presumption has arisen and in determining the strength of that presumption.  It is not a divining-rod by means of which the presence of undue influence in the procuring of a transaction can be identified.  It is merely a description of a transaction which cannot be explained by reference to the ordinary motives by which people are accustomed to act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;221. In the present case, the judge's conclusion that there had been no actual undue influence was reached after considering all the evidence.  There was evidence of the relationship between Mr and Mrs Etridge.  Their relationship was, as one would expect of a married couple living together with the family income being provided by the husband's business activities and with financial decisions affecting the family being taken by the husband, a relationship of trust and confidence by her in him.  But there was no evidence of abuse by Mr Etridge of that relationship, or of any bullying of Mrs Etridge in order to persuade her to support his decisions.  Both the transactions under attack had been entered into in part in order to provide finance for the purchase of The Old Rectory and in part to obtain financial support for Mr Etridge in his business enterprises.  Both had elements disadvantageous to her and elements that were to her advantage.  To draw a distinction between the two charges as to inferences of undue influence that might be drawn was, in my opinion, unreal.  In my view, the judge's conclusion that there had been no undue influence was well justified on the evidence.  That conclusion should have been an end of the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;222. Before your Lordships Mr Mawrey QC, counsel for Mrs Etridge, argued that Mrs Etridge's ignorance of the nature or contents of the documents she was signing and, in particular, her ignorance that she was charging The Old Rectory as a security for her husband's debts, enabled her to contend that she had been induced to sign by her husband's misrepresentation.  Mr Etridge had had a duty to explain to her the nature of the transaction.  His failure to do so constituted a misrepresentation by silence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;223. Mr Mawrey told us that misrepresentation had always been part of Mrs Etridge's case, and indeed it figures in her pleading.  But there is no reference to it in Judge Behrens' judgment.  He made no finding on misrepresentation.  Nor did the Court of Appeal comment on the point.  It is fair to conclude, therefore, that if the misrepresentation point was argued at all below, it could only have been very faintly.  This is not surprising for the point is not sustainable.  First, a misrepresentation must, if it is to lead to an equitable or legal remedy, have led to a false impression about some material matter being held by the victim.  In the present case Mrs Etridge had no impression at all as to the nature of the documents she was signing.  No false impression had been planted on her by Mr Etridge.  Mr Etridge's silence did not lead her to form, or to continue to hold, any false impression.  She did not bother to read the documents that were placed before her for signature, and no one explained them to her, so she did not know what she was signing.  But she was not persuaded to sign by any misrepresentation.  Second, Judge Behrens found as a fact that if the nature and content of the documents had been explained to her, she would still have signed.  So, if there had been any misrepresentation as to the nature and content of the documents, it had no relevant causative effect.  The misrepresentation contention is, in my opinion, for both these reasons a hopeless one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;224. There was, therefore, nothing, no undue influence and no misrepresentation, to which constructive notice could attach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;225. As to constructive notice, the bank was of course aware that Mrs Etridge was offering her property, The Old Rectory, to secure her husband's indebtedness.  The bank was, therefore, on notice of a risk that her consent to grant the security might have been improperly obtained by her husband.  The bank had no particular reason to suspect either undue influence or misrepresentation but the risk, attendant in every case where a wife is being asked to stand surety for her husband's debts, was present.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;226. But Mrs Etridge was, to the knowledge of the bank, being advised by Robert Gore &amp; Co, solicitors.  The solicitors confirmed to the bank, in the event falsely but the bank was not to know that that was so, that they had advised Mrs Etridge about the content and effect of the charge.  That confirmation, from the bank's point of view, reduced the risk that Mrs Etridge's consent to grant the charge might have been improperly obtained.  The possibility that there might have been some such impropriety could never be wholly eliminated.  But the fact that to the bank's knowledge there were solicitors acting for Mrs Etridge, and the fact that they had told the bank that they had advised her about the content and effect of the charge, entitled the bank, in my opinion, to be satisfied that it was safe in relying on her apparent consent.  There were no further steps that the bank could reasonably have been required to take.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;227. Nor, in my opinion, can Robert Gore &amp; Co's knowledge that they had failed to give Mrs Etridge the requisite advice be imputed to the bank.  The solicitors were not the bank's agents for the purpose of advising Mrs Etridge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;228. In my opinion, therefore, Mrs Etridge's appeal fails and should be dismissed.</p>
<i><p><i></i></p>
</i><p><i><i>Barclays Bank plc v Harris</i></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;229. In this case there has not yet been a trial.  Mrs Harris' appeal to your Lordships' House is against an interlocutory order striking-out her Defence and Counterclaim and giving judgment for the bank on its claim for possession.  It must, therefore, be assumed that the primary allegations of fact pleaded by Mrs Harris are true.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;230. Mr and Mrs Harris were in 1988 joint owners of The Old Rectory, Nether Whitacre, Coleshill, Warwickshire.  They had purchased the property in 1976 for £39,000.  By 1988 its value was in the region of £200,000.  There were two mortgages on the property securing in total about £28,000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;231. Mr Harris was an industrial chemist.  He carried on business through the medium of two companies.  One, High Tec Powder Coatings Ltd (High Tec), carried on the business of industrial powder coatings producers and finishers.  High Tec had an issued share capital of £10,000 divided into 10,000 £1 shares of which 2,499 were held by Mr Harris and 2,499 by Mrs Harris.  Mr and Mrs Harris and their son, Peter, were directors of High Tec.  But Mrs Harris took no actual part in the conduct of High Tec's business and is described in the company documents as "Housewife".  Mr Harris had given guarantees of High Tec's liabilities to the company's bankers and to its landlords.  These guarantees were not secured on The Old Rectory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;232. Mr Harris' other company was S T Harris (Powder Coatings Consultant) Ltd (PCC).  Mr Harris' services as a powder coatings consultant were made available to clients through the medium of PCC.  PCC had an issued share capital of £2, of which one £1 share was held by Mr Harris and the other by Mrs Harris.  They were the directors of PCC and Mrs Harris was the company secretary.  As with High Tec, she took no part in PCC's business and was described in the company documents as "Housewife".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;233. By 1988 High Tec was in serious financial difficulties.  Mr Harris' potential liability under the guarantee he had given was £120,000.  He consulted solicitors, Wragge &amp; Co, about how to manage his personal liabilities arising from the failure of High Tec in a way that would enable him to continue to carry on business through PCC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;234. Acting on the advice of Wragge &amp; Co, he arranged banking facilities with Barclays Bank under which the bank would refinance the £28,000 secured under the existing mortgages on The Old Rectory and would provide a loan facility of £100,000 to PCC.  These details were not known to Mrs Harris.  In return the bank required that a guarantee, unlimited in amount, of PCC's liabilities to the bank be given by both Mr and Mrs Harris and that their liability to the bank under this guarantee be secured by a first charge over The Old Rectory.  Mr Harris agreed to this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;235. On 26 October 1988 the bank wrote to Mr Hamlett of Wragge &amp; Co, who the bank knew to be acting for Mr Harris, enclosing the bank's standard form of legal charge and asking Mr Hamlett to arrange to have it signed by Mr and Mrs Harris.  The letter asked Mr Hamlett to confirm that the title deeds to The Old Rectory would be held to the bank's order upon repayment of the existing mortgages and added:  "under the circumstances, it would probably be easiest if you arrange to redeem the outstanding mortgages and register our charge in the usual fashion".  The letter then referred to the guarantee that Mr and Mrs Harris were to give and continued:</p>
<p></p><ul>"I would ask you to explain the nature of the document to both parties and confirm to us that independent legal advice has been given . . ."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;236. On 27 October 1988 Mr and Mrs Harris went to Wragge &amp; Co's offices and had a meeting with Mr Hamlett.  Mrs Harris' pleaded case is that her husband had told her that the bank had agreed to lend PCC some money temporarily, so that he could trade his way out of his financial predicament, that she attended the solicitors' offices at the request of her husband, that Mr Hamlett interviewed them together and showed them a number of legal documents and that her husband told her he wanted her to sign, asking her to trust him.  She pleads that after some discussion between Mr Hamlett and her husband that she did not understand, each of them signed the legal documents.  The legal documents included a guarantee and a legal charge of The Old Rectory.  The legal charge secured Mr and Mrs Harris' liabilities to the bank under the guarantee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;237. Mrs Harris alleges in her pleading that Mr Hamlett was acting for the bank, Mr Harris and for herself (para 3(5) of her defence and counterclaim).  But, as my noble and learned friend, Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough, has pointed out, her solicitor in these proceedings, Mr Holt of Evans Derry Binnion has stated in an affidavit of 28 May 1997 that "insofar as my client is concerned Wragge &amp; Co were not her solicitors" (paragraph 6).  Your Lordships should assume, in my opinion, that Mrs Harris' defence will be amended so as to become consistent with that statement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;238. On 27 October 1988, Mr Hamlett wrote to the bank a letter which said, among other things:</p>
<p></p><ul>"I have explained to Mr &amp; Mrs Harris in detail this morning the effect of the first charge over the property and of the unlimited personal guarantee."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;249. It appears, however, that Mr Hamlett's 27 October letter may not have been received by the bank, or, after receipt, may have gone astray.  On 29 June 1989 the bank wrote to him saying that they did not appear to have received from him the confirmation that they had asked for in their letter of 26 October 1988.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;240. In her defence and counterclaim, Mrs Harris pleaded that her agreement to sign the guarantee and the legal charge had been obtained "in the premises" by her husband's undue influence, or, alternatively, that it was to be presumed that it had been so obtained.  She pleaded that the bank was, or should have been, aware that the transactions were manifestly disadvantageous to her and that the bank had actual or constructive notice of the undue influence.  She pleaded that, in the circumstances, the guarantee and the legal charge were not binding on her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;241. As I have said, Mrs Harris' defence and counterclaim were struck out by the deputy district judge.  She appealed.  Her appeal was heard by Judge Alton, in the Birmingham County Court, who dismissed the appeal.  The judge identified two issues, namely:</p>
<p></p><ul>"whether the bank was potentially on constructive notice   . . . of undue influence, presumed or actual by Mr Harris.  Secondly, if so, whether it took reasonable steps to negative such notice."<p></p></ul>
<p>It was conceded, for the purpose of the strike-out application , that the relationship of trust and confidence between Mr Harris and Mrs Harris brought the case into category 2B where undue influence was to be presumed.  I doubt whether this concession was sound, for there was, I think, also a third issue that arose on the pleadings, namely, whether the facts and matters pleaded by Mrs Harris, "the premises" referred to in her defence and counterclaim, raised any presumption at all or could sustain any arguable case of undue influence.  I will return to this issue.</p>
