<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86.&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the main functions of the law of obligations, contractual or tortious, is to provide, or attempt to provide, a set of yardsticks for determining whether a legal injury has been inflicted on a person (the claimant) by another person (the defendant) and, if so, for determining the amount of the damages that the defendant must pay by way of reparation.  If the two parties are unable to agree, an answer can be found by recourse to litigation.  But the cost of litigation, often excessive both in absolute terms and in relation to the amount in dispute, and the inevitable delay, worry and anxiety that accompany court proceedings provide impelling reasons why the yardsticks by means of which legal liability is to be measured should be kept as simple and uncomplicated as practicable.  The common law is, and always will be, in a constant state of development, adjusting to changes in social habits, technological changes, changes in notions of what is fair and of what justice requires.  From time to time Parliament intervenes and statutory changes to the law are made.  Otherwise the changes come about by means of case law.  But however the changes come about it is, in my opinion, of the greatest importance that sight is never lost of the need to try and keep the law simple so as to avoid, so far as possible, recourse to litigation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case it is proposed that a distinction should be drawn between persons who are too impecunious to be able to afford to pay spot rates for car hire and others who are financially able to do so.  The former can recover in full the charges for car hire made by credit-hire companies; the latter can only recover the spot rate level of charge.  In my respectful opinion this result will do a disservice to the law.  What is to be the test of sufficient impecuniosity?  The suggestion has been made that lack of possession of a credit card or a debit card might be taken as an indication of sufficient impecuniosity.  But there are still many people in this country who keep cash in their houses, would be accounted quite well-off by most standards, but who do not have credit or debit cards.  Some people have bank accounts and overdraft facilities.  Their accounts may be consistently overdrawn but within the facility.  They have no spare cash but the facility to borrow.  How, sensibly, can their position be distinguished from that of those like Mr Lagden who, similarly, have no spare cash but have no bank overdraft facility?  If Mr Lagden is to be entitled to re-imbursement of Helphire's financing charge, why should the others not be entitled to re-imbursement of their bank's financing charge?  In each case it could be said that without the financing the replacement vehicle could not have been hired.  It would be equally reasonable for all of these to enter into a Helphire type of credit-hire agreement and equally foreseeable that they would want to do so.  Indeed, I think it would be very difficult to construct a case in which it was not reasonable for the innocent owner of a car damaged by the negligence of another to enter into a credit-hire agreement in order to obtain a substitute car while the damaged car was being repaired.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88.&nbsp;&nbsp;A criterion of reasonableness as a test for recovery of the full credit hire charges would be easy and simple to apply.   It was the test proposed by the majority in the Court of Appeal and by Lord Nicholls in the House of Lords in <i>Dimond v Lovell</i>.  But that criterion is barred by the majority opinion in <i>Dimond v Lovell</i>.  The <i>Dimond v Lovell</i> principle, if applied to all cases, too would provide a simple and uncomplicated yardstick.  The injured party would recover the spot rate charge but no more.  But the impecuniosity, no other choice, exception that your Lordships are introducing is not based on any principle that can be reconciled with <i>Dimond v Lovell</i> and is conceptually imprecise.  It will, I believe, prove an obstacle to the swift and economical settlement of a very large number of simple cases.  I think it will be a disservice to the development of the law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, my Lords, I would have allowed this appeal.</p>
<p><b>LORD WALKER OF GESTINGTHORPE</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I have the misfortune to differ from the majority of your Lordships as to the disposal of this appeal, I will state my reasons briefly at the end of this opinion.  But the House is, I understand, unanimously of the view that we should lay to rest what is left of <i>Liesbosch Dredger (Owners of) v Owners of SS Edison</i> <i>(The Liesbosch) </i>[1933]  AC 449, and I wish to say something on that topic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91.&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts of the case are well known.  They are summarised in a valuable article by Professor Brian Coote ("Damages, <i>The Liesbosch</i>, and Impecuniosity" [2001] CLJ 511) to which I gladly acknowledge my indebtedness.  For present purposes it is sufficient to note that as a result of the sinking of <i>The Liesbosch</i> no dredging took place at the harbour for over six months, and for a year after that <i>The Adria</i> (an older but larger dredger) was hired by the syndicate (together with a tug and two hopper barges) at high rates.  Then the Patras Harbour Board purchased <i>The Adria</i> and resold it on easy terms to the syndicate (which had not had the funds to make an outright purchase a year before).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92.&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Coote closely analyses the progress of the litigation through different courts, commenting (at p 513) that the proceedings:</p>
<p></p><ul>"are illustrations of the truth that the answers a court will, or should, give depend crucially on how it classifies the problem before it".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Langton J (on a motion to vary the Admiralty Registrar's report) counsel for the appellant defendants argued that the case was concerned with remoteness of damage; counsel for the respondent plaintiffs argued that the issue was "minimising the damages" (<i>The Edison</i> [1931]  P 230, 232).  Langton J (at the beginning of what Greer L J in the Court of Appeal, [1932] P 52, 74, called a "very breezy judgment") recorded (at p 233) that counsel for the appellants had pressed on him:</p>
<p></p><ul>" … that the main question in issue raises a novel and most important point in the law of damages … It was accordingly disappointing to hear from [counsel for the plaintiffs] that the case presented no opportunity for blazing a trail for the enlightenment of future generations, and was in truth confined to a very ordinary question of fact which the registrar had already determined in his favour".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Langton J upheld the registrar although he did observe (at p 239):</p>
<p></p><ul>"I can imagine few things more maddeningly provoking than to be called upon, as a consequence of sinking a somewhat elderly dredger, to pay a sum amounting to more than twice her value when generously computed".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the point which was seized on by the Court of Appeal.  The registrar had valued the sunken dredger at a little over £9,000, the sum at which the Patras Harbour Board had purchased <i>The Adria</i> for resale to the syndicate.  <i>The Liesbosch</i> had been purchased for £4,000 and (apparently after some expenditure on refitting) was insured for £5,250.  Scrutton LJ quoted Langton J's remark and observed caustically [1932] P 52, 58:</p>
<p></p><ul>"But it does not seem to have occurred to him that to pay twice the value generously computed of the ship you have sunk suggests that something has gone wrong with the assessment".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94.&nbsp;&nbsp;Scrutton LJ reviewed numerous authorities as to the measure of damages for the total loss of a profitable vessel,  and (at 65) quoted Gorell Barnes J in <i>The Harmonides</i> [1903]  P 1, 6:</p>
<p></p><ul>"the real test … is … what is the value [of the vessel] to the owners, as a going concern, at the time the vessel was sunk".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scrutton L J added:</p>
<p></p><ul>"But if this is 'the value' of the ship to which the claimant is entitled, payable at the time of the loss, I do not see any room for the addition of profits on an existing contract which would have been made but for the loss.  Suppose the lost ship is under a ten years' charter, is the claimant to have both the value of the ship as a going concern at the time of the loss, <i>and</i> the profits he would have made under the ten years' charter?  The value of the ship is an estimate, or rough capitalisation, of the earning power of the ship for its life.  You cannot give both the value of the ship and the profits it would probably earn".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greer L J followed much the same line of reasoning.  He thought (at 68) that the plaintiffs' case was based on the fallacy that all loss in any way causally connected with a breach of duty was recoverable, subject only to the requirement to mitigate loss.  Slesser LJ agreed with both judgments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95.&nbsp;&nbsp;Had the plaintiffs not appealed to your Lordships' House the case would probably have earned no more than a passing reference in the textbooks.  It would have been no more than an example of an error of double counting made by the registrar, not corrected by the Admiralty judge but corrected by the Court of Appeal.  However there was a further appeal, the main ground being ([1933] AC 449, 451-2) that the hiring of <i>The Adria</i> was a reasonable and natural result of the sinking of <i>The Liesbosch</i>, and that the defendants must take the plaintiffs (in terms of affluence as well as in terms of health) as they found them.  The respondents supported the reasoning of the Court of Appeal without any particular emphasis (so far as appears from the report) on the plaintiffs' impecuniosity. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96.&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the background to Lord Wright's famous and controversial speech, in which the rest of the House concurred.  I need not repeat the often-cited passage (at p 460) on remoteness of damage and "consequences of consequences".  But it is noteworthy that (at p 461) Lord Wright quoted from the speech of Lord Collins in <i>Clippens Oil Co v Edinburgh &amp; District Water Trustees</i> [1907]  AC 291, 303 ("the wrongdoer must take his victim talem qualem, and if the position of the latter is aggravated because he is without the means of mitigating it, so much the worse for the wrongdoer, who has got to be answerable for the consequences flowing from his tortious act").  Lord Wright then observed:</p>
<p></p><ul>"But, as I think it is clear that Lord Collins is here dealing not with measure of damage, but with the victim's duty to minimise damage, which is quite a different matter, the dictum is not in point".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Wright, at pp 460-461, treated the plaintiffs' impecuniosity as "extraneous" or "extrinsic", in contrast to "that physical delicacy or weakness which may aggravate the damage in the case of personal injuries".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether a victim's duty to minimise damage is indeed "quite a different matter" from measure of damage is by no means obvious, although (as so often) it ultimately comes down to choice of terminology.  That can be illustrated by a small anthology of citations.  In <i>Burns v MAN Automotive (Aust) Pty Ltd</i> (1986)  161 CLR 653, a decision of the High Court of Australia in which <i>The Liesbosch</i>, while not actually departed from, was referred to with little enthusiasm, Gibbs CJ said (at p 659)  that the reason for Lord Wright's distinction was not altogether clear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Radford v De Froberville</i> [1977]  1 WLR 1262, 1272, Oliver J said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"No doubt the measure of damages and the plaintiff's duty and ability to mitigate are logically distinct concepts (see for instance, the speech of Lord Wright in <i>Liesbosch</i> <i>(Dredger) v SS Edison (Owners) </i>[1933]  AC 449, 456-469).  But to some extent, at least, they are mirror images …"<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Dodd Properties Ltd v Canterbury City Council</i> [1980]  1 WLR 433 Megaw LJ (at p 453) and Browne LJ (at p 456) agreed with Oliver J's observations. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Koch Marine Inc v D'Amica Societa Di Navigazione ARL (The Elena d'Amico)</i> [1980]  1 Lloyd's Rep 75, 88 Robert Goff J set out the three heads of mitigation as listed in <i>McGregor on Damages</i> (then the 13th ed (1972), pp 145f, now 16th ed (1997), pp185f) that is non-recovery for avoidable loss; recovery for loss incurred in reasonable attempts to avoid loss; and non-recovery for avoided loss.  Robert Goff J then observed:</p>
<p></p><ul>" … these three aspects of mitigation are all really aspects of a wider principle which is that, subject to the rules of remoteness, the plaintiff can recover, but can only recover, in respect of damage suffered by him which has been caused by the defendant's legal wrong.  In other words, they are aspects of the principle of causation".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100.&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Goff J was in my respectful opinion right to see mitigation of loss as an aspect (or category) of the larger principle of causation.  Although almost all the authorities cited to your Lordships on this appeal have been concerned with after-the-event expenditure by the claimant (replacing, reinstating or repairing property destroyed or damaged by the defendant's breach of duty) action to mitigate loss does not always require the expenditure of money.  A failure to mitigate may, for instance, consist of an unreasonable refusal to undergo free surgical treatment after a bodily injury (see for instance <i>McAuley v London Transport Executive</i> [1957]  2 LR 500). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the claimant does spend money after an accident in which his property has been damaged, that expenditure may well be described as incurred as part of his duty to mitigate.  If the claimant's car is damaged and is unserviceable in its damaged state, but is repairable at reasonable cost, he cannot refuse to have it repaired and claim for a total loss.  But his hiring of a replacement car while the repairs are being carried out cannot be analysed in quite the same way.  The claimant's hire of the replacement car will (by turning a claim for general damages into a claim for special damages) quantify and increase (rather than minimising) the damages which can be recovered.  Your Lordships were told that where a claimant has not hired a replacement car, the county court routinely awards general damages at the rate of about £10 a day for loss of the use of the car (whereas hire of a replacement car may cost anything from at least twice to several times that figure).  This notion of a substituted expense has been explained by Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough in his speech in <i>Dimond v Lovell</i> [2002]  1 AC 384, 406. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the development of the law in the 70 years since <i>The Liesbosch</i> was decided, it has in my view become apparent that Lord Wright's sharp distinction between mitigation of damage and measure (meaning, as I understand it, heads) of damage it is not helpful.  Nor do I think his general classification of impecuniosity as "extraneous" or "extrinsic" is consistent with the modern state of the law (although loss attributable to impecuniosity, on a claim in contract or tort, may on examination prove to be too remote).  Many recent cases, both in England and in the Commonwealth, have noted that <i>The Liesbosch</i> has been distinguished so often that its authority has been greatly attenuated.  The most recent case is <i>Alcoa Minerals of Jamaica Inc v Broderick</i> [2002]  1 AC 371, an appeal from Jamaica to the Privy Council when the Board included my noble and learned friends, Lord Slynn of Hadley and Lord Hope of Craighead.  In my view the time has now come to say that the law has moved on from Lord Wright's exposition in <i>The Liesbosch,</i> although the actual decision in that case can be readily justified by the reasoning of Scrutton and Greer LJJ in the Court of Appeal.  The correct principle is that stated in the speech of Lord Hope, with which I am (so far as <i>The Liesbosch</i> is concerned) in full agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103.&nbsp;&nbsp;I find myself unable to agree with the majority of your Lordships as to the disposal of the appeal.  I will state my reasons as briefly as possible.  The starting point is the majority view (of Lord Browne-Wilkinson, Lord Hoffmann and Lord Hobhouse) in <i>Dimond v Lovell</i> that the additional benefits which the claimant obtained (additional, that is, to the use of the replacement car provided by the accident hire company), although obtained by a course of action which was reasonable, were not compensatable loss.  The correctness of that view is not challenged. (It was submitted that Lord Hoffmann and Lord Hobhouse differed in their reasoning, but for present purposes at least I do not discern any significant difference).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104.&nbsp;&nbsp;Should your Lordships reach a different conclusion in a case where the additional benefits were obtained by a course of action which was not merely reasonable, but was (as the county court judge held) the only course of action by which the claimant could obtain a replacement car?  I would answer that question in the negative, both as a matter of principle and for reasons of policy.  As a matter of principle, it would not in my view be right to permit a claimant's impecuniosity, however much it may attract sympathy, to enable him to obtain compensation under a head which English law does not regard as part of his compensatable loss.  This claimant's choice was restricted by his extreme impecuniosity.  The freedom of choice open to other claimants might be restricted by all sorts of other circumstances, such as the remote geographical location in which an accident occurred, the specialised character of the claimant's vehicle, or a dislocation of the normal market caused by exceptional demand.  The proposed modification of the principle in <i>Dimond v Lovell</i> seems dangerously open-ended.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not lost sight of the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Harbutt's "Plasticine" Ltd v Wayne Tank and Pump Co Ltd</i> [1970]  1 QB 447, in which Lord Denning MR (at p 468) referred to the claimant as having had no choice, and Widgery LJ referred (at p 473) to a situation where "no reasonable alternative can be provided".  But in that case the rebuilt factory, although of a different shape, was the same size and had the same facilities as before.  The Court of Appeal recognised that an element of betterment, if pleaded and proved, would have had to be accounted for.  They might have taken that view even if the betterment (not being merely "new for old") had been forced on the claimant by planning or health and safety requirements or other outside circumstances.  But in any event the present case is different, since the element of betterment is of a quite different character and has never been regarded as a head of recoverable damage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106.&nbsp;&nbsp;To my mind policy considerations point to the same conclusion.  The concept of a claimant being unable to hire a replacement car (otherwise than through an accident hire company) because of impecuniosity is, as was acknowledged in the course of argument, a vague one.  In practice, many claimants will go to an accident hire company if they can, simply because of its convenience, without asking themselves whether they could afford the alternative of hiring from a conventional car-hire firm; and if they do consider the alternative, the choice is likely to depend on temperament and resourcefulness, rather than on some minute calculation of their margin of solvency.  To allow the exception would be liable to lead to an increase in contested small claims, contrary to the public interest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore allow this appeal.</p>
