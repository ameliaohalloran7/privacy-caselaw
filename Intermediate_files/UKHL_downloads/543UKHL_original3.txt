<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) the use by a person of his own name or address</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ………</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; provided the use is in accordance with honest practices in industrial or commercial matters"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  and see Article 6.1 of the Directive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Whether Limited is entitled under section 11(2) to carry on business as "Scandecor" depends</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  (i)  on whether paragraph (a) of section 11(2) applies not only to individuals but also to companies; and </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) on whether Limited, in continuing to trade as Scandecor after the revocation of its trade mark licence, is complying with the "honest practices" proviso to section 11(2).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. The issue under (i) above depends upon the correct construction of the statutory language.  I am in agreement with Lord Nicholls' opinion that section 11(2)(a) does apply to companies.  He has, however, expressed the opinion that the point is not acte clair, and I do not dissent from that.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. The issue under (ii) above is one of fact.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. If Limited is entitled to carry on business under the style 'Scandecor' notwithstanding the termination of its trade mark licence, it must follow that the use of the marks by Development or Panther, or by any other licensee of Development, has become "liable to mislead the public".  The public, for this purpose, consists of retailers.  Retailers associate posters and other products sold under the Scandecor mark with Limited.  If Limited can continue to trade as Scandecor, the mark will have ceased to be capable of distinguishing the goods of one undertaking (Development and its licensees) from those of another undertaking (Marketing and Limited):  see section 1(1) of the Act and Article 2 of the Directive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. Under section 46(1)(d) of the 1994 Act, the registration of a trade mark may be revoked if it has become liable to mislead the public "in consequence of the use made of it by the proprietor or with his consent".  The Scandecor reputation acquired by Limited through use of the marks over the period 1979 to 1997 under the licences granted by the proprietor of the marks is the reason why, if Limited can continue to trade as Scandecor, the marks have become "liable to mislead".  Accordingly, registration may be revoked under section 46(1)(d).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. There is a dispute between the parties as to whether revocation under section 46(1) is mandatory or discretionary.  If, on the premise that Limited can continue to trade as Scandecor, the revocation power under section 46(1)(d) is exercisable, it ought, in my opinion, to be exercised.  It could not be right to have the retailer customers or the general public in a position of being unable to tell from which of the two rival undertakings the Scandecor goods which they had purchased, or were proposing to purchase, originated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. On the other hand, if Limited is not able to take advantage of section 11(2), then unless Marketing/Limited can succeed in obtaining the revocation under section 46(1)(d) of the registration of the marks, Development's case must, in my opinion, succeed.  Limited's use of the style "Scandecor" would be a plain and continuing trade mark infringement.  The only defence would be that registration should be revoked (see s. 46(6) of the 1994 Act).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. As I have said, if Limited is entitled under section 11(2) to continue to trade as Scandecor the case for revocation seems to me to be very clear.  But if Limited is not so entitled, the revocation case is not, to my mind, nearly so clear.  Marketing/Limited's case for revocation is that Limited's use of the marks over the period 1979 to 1997, in part as distributor of International's products and in part as licensee, has brought about an accrual to Limited of a reputation in the marks that renders the use of them by the proprietor liable to mislead.  But if, after termination of the distributorship and the licence, there is no continuing right for the ex-distributor/licensee, Limited, to trade under the Scandecor name, the existence of its accrued reputation may not be enough to satisfy the section 46(1)(i) criterion.  If it is enough, then every grant of an exclusive licence would potentially put the mark at risk.  This, to my mind, is easily the most difficult point in the case.  It is also, perhaps, the most important, because a decision on the point may have legal and commercial implications for a wide variety of licensing arrangements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. A decision on this point will need to take account of the moment at which Marketing/Limited became, for the purposes of section 1(1) of the Act, a separate "undertaking" from the undertaking of which International, the proprietor and licensor of the marks was a member.  Was it 1979, or 1984, or was it not until the insolvency of International in 1994?  If they all remained members of the same "undertaking" until 1994, it is difficult to see how, in the short period between then and 1997, the marks could have lost their capability of distinguishing the proprietor's undertaking from other undertakings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. In addition, the question whether the use of a mark by a bare exclusive licensee can, in principle, lead to the mark becoming "liable to mislead" for section 46(1) purposes by reason of the association in the public mind of the licensee with the mark is critical to Marketing/Limited's case for revocation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. If Marketing/Limited can succeed in establishing that the criteria of section 46(1)(d) are met, the question whether the revocation power is mandatory or discretionary will then arise.  On the premise that Marketing/Limited are not entitled, so long as the marks remain registered, to trade under the name Scandecor, the answer to the question whether, if the power is discretionary, it should be exercised, is not, to my mind, obvious.  If it is only Development and its new licensees who are entitled to trade as Scandecor, the Scandecor mark will remain capable of distinguishing between the undertaking which they represent and other undertakings. There would not necessarily be any greater or more lasting confusion than would be consequent upon any assignment of a mark unaccompanied by business goodwill (see section 24(1) of the 1994 Act), or upon any revocation of an exclusive licence with the grant of a new licence to another.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66.	For these reasons I agree with Lord Nicholls' opinion that authoritative rulings should be sought from the European Court on the three questions he identifies in paragraphs 49, 50 and 53 of his opinion.</p>
