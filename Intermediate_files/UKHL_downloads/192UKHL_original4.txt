<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons I would allow this appeal.</p>
LORD BROWN OF EATON-UNDER-HEYWOOD
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am grateful to my noble and learned friends Lord Scott of Foscote, Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe and Lord Mance for their very full exposition of the facts of this appeal, the statutory provisions in play and the many authorities in this difficult area of law.  This enables me to state my own opinion in the matter quite shortly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83.&nbsp;&nbsp;Shorn of all detail—indeed, simplified to the very limits of accuracy—the facts are these.  In December 1994 Mr Haward acquired for £60,000 a controlling interest in an agricultural machinery company which he knew from the outset would require the injection of a further £100,000 or so before it turned to profitability but which in the event, despite the injection of some £431,000 in 1995, some £102,000 in 1996, some £509,000 in 1997 and some £208,000 in 1998, failed.  Throughout the whole course of this disastrous enterprise Mr Haward had been advised by Fawcetts, a firm of accountants which had acted for him and his family since 1958.  By, at latest, 6 December 1998 (three years before he issued proceedings against Fawcetts and thus the date at which Mr Haward's knowledge falls to be considered for the purposes of section 14A of the Limitation Act 1980) Mr Haward knew that these sums had become lost to him: the company was hopelessly insolvent.  He believed, however, that his losses were to be explained, not by any deficiency in the advice he had received when making his investments but rather by a variety of damaging economic factors: initially adverse trading conditions such as the general agricultural recession and the effect of BSE, and later by a number of detrimental activities on the part of the company's sales director.  It was not until May 1999 that Mr Haward for the first time began to question the soundness of Fawcetts' investment advice and only then did the investigations start which finally led to the issue of a negligence claim against them in December 2001.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in these circumstances that the central question arises: at what date did Mr Haward know that "the damage was attributable in whole or in part to the act or omission which is alleged to constitute negligence" within the meaning of section 14A(8)(a) of the 1980 Act?  If it was before 6 December 1998, section 14A cannot avail Mr Haward: his claim would then be restricted to the damage he sustained after 6 December 1995 (six years before the issue of proceedings, the primary limitation period).  If, however, it was after 6 December 1998, then he can benefit from section 14A's alternative three-year period of limitation.  This preliminary point accordingly concerns Mr Haward's initial investment of £60,000 made in 1994 and the further advances of some £431,000 made in 1995.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85.&nbsp;&nbsp;"The damage" for the purposes of section 14A(8)(a) is "the damage in respect of which damages are claimed" within the meaning of section 14A(6)(a) which I take to mean the loss of the sums invested: a loss, as already stated, which was known to Mr Haward at latest by December 1998 and the loss for which he seeks compensation in his claim for damages.  When, however, did Mr Haward know that this loss was "attributable in whole or in part to the act or omission which is alleged to constitute negligence"?  That is the critical question.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it enough that Mr Haward knew, as plainly he did, that Fawcetts advised him that this was a sound and suitable investment (both initially and as to the subsequent advancement of further funds to the company) and that it was on the basis of this advice that he went ahead with it?  Or did he need to know more than that and, if so, what more? Clearly, for time to start running,  he did not have to know that Fawcetts had, as a matter of law, acted negligently in the giving of their advice—see section 14A(9). On the facts of this case the question ultimately seems to me to come down to this: to set time running did Mr Haward need to know not only that the investment was made on Fawcetts' advice but also that that advice had not been based on the kind of investigations which must necessarily be undertaken before any such advice can be reliably tendered?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87.&nbsp;&nbsp;As Lord Mance has pointed out, were Fawcetts able to rely upon section 14A (10) to assert constructive knowledge on Mr Haward's part, their case here would be a strong one even if the knowledge required  was of their failure to make a preliminary investigation into the company before the advice to acquire it was given.  Having regard to the huge scale of his losses from the outset, Mr Haward ought surely to have sought expert advice and set in train the consideration of a possible claim against Fawcetts long before he did.  Given, however, that Fawcetts' case is based solely on Mr Haward's actual knowledge, to my mind it must fail if anything more is required than that Mr Haward knew that his loss might well have resulted from an investment made on Fawcetts' advice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having, I confess, changed my mind upon the point, I have finally come to the conclusion that nothing more <i>is</i> needed.  I had earlier been attracted to the view that the analogy here was with <i>Dobbie v Medway Health Authority</i> [1994]  1 WLR 1234, as thereafter analysed in <i>Hallam-Eames v Merrett Syndicates</i> (1995) [2001] Lloyd's Rep PN 178:  unless and until Mrs Dobbie knew that her removed breast had in fact been healthy, time would not start running against her.  So too here, it has been suggested: until the investment was known not merely to have been lost but to have been intrinsically unsound when made (i.e. an ill-judged and ill-advised investment from the outset rather merely than one which proved unsuccessful as a result of subsequent events) time should not run.  I have come to recognise, however, a critical difference between the two cases.  In <i>Dobbie's</i> case what was unknown was not the attributability of the damage to the defendant's act but rather the very fact of damage: Mrs Dobbie would clearly have suffered none had her removed breast in fact been unhealthy; she would have been better off without it.  Similarly, as Lord Walker has explained, <i>H F Pension Trustees Limited v Ellison</i> [1999]  Lloyd's Rep PN 489 should have been differently decided, not because of any doubts about attributability but rather on the basis that the trustees there did not know that they had suffered any damage until they learned of the impropriety of the payments made and the consequent likelihood of tax losses.  In both those cases, however, there could have been no question but that, once the fact of damage was known to the respective claimants, time started running.  It was not necessary for Mrs Dobbie also to have known that the reason her healthy breast had been removed was because the surgeon had failed first to carry out a sufficient examination of the lump to be satisfied of its malignancy; nor would it have been necessary for the trustees in the pension case to have known what underlay the incorrect advice they had received when making the payments.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, by contrast with those two cases, it is now common ground that Mr Haward knew that he had suffered the relevant damage by the material date.  Fawcetts' advice was more than merely the <i>sine qua non</i> of that loss.  There is no parallel here with Hoffmann LJ's illustration in <i>Hallam-Eames</i> of the member's agent taking the Name to lunch and persuading him to join Lloyd's where he then suffered losses—an event which would clearly not have been causally relevant in the context of an allegation of negligence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90.&nbsp;&nbsp;What the claimant must know to set time running is the essence of the act or omission to which his damage is attributable, the substance of what ultimately comes to be pleaded as his case in negligence.  That essence or substance here could no doubt be characterised in either of two ways: either as the act of recommending investment in the company (or omitting to caution against it—on the particular parts of this case these are two sides of the same coin), or, with greater particularity, the act of recommending investment without first carrying out the investigations necessary to justify such positive advice.  Having at first preferred the latter characterisation, I have come to prefer the former.  True, under the former the claimant knows nothing beyond the fact that his advisers led him into what turned out to be a bad investment; he does not know, as under the latter characterisation he would, that he has a justifiable complaint against his advisers.  But he surely knows enough (constructive knowledge aside) to realize that there is a real possibility of his damage having been caused by some flaw or inadequacy in his advisers' investment advice, and enough therefore to start an investigation into that possibility, which section 14A then gives him three years to complete. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the other approach is adopted, time only starts to run once the claimant recognises that a fuller examination of the company's prospects should have been carried out than was in fact carried out, knowledge which Mr Haward only learned here at some unascertained date after the investigation into Fawcetts' conduct had itself begun in May 1999 (when another accountant first suggested to Mr Haward that a negligence claim might lie against Fawcetts).  But what if that suggestion and the investigation which it prompted had themselves been made at a later date still, perhaps very substantially later?  On this approach the limitation period would appear capable of almost limitless extension and for no sufficient reason: unlike the position in <i>Pirelli General Cable Works Ltd v Oscar Faber &amp; Partners</i> [1983] 2 AC 1— the decision which precipitated what is now section 14A of the 1980 Act—there is nothing latent here about the damage or, indeed, about the identity of the prospective defendant.  I recognise, of course, that that does not foreclose the argument on attributability: it provides, however, the relevant context in which it falls to be resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, which are not I think substantially different from those more fully set out in the opinions of my noble and learned friends, I too would allow this appeal and restore the order of Judge Playford QC.</p>
LORD MANCE
<p>My Lords,</p>
<i></i><p><i>Introduction</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under s.2 of the Limitation Act 1980, the basic period within which a claimant must bring a cause of action for negligence is six years from the date when the cause of action accrued. S.14A provides, as its heading states, a "special time limit for negligence actions where facts relevant to cause of action are not known at date of accrual". The period under s.14A(4)(b) and (5) for bringing an action for damages for negligence is three years from the date when the claimant first had "the knowledge required for bringing an action for damages in respect of the relevant damage", where that period expires later than a period of six years from the date when the cause of action accrued.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94.&nbsp;&nbsp;This appeal raises for consideration the nature of "the knowledge required". Having regard to definitions and provisions contained in further subsections of s.14A., the "facts relevant to the current action" about which knowledge is required (subs.(6)(b)) include knowledge "that the damage was attributable in whole or in part to the act or omission which is alleged to constitute negligence" (subs.8(a)), but not knowledge "that any acts or omissions did or did not, as a matter of law, involve negligence" (subs. (9)). What is involved in knowledge that damage was "attributable" to an act or omission alleged to constitute negligence? How and at what level of particularity is such an act or omission to be described? And at what point does it become a (statutorily irrelevant) matter of law whether such an act or omission involved negligence?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95.&nbsp;&nbsp;The further subsections of s.14A read:</p>
<p></p><ul>"(6) … 'the knowledge required for bringing an action for damages in respect of the relevant damage' means knowledge both -<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;of the material facts about the damage in respect of which damages are claimed; and<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;of the other facts relevant to the current action mentioned in subsection (8) below.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purposes of subsection (6)(a) above, the material facts about the damage are such facts about the damage as would lead a reasonable person who had suffered such damage to consider it sufficiently serious to justify his instituting proceedings for damages against a defendant who did not dispute liability and was able to satisfy a judgment.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(8)&nbsp;&nbsp;The other facts referred to in subsection (6)(b) above are -<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;that the damage was attributable in whole or in part to the act or omission which is alleged to constitute negligence; and<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;the identity of the defendant; and<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;if it is alleged that the act or omission was that of a person other than the defendant, the identity of that person and the additional facts supporting the bringing of an action against the defendant.<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowledge that any acts or omissions did or did not, as a matter of law, involve negligence is irrelevant for the purposes of subsection (5) above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purposes of this section a person's knowledge includes knowledge which he might reasonably have been expected to acquire -</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;from facts observable or ascertainable by him; or</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;from facts ascertainable by him with the help of appropriate expert advice which it is reasonable for him to seek;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a person shall not be taken by virtue of this subsection to have knowledge of a fact ascertainable only with the help of expert advice so long as he has taken all reasonable steps to obtain (and, where appropriate, to act on) that advice."</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The claim in outline </p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case the three claimants are Mr Haward, W. J. Haward Limited, a family firm of building contractors established in 1902 and under Mr Haward's control since his father's death in 1992, and W. J. Haward Family Trust No. 1, a family trust of which the trustees were Mr Haward and, until 1999, Mr Trevor Austreng of the defendants, Fawcetts. The focus for limitation purposes is on Mr Haward's knowledge, which it is agreed the other two claimants are to be treated as sharing. The claimants allege that Fawcetts, accountants acting as their advisers, were negligent in relation to advice given or not given both in late 1994 and at subsequent dates. They allege that, in reliance on such advice, on 9th December 1994 Mr Haward acquired for £60,000 a 60% shareholding in Kings Stag Engineering Limited (which changed its name in 1995 to Haward Agriculture Limited and which I shall call HAL throughout), and the Trust No. 1 acquired for £100,000 the leasehold of HAL's premises, and at later dates Mr Haward made substantial further investments in or loans to HAL, using monies advanced to him by the second claimant company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97.&nbsp;&nbsp;A business plan for 1995 was prepared before the acquisition of HAL, upon which plan it is alleged that Fawcetts were instructed to advise. The plan included this optimistic assessment:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The Profit and Loss and Balance Sheet Forecasts look extremely promising, and have been carefully prepared in order to give an accurate picture for 1995. All the categories have been studied and I feel the end result is more than satisfactory".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan contemplated that only £106,745 would need to be advanced to HAL during 1995. In the event, the sums advanced by the end of 1995 totalled £431,000. The business plan contemplated a loss in that accounting year of £5,520, whereas the loss in the event totalled £266,340. Further loans were made in 1996 totalling £102,985 and in 1997 totalling £509,525, and HAL made net losses in those years of £27,276 and £400,062. The general picture therefore during this period was one of repeated, unexpected requirements for cash injections. The annual directors' reports for HAL, prepared for signature by Mr Austreng, remained nevertheless optimistic that the company would turn round. The report for 1995, signed on 29th October 1996, said that:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Following the re-structuring at the end of 1994 - and throughout 1995 - significant investment has been undertaken in order to put the company in a position from which it can expect to benefit from anticipated increases in turnover. This has resulted in a large trading loss in 1995 but profits are anticipated to be earned from the middle of 1996 and onwards."<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>That for 1996, signed on 20th October 1997, read:<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"The re-structuring of the company … has continued during 1996. Losses continued until mid-1996 at which time the directors are pleased to report that monthly profits were achieved, albeit not sufficient to cover the previous losses. Trading conditions remain difficult and further losses are now anticipated throughout much of 1997. However the company has adequate resources to continue trading and the longer term outlook remains optimistic."<p></p></ul>
<p>As this report records, HAL had been afflicted by difficult trading conditions, which included a general market decline, the BSE crisis and the strong pound. In mid-1998 issues also emerged about the conduct of its affairs by its day-to-day manager, Mr Brunt. By 6th December 1998, the judge found, Mr Haward knew that "the payments already made had gone" and had become effectively or at least largely a loss. This loss represents the damage which the claimants now claim to have been attributable to negligent advice on Fawcetts' part regarding investment in HAL.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98.&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreed Statement of Facts and Issues put before the House records in paragraph 18 that</p>
<p></p><ul>"The essence of the [claimants'] case was that Fawcetts gave advice that led to the original purchase or subsequent expenditure, alternatively failed to give advice when advice was needed, in consequence of which the original purchase or subsequent expenditure resulted".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Statement goes on to identify as critical issues in this case: "What did Mr Haward need to know in order to know, per s.14A(8)(a) of the Act, that 'the damage was attributable in whole or in part to the act or omission which is alleged to constitute negligence'?" and, secondly, "what in this case is/are the acts or omissions which is/are alleged to constitute negligence?". From this, it is clear that the claimants put in issue whether knowledge of the bare matters asserted in paragraph 18 (of which Mr Haward on any view knew, at least as regards advice actually given) was to be equated with knowledge of the acts or omissions now alleged by them to constitute negligence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99.&nbsp;&nbsp;Consistently with this, both before the judge in argument at first instance and before your Lordships, the claimants' submissions have referred to complaints that Fawcetts did not do their "homework" before advising the claimants in favour of the acquisition of, and the further investments in, HAL and/or in failing to advise them against further investments. In a note written to the judge with the consent of counsel for Fawcetts after the oral hearing, counsel for the claimants argued that, in addition to knowing that advice had been given or not given, Mr Haward "must at least have known that the advice or absence of advice was on the basis of inadequate investigation", although counsel accepted that it was not necessary to know "the detailed allegations with regard to what due diligence exercises or audits should have been undertaken". Finally, the claimants' written Case before your Lordships describes the complaint in paragraph 14 as being that there was "inadequate consideration of the underlying state of the Business by [Fawcetts] both prior to and following the purchase". Eliminating as far as possible any suggestion of negligence or fault, the claimants' claim may on this basis, in my view, be broadly categorised as being for loss flowing from advice or absence of advice in circumstances where Fawcetts had not done certain preparatory work or given any or full consideration to information available to them, and as a result did not identify (or therefore advise about) problems in HAL's affairs and accounts, affecting the soundness from the outset of HAL and investments made in HAL. In short, omissions on Fawcetts' part led them to an unsound assessment and inappropriate advice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100.&nbsp;&nbsp;The amended particulars of claim include detailed allegations of negligence which are to similar effect. Thus, they complain in paragraph 18 that Fawcetts failed "properly to carry out due diligence" in respect of HAL prior to 9th December 1994, in that they</p>
<p></p><ul>"(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;failed to carry out a stock-take …,<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;failed to consider at all/adequately the 1995 Business Plan, Profits Loss and Balance Sheet and failed to advise the Claimants at all/adequately as to its inaccuracies and Profits Loss and Balance Sheet forecasts;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;failed to advise the Claimants at all/adequately as to the prospect of [HAL] making a profit as anticipated in the 1995 Business Plan; and<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;failed properly to advise in respect of financial and other information considered by Fawcetts".<p></p></ul>
There are also complaints that Fawcetts failed to advise the claimants as to the prospective acquisition generally and more specifically as to the prudence of acquiring a controlling interest in HAL and subsequent investment therein (paragraph 19); that they failed to advise as to the correct basis for an evaluation of HAL, as to its proper value and as to the proper consideration for a 60% controlling shareholding (paragraph 20), that they failed to advise as to the tax advantages of incorporating HAL as a subsidiary of the second claimant, so that HAL losses could be set against the second claimant's profits (paragraph 21) and that they failed to advise Mr Haward and the second claimant that the latter could (then) have planned its developments and disposals in a tax advantageous manner (paragraph 22). In paragraph 29 it is further alleged that
<p></p><ul>"Fawcetts failed to advise the Claimants in any Board Meeting or on any other occasion …:-<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;that there were fundamental errors in the accounting procedures utilised by the Company in the production of the Management Accounts;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;that the monthly Management Accounts showed considerable and unacceptable swings in direct cost percentages;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;that the Company was not operating as anticipated/in an "orderly and controlled manner"/at all; or<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;that the Company was running at a loss not anticipated upon 9 December 1994 or in the 1995 Business Plan."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first three points go to matters which it is said that Fawcetts should have discovered from materials available to them. The final point must have been obvious, and must no doubt be read in conjunction with the previous complaints about Fawcetts' failure to ascertain HAL's real financial position from work they should have done and material they saw or should have seen and on the basis of which, it is said, they should have advised the claimants or advised them differently. It is said that, had Fawcetts fulfilled their duties of skill and care, and as a result advised the claimants properly, HAL would not have been acquired or acquired on the same basis and further investments and loans would not have been made in HAL and to HAL after its acquisition.</p>
<i>The proceedings to date
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102.&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic six year period for any claim for damages in tort in respect of the acquisition of, or any subsequent investment in, HAL expired six years after such acquisition or investment (cf <i>Forster v. Outred</i> [1982] 1 WLR 86). Any claim in contract would also be time-barred by then, if not earlier. Proceedings were issued on 6th December 2001. So, in response to the claim, Fawcetts pleaded that any claims for breaches of contractual duty occurring, and any tortious claims for losses accruing, prior to 6th December 1995 were statute barred. In reply, the claimants pleaded that the earliest date on which they had the knowledge referred to in subsection (5) of s.14A of the 1980 Act was 17th December 1999 (a date modified in oral submissions to May 1999). Pursuant to an order made on 26th November 2002 by Master Leslie, the issues of limitation were tried as preliminary issues before HHJ Playford QC, who decided them in favour of Fawcetts on 15th April 2003. The Court of Appeal (Potter LJ, Jonathan Parker LJ and Charles J) allowed the claimants' appeal on 11th March 2004, and the House gave leave to appeal on 14th July 2004.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103.&nbsp;&nbsp;On one view, HHJ Playford considered that the only knowledge required of the claimants was knowledge that (a) sums were invested; (b) that the investments were made either with or without the defendants' advice; and (c) that the investments so made had become lost; and that all such matters were patent, while everything else was either a mere particular of negligence (as he described the allegation of failure to do the necessary homework) or a matter of law irrelevant under subsection (9) of s.14A. HHJ Playford said that it was</p>
<p></p><ul>"unwarranted, especially in cases of financial advice given to persons under no disability, to put a gloss on the Statute so that what is required is "knowledge that there is a real possibility that the damage sustained was caused by the acts or omissions said to constitute negligence, sufficient to make it reasonable to investigate whether or not there is a case against the defendant", … and I do not understand Brooke LJ to be saying that in <i>Spargo v. North Essex District Health Authority </i>(1977) PIQR 235)."<p></p></ul>
<p>Earlier in the same paragraph in his judgment HHJ Playford said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Mr Black [counsel for the claimants] submits that 'the essence of a causally relevant act cannot simply be the giving or the not giving of advice'. With that I agree. The Act requires knowledge that the damage was attributable to the act or omission and that means knowledge that the damage is capable of being attributed to the act or omission. But the causal connection between the advice or non-advice and the damage in this case is patent and obvious, especially to a mature businessman and company director".<p></p></ul>
<p>He did not however elaborate on what he meant by the "causal connection" which he thought was "patent". If (as I am inclined to think) all he meant was that it was clear that, but for whatever advice was or was not given, the investments would never have been made and so would never have been lost, that involved, as I shall show, a significant error regarding the statutory test for limitation. At the end of his judgment, HHJ Playford went on "for the sake of completeness only" to consider the claimants' factual case that they had no knowledge that they had any claim against Fawcetts until 1999, and found that the claimants had not discharged the burden on them to establish this. He also recorded that no question of constructive knowledge had been argued before him.</p>
