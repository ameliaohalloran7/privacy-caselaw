<p align="right"><a href="gener-3.htm">(back to preceding text)</a></p>

<p class="para">80.&nbsp;&nbsp;The starting point must, of course, be the 1977 Act and the EPC. I have already identified and discussed the centrally relevant provisions of the 1977 Act, namely section 72(1)(a) and (c), which reflect art 100 of the EPC and refer back to sections 1(1), 14(3), and 14(5), which in turn reflect arts. 52, 83, and 84 of the EPC. It is hard to discern any statutory provision (or, by the same token, any provision in the EPC) to support the proposition that, once it has been established that a product claimed in a patent is novel and non-obvious, and the specification sufficiently explains to the person skilled in the art how to make it, the claim can nonetheless be rejected because there may be other ways of making the product which owe nothing to the teaching of the patent.</p>
<p class="para">81.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Thorley QC, for the appellants, relied on section 14(5)(c): he said that where, as in this case, a product was a known <i>desideratum</i>, the first person to make it could rely on his way of making it as “support” for a claim for that process, but not for a claim for the product, as the single process did not support a claim for the product. I think that that argument ascribes an effect to section 14(5)(c) which it does not have. In <i>Asahi Kasei Kogyo KK’s Application </i>[1991] RPC 485, 536, Lord Oliver of Aylmerton<i> </i>explained that “a description would not ‘support’ the claims for the purpose of subsection (5)(c) unless it contained sufficient material to enable the specification to constitute the enabling disclosure which subsection (3) required” (to quote Lord Hoffmann’s summary in <i>Biogen </i>[1997] RPC 1, 47). That brings one straight back to section 14(3), and, as already mentioned, the specification of the Patent clearly sets out the diol method of manufacturing escitalopram, and therefore it plainly satisfies section 14(3).</p>
<p class="para">82.&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Andrew Waugh QC, for the respondent, contended, and as the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Scott of Foscote (which I have had the privilege of seeing in draft) implies, given that there is now an unchallenged finding that the (+)-enantiomer was novel as at the priority date, the appellants’ argument really involves suggesting that, at least when it comes to product claims, the 1977 Act envisages two types of novelty, one expressly mentioned in section 1(1)(a) and the other implied into section 14(5)(c). That seems an unlikely proposition: either a product is novel or it is not.</p>
<p class="para">83.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also contended on behalf of the appellants that, if the Patent extended to escitalopram as a product, the respondents would be accorded a monopoly which exceeded their technical contribution to the art. Although it is an extra-statutory concept, I accept that, at least as a general rule, the monopoly to be granted to the patentee is to be assessed by reference to the “technical contribution” made by the teaching of the patent. That is an approach regularly adopted by the Technical Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office (“the Board”): see, for example, T409/91 <i>EXXON/Fuel Oils </i>[1994] OJEPO 653, para 3.3. However, to put it at its lowest, it can be said that the respondent’s technical contribution in this case was to make available, for the first time, a product which had previously been unavailable, namely the isolated (+)-enantiomer of citalopram. On that basis, it would appear to follow that the respondent was entitled to claim the enantiomer. </p>
<p class="para">84.&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject, at any rate, to <i>Biogen </i>[1997] RPC 1 (and some cases purportedly following it), your Lordships have not been referred to any decided case in this jurisdiction which calls into question the approach of Lord Hoffmann and Jacob LJ in this case, as summarised in paras 74  and 75 above. It is true that in <i>British United Shoe Machinery Co Ltd v Simon Collier Ltd </i>(1908) 26 RPC 21 (aff'd (1909) 26 RPC 534, (1910) 27 RPC 567), Parker J said:</p>
<p class="qt">“[I]f the principle is new, and you show one mode of carrying it into effect, you may protect yourself against all other modes…. . If, however, the principle is not new, you can only protect yourself against those modes … which are substantially the same as the mode you have yourself invented” (see at p 49).</p>
<p class="para">85.&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me, however, that the application of that observation to this case could, to put it at its lowest, fairly be said to assist the respondent: given that the (+)-enantiomer claimed has been judged to be new, it should be patentable. However, that observation was concerned with the permissible breadth of a process claim, not with the circumstances in which it is permissible to make a product claim. Indeed, it is interesting to note that Kitchin J’s formulation of the principle he was applying at the end of [2007] RPC 32, para 265, and quoted at the end of para 78 above, seems also to be concerned with process claims, not product claims. </p>
<p class="para">86.&nbsp;&nbsp;While, as my noble and learned friend Lord Mance says, no real help in this case can be obtained from judicial decisions in countries which are not signatories to the EPC, quite different considerations apply to decisions of the Board. Your Lordships’ House has frequently emphasised that the principles of patent law adopted by courts in this jurisdiction should, if at all possible, be the same as those adopted by the Board - see for instance <i>Merell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc v H N Norton &amp; Co Ltd </i>[1996] RPC 76, 82, <i>Kirin-Amgen Inc v Hoechst Marion Roussel Ltd</i> [2004] UKHL 46,<i> </i>[2005] RPC 9, para 101, and <i>Conor Medsystems Inc v Angiotech Pharmaceuticals Inc </i>[2008] UKHL 49, [2008] 4 All ER 621, para 3.</p>
<p class="para">87.&nbsp;&nbsp;In that connection, the approach of the Board has been consistently along the same lines as that of the Court of Appeal in this case. Thus, in T595/90 <i>Grain-orientated silicon sheet/Kawasaki </i>[1994] OJEPO 695, 703, the Board said:</p>
<p class="qt">“[A] product which can be envisaged as such with all characteristics determining its identity together with its properties in use, i.e. an otherwise obvious entity, may become nevertheless non-obvious and claimable as such if there is no known way or applicable (analogy) method in the art to make it and the claimed methods for its preparation are therefore the first to achieve this in an inventive manner".</p>
<p class="para">(See also the decisions cited by Lord Hoffmann at [2008] RPC 19, paras 38 and 39.)</p>
<p class="para">88.&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, specifically in relation to the type of question arising in this case, the Board has held on more than one occasion that the fact that “the two enantiomers … actually exist unseparated in the racemate…. [and generally] can also be separated …” are “considerations [which] are immaterial to the question of novelty … and will be more usefully applied to the examination as to inventive step” (quoted from T0296/87, <i>Hoechst, </i>30 August 1988, para 6.5, and see also, for example, T1046/97, <i>Enantiomer/Zeneca</i>, 2 December 1999, para 2.1.1.4). That would suggest that Kitchin J’s conclusion on novelty was correct and that he rightly addressed the issue of obviousness, but that, having decided those issues in favour of the respondent, he should have upheld the claim to escitalopram.</p>
<p class="para">89.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that in none of these decisions of the Board was any consideration given to whether the product claim failed on the ground of insufficiency for the reason given by Kitchin J in this case at [2007] RPC 32, paras 264 to 265. However, the argument based on obviousness considered by the Board is very similar to the insufficiency reason given by Kitchin J. It also seems to me that, in the light of the expertise and experience of the members of the Board, and the number of decisions where the insufficiency reason could have been raised, it is fanciful to suggest that, if the reason had been arguable, it would not have been raised before or by the Board by now. As mentioned below, much of the reasoning in <i>Biogen </i>[1997] RPC 1 was based on decisions of the Board, and members of the Board appear to be well aware of their previous decisions, and, at least in general, anxious to have a consistent approach.  Further, the decision in <i>Biogen </i>[1997] RPC 1 was well known in the world of patents, and it did not cause the Board to change its view on the issue of product claims, as is demonstrated by the reasoning in <i>Enantiomer/Zeneca </i>in relation to enantiomers, and, more generally, in T1195/00 <i>Alcan International Ltd,</i> 24 May 2004.</p>
<p class="para">90.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of this discussion, it appears clear to me that, unless precluded by the reasoning in <i>Biogen </i>[1997] RPC 1, on which Kitchin J primarily relied in his decision and on which Mr Thorley primarily relies in his argument, the product claim in the present case is valid. I appreciate that this means that, by finding one method of making a product, a person can obtain a monopoly for that product. However, that applies to any product claim. Further, where (as here) the product is a known <i>desideratum</i>, it can be said (as Lord Walker pointed out) that the invention is all the more creditable, as it is likely that there has been more competition than where the product has not been thought of. The role of fortuity in patent law cannot be doubted: it is inevitable, as in almost any area of life. Luck as well as skill often determines, for instance, who is first to file, whether a better product or process is soon discovered, or whether an invention turns out to be valuable. Further, while the law must be principled, it must also be clear and consistent.<i> </i></p>
<i></i><p class="para"><i>The insufficiency argument based on Biogen [1997] RPC 1</i> </p>
<p class="para">91.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have mentioned, the principal plank in the appellants’ argument is the opinion of Lord Hoffmann in <i>Biogen </i>[1997] RPC 1, no doubt for the reasons just discussed. Mr Thorley was able to point to a number of observations in that opinion which, at least if read on their own, might at first sight be said to support his contention that, given that the (+)-enantiomer was known to be a desirable goal, the only technical contribution of the Patent was the diol method of making the enantiomer, and accordingly it is that process, and not the enantiomer, which should have been claimed. </p>
<p class="para">92.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the seven passages in the speech of Lord Hoffmann Mr Thorley particularly relied on, I shall limit myself to three, although the observations which follow apply equally to the other passages. At [1997] RPC 1, 48, Lord Hoffmann said that “if the claims include a number of discrete methods or products, the patentee must enable the invention to be performed in respect of each of them". But in this case the claim is to a single product, and it is clear that the product is enabled by the disclosure in the Patent. </p>
<p class="para">93.&nbsp;&nbsp;At [1997] RPC 1, 50, there is this: “[The issue] is not whether the claimed invention could deliver the goods, but whether the claims cover other ways in which they might be delivered: ways which owe nothing to the teaching of the patent or any principle which it disclosed". This is perhaps the most important of the three passages for present purposes. The vital point is that Lord Hoffmann was not dealing with a simple product claim, as is involved in this Patent. As he explained at [1997] RPC 1, 40, the claim in that case was “to a product, a molecule identified partly by the way in which it has been made …. and partly by what it does". In that case, the patentee could claim neither the product (a DNA fragment of the so-called Dane particle), as it had already been made (see per Aldous J at first instance at [1995] RPC 25, 57), nor the process (recombinant DNA technology enabling expression in a cell), as it had already been invented (see at [1995] RPC 25, 58 and 65). Nor could he identify the product in any other way, as it had not been mapped or sequenced (see e.g. at [1995] RPC 25, 65).</p>
<p class="para">94.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, the invention claimed in <i>Biogen </i>[1997] RPC 1 was, as it were, the notion of subjecting the product (the unsequenced DNA fragment from the Dane particle) to the process (recombinant DNA technology) in order for it to be expressed to produce HBV antigens. It was therefore at least as much as a process claim as a product claim. In those circumstances, one can well see why the claim was held to be insufficient. The patent disclosed one way in which the DNA fragments could produce HBV antigens, but the claim “cover[ed] other ways in which they might be delivered, ways which owed nothing to the teaching of the patent or any principle which it disclosed” - [1997] RPC 1, 50. Accordingly, the claim was very different from a simple product claim as in the present case. This analysis of the facts in <i>Biogen </i>[1997] RPC 1 also explains why Lord Hoffmann said at pp. 51-52 that “the excessive breadth” of the patent in that case was due “to the fact that the same results could be produced by different means” from that disclosed by the patent. </p>
<p class="para">95.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, at [1997] RPC 1, 54, Lord Hoffmann emphasised that “the extent of the monopoly claimed [should not] exceed … the technical contribution to the art made by the invention as described in the specification". As already explained, in the context of a simple product claim such as the present (especially where the claim is to a single chemical product), the technical contribution is (at least in the absence of special factors) the product itself. As I have suggested, the technical contribution can often be equated with non-obvious novelty - what is new to the art and not obvious is really another way of identifying the technical contribution.</p>
<p class="para">96.&nbsp;&nbsp;The notion that Lord Hoffmann was not seeking to depart from the established approach of the Board is supported by the weight he placed on the reasoning in its decisions, especially <i>Genentech/Polypeptide expression </i>[1989] OJEPO 275 and T409/91 <i>EXXON/Fuel Oils </i>to which I have referred - see at [1997] RPC 1, 48-53. The fact that he took a different view from the Board on the patent in suit does not detract from this point: he was considering an argument which had not been raised in the opposition proceedings - see section 12 of his judgment at [1997] RPC 1, 52-53. Indeed, at the end of that section Lord Hoffmann was at pains to point out that there was no “divergence between the jurisprudence of this court and that of the EPO".<i> </i></p>
<p class="para">97.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is perhaps worth referring to one passage in the Board’s decision in T409/91 <i>EXXON/Fuel Oils</i>, which was relied on by Mr Thorley, and was quoted in <i>Biogen</i> [1997] RPC 1, 49. The quotation, taken from para 3.3 of the decision, concludes with the statement that there is a “general legal principle that the extent of the patent monopoly, as defined by the claims, should correspond to the <i>technical contribution </i>to the art in order for it to be supported, or justified". However, the passage continues:</p>
<p class="qt">“This means that the definitions in the claims should essentially correspond to the scope of the invention as disclosed in the description. In other words,… the claims should not extend to subject-matter which, after reading the description, would still not be at the disposal of the person skilled in the art.”</p>
<p class="para">98.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, it is clear that, in that paragraph the Board was discussing insufficiency and support in the normal sense, and there is nothing to suggest that, in the case of a product claim, once it is decided that the product is novel, the technical contribution may not be the product itself, if it is a known <i>desideratum</i>. </p>
<p class="para">99.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, therefore, in agreement with the Court of Appeal, the opinion of Lord Hoffmann in <i>Biogen </i>[1997] RPC 1, though a <i>tour de force</i> as Lord Walker says, is of no assistance to the appellants in this case. It applied in the light of the very unusual nature of the claim in that case. Far from being a straightforward product claim (as in this case) or even a product-by-process claim (as discussed in<i> Kirin-Amgen </i>[2005] RPC 9, paras 86-91 and 101), the claim was to a product identified in part by how it was made and in part by what it did - almost a process-by-product-by-process claim. </p>
<p class="para">100.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kitchin J is by no means alone in having taken the mistaken view that the reasoning in <i>Biogen </i>[1997] RPC 1 is of much wider application, and in particular that it applies to any product claims (at least where they are claims to chemical compounds). I made exactly the same mistake at first instance in the <i>Kirin-Amgen </i>case - see at [2002] RPC 1, paras 300-312. A number of articles to which reference was made in the written cases also appear to have proceeded upon the same view.</p>
<p class="para">101.&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be that this is in part attributable to the focussing by Lord Hoffmann in <i>Biogen </i>[1997] RPC 1, 42-46 on the “inventive step” involved in the alleged invention in that case. There is a difference between the “inventive step” or “inventive concept", on the one hand, and the “technical contribution to the art", on the other hand. I respectfully agree with the explanation of the difference between the two concepts given in paras 29 to 31 of Lord Walker’s opinion. When considering the validity of a simple product claim (such as is under scrutiny on this appeal), it may be that concentrating on the identification of the inventive step rather than the technical contribution can lead to error. “Inventive step” suggests how something has been done, and, in the case of a product claim at any rate, one is primarily concerned with what has been allegedly invented, not how it has been done. On the other hand where the claim is for a process or (as in <i>Biogen </i>[1997] RPC 1) includes a process, the issue of how the alleged invention has been achieved seems to be more in point.</p>
