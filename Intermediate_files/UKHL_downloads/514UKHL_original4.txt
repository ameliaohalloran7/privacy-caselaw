<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90. The defendant admits that the conduct of the police constable as pleaded amounts to the tort of misfeasance in public office.  The essence of the tort is abuse of power.  In <i>Rookes v Barnard</i> [1964] AC 1129 1228, Lord Devlin stated: </p>
<p></p><ul>"In a case in which exemplary damages are appropriate, a jury should be directed that if, but only if, the sum which they have in mind to award as compensation (which may, of course, be a sum aggravated by the way in which the defendant has behaved to the plaintiff) is inadequate to punish him for his outrageous conduct, to mark their disapproval of such conduct and to deter him from repeating it, then it can award some larger sum."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91. I think that the use of the adjective "outrageous" shows that the conduct which falls within Lord Devlin's first category as being oppressive or arbitrary or unconstitutional is conduct of such a nature that it calls for exemplary damages to mark disapproval, to deter and to vindicate the strength of the law, and I further think that not every abuse of power which constitutes the tort of misfeasance will come within the first category.  If the point had arisen for decision I am very doubtful if I would have held that the conduct of the police constable in the present case calls for exemplary damages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92. Submissions were advanced to the House on the point whether exemplary damages could be awarded where a plaintiff is entitled to recover compensation or damages under the discrimination legislation or the Human Rights Act 1998, but I would wish to reserve my opinion on this point until the matter arises directly for decision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93. I have referred in this speech to two Northern Ireland cases where I consider that the award of exemplary damages served a valuable purpose in vindicating the strength of the law, and in these cases the awards were made against the Ministry of Defence and the Northern Ireland Office on the basis of vicarious liability.  In his speech Lord Scott of Foscote has developed a powerful argument against the awarding of exemplary damages on the basis of vicarious liability.  This issue was not raised in this appeal and was not addressed by counsel, and therefore I wish to reserve my opinion on this important and interesting question discussed by my noble and learned friend </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94. I would allow this appeal for the reasons which I have given.</p>
<p><b>LORD SCOTT OF FOSCOTE</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95. The function of an award of damages in our civil justice system is to compensate the claimant for a wrong done to him.  The wrong may consist of a breach of contract, or a tort, or an interference with some right of the claimant under public law.  But whatever the wrong may consist of the award of damages should be compensatory in its intent.  Measured by this fundamental principle of damages, an award of exemplary damages, the intention of which is not to compensate the victim of a wrong but to punish its perpetrator, is an anomaly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96. The anomalous character of exemplary damages was recognised in <i>Rookes v Barnard</i> [1964]  AC 1129.  Lord Devlin, at p 1221, invited your Lordships' House to consider "whether it is open to the House to remove an anomaly from the law of England".  But having referred to various authorities he said, at p 1223:</p>
<p></p><ul>"These authorities clearly justify the use of the exemplary principle; and for my part I should not wish, even if I felt at liberty to do so, to diminish its use in this type of case where it serves a valuable purpose in restraining the arbitrary and outrageous use of executive power."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97. And, at pp 1225-1226, after reviewing further authorities, he said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"These authorities convince me of two things.  First, that your Lordships could not, without a complete disregard of precedent, and indeed of statute, now arrive at a determination that refused altogether to recognise the exemplary principle.  Secondly, that there are certain categories of cases in which an award of exemplary damages can serve a useful purpose in vindicating the strength of the law and thus affording a practical justification for admitting into the civil law a principle which ought logically to belong to the criminal.  I propose to state what these two categories are;  and I propose to state also three general considerations which, in my opinion, should always be borne in mind when awards of exemplary damages are being made."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98. The first of Lord Devlin's two categories was "oppressive, arbitrary or unconstitutional action by the servants of the Government".  His second category covered cases "in which the defendant's conduct has been calculated by him to make a profit for himself which may well exceed the compensation payable to the plaintiff".  The three considerations always to be borne in mind were, first, at p 1227, that:</p>
<p></p><ul>"the plaintiff cannot recover exemplary damages unless he is the victim of the punishable behaviour."<p></p></ul>
<p>second, that:</p>
<p></p><ul>"the power to award exemplary damages constitutes a weapon that, while it can be used in defence of liberty, as in the <i>Wilkes</i> case (<i>Wilkes v Wood</i> (1763) Loftt. 1) can also be used against liberty."<p></p></ul>
<p>and, third, at p 1228, that:</p>
<p></p><ul>"the means of the parties, irrelevant in the assessment of compensation, are material in the assessment of exemplary damages."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99. It is relevant in considering the attention paid by Lord Devlin to the authorities that <i>Rookes v Barnard</i> pre-dated the 1966 <i>Practice Statement (Judicial Precedent)</i> [1966] 1 WLR 1234, under which your Lordships' House became free in certain circumstances to depart from previous decisions of the House.  It is relevant, also, to notice that each of the three considerations that Lord Devlin warned should be kept in mind draws attention to the anomalous character of exemplary damages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100. The anomalous character of exemplary damages was stressed by Lord Reid in <i>Broome v Cassell</i> <i>&amp; Co Ltd</i> [1972]  AC 1027.  He had been a member of the committee that had heard <i>Rookes v Barnard</i> [1964] AC 1129 and he had concurred in Lord Devlin's speech.  In <i>Broome v Cassell</i> <i>&amp; Co Ltd</i>, he explained, at p 1086:</p>
<p></p><ul>"We thought we had to recognise that it had become an established custom in certain classes of case to permit awards of damages which could not be justified as compensatory, and that must remain the law.  But we thought and I still think it well within the province of this House to say that that undesirable anomaly should not be permitted in any class of case where its use was not covered by authority."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101. Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest remarked, at p 1100, on some of the illogicalities of an award of exemplary damages:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Logical analysis forces the conclusion therefore that in the result there would in a civil action have been punishment for conduct not particularised in any criminal code and that such punishment had taken the form of a fine not receivable by the state but as a sort of bonus by a private individual who would, apart from it, be solaced for the wrong done to him.  There may be much to be said for making it permissible in a criminal court to order in certain cases that a convicted person should pay compensation.  There is much to be said against a system under which a fine becomes payable in a civil court without any of the safeguards which protect those charged with crimes."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102. Viscount Dilhorne commented, at p 1108:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Power to award exemplary damages may be an anomaly, but I doubt whether it is beneficial to the law to seek to reduce the area of that anomaly at the price of creating other anomalies and illogicalities."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103. Lord Wilberforce pointed out, at pp 1114-1115, out that English law contained a "heavy, indeed exorbitant, punitive element in its costs system".  He regarded the costs system as the strongest argument against the principle of punitive damages and said:  "One or other must clearly be reformed, and it is Parliament alone that can do it".  In the event, neither has been reformed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104. And, finally, Lord Diplock, also recognising the anomalous character of exemplary damages, said this of Lord Devlin's first category, at pp 1129-1130:</p>
<p></p><ul>"My Lords, had I been party to the decision in <i>Rookes v Barnard</i> I doubt if I should have considered it still necessary to retain the first category.  The common law weapons to curb abuse of power by the executive had not been forged by the mid-18th century.  In view of the developments, particularly in the last 20 years, in adapting the old remedies by prerogative writ and declaratory action to check unlawful abuse of power by the executive, the award of exemplary damages in civil actions for tort against individual government servants seems a blunt instrument to use for this purpose today."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105. These several statements underlining the anomalous nature of awards of exemplary damages constitute the backcloth to the appeal that is now before your Lordships' House.  The issues presented to your Lordships are expressed in the statement of facts and issues signed by counsel for the plaintiff and defendant respectively.  The issues can be summed up in this question: "Is an award of exemplary damages a possible remedy for the tort of misfeasance in public office?"  In inviting your Lordships to consider and answer this question, counsel, on both sides, instructed us that we were to assume that the speech of Lord Devlin in <i>Rookes v Barnard </i>[1964] AC 1129 and the speeches in <i>Broome v Cassell &amp; Co Ltd </i> [1972] AC 1027 correctly stated the law.  We were to decide whether the judgment of the Court of Appeal in <i>AB v South West Water Services Ltd</i> [1993]  QB 507, which was followed by the Court of Appeal in the present case, correctly applied the law as established by the two cases in your Lordships' House to which I have referred.  Counsel had not come prepared to assist your Lordships in a re-examination of the propriety of exemplary damages in the civil law or in a consideration of their propriety in misfeasance in public office cases in particular.  Mr Harris, counsel for the plaintiff, told us that if we proposed to consider those broader issues he would apply for an adjournment in order to enlist the valuable services of Professor Andrew Burrows as a member of his team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106. My Lords, this is not, in my view, an appropriate manner in which to bring before your Lordships an important issue of principle.  I share the dismay expressed by my noble and learned friend, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, about the lack of assistance that your Lordships have had in considering the general issues about exemplary damages that this appeal has raised, many of which were mentioned in the course of the hearing but, no doubt for the reason I have given, not examined in any depth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107. I agree with Lord Nicholls that the question whether exemplary damages are available in misfeasance in public office cases cannot be answered without first asking whether exemplary damages should be available in misfeasance cases.  And that question cannot be answered without considering the role and propriety of exemplary damages in the civil law.  The law regarding exemplary damages did not become fossilised and set in stone when Lord Devlin pronounced in 1964 (<i>Rookes v Barnard</i> [1964] AC 1129) or when the seven members of the House pronounced in 1972 (<i>Broome v Cassell &amp; Co Ltd</i> [1972] AC 1027).  Since then the common law has flowed on.  One of the great developments of the common law since the time of <i>Rookes v Barnard</i> has been in the area of public law and judicial review to which Lord Diplock referred.  Oppressive, arbitrary and unconstitutional acts by members of the executive can be remedied through civil proceedings brought in the High Court.  The remedies the court can provide include awards of damages, declarations of right and, in most cases, injunctions.  The developments since Lord Diplock's remarks in <i>Broome v Cassell</i> <i>&amp; Co Ltd </i>have transformed the ability of the ordinary citizen to obtain redress.  The continuing need in the year 2001 for exemplary damages as a civil remedy in order to control, deter and punish acts falling within Lord Devlin's first category is not in the least obvious.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108. My noble and learned friend, Lord Hutton, has referred, as examples, to two cases in Northern Ireland where in his view the award of exemplary damages served a valuable purpose in restraining the arbitrary and outrageous use of executive power and in vindicating the strength of the law.  In one case (<i>Lavery v Ministry of Defence</i> [1984] NI 99) a soldier was the wrongdoer.  The Ministry of Defence was the defendant.  In the other case (<i>Pettigrew v Northern Ireland Office</i> [1990] NI 179), prison officers were the wrongdoers.  The Northern Ireland Office was the defendant.  In each case the conduct of the wrongdoer, or wrongdoers, was outrageous and fell squarely within Lord Devlin's first category.  But I do not follow why an appropriate award of aggravated damages would not have served to vindicate the law just as effectively as the fairly moderate awards of exemplary damages that were made.  The condemnation by the trial judge of the conduct in question would have been expressed no differently.  As to deterrence, in a case where the defendant is not the wrongdoer, and the damages are in any event going to be met out of public funds, how can it be supposed that the award of exemplary damages adds anything at all to the deterrent effect of the trial judge's findings of fact in favour of the injured person and his condemnation of the conduct in question?  The proposition that exemplary damage awards against such defendants as the Ministry of Defence or the Northern Ireland Office, or, for that matter, the Chief Constable of Leicestershire Constabulary, can have a deterrent effect is, in my respectful opinion, fanciful.  It is possible that exemplary damages awards against the actual wrongdoers which they would have to meet out of their own pockets would have a deterrent effect upon them and their colleagues.  But that is not what happened in either of the two cases.  As to the propriety in principle of exemplary damages awards in vicarious liability cases, I will return to the point later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109. Lord Devlin's second category, cases in which the defendant' wrongful conduct has made a profit for himself which exceeds the compensation payable to the victim of the conduct, has been largely overtaken by developments in the common law.  Restitutionary damages are available now in many tort actions as well as those for breach of contract.  The profit made by a wrongdoer can be extracted from him without the need to rely on the anomaly of exemplary damages: see the discussion of the topic in <i>Attorney General v Blake</i> [2001]  1 AC 268, 278-280 by Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110. Whatever may have been the position in 1964, when <i>Rookes v Barnard </i>[1964] AC 1129 was decided, or in 1972, when <i>Broome v Cassell &amp; Co Ltd</i> [1972] AC 1027 was decided, there is, in my opinion, no longer any need for punitive damages in the civil law, or, at least, no need sufficient to offset the disadvantages to which Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest in <i>Broome v Cassell &amp; Co Ltd</i> cogently referred.  These disadvantages are the more prominent now that, via the Human Rights Act 1998, article 6 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (1953) (Cmnd 8969) has become part of our domestic law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111. Thus far I have been considering some of the general issues that are prompted by the present appeal.  For the reasons I have outlined, I would be receptive to a submission that exemplary damages awards should no longer be available in civil proceedings.  However, Mr Mansfield, counsel for the defendant, has not made that submission and, having had the advantage of reading the texts of my noble and learned friends' speeches on this appeal, it is apparent that mine is a minority view.  It is, therefore, necessary for me to consider the narrower question, namely, whether in order to qualify for an award of exemplary damages the claim must not only fall within one or other of the two categories identified by Lord Devlin in <i>Rookes v Barnard</i>  [1964] AC 1129, 1126 but also be a claim based on a cause of action that, pre-<i>Rookes v Barnard</i>, had been recognised in the case law as grounding a claim for exemplary damages. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112. Express support for the need to satisfy the cause of action criterion is not to be found in the speech of Lord Devlin itself.  He formulated the two types of conduct that might attract an award of exemplary damages in a tort action.  He recognised, at p 1227, that exemplary damages awards for breaches of statutory duty might be expressly authorised by statute but plainly regarded the two types of conduct as comprehensively covering all tortious conduct that might justify an exemplary damages award.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113. The requirement for the additional cause of action criterion comes not from Lord Devlin in <i>Rookes v Barnard</i> but from <i>Broome v Cassell</i> &amp; <i>Co Ltd</i> [1972] AC 1027 and, in particular, the speeches of Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone LC, Lord Reid and Lord Diplock.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114. Lord Hailsham said, at p 1076, that he did not think that Lord Devlin "by listing the 'categories' was … intending … to add to the number of torts for which exemplary damages can be awarded".  In <i>Mafo v Adams</i> [1970]  1 QB 548 Widgery LJ had said, at p 558:</p>
<p></p><ul>"As I understand Lord Devlin's speech   . . .   the range of offences in respect of which [exemplary damages] may be granted has been increased, and I see no reason … why, when considering a claim for exemplary damages, one should regard the nature of the tort as excluding the claim."<p></p></ul>
<p>Lord Hailsham expressed his dissent from Widgery LJ's view.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Diplock said, at p 1131, that:</p>
<p></p><ul>"<i>Rookes v Barnard</i> was not intended to extend the power to award exemplary or aggravated damages to particular torts for which they had not previously been awarded;  such as negligence and deceit."<p></p></ul>
<p>Lord Reid made the comment, at p 1086, that I have cited at paragraph 6 of this opinion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115. And, in addition, Lord Wilberforce referred, at p 1114, to:</p>
<p></p><ul>"the range of torts for which punitive damages may be given (trespass to person or property, false imprisonment and defamation being the commonest, …"<p></p></ul>
<p>thus at least suggesting a cause of action test.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116. It seems to me, therefore, that the Court of Appeal, both in <i>AB v South West Water Services Ltd</i> [1993]  QB 507 and in the judgment under appeal in the present case, were on firm ground in concluding that the authoritative case law required that a claim for exemplary damages should not only fall within one or other of the two Devlin categories (<i>Rookes v Barnard</i> [1964] AC 1129, 1226) but should also satisfy the cause of action test.  The passages from the speeches of Lord Hailsham, Lord Wilberforce and Lord Diplock cited above were cited in the <i>AB</i> case as authority for giving the answer 'No' to the question "Did <i>Rookes v Barnard</i> extend exemplary damages to fresh torts?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117. My Lords, I am in respectful agreement with much of the criticisms of the cause of action test that are to be found both in academic writings and in the speeches of my noble and learned friends on this appeal.  I agree that the cause of action test "commits the law to an irrational position in which the result depends not on principle but upon the accidents of litigation": <i>Winfield and Jolowicz on Tort,</i> 15th ed, p 746, cited by my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern (ante, para xx);  and I agree that the cause of action test appears to encourage a tedious trawl through ancient authority in an attempt to unearth an award of damages that can be categorised as exemplary in a case based upon a particular cause of action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118. The present case is an example.  Misfeasance in public office is a cause of action discovered, or rediscovered, relatively recently.  But it is only since <i>Rookes v Barnard</i> [1964] AC 1129 that exemplary damages have been clearly distinguished from aggravated damages.  The task of discovering whether, pre-<i>Rookes v Barnard</i>, exemplary damages had been awarded in a misfeasance in public office case has shown itself to be, and was always likely to be, lengthy and inconclusive.  The cause of action criterion for an award of exemplary damages as an addition to the requirement that the conduct of the defendant fall within one or other of Lord Devlin's two categories does no credit to the law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119. On the other hand the exemplary damages principle is itself an anomaly in the civil law and, as Lord Mackay has pointed out, it should not come as a matter of too much surprise that anomalies are to be found in the criteria that determine the availability of an anomalous remedy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120. Your Lordships are, it seems to me, caught on the horns of a dilemma.  On the one hand, the cause of action test is not based on principle and has serious practical difficulties.  On the other hand, the removal of the cause of action test would expand the cases in which exemplary damages could be claimed.  Claims could be made in cases of negligence and cases of deceit provided only that the conduct complained of fell within one or other of the two Devlin categories (<i>Rookes v Barnard</i> [1964] AC 1129, 1226).  Claims could probably also be made, subject to the same proviso, in actions based upon breach of statutory duty whether or not the statute had expressly authorised such claims.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121. My Lords, I view the prospect of any increase in the cases in which exemplary damages can be claimed with regret.  I have explained already why I regard the remedy as no longer serving any useful function in our jurisprudence.  Victims of tortious conduct should receive due compensation for their injuries, not windfalls at public expense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122. Faced with the unattractive alternatives of leaving the cause of action test in place or removing it, I would, for my part, favour a pragmatic solution under which, on the one hand, the cause of action test were removed but, on the other, exemplary damages were declared to be unavailable in cases of negligence, nuisance and strict liability, and also liability for breach of statutory duty except where the statute in question had expressly authorised the remedy.  In this way the main objections to the cause of action test would be met and tedious research into pre-1964 case law would be avoided but existing authority as to cases where exemplary damages cannot be claimed would be left broadly unaltered.  It will be noticed that I have not included deceit among the nominate torts where, on authority, exemplary damages cannot be claimed.  This is because if, which I regret, exemplary damages are to be retained and reformed, rather than abolished, deceit practised by a government or local authority official, or by a police officer, on a citizen ought, it seems to me, to be allowed in a suitable case to attract them.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123. There is, however, a further issue in this case that, in my opinion, requires some comment.  The issue is whether exemplary damages can be claimed against an employer for a tort committed by an employee where the employer's liability is only vicarious.  The facts of the present case raise this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;124. The plaintiff's case is that he made a complaint to the police of the theft from his home of certain property.  He named a lodger at his home as the suspect.  A police officer, PC Cavendish, assured the plaintiff that the complaint would be investigated but subsequently forged the plaintiff's signature on a statement purporting to be a withdrawal by the plaintiff of the complaint.  So the theft was never investigated and the plaintiff lost the chance of his property being recovered.  Later the plaintiff was informed by the Crown Prosecution Service that there was insufficient evidence to justify a prosecution of the lodger.  The defendant to the plaintiff's misfeasance in public office claim is the Chief Constable of Leicestershire Constabulary.  PC Cavendish, the alleged wrongdoer, has not been sued.  The plaintiff makes no allegation against the Chief Constable personally.  The Chief Constable's alleged liability is simply vicarious.  The particulars of conduct relied on as justifying an award of exemplary damages are particulars which relate to the alleged conduct of PC Cavendish.  The Chief Constable is not mentioned anywhere in the body of the pleading. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125. My Lords, the viability of the plaintiff's exemplary damages claim against the Chief Constable depends not only on the question whether exemplary damages can ever be recovered in a misfeasance claim, but also on the question whether exemplary damages can be recovered in a claim where the defendant's alleged liability is simply vicarious.  The point was raised with counsel in the course of the hearing before your Lordships but neither counsel made any submission on it.  Nonetheless it is a point that seems to me of considerable importance and one that may be determinative of the present case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;126. There has been, so far as I have been able to discover, no discussion in English case law, and, with one notable exception, very little discussion in English law textbooks, of the availability of exemplary damages awards in vicarious liability cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;127. In <i>McGregor on Damages</i>, 16th ed (1997) para 469, the text deals with exemplary damages awards where there are joint wrongdoers:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Where joint wrongdoers are sued together, the conduct of one defendant does not allow exemplary damages to be awarded in the single judgment which must be entered against all if the conduct of the other defendant or defendants does not merit punishment.  This was the view of Pollock B in <i>Clark v Newsam </i>(1847) 1 Exch 131, 141, and is now finally established by the House of Lords in <i>Broome v Cassell &amp; Co Ltd</i> [1972] AC 1027."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;128. If that is the rule where joint wrongdoers are sued, it must also be so where only one of two or more joint wrongdoers is sued, or where the employer is sued together with the wrongdoers, or where the employer alone is sued.  Since all the wrongdoers are jointly liable for the wrong and, if their employer is vicariously liable, he is jointly liable with them, an exemplary damages award against any of them ought, in principle, to be a justifiable award against each of them.  If the conduct of any of them, including the employer, does not merit punishment, an exemplary damages award ought, in principle, not to be made.  The law might, of course, develop so that an exemplary damages award against a particular wrongdoer became separated from the general compensatory damages for which all the wrongdoers and their vicariously liable employer were jointly liable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;129. The notable exception to which I referred is to be found in Professor Atiyah's <i>Vicarious Liability</i>, published in 1967 not long after <i>Rookes v Barnard </i> [1964] AC 1129 had been decided, which contains a chapter (chapter 39) dealing with exemplary damages.  The chapter has a section headed "Vicarious Liability".  This section commences with the following paragraph:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The most difficult problems arise in this connection in cases of pure vicarious liability.  There appears to be no English authority in which there has been any discussion of the question whether exemplary damages can be awarded against an employer who is vicariously liable for the tort of a servant committed in circumstances in which exemplary damages can be awarded against the servant.  At first sight there seems to be much against allowing vicarious liability for exemplary damages, for if these are avowedly designed as punishment it might seem wrong in principle to punish someone other than the actual wrongdoer.  On the other hand it can also be urged that vicarious liability in the criminal law is not wholly unknown, and that the deterrent aspect is also an important consideration.  In certain types of action, in particular false imprisonment, purely compensatory damages might not be an adequate deterrent against repetition, and it may well be that the deterrence would be more effective if aimed against the employer rather than the servant.  The question could become of practical importance with the recent introduction of vicarious liability for police officers.  If a policeman were to make an arrest in wholly unjustifiable circumstances it would seem right that the vicarious liability of the Chief Constable should extend to exemplary damages, for otherwise there might be no sufficient incentive to the police authorities to take stern measures with a view to preventing repetition of the offence."<p></p></ul>
<p>I would not myself accept that a deterrent purpose was a sufficient justification for exemplary damages in vicarious liability cases, but, whatever may be the value of such a purpose in the false imprisonment or unlawful arrest cases referred to in the text, such a purpose has no relevance in the present case.  No one would think of arguing that there is a need for chief constables to be deterred from allowing their officers to conduct themselves as PC Cavendish is alleged by the plaintiff to have conducted himself.  </p>
