<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analysis of Southern Cross's role</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107.&nbsp;&nbsp;In submitting that Southern Cross in providing care and accommodation has and is exercising functions of a public nature, Mr Pannick relies on the statutory framework which led to the council's involvement and to the placement of YL with Southern Cross. That consists primarily in the National Assistance Act 1948 as amended in (inter alia) 1972, 1990 and 1992. The Act as amended reads:</p>
<p></p><ul>"21 Duty of local authorities to provide accommodation<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to and in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Act, a local authority may with the approval of the Secretary of State, and to such extent as he may direct shall, make arrangements for providing—<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;residential accommodation for persons aged eighteen or over who by reason of age, illness, disability or any other circumstances are in need of care and attention which is not otherwise available to them; and<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(aa)&nbsp;&nbsp;residential accommodation for expectant and nursing mothers who are in need of care and attention which is not otherwise available to them.<p></p></ul>
….
<p></p><ul>(2A)&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining for the purposes of paragraph (a) or (aa) of subsection (1) of this section whether care and attention are otherwise available to a person, a local authority shall disregard so much of the person's resources as may be specified in, or determined in accordance with, regulations made by the Secretary of State for the purposes of this subsection.<p></p></ul>
….
<p></p><ul>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to the provisions of section 26 of this Act accommodation provided by a local authority in the exercise of their functions under this section shall be provided in premises managed by the authority or, to such extent as may be determined in accordance with the arrangements under this section, in such premises managed by another local authority as may be agreed between the two authorities and on such terms, including terms as to the reimbursement of expenditure incurred by the said other authority, as may be so agreed.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;References in this Act to accommodation provided under this Part thereof shall be construed as references to accommodation provided in accordance with this and the five next following sections … ."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 22 requires a local authority to recover from any person to whom accommodation is provided under section 21 a payment consisting of the full cost to the authority of providing such accommodation or such lower rate as the authority may assess that such person is able to pay.  Section 26 provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Provision of accommodation in premises maintained by voluntary organisations<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to subsections (1A) and (1C) below, arrangements under section 21 of this Act may include arrangements made with a voluntary organisation or with any other person who is not a local authority where—<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;that organisation or person manages premises which provide for reward accommodation falling within subsection (1)(a) or (aa) of that section, and<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;the arrangements are for the provision of such accommodation in those premises.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(1A)&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrangements must not be made by virtue of this section for the provision of accommodation together with nursing or personal care for persons such as are mentioned in section 3(2) of the Care Standards Act 2000 (care homes) unless—<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;the accommodation is to be provided, under the arrangements, in a care home (within the meaning of that Act) which is managed by the organisation or person in question; and<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;that organisation or person is registered under Part II of that Act in respect of the home."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 26(2) and (3) require arrangements made under section 26 to provide for payments by the local authority to the accommodation provider "at such rates as may be determined by or under the arrangements" and for the resident to refund the local authority either in full or according to his or her ability to pay. Section 26(3A) enables the local authority, the resident and the service provider to agree instead for the resident to pay direct to the provider any share that he or she would otherwise have to refund to the local authority and for the local authority to be liable only to pay the balance to the provider.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Pannick submits that the 1948 Act gives effect to a basic state or public responsibility to <i>provide </i>care and accommodation for those in need. In <i>R (Heather) v Leonard Cheshire Foundation</i> [2002] EWCA Civ 366; [2002] 2 All ER 936, para 15, Lord Woolf CJ said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"If the authority itself provides accommodation, it is performing a public function. It is also performing a public function if it makes arrangements for the accommodation to be provided by LCF. However, if a body which is a charity, like LCF, provides accommodation to those to whom the authority owes a duty under section 21 in accordance with an arrangement under section 26, it does not follow that the charity is performing a public function."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking as his premise Lord Woolf's first two sentences, Professor Paul Craig argues with force that the nature of a function does not alter if it is contracted out, rather than performed in house ("Contracting Out, the Human Rights Act and the Scope of Judicial Review" (2002)<i> </i>118 LQR 551). But Professor Dawn Oliver in the article in 2000 to which Lord Nicholls referred and in a later article in 2004 ("Functions of a Public Nature under the Human Rights Act", [2004] PL 329) pertinently observes that it is a fallacy to regard all functions and activities of a core public authority as inherently public in nature. All such functions and activities are subject to the Convention, because the authority is a core public authority. It only becomes necessary to analyse their nature, if and when they are contracted out to a person who is not a core public authority. Some of them may then on analysis be private in nature. Reference to a core public authority performing a public function when providing care and accommodation is potentially confusing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111.&nbsp;&nbsp;How then is the provision of care and accommodation to be regarded? The House was taken to the history and amendments of the 1948 Act and to the more remote background of the Poor Law abrogated by section 1 of that Act. Mr Pannick submits that the Act gave effect to an essential duty of the State to provide care and accommodation for the needy. As originally enacted, section 21 made it the duty of every local authority "to provide" residential accommodation for persons in need of care and attention not otherwise available to them. This function was under section 21(3) to be exercised in accordance with a scheme. The accommodation was under section 21(4) to be provided in premises managed by the local authority, or by another local authority on terms to be agreed between them. However, under section 21(5) references to accommodation provided were to be construed as references to accommodation provided in accordance with the five next sections, and section 26(1) stated that, notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions, a scheme under section 21 "may provide for the making by a local authority ….. of arrangements with a voluntary organisation managing any premises for the provision of accommodation in those premises".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1972, section 21 was amended to its present form, whereby a local authority's duty is expressed generally as being to "make arrangements for providing …. accommodation" not otherwise available for those in need of care and attention. With effect from 1 April 1993, as a result of amendments made in 1990 and 1992, sections 21 and 26 enable arrangements to be made not merely with a voluntary organisation, but also "with any other person who is not a local authority". In 2000 section 26(1A) was further amended by section 116 of, and paragraph 1(1)(3) of Schedule 4 to, the Care Standards Act 2000 to require any such arrangements for care and accommodation to be with a care home registered under the 2000 Act. Mr Pannick points out that in its modern form the 1948 Act still retains headings suggesting a duty of provision on the local authority (most obviously, the heading to section 21: "Duty of local authorities to provide accommodation"). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113.&nbsp;&nbsp;In response, Mr Arden submits that the appellants' propositions are supported neither by history nor by the amended form of the legislation. As a matter of history, he observes that the State's duty to address the needs of the poor "often took the form of cash payments" (Neville Harris, <i>Social Security Law in Context</i> (2000) p 71). Further, attention should focus on the modern form of the 1948 Act, and this is deliberately phrased in terms of a duty on the local authority to make arrangements. That duty never passes to the care home, which does no more than provide care and accommodation under contract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view it is appropriate to focus on the modern form of the 1948 Act. This is particularly so when contracting with a care home such as Southern Cross only became possible from 1 April 1993, when the legislation was amended to formulate the local authority's duty as being to arrange care and accommodation. Neither the concept nor the extent of a function of a public nature is immutable in either national or European law (cf also per Lord Rodger in <i>Aston Cantlow</i> [2004] 1 AC 546, para 159).  The modern legislation distinguishes clearly between a local authority with a statutory duty to arrange care and accommodation and a private company providing services with which the local authority contracts on a commercial basis in order to fulfil the local authority's duty to arrange care and accommodation. My noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann summarised the effect of the modern form of legislation, aptly also for present purposes, in <i>R v Wandsworth London Borough Council, Ex p Beckwith </i>[1996] 1 WLR 60, 64C-D:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The duty of the council under section 21 is to make "arrangements" for providing residential accommodation for certain classes of people. Subsection (4) says that the accommodation must be managed by the local authority or by some other authority. But this is expressed to be subject to section 26, which says that "arrangements under section 21 of this Act" (not, notice, "<i>the</i> arrangements <i>made</i> under section 21 of this Act") may include arrangements with the private sector. The draftsman is therefore not saying that homes in the private sector may be included in the collective of homes which the council has to provide. He is saying that the <i>concept</i> of "arrangements" which has been used to define the council's duty in section 21 is to include arrangements with the private sector. This produces an altogether different result: it extends the meaning of the concept by which the council's duty is defined. Any arrangements which fall within the extended definition will satisfy the council's duty."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rider that perhaps calls for mention is that it is not, and could not be, suggested that a local authority has no continuing duty in respect of the suitability of a placement, once made. As Moses J observed in <i>R v Servite Houses, Ex p Goldsmith</i> [2001] LGR 55, 66d: </p>
<p></p><ul>"It remains under a duty to see that the applicants' needs are met and if necessary to re-assess them. It remains under an obligation to ensure that the arrangements which it has made continue to be sufficient to meet the needs of those qualified for such community care provision".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not regard the actual provision, as opposed to the arrangement, of care and accommodation for those unable to arrange it themselves as an inherently governmental function. The duty on a local authority under section 21 constitutes a safety net, conditional upon care and attention being "not otherwise available". In practice, this means that, if a person assessed as in need of care and accommodation has more than £21,000 capital and can arrange care and accommodation or (for example through relatives) make arrangements for it, then the local authority will not be further involved. In contrast with the position relating to the national health service, the default position is one in which the local authority is not involved. I can see no basis, and none was really suggested, on which a private care home could somehow be regarded as exercising functions of a public nature in providing care and accommodation for "self-funders", those who or whose relatives could fund and make their own arrangements. The local authority's involvement is aimed at making arrangements (including funding) which put those in need in effectively the same position as those "self-funders" Once such arrangements are made, the actual provision of care and accommodation is a different matter, which, as the modern legislation recognises, does not need actually to be undertaken by the local authority and can take place in the private sector, as it does for those who or whose relatives are able to make arrangements including funding for themselves. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116.&nbsp;&nbsp;In providing care and accommodation, Southern Cross acts as a private, profit-earning company. It is subject to close statutory regulation in the public interest. But so are many private occupations and businesses, with operations which may impact on members of the public in matters as diverse for example as life, health, privacy or financial well-being. Regulation by the State is no real pointer towards the person regulated being a state or governmental body or a person with a function of a public nature, if anything perhaps even the contrary. The private and commercial motivation behind Southern Cross's operations does in contrast point against treating Southern Cross as a person with a function of a public nature. Some of the particular duties which it has been suggested would follow - a duty not to close the home without regard to the Convention right to a home of publicly funded residents, and perhaps even a duty to give priority to accepting such residents into the home - fit in my view uneasily with the ordinary private law freedom to carry on operations under agreed contractual terms, even accepting (as I would) that, if the Convention applied, a private care home would be able to invoke that freedom as a relevant factor under article 8(2).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117.&nbsp;&nbsp;A private care home company provides services for residents in its care homes, which do not - and should not - depend in their nature or quality on the person with whom it contracts to provide such services. Age Concern England in a memorandum dated January 2006 annexed to the Joint Committee of the House of Lords and House of Commons of March 2007 was aware of this, and observed that "it would also be inequitable if self-funders - who pay higher fees (often called the 'self-funders rate') - had less legal protection than residents whose lower fees are met by the local authority" (para 3.5). Age Concern's only antidote was to recommend some form of legislation (paras 8.4 to 8.5). In my view, however, a submission which leads to such a distinction being drawn under section 6(3)(b) of the Human Rights Act is inherently questionable.  Care homes would be bound to be, and to make their staff, aware of the distinction between Human Rights Convention protected and other residents. If it came to an issue like closure of a wing of a home or relocation of some residents during works, there could be an incentive (it might be argued even a legal duty) to give priority to the wishes and demands of publicly funded residents. To distinguish between different residents in the same care home on the basis of their ability to make the relevant contractual arrangements necessary to gain entry to the home appears undesirable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some differences do of course exist between care home residents whose placement is arranged under section 21 and residents whose placement is privately arranged. Every resident, privately or publicly funded, must consent, either personally or through a representative, to being admitted to the particular care home. A privately funded resident has, subject to space and funds, a choice of care homes. A publicly funded resident also has the choice which care home to enter, at least if the necessary funds exist to meet any consequential top-up liability. All care home residents have common and criminal law rights not to be mistreated (including any claims that may, perhaps, exist for breach of statutory duty). But a privately placed resident will either be party to a contract with the care home or be resident as a result of a contract covering his or her residence made by a representative or relative. In contrast, the only contract covering the publicly funded resident's placement may be between the local authority and the care home, although YL was through her representative party to the tripartite arrangements described at the start of this opinion. On the other hand, even if a publicly funded resident is not party to any contract with the care home, he or she will (unlike privately funded residents) have public law rights, including the right to invoke the protection of the Human Rights Convention, as against the local authority. These will enable him or her effectively to place on the local authority the onus to take any steps open to it as against the care home to protect the resident's human rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view the differences mentioned do not either justify or require a different approach to the application to the care home of the Convention as between privately and publicly funded residents in one and the same care home. Apart from any contractual arrangements, the care home should view and treat all such residents with equality. Their contractual arrangements differ, but not in any way which indicates that publicly funded residents need additional protection compared with privately funded residents. A publicly funded resident's Convention rights against the local authority may even mean that he or she is in some respects already more amply protected than a privately funded resident. As to the direct application of the Convention as against a care home, it is less incongruous to distinguish between residents in privately owned, profit-earning care homes on the one hand and residents in a local authority owned and managed care home on the other hand, than it is to distinguish between publicly and privately funded residents in one and the same care home. Residents in a local authority owned and managed care home have the protection of the Convention not because the function of providing care and accommodation for those in need is inherently public in nature, but simply because a local authority is a core public authority, all of whose activities are, whatever their nature, subject to the Convention under section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120.&nbsp;&nbsp;The House was referred to a number of previous domestic authorities. The decision which I would reach on this appeal fits within them. Before the Human Rights Act came into force, in <i>R v North and East Devon Health Authority, Ex p Coughlan</i> [2001] QB 213, the court granted judicial review of a health authority's decision to close one of its National Health Service nursing homes; and in an illuminating judgment in <i>R v Servite Houses, Ex p Goldsmith</i> [2001] LGR 55, Moses J concluded that a private care home company was not exercising a public function in relation to residents placed with it under contract with the local authority, in the absence of any statutory source or underpinning for its operations and although the nature of its activities was "a matter of public concern and interest". At p 81 Moses J said this was "not to say that a fresh approach ought not to be adopted so that the court can meet the needs of the public faced with the increasing privatisation of what were hitherto public functions", but that, if this was to be done, it would have to be in a higher court. For my part, however, his reasoning remains persuasive, and the essentially contractual source and nature of Southern Cross's activities differentiates them from any "function of a public nature", even though it is (as often in the private sector) a matter of public concern, interest and benefit that reputable, efficient and properly regulated providers of such services should exist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>R (A) v Partnerships in Care Ltd</i> [2002] EWHC 529 Admin; [2002] 1 WLR 2610, Keith J held that section 6(3)(b) covered the functions performed by a mental nursing home registered under the Registered Homes Act 1984 in which the claimant, who had a severe personality disorder, was compulsorily detained pursuant to section 3(1) of the Mental Health Act 1983. He distinguished the circumstances before him, admission by compulsion, from those in the then first instance decision of Stanley Burnton J in <i>R </i>(<i>Heather) v Leonard Cheshire Foundation</i> [2001] EWHC 429 (Admin), residence by choice - a fact which, Keith J [2002] 1 WLR 2610, para 25 thought that Stanley Burnton J "rightly considered as critical". I agree.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in <i>R (Beer (trading as Hammer Trout Farm)) v Hampshire Farmers' Markets Ltd</i> [2003] EWCA Civ 1056; [2004] 1 WLR 233, the county council, which had previously run farmers' markets under statutory powers, set up a non-profit making company to run such markets on a contractual basis on publicly owned land to which the public had, and at common law had the right of, access for the sale of goods. The Court of Appeal held that, despite the lack of any statutory source or underpinning for the company's role, the company was both performing a function of a public nature under section 6(3)(b) and subject to judicial review. An important element in this decision was the common law right of access of the public to such markets, which was being regulated by the company in succession to the council: cf <i>R v Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council, Ex p Hook</i> [1976] 1 WLR 1052. There is in the present case no such right or feature in relation to Southern Cross. Publicly funded residents have public law rights against the local authority, but no common law right of access to or residence in any private care home, other than under a contractual arrangement with whomsoever made.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons I would hold that Southern Cross in providing care and accommodation for YL was not and is not exercising functions of a public nature within section 6(3)(b) of the Human Rights Act 1998. I would leave entirely open the position of those operating in the different areas of health and education services, but I agree with the reasoning and conclusions regarding privately owned care homes such as Southern Cross's contained in the opinions of Lord Scott of Foscote and Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury which I have had the benefit of seeing in draft. If further protection or regulation is considered to be necessary in respect of privately owned care homes, in addition to that which is available under common law or statute and for which local authorities may contract as indicated in paragraph 80 above, the means may already be available to achieve this under the Care Standards Act 2000. And, if additional protection is to be achieved by statutory means, it is no matter for regret that this should be done without distinguishing between residents in one and the same care home who on the one hand arrange and fund their own care and accommodation and others who on the other hand benefit from local authority assistance to arrange and fund such care and accommodation. I would accordingly dismiss this appeal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD NEUBERGER OF ABBOTSBURY</p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introductory</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;124.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a "person [is] by reason of age, illness [or] disability in need of care and attention which [would] not otherwise [be] available to [her]", the local authority "in whose area [she] is ordinarily resident" becomes liable, under sections 21(1)(a) and 24(1) of the National Assistance Act 1948 ("the 1948 Act") as amended, to "make arrangements for providing … residential accommodation" for her. By virtue of section 21(5), "accommodation" in this context extends to such "board and other services, amenities and requisites" as she needs, and in this speech I shall refer to these services as "care and accommodation". Such care and accommodation can be provided by the local authority itself (sections 21(4), 22 and 23), by another local authority (section 24(4)), or by "a voluntary organisation or … any other person [who] manages premises which provide for reward [such] accommodation" (section 26(1)). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125.&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue raised on this appeal is whether, in a case where a local authority performs its duty by arranging and paying for care and accommodation in a privately owned care home, the person concerned can claim that the proprietor of the care home is thereby someone "certain of whose functions are functions of a public nature" within the meaning of section 6(3)(b) of the Human Rights Act 1998 ("the 1998 Act"). The appeal arises from facts, and in a historical context, which are fully set out in the opinions of my noble and learned friends, Baroness Hale of Richmond and Lord Mance, which I have had the privilege of reading in draft. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;126.&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the conclusion reached by Lord Mance, and with his reasons for reaching that conclusion. However, as the issue raised on this appeal is of some importance, and as it has resulted in a sharp difference of opinion in this House, it seems appropriate to explain my thinking, although, in doing so, I do not intend to detract from my agreement with Lord Mance's reasoning. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;127.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the provision of care and accommodation in circumstances such as those of the instant case is a function falling within subsection (3)(b) of section 6 of the 1998 Act ("section 6"), then, by virtue of section 6(1), it would be "unlawful" for the proprietor of the care home "to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right" of that person. Thus, a resident of a privately owned care home, whose care and accommodation is paid for (in whole or in part), or even (possibly) whose care and accommodation has simply been arranged, by a local authority would have rights against the proprietor of the home ("the proprietor") in addition to those that would lie under contract, common law or purely domestic legislation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;128.&nbsp;&nbsp;While the issue can be relatively easily and briefly expressed and explained, it is much harder to resolve with confidence, as is demonstrated by the sharp difference of opinion revealed in the four preceding opinions. Any reasoned decision as to the meaning of section 6(3)(b) risks falling foul of circularity, preconception and arbitrariness. The centrally relevant words, "functions of a public nature", are so imprecise in their meaning that one searches for a policy as an aid to interpretation. The identification of the policy is almost inevitably governed, at least to some extent, by one's notions of what the policy should be, and the policy so identified is then used to justify one's conclusion. Further, given that the question of whether section 6(3)(b) applies may often turn on a combination of factors, the relative weight to be accorded to each factor in a particular case is inevitably a somewhat subjective decision. </p>
