        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suspect that, having regard to the 
          power of the court to strike out actions which have no real prospect 
          of success, the <i>Hunter </i>doctrine is unlikely in this context to 
          be invoked very often. In my opinion, the first step in any application 
          to strike out an action alleging negligence in the conduct of a previous 
          action must be to ask whether it has a real prospect of success. Hopeless 
          cases like <i>Rondel v. Worsley</i> [1969] 1 A.C. 191 are not a suitable 
          vehicle for deciding important points of public policy.</p>
        <i> 
        <p>25. Conclusion</p>
        </i> 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, I have said nothing about whether 
          the immunity, if preserved, would be contrary to article 6 of the European 
          Convention on Human Rights. The question does not arise. Nor have I 
          said anything about the distinction between those acts of lawyers which 
          are "intimately connected" with the conduct of litigation and those 
          which are not. The Court of Appeal, being bound by <i>Saif Ali v. Sydney 
          Mitchell &amp; Co. </i>[1980] A.C. 198, struggled with this distinction. 
          Mr. Sumption's submissions as to why they were wrong served only to 
          convince me that the distinction is very difficult to apply with any 
          degree of consistency. That is perhaps another reason why the immunity 
          should be altogether abolished. I would therefore dismiss the appeals.</p>
        <p><b>LORD HOPE OF CRAIGHEAD</b></p>
        <p>My Lords,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The events with which these three appeals are 
          concerned took place in 1991, when the parties on one side of the case 
          ("the clients") were all engaged in civil litigation for the purposes 
          of which they had appointed the other party to act as their solicitors. 
          Mr. Simons, who is a building contractor, was in dispute with the owner 
          of a building about the work which he had carried out for the owner 
          under a building contract. The proceedings were settled on 19 August 
          1991, which was the day before the trial of his action was due to start. 
          Mr. Barratt was in dispute with his wife after their marriage had broken 
          down. Her claim for ancillary relief was settled on 5 September 1991 
          when the judge approved a minute of order lodged by his solicitors and 
          directed that it should stand as the court's order made by consent. 
          Mrs. Harris was also engaged in matrimonial proceedings following the 
          breakdown of her marriage. In her case a consent order was made by the 
          judge on 22 November 1991 following advice which she received from counsel 
          outside the court on the day of the ancillary relief hearing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In each case the clients are dissatisfied with 
          the outcome of their litigation and in particular with the terms of 
          settlement. They have alleged that the solicitors were negligent in 
          regard to things which they did or omitted to do outside the courtroom. 
          The essence of the case made by Mr. Simons against his solicitors is 
          that they should have advised him at the outset that he should settle 
          on the terms which he was ultimately forced to accept after much unnecessary 
          delay and expenditure or that they should have prepared for trial so 
          that he could pursue his case with unimpaired prospects of success. 
          Mr. Barratt's case is that his solicitors failed at any stage to obtain 
          or advise the obtaining of a valuation of the family home which was 
          eventually sold for much less than it had been assumed to be worth when 
          they were negotiating the terms of settlement, that they lodged with 
          the court a minute of order which inaccurately recorded the valuation 
          of the property and that they failed to advise him that the settlement 
          should provide for the parties to receive percentage interests in the 
          property rather than that his wife should receive a guaranteed sum when 
          it was sold. Mrs. Harris alleges that her solicitors failed to brief 
          competent counsel, to inform themselves properly of the facts and take 
          proper instructions prior to the settlement and that they gave incorrect 
          advice about the possibility of setting aside a consent order. The solicitors 
          in each case claim that they are immune from suit in regard to the allegedly 
          negligent conduct.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All three cases were listed and heard together 
          in the Court of Appeal, as was a fourth case with which your Lordships 
          are not now concerned. At the outset of their judgment the Court of 
          Appeal (Lord Bingham C.J., Morritt and Waller L.JJ.) said that the following 
          questions arose ([1999] 3 W.L.R. 873, 881D-E): to what extent and in 
          what circumstances does a lawyer's immunity from suit in relation to 
          the allegedly negligent conduct of a case in court protect him against 
          claims for allegedly negligent acts and omissions which take place out 
          of court? Does a lawyer, if not otherwise immune from a claim in negligence 
          by a client, become so when the court approves a consent order in any 
          proceedings, but particularly in matrimonial proceedings in relation 
          to ancillary relief? Is it in such circumstances an abuse of the process 
          of the court to claim damages against a lawyer for alleged negligence 
          leading to the making of a consent order?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary sources on which the Court of Appeal 
          drew as to the advocate's immunity were the decisions of the House in 
          <i>Rondel v. Worsley</i> [1969] 1 A.C. 191 and <i>Saif Ali v. Sydney 
          Mitchell &amp; Co.</i> [1980] A.C. 198. After setting out four propositions 
          which it derived from them, the court made these observations, at p. 
          882F-H:</p>
        <p>
        </p><ul>
          "It may of course be that the House of Lords will hereafter choose to 
          review and modify the rulings given in these two leading cases, and 
          it is noteworthy that in the <i>Saif Ali</i> case [1980] A.C. 198 Lord 
          Diplock, at p. 223, expressed regret that counsel for the plaintiff 
          had not made a more radical challenge to the authority of <i>Rondel 
          v. Worsley</i> [1969] 1 A.C. 191. We understand further that the European 
          Court of Human Rights may be called upon to consider the compatibility 
          of the decision in <i>Rondel v. Worsley </i>with the European Convention 
          for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (1953) (Cmd. 
          8969). But we must treat these cases as binding authority for the four 
          propositions we have set out. Those propositions do not, however, answer 
          the first question posed above, which relates to the outer limits of 
          forensic immunity, beyond the core immunity which protects an advocate 
          against claims arising from the conduct of a cause in court. More particularly, 
          the issue arises (in all four appeals) whether forensic immunity . . 
          . affords immunity to a lawyer who advises that a case be compromised, 
          where the advice is accepted and the case is settled." 
          <p></p>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the three remaining appeals have reached 
          this House the opportunity has been taken to undertake the more radical 
          challenge to the authority of <i>Rondel v. Worsley</i> [1969] 1 A.C.191 
          which was not undertaken in the <i>Saif Ali </i>case [1980] A.C. 198. 
          It is therefore open to your Lordships to dispose of them on grounds 
          which were not available to the Court of Appeal.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to say, however, before turning to this 
          wider and more general argument, that I consider that the grounds which 
          the Court of Appeal gave for its decision in each case were entirely 
          sound, sufficient and satisfactory and that I would have dismissed each 
          of the appeals for the same reasons irrespective of the view that was 
          taken about what the Court of Appeal has described as the core forensic 
          immunity. In Mr. Simons's case this is because the acts and omissions 
          of which he complains were done or not done, as the case may be, when 
          the solicitors were acting otherwise than as advocates. Even if they 
          had been acting in the relevant respects as advocates, none of the allegations 
          against them satisfy the "intimate connection" test described by McCarthy 
          P. in <i>Rees v. Sinclair</i> [1974] 1 N.Z.L.R. 180,187: see the Court 
          of Appeal's judgment [1999] 3 W.L.R. 873, 908E-G. In Mr. Barratt's case 
          the solicitors were not acting as advocates in relation to any alleged 
          act of negligence, nor was their conduct said to be negligent in an 
          area where the solicitors could say that they were acting where public 
          policy as the rationale for immunity had any impact: p. 911F. In Mrs. 
          Harris's case her solicitors were not acting in any way as advocates 
          in the respects in which they were alleged to be negligent, nor is there 
          any public policy rationale for which immunity in their case could be 
          said to be justified: p. 920G-921A. In short, I would regard the argument 
          in each case for extending the immunity to the solicitors when they 
          were negotiating the terms of settlement as entirely without merit on 
          the existing state of the authorities. On this view it is unnecessary 
          to examine the fundamental question whether the core forensic immunity 
          can now - or, to put the question more accurately if it is to provide 
          a ground for our decision in these three cases, <i>could</i> <i>in</i> 
          <i>1991</i> - still be justified on grounds of public policy. Nevertheless 
          I agree that your Lordships should accept the opportunity for reviewing 
          the fundamental question, for the following reasons.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first reason is that, as Lord Reid recognised 
          in <i>Rondel v. Worsley</i> [1969] 1 A.C. 191, 227, public policy is 
          not immutable. Lord Wilberforce was making the same point when he said 
          in <i>Roy v. Prior</i> [1971] A.C. 470, 480F that immunities conferred 
          by the law in respect of legal proceedings need always to be checked 
          against a broad view of the public interest. Doubts have once again 
          arisen as to whether the existing rule is justified in present day conditions 
          in this country, so it is proper to re-examine the whole matter now. 
          The second reason is that there is now a greater appreciation of the 
          importance which has to be attached in this context to the principles 
          of human rights law, especially in view of the imminence of the coming 
          into force of the Human Rights Act 1998. The period which has to elapse 
          before that Act comes into force in October 2000 is now very short. 
          I think that it is appropriate in this case to anticipate that event 
          by taking account of the relevant provisions of the European Convention 
          on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms ("the Convention") and the 
          jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights in our determination 
          of the question whether, and if so to what extent, the core forensic 
          immunity can still be justified. The third reason is that, while I would 
          not regard it as necessary in order to dispose of these appeals for 
          your Lordships to say that any change as regards the immunity rule should 
          operate retrospectively, I consider it to be a legitimate exercise of 
          your Lordships' judicial function to declare prospectively whether or 
          not the immunity - which is a judge-made rule - is to be available in 
          the future and, if so, in what circumstances.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that none of your Lordships would 
          wish to go so far as to hold that <i>Rondel v. Worsley</i> [1969] 1 
          A.C. 191 was wrongly decided and that it should be overruled. The issue 
          is whether the decision which was reached in that case can now be justified. 
          It seems to me to be preferable that we should address this issue by 
          examining the circumstances relevant to this issue as we find them today, 
          and that we should express our decision so that it applies only to the 
          future - not to a period in the past as well, the commencement of which 
          would be very difficult at this stage to identify.</p>
        <i> 
        <p><i></i></p>
        <p><i>The basic principle</i></p>
        </i> 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any immunity from suit is a derogation from 
          a person's fundamental right of access to the court which has to be 
          justified. This principle is found both in the common law and in the 
          jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights. For the common 
          law position it is sufficient to note the following observations. In 
          <i>Rondel v. Worsley</i> [1969] 1 A.C. 191, 228 Lord Reid said:</p>
        <p>
        </p><ul>
          "Like so many questions which raise the public interest, a decision 
          one way will cause hardships to individuals while a decision the other 
          way will involve disadvantage to the public interest. On the one hand, 
          if the existing rule of immunity continues there will be cases, rare 
          though they may be, where a client who has suffered loss through the 
          negligence of his counsel will be deprived of a remedy. So the issue 
          appears to me to be whether the abolition of the rule would <i>probably</i> 
          be attended by such disadvantage to the public interest as to make its 
          retention <i>clearly</i> justifiable." (Emphasis added) 
          <p></p>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <i>Rees v. Sinclair</i> [1974] 1 N.Z.L.R. 
          180, 187 McCarthy P. said that the protection of the immunity should 
          not be given any wider application than is absolutely necessary in the 
          interests of the administration of justice. In the <i>Saif Ali</i> case 
          [1980] A.C. 198, 214H Lord Wilberforce said that in fixing the boundary 
          of immunity from an action, which depends on public policy, account 
          must be taken of the principle that a wrong should not be without a 
          remedy. As Kirby J. said in <i>Boland v. Yates Property Corporation 
          Pty. Ltd</i>. (1999) 74 A.L.J.R. 209, 236, 238, 239, paras.129, 137 
          and 140, an immunity from liability at law is a derogation from the 
          normal accountability for wrong-doing which is an ordinary feature of 
          the rule of law and fundamental civil rights. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of human rights law the individual's 
          right of access to the court for the determination of his civil rights 
          is to be found in article 6 (1) of the Convention. In <i>Golder v. United 
          Kingdom</i> (1975) 1 E.H.R.R. 524, 535-536 paragraph 35 the European 
          Court of Human Rights said:</p>
        <p>
        </p><ul>
          "The principle whereby a civil claim must be capable of being submitted 
          to a judge ranks as one of the universally 'recognised' fundamental 
          principles of law; the same is true of the principle of international 
          law which forbids the denial of justice. Article 6(1) must be read in 
          the light of these principles." 
          <p></p>
        </ul>
        <p>In <i>Fayed v. United Kingdom </i> (1994) 18 E.H.R.R. 393, 429-430, 
          para. 65, in a passage which was approved in <i>Tinnelly Sons Ltd. v. 
          United Kingdom</i> (1998) 27 E.H.R.R. 249, 271, para. 74, the court 
          said:</p>
        <p>
        </p><ul>
          "'(a) The right of access to the courts secured by article 6(1) is not 
          absolute but may be subject to limitations, these are permitted by implication 
          since the right of access" by its very nature calls for regulation by 
          the state, regulation which may vary in time and in place according 
          to the need and resources of the community and individuals." [<i>Belgian 
          Linguistic Case (No. 2) </i>(1968) 1 E.H.R.R. 252, 281, para. 5]<i>

          (b) In laying down such regulation, the contracting states enjoy a certain 
          margin of appreciation, but the final decision as to the observance 
          of the Convention's requirements rests with the court. It must be satisfied 
          that, the limitations applied do not restrict or reduce the access left 
          to the individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence 
          of the right is impaired. 
          <p></p>
        </ul>
        <p>
        </p><ul>
          (c) Furthermore, a limitation will not be compatible with article 6(1) 
          if it does not pursue a legitimate aim and if there is not a reasonable 
          relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim 
          sought to be achieved.' [<i>Lithgow v. United Kingdom</i> (1986) 8 E.H.R.R. 
          329, 393 para. 194] 
          <p></p>
        </ul>
        <p>
        </p><ul>
          These principles reflect the process, inherent in the court's task under 
          the Convention, of striking a fair balance between the demands of the 
          general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection 
          of the individual's fundamental rights." 
          <p></p>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear from the passage which I have quoted 
          from Lord Reid's speech in <i>Rondel v. Worsley</i> [1969] 1 A.C. 191, 
          228 that under the common law the presumption is strongly in favour 
          of the right of the individual to a remedy. Any immunity from suit must 
          therefore be clearly justifiable. In terms of human rights law it will 
          only be justifiable if it is designed to pursue a legitimate aim and 
          then only if it satisfies the test of proportionality. If the restriction 
          which the immunity imposes on the right of the individual is disproportionate 
          to the aim sought to be achieved on grounds of public policy it will 
          be incompatible with the right secured to the individual by article 
          6(1) of the Convention. Although the common law and the human rights 
          law tests are expressed in different language, they are both directed 
          to the same essential point of principle that an immunity from suit 
          is a derogation from a fundamental right which requires to be justified.

        <p><i>Summary</i></p>
        </i> 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish at the outset to summarise the main 
          points with which I intend to deal in order to explain the position 
          which I would adopt on the question of the immunity. I shall use the 
          expression "the core immunity" to describe the immunity which attaches 
          to the advocate, when engaged in conduct performed in court, from claims 
          by his client for negligence. I am conscious of the fact that, if the 
          immunity is to continue, the scope of its application may need to be 
          defined more carefully in due course.</p>
        <p>a. The sole basis for retaining the core immunity is the public interest 
          in the administration of justice.</p>
        <p>b. The public interest in the administration of justice is at its most 
          compelling in the field of criminal justice.</p>
        <p>c. The risks to the efficient administration of our system of criminal 
          justice which would result from the removal of the core immunity greatly 
          outweigh the benefits.</p>
        <p>d. The principle in <i>Hunter v. Chief Constable of the West Midlands 
          </i>Police [1982] A.C. 529 which treats collateral challenge as an abuse 
          of process is not a satisfactory substitute in the field of criminal 
          justice for the core immunity.e. The risks to the efficient administration 
          of justice are significantly less in the field of civil justice, so 
          in that field the retention of the core immunity of the advocate from 
          claims by his client for negligence is no longer justified.<i> </i></p>
        <i> 
        <p><i>Background </i></p>
        </i> 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, as I believe, your Lordships do not wish 
          to go so far as to say that <i>Rondel v. Worsley</i> [1969] 1 A.C. 191 
          was wrongly decided, it is appropriate to take note of some the events 
          that have happened since then - and especially since the date of the 
          decision in the <i>Saif Ali</i> case [1980] A.C. 198 - which may throw 
          light on the view that ought now to be taken as to the justification 
          for the immunity on grounds of public policy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question whether the core immunity was 
          in the public interest was considered by the 1979 Royal Commission on 
          Legal Services. In its final report the Royal Commission concluded (Cmnd. 
          7648, vol. 1, p. 333, para. 24.7):</p>
        <p>
        </p><ul>
          "It happens that we first considered this topic before the most recent 
          decision of the House of Lords [<i>Saif Ali</i>] was made known. We 
          considered that, on balance, it was in the public interest that there 
          should be immunity in respect of an advocate's work in court and reached 
          a provisional conclusion as to the proper extent of that immunity which 
          was close to that which has now been laid down. Accordingly we have 
          no recommendation to make in regard to the extent of immunity which 
          would go beyond the law as now stated." 
          <p></p>
        </ul>
        <p>Legislation consistent with this conclusion, and with the decision 
          in the <i>Saif Ali </i>case, was introduced under the Supply of Goods 
          and Services Act 1982. Section 13 of that Act implies a term of reasonable 
          skill and care into contracts for the supply of a service where the 
          supplier is acting in the course of a business. But the Supply of Services 
          (Exclusion of Implied Terms) Order 1982 (S.I. 1982 No. 1771), made under 
          section 12(4) of the Act, provides that that section shall not apply 
          to:</p>
        <p>
        </p><ul>
          "2. . . . (1) the services of an advocate in court or before any tribunal, 
          inquiry or arbitrator and in carrying out preliminary work directly 
          affecting the conduct of the hearing." 
          <p></p>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Conservative government came to power 
          in 1989 the practices of the legal profession again came under close 
          scrutiny. The aim was to bring to an end restrictive practices, such 
          as those relating to rights of audience, that could no longer be justified. 
          This resulted in the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990. That Act was 
          preceded in 1989 by both a Green Paper <i>The Work and Organisation 
          of the Legal Profession </i>(Cm. 570) and a White Paper entitled <i>Legal 
          Services: A Framework for the Future </i>(Cm. 740) in which the view 
          was expressed that the core immunity was justified in the public interest. 
          The Green Paper stated in paragraph 62:</p>
        <p>
        </p><ul>
          "The main reasons for this immunity are that the administration of justice 
          requires barristers and solicitors to be able to carry out their duty 
          to the court fearlessly and independently and that actions for negligence 
          against barristers and solicitors in respect of advocacy work would 
          make the re-trying of the original actions inevitable and so multiply 
          litigation. The Government accepts the cogency of these arguments and 
          considers that this immunity from actions in negligence should in the 
          future extend to all recognised advocates." 
          <p></p>
        </ul>
        <p>During the progress of the Bill attempts were made in both Houses to 
          abolish the immunity (Hansard (H.L. Debates), 5 February 1990, cols 
          570-578); (H.C. Debates, Standing Committee D), 7 June 1990, cols. 325-340), 
          but proposed amendments to that effect were withdrawn after debate. 
          The Lord Chancellor said that the Government believed the immunity rule 
          to be an appropriate one, and he emphasised that it had "placed it in 
          the forefront of consultation right from the start" (Hansard (H.L. Debates), 
          5 February 1990, col. 576). In the result what is now section 62 of 
          the Act of 1990, which extended the immunity to a person who is not 
          a barrister but is lawfully providing legal services in any proceedings, 
          was enacted against the background of the existing rule, which it did 
          not alter. A further opportunity arose in Parliament to abolish the 
          immunity when parts of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 were amended 
          by the Access to Justice Act 1999. It was not suggested in either House 
          that the existing immunity was no longer in the public interest and 
          should be abolished.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that Parliament has not seen fit to 
          abolish the core immunity does not, of course, mean that your Lordships 
          should feel inhibited from taking that initiative. The position which 
          Parliament has adopted is consistent with the view that the question 
          whether the immunity should be retained is pre-eminently a matter for 
          the judges. But the heart of the matter is whether the immunity is in 
          the public interest. It is true, as my noble and learned friend Lord 
          Steyn has pointed out, that a number of distinguished commentators including 
          Sir Sydney Kentridge Q.C. and David Pannick Q.C. have expressed views 
          to the effect that it cannot be justified. But it is notorious that 
          views as to what is in the public interest may vary widely from one 
          person to another, and that they are heavily dependent upon each person's 
          background, focus of attention and experience. The judicial task is 
          to gather the evidence from all the sources that are available and, 
          having done so, to assess the weight of that evidence.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my part, I would be inclined to attach 
          considerable weight to that fact that neither the 1979 Royal Commission 
          nor the consultation exercise which preceded the enactment of the Courts 
          and Legal Services Act 1990 revealed that there is widespread dissatisfaction 
          among members of the public with the core immunity. I would also be 
          inclined, even now, to attach weight to the observations of the judges 
          in <i>Rondel v. Worsley</i> [1969] 1 A.C. 191 and the <i>Saif Ali</i> 
          case [1980] A.C. 189 and, more recently, in <i>Giannarelli v. Wraith</i> 
          (1988) 165 C.L.R. 543 in the High Court of Australia with particular 
          reference to the public interest in the efficient administration of 
          criminal justice. Another factor to which I would attach some importance 
          is the marked lack of litigation directed to this issue in this country. 
          The list which is provided in the Court of Appeal's judgment of the 
          decided cases in which lawyers have been held entitled to avail themselves 
          of the protection afforded by the immunity contains only one case in 
          which the complaint related to the conduct of the trial: <i>Bateman 
          v. Owen White </i>[1996] 1 P.N.L.R. 1 (failure to object to inadmissible 
          evidence). The present cases, as I mentioned above, do not involve a 
          challenge to the core immunity. They are concerned with the limits of 
          its application. These factors suggest to me that the arguments for 
          the abolition of the immunity are more finely balanced than some commentators 
          have suggested, and that the case for abolition requires to be approached 
          with caution and with careful regard to all the relevant factors.</p>
        <i> 
        <p><i>The basis for the core immunity</i></p>
        </i> 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My noble and learned friends Lord Steyn and 
          Lord Hoffmann have analysed the arguments for the immunity under four 
          headings: (1) the cab rank rule, (2) the analogy of the immunity of 
          others who participate in court proceedings, (3) re-litigation or collateral 
          challenge and (4) divided loyalty or the duty of the advocate to the 
          court. I am content to accept this analysis of the various reasons which 
          have been advanced to support the immunity on grounds of public policy. 
          But I would approach each of them in a different way, by asking myself 
          in each case what bearing each of these arguments has on the administration 
          of our systems of criminal justice. I think that it is also worth bearing 
          in mind that these arguments are not of equal weight. As my noble and 
          learned friend Lord Steyn has said, the critical factor is the duty 
          of the advocate to the court. He has used the word "barrister," but 
          I think that we are all agreed that the position of advocates in Scotland 
          and of solicitor advocates in all three jurisdictions is the same in 
          this respect as that of barristers and I shall use the word "advocate" 
          to embrace all of them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish to say much about the cab rank 
          rule. Its value as a rule of professional conduct should not be underestimated, 
          but its significance in daily practice is not great and the extending 
          of the rights of audience of solicitor advocates who are not bound by 
          the same rule has reduced such importance as it may once have had in 
          the context of discussions about advocates' immunity. I do not think 
          that there is any sound basis for thinking that removal of the immunity 
          would have the effect of depriving those who were in need of the services 
          of advocates in criminal cases of the prospect of obtaining their services. 
          The independent bars have a long and honourable tradition in the field 
          of criminal justice that no accused person who wishes the services of 
          an advocate will be left without representation. This is a public duty 
          which advocates perform without regard to such private considerations 
          as personal gain or personal inconvenience.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that there is a little more, but not 
          much, to be said for the analogy with the immunity of others who participate 
          in the proceedings which take place in court. At best it is only an 
          analogy. It is a make-weight argument. Its significance lies in the 
          fact that the other immunities exist because they also can be justified 
          on grounds of public policy. They are illustrations of the fundamental 
          point that it is in the public interest that those who are called upon 
          to give evidence in court or who have to perform duties there should 
          be enabled to do so without the risk of being sued for defamation or 
          for negligence. As Mason C.J. said in <i>Giannarelli v. Wraith</i>, 
          165 C.L.R. 543, 557 the exception in favour of counsel is in conformity 
          with the privilege which the law has always conferred on those engaged 
          in the adminstration of justice, whether as judge, juror, witness, party, 
          counsel or solicitor in respect of what they say in court. In an appropriate 
          case the public interest will prevail over the private interest. But 
          each of these immunities needs to be justified, and this can be done 
          only on grounds which are relevant to the public interest in the efficient 
          and impartial administration of justice.</p>
