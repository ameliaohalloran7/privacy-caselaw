<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reference to Hansard does not often help the courts with issues of statutory interpretation, but experience has shown that it does so occasionally.  In this instance it is as helpful as the consultation paper of May 1998, summarised by my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill, in relation to the Order of 1999.  Not being persuaded that there is any good reason why the courts should deny themselves the advantage of such sources, I would adopt the opening passage of the speech of Lord Griffiths in <i>Pepper v. Hart</i> [1993]  A.C. 593, 617: </p>
<p></p><ul>"My Lords, I have long thought that the time had come to change the self-imposed judicial rule that forbade any reference to the legislative history of an enactment as an aid to its interpretation.  The ever increasing volume of legislation must inevitably result in ambiguities of statutory language which are not perceived at the time the legislation is enacted.  The object of the court in interpreting legislation is to give effect so far as the language permits to the intention of the legislature.  If the language proves to be ambiguous I can see no sound reason not to consult Hansard to see if there is a clear statement of the meaning that the words were intended to carry.  The days have long passed when the courts adopted a strict constructionist view of interpretation which required them to adopt the literal meaning of the language.  The courts now adopt a purposive approach which seeks to give effect to the true purpose of legislation and are prepared to look at much extraneous material that bears upon the background against which the legislation was enacted.  Why then cut ourselves off from the one source in which may be found an authoritative statement of the intention with which the legislation is placed before Parliament?"<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Lord Griffiths, I agree with Lord Browne-Wilkinson in the same case at 634 that ambiguity is one condition of judicial resort to Hansard (and in the present case the only relevant one).  Again like Lord Griffiths, I think that ambiguity may fairly be said to exist even if, without Hansard, one would lean towards the interpretation supported by Hansard.  As in the present case, it is reassuring, when considering whether sweeping general statutory language can properly be cut down by interpretation, to find a wide intention confirmed by Ministerial statements in parliamentary debates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that respect the present case is analogous to <i>Marac Life Assurance Ltd. v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue</i> [1986]  1 NZLR 694, cited in the discussion in <i>Bennion on Statutory Interpretation</i>, 3rd ed. (1997) 520-521.  There an issue was whether the proceeds of certain short-term life insurance bonds were caught by an Act of 1983 taxing interest on money lent.  The language of the new Act was wide, but traditionally life insurance had been treated in taxation legislation as a separate and self-contained topic.  A court of five accepted that the new Act was not intended to depart from that pattern.  Each judge in the Court of Appeal found confirmation in, or at least referred to, a financial statement presented by the responsible Minister to the House of Representatives in moving the second reading of the Bill: see pages 701-702; 708; 713; 716; 718.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the argument of expense, in some cases time may be more usefully spent in looking up Hansard than in compiling a dossier of general propositions and authorities on statutory interpretation or administrative law familiar to every judge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary to distinguish two things often treated as if they were one.  First there are cases in which the court can in the end derive real help from Hansard, even if it is not necessarily decisive help.   I think that this case is an example.  Hansard shows that the courts will not be thwarting a clear intention of the legislators by holding that the wider interpretation is correct.  Secondly there is the question whether it is proper for counsel to cite Hansard.  A practice of constant citation is unacceptable to the courts.  Counsel must be expected to use their discretion.  In this case I think that counsel for the landlords was fully justified in his citations.  After all, they convinced the Court of Appeal.  To shut out either party from relying on Hansard would have been, in my opinion, contrary to natural justice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly I too would allow the appeal.</p>
<p><b>LORD HOPE OF CRAIGHEAD</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill, whose speech I have had the advantage of reading in draft, has described the circumstances in which The Rent Acts (Maximum Fair Rent) Order 1999 came to be made and the background to the arguments which Spath Holme Limited have advanced to the effect that section 31 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 did not give the ministers power to make the Order.  For the like reasons I too would allow the appeal by the ministers and dismiss Spath Holme's application for judicial review.  But the case has raised important questions of statutory construction with regard to the scope of the rule-making power in section 31, and I should like to add these observations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary rule is that a discretion which is conferred by Parliament on a minister must be taken to have been conferred on him with the intention that he should use it to promote the policy and objects of the Act: <i>Padfield v. Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food </i>[1968]  A.C. 997, 1030C <i>per</i> Lord Reid.  No minister who seeks to exercise a discretion which legislation has conferred on him can claim that the discretion, however widely expressed, is unfettered or unlimited.  This is essential to the maintenance of a sound relationship between the executive and the legislature in a democracy.  Discretionary powers may be sought from Parliament by the executive.  But decisions as to the extent of those powers and the purpose for which they may be exercised rest solely with Parliament.  They depend on the meaning and effect of the legislation which confers the power.  This is a matter for Parliament, not the executive.  So when issues are raised as to the scope of the discretion, as they have been in this case, it is necessary to construe the Act.  The purpose of doing so is to discover the true intent and meaning of the provision by which the discretion has been conferred by Parliament on the minister.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some cases the point at issue will turn on the meaning to be given to a word or phrase in the enabling statute which appears at first sight to be ambiguous.  In other cases the search for the true intent and meaning of the provision will raise broader considerations than the meaning to be given to particular words or phrases.  The words or phrases which the enabling provision has used may in themselves be perfectly clear and unambiguous.  On the face of it the discretion may appear to be very wide.  The question will then be whether the width which the enabling provision bears according to its ordinary and natural meaning is limited by the context in which it appears when the Act is read as a whole.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case none of the words or phrases which Parliament has used in section 31(1) of the 1985 Act appear to me to be ambiguous.  The problem arises simply because no mention is made in the subsection of the purpose for which the power has been given or the circumstances in which it may be exercised.  There is a sidenote which reads "Reserve power to limit rents".  It may be assumed from this that the intention was that the power should be used seldom, if at all, and then only when other means of restricting or limiting rents had proved to be ineffective.  But this tells one nothing about the purpose for which the power was given or the circumstances when it might be exercised.  The answer to the question which has been raised in this case about the scope of the power must therefore be found by examining the wider context.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Issues of some difficulty and importance have however been raised as to how far it is proper to go in the search for guidance as to the policy and objects of the 1985 Act.  On the one hand the ministers say that sufficient guidance is to be found in the Act itself and that, notwithstanding the fact that this is a consolidating enactment, it is both unnecessary and illegitimate to examine the legislative history by scrutinising the consolidated enactments.  They also say that it would not be appropriate in this case to refer, on the authority of <i>Pepper v. Hart </i>[1993] A.C. 593, to statements reported in Hansard.  The argument for Spath Holme on the other hand is that the power may be used only for counter-inflationary purposes.  It is based upon propositions which are drawn from an analysis of the language and history of the consolidated enactments and of material which is to be found in Hansard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of important signposts that are to be found within the 1985 Act itself which indicate the context in which this reserve power was given to the ministers.  Section 31(1) confines the power to restricting or preventing increases of rent to rent for "dwellings".  Section 32(3) provides that the power does not apply to a dwelling forming part of a tenancy to which Part II of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 applies because the premises are occupied for business or professional purposes.  The Act as a whole relates to the housing of tenants in the public and private sectors.  Its primary concern is the regulation of the relationship between landlord and tenant, with a view to achieving fairness for the tenant.  It deals with matters such as the provision of information to tenants, the provision of rent books, implied terms as to fitness for habitation and obligations of repair.  It does not seek to replace or alter the systems for security of tenure and for the assessment of fair rents which are set out in the Rent Act 1977.  But, taken overall, the context in which section 31 appears is one in which the primary concern is the maintenance of fairness as between landlord and tenant in regard to the letting of dwelling-houses in both the public and the private sector for housing.  These are matters which fall within the realm of housing policy.  There is nothing here to indicate that either the Act as a whole or section 31 in particular was concerned in any respect with counter-inflation policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first question then is whether it is proper to look back to the consolidated legislation from which section 31 was derived in order to derive further guidance as to the purpose for which the section was enacted.  There is no doubt that, as general rule, it is not permissible to construe a consolidating enactment by reference to the repealed statutes which that enactment has consolidated: <i>Maunsell v. Olins</i> [1975]  A.C. 373, 392F-G <i>per</i> Lord Diplock and Lord Simon of Glaisdale.  In <i>Farrell v. Alexander </i>[1977]  A.C. 59, 72H Lord Wilberforce said that he agreed with and endorsed the principle that it is quite wrong in every case where a consolidation Act is under consideration, as a matter of course, to look back through the history of the various provisions that have been consolidated.  On the other hand an exception may be made where words used in the consolidation Act are ambiguous.  In that event, as Lord Diplock and Lord Simon recognised in <i>Maunsell v. Olins </i>at p. 392H-393A, recourse may be had to any difference in the wording of the corresponding provision in the repealed enactment as an aid to the construction of those words.  As Lord Simon said in <i>Farrell v. Alexander</i> at p. 84H, if the primary approach to construction discloses an ambiguity in a consolidation Act, that may sometimes (though rarely) be resolved by examination of the superseded legislation.  But I do not think that that is the situation in the present case.  It seems to me that there is no ambiguity in the words used in section 31 of the 1985 Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another situation in which in <i>Farrell v. Alexander </i>at p. 84A-B Lord Simon said it was permissible for the court to construe a consolidation Act by reference to a consolidated enactment - also described by him as rare - is where the purpose of a statutory word or phrase can only be grasped by an examination of the social context in which it was first used.  But I do not think that any of the words or phrases used in section 31 fall into that category.  The argument which has been advanced for Spath Holme in this case is not directed to any ambiguity in the meaning of words or phrases used in the consolidation Act.  It seeks instead to limit the scope of the discretion which that section confers on the ministers by reference to a policy and to objects for which the sole basis in statutory language is to be found in the repealed enactments which do not appear anywhere in the consolidation Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that it is highly doubtful whether the exercise which Spath Home have invited your Lordships to carry out is legitimate in these circumstances.  But even if it was I do not think that it produces the result that Spath Holme have contended for.  The general power to make orders restricting or preventing increases in rent which was contained in section 11 of the Counter-Inflation Act 1973, which replaced the power conferred by section 2(4) of the Counter-Inflation (Temporary Provisions) Act 1972, was enacted as part of a series of measures to enable the government to control inflation.  The 1972 and 1973 Acts applied to the whole of the United Kingdom, including Scotland and Northern Ireland.  This was consistent with the fact that inflation is a phenomenon which affects the whole of the country's economy.  It does not respect internal geographical boundaries.  The power to make orders restricting or preventing increases in rents adopted the same approach, as it applied to rents generally as one of a variety of species of income that needed to be dealt with in order to control inflation.  It was not confined to rents payable by the tenants of dwelling-houses.  Measures were included to ensure that orders made under this legislation were of a temporary nature, on the view that the restrictions would no longer be needed once inflation was under control.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that was changed when section 11(1) of the Housing Rents and Subsidies Act 1975 was enacted.  This was a power which related only to the amount of rent payable on lettings of dwelling-houses.  The 1975 Act applied to England and Wales only: section 17(10).  And the power was not subject to any time-limits.  Although counter-inflation legislation was still in force when that Act was enacted and, as section 11(4) indicates, the reserve power could have been used at that time in order to help to control inflation within the economy generally, these important alterations in the structure and content of the legislation indicate that the policy reasons for which the power could be used were no longer to be confined to this.  The inference which I would draw from the enactment of this power in the 1975 Act is that it was enacted for reasons of housing policy with a view to the power being exercised by housing ministers, not for counter-inflationary reasons which would be of concern primarily to ministers responsible for economic policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The context in which the power conferred by section 11 of the 1975 Act which has now been consolidated into the 1985 Act was enacted is therefore quite different from that in which earlier powers were enacted as part of the counter-inflation legislation.  The logical conclusion of the argument that Spath Holme seek to advance is that section 31 of the 1985 Act has been preserved in the consolidation Act as a relict from the counter-inflation legislation, and that it may only be used in the circumstances which were envisaged when that legislation was enacted.  But the whole of the statutory framework which was designed to deal with the effects of inflation in the economy generally has disappeared.  The current legislation provides no yardstick, by way of definition or otherwise, which would enable the ministers to identify the parameters within which the power was available to them to be used if its use was to be confined to counter-inflationary purposes.  I am not willing to accept that it was the intention of Parliament when it enacted section 31 that the purpose for which the power might be used was so limited.  For these reasons I do not consider that it is helpful in this case, even if it were legitimate, to refer to the context in which the repealed legislation was enacted for the purpose of defining the circumstances in which the power in the consolidation Act may be exercised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the question whether it is proper to examine the statements made by ministers during the passage of the 1975 Act through Parliament as reported in Hansard.  Here again I think that it is, at best, highly doubtful whether in this case this exercise is legitimate.  My own view is that it is not.  It is important to appreciate the purpose for which your Lordships have been invited to undertake the exercise.  It is not to construe words used in the legislation which are said to be ambiguous or obscure or which, having regard to their ordinary meaning, would lead to absurdity: see <i>Pepper v. Hart</i> [1993]  A.C. 593, 640C <i>per</i> Lord Browne-Wilkinson.  Its purpose is to identify the reasons of policy for which the discretionary power to make orders restricting or preventing increases in rents was sought to be obtained from Parliament by the executive.  It is not the language used by the draftsman that is in issue here, but what was in the mind of the minister.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion there are sound reasons of principle for rejecting the argument that statements made by ministers in Parliament may be used to identify the policy and objects of an enactment for the purpose of identifying the scope of a discretionary power which Parliament has conferred on the executive.  As Lord Reid made clear in <i>Padfield v. Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</i> [1968] A.C. 997, 1030B-C, the policy and objects of the Act must be determined by construing the Act.  The underlying rule is that it is the intention of Parliament that defines the policy and objects of the Act, not the purpose or intention of the executive.  The law-making function belongs to Parliament, not to the executive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The limited exception to the general rule that resort to Hansard is inadmissible which was recognised in <i>Pepper v. Hart</i> [1993]  A.C. 593 is available to prevent the executive seeking to place a meaning on words used in legislation which is different from that which ministers attributed to those words when promoting the legislation in Parliament.  That was the situation which appears to have arisen in that case where, as Lord Bridge of Harwich observed at p. 616G-H, the argument which was before the House on the first hearing of the appeal raised an acute question as to whether it could be right to give effect to taxing legislation which was capable of two possible interpretations in such a way as to impose a tax which the Financial Secretary to the Treasury had assured the House of Commons it was not intended to impose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No such issue has been raised in this case.  As I have already sought to explain, the passages in Hansard to which your Lordships have been referred deal not with the meaning of words or possible interpretations of expressions that were or might be ambiguous but with statements made by ministers as to matters of policy.  I consider that to permit resort to Hansard as a source for material of that kind to define the scope of a discretionary power conferred by Parliament would be to extend the decision in <i>Pepper v. Hart </i>well beyond its proper limits.  I respectfully agree with my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill, for all the reasons that he has given, that it is important that the conditions laid down by the House in that case should be strictly insisted upon.  I also agree with him that, if a minister were to give a categorical assurance to Parliament that a discretionary power would not ever be used in a given set of circumstances, that statement would be admissible against the executive in order to control its exercise.  But I also think that it is important to stress that as matter of principle the decision in <i>Pepper v. Hart</i> should be confined to cases where the court is concerned with the meaning that is to be given to the words used in legislation by Parliament.  It would be contrary to fundamental considerations of constitutional principle to allow it to be used to enable reliance to be placed on statements made in debate by ministers about matters of policy which have not been reproduced in the enactment.  It is the words used by Parliament, not words used by ministers, that define the scope within which the powers conferred by the legislature may be exercised.</p>
<p><b>LORD HUTTON</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the advantage of reading in draft the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill and I gratefully adopt his account of the background giving rise to this appeal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal rightly observed in its judgment ([2000] 3 WLR 141, 151 para 27) that by far the most important ground of Spath Holme Limited's application was the following one:</p>
<p></p><ul>"27.	The Order has not been made to further the purpose with which section 31 of the Act of 1985 was enacted namely to counter general inflation within the economy.  The purpose of the Order is to achieve an extraneous purpose, namely to alleviate the perceived hardship or unfairness to one comparatively small class of tenants produced not by general inflation but by recent decisions prescribing the lawful and proper methods of determining fair rents.  This use of the Order is wholly outside the intention with which the reserve power was originally introduced into section 11 of the Counter-Inflation Act 1973, continued into section 11 of the Housing Rents and Subsidies Act 1975 and consolidated into section 31 of the Act of 1985."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 is a consolidation Act, its long title stating:</p>
<p></p><ul>"An Act to consolidate certain provisions of the law of landlord and tenant formerly found in the Housing Acts, together with the Landlord and Tenant Act 1962, with amendments to give effect to recommendations of the Law Commission. [30th October 1985] "<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its judgment the Court of Appeal cited a number of authorities on the construction of consolidation Acts.  Whilst there is some variation in the speeches in the leading cases on the proper approach to the construction of a consolidation Act, I consider that the underlying principle which emerges from the cases is that in construing a consolidation Act a court should not have regard to earlier enactments unless the language of the Act is unclear or ambiguous or there is something in the context of the Act or the relevant section which causes the court to consider that it should look for guidance to an earlier enactment or enactments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Maunsell v. Olins</i> [1975] A.C. 373 Lord Simon of Glaisdale delivered a speech which he had prepared in collaboration with Lord Diplock.  He said at p. 392H:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is only where the actual words used in the consolidation Act are ambiguous (in the sense of being fairly susceptible of bearing more than one meaning in their context and register) that recourse may be had to any difference in phraseology of the corresponding provision in the repealed enactment as an aid to their construction."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Simon of Glaisdale also expressly warned at page 393E against a court narrowing the meaning of a statutory provision by having regard to the mischief at which an earlier statutory provision was aimed,  and at p. 395A he said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The rule in <i>Heydon's Case</i>, 3 Co.Rep. 7a itself is sometimes stated as a primary canon of construction, sometimes as secondary (i.e., available in the case of an ambiguity): cf. <i>Maxwell</i>, pp. 40, 96, with <i>Craies on Statute Law,</i> 7th ed. (1971), pp. 94, 96.  We think that the explanation of this is that the rule is available at two stages.  The first task of a court of construction is to put itself in the shoes of the draftsman? to consider what knowledge he had and, importantly, what statutory objective he had? if only as a guide to the linguistic register.  Here is the first consideration of the 'mischief.'  Being thus placed in the shoes of the draftsman, the court proceeds to ascertain the meaning of the statutory language.  In this task 'the first and most elementary rule of construction' is to consider the plain and primary meaning, in their appropriate register, of the words used.  If there is no such plain meaning (i.e., if there is an ambiguity), a number of secondary canons are available to resolve it.  Of these one of the most important is the rule in <i>Heydon's Case</i>.  Here, then, may be a second consideration of the 'mischief.'<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>In the instant case, however, we ourselves find no reason to resort to any secondary canon."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In  <i>Farrell v. Alexander</i> [1977]  A.C. 59, 72G  Lord Wilberforce agreed with the approach stated by Lord Simon of Glaisdale and Lord Diplock and referring to <i>Maunsell v. Olins </i> he said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Lord Diplock and Lord Simon of Glaisdale, on the other hand, thought the word was clear and for that reason considered that it was not legitimate to go back into the legislative history.  If I may say so, on that hypothesis I would agree with them.  I would agree and endorse the principle that it is quite wrong that, in every case where a consolidation Act is under consideration, one should automatically look back through the history of its various provisions, and the cases decided upon them, and minutely trace the language from Act to Act? a process, which, incidentally, has led to an argument of four days' length in this House.  In recent times, because modern statutes have become so complicated, the courts myself included, (cf. <i>Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Joiner</i> [1975]  1 W.L.R. 1701) rather too easily accept this process, whether under persuasion of counsel or from their own scholarly inclinations.  But unless the process of consolidation, which involves much labour and careful work, is to become nothing but a work of mechanical convenience, I think that this tendency should be firmly resisted; that self-contained statutes, whether consolidating previous law, or so doing with amendments, should be interpreted, if reasonably possible, without recourse to antecedents, and that the  recourse should only be had when there is a real and substantial difficulty or ambiguity which classical methods of construction cannot resolve."<p></p></ul>
<p>See also Lord Simon of Glaisdale at pages 82 B-D and 84 A-E.</p>
<p>Lord Edmund-Davies at page 97A-B also stated that the harking back approach is only permissible if the wording of the section is ambiguous and its ambit obscure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of these judgments I turn to consider the wording of section 31 of the Act of 1985 which provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"(1)	The Secretary of State may by order provide for?<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)	restricting or preventing increases of rent for dwellings which would otherwise take place, or<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)	restricting the amount of rent which would otherwise be payable on new lettings of dwellings;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>and may so provide either generally or in relation to any specified description of dwelling.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(2)	An order may contain supplementary or incidental provisions including provisions excluding, adapting or modifying any provision made by or under an enactment (whenever passed) relating to rent or the recovery of overpaid rent.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(3)	In this section?<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"new letting" includes any grant of a tenancy, whether or not the premises were previously let, and any grant of a licence;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"rent" includes a sum payable under a licence, but does not include a sum attributable to rates or, in the case of dwellings of local authorities or new town corporations, to the use of furniture, or the provision of services;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>and for the purposes of this section an increase in rent takes place at the beginning of the rental period for which the increased rent is payable.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(4)	An order under this section shall be made by statutory instrument which shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament."<p></p></ul>
