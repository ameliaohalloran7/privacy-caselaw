<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94.&nbsp;&nbsp;In these circumstances, it seems to me positively fanciful to suggest that the decision to refuse the Application could conceivably have infringed the respondent's Article 10 rights. Assuming for the moment in favour of the respondent that the Council's decision to refuse the Application on the primary ground might have been incompatible with the respondent's Article 10 rights, it seems to me inconceivable that the secondary grounds could possibly be similarly assailed. I arrive at this conclusion by taking into account the nature of the articles, namely pornographic books, magazines and videos, whose sale from the premises is precluded by the refusal of the Application (and the consequent low level at which Article 10 is engaged), and the three secondary grounds for refusing the Licence, which  speak for themselves. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95.&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the primary ground for the refusal of the Licence in this case, it appears to me clear that the assumption upon which the analysis in the previous paragraph proceeded was over-generous to the respondent. In my judgement on the facts of the present case, the primary reason given by the Council for refusing the Application cannot possibly be said to fall foul of the respondent's Article 10 rights. The reason put forward by the Committee, as adopted by the Council, for the nil determination for the Gresham Street locality, namely the proximity of certain public buildings and shops of particular attraction to children, and of places of worship, appears to me to represent a rational ground for making and adhering to a nil determination: indeed it is just the sort of assessment that a local authority is best able to judge. Article 10 is, as mentioned, engaged at a low level, and no special facts were advanced for departing from this determination by allowing the Application. The effect of the refusal of the Application was merely to prevent the sale taking place, at best, from buildings within the Gresham Street locality: it is not as if it has been suggested that the general policy of the Council was to prevent the sale of pornographic articles anywhere in Belfast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not even as if the question of freedom of speech was wholly overlooked by the Council (as the Court of Appeal appears to have thought). As already explained, the solicitor representing the respondent told the Committee that the right to free speech under the Convention was engaged by the Application, and the minutes of the meeting record that what had been said on behalf of the respondent had been taken into account. While that cannot be said to suggest any sort of careful consideration of Article 10, it does indicate that some regard was had to it. However, for reasons already given, that is not the essential point. The essential point is that, particularly when one looks at the reasons for refusing the Application as a whole, and the fact that the respondent has not argued that there are any special features in this case (which might conceivably have justified a different result), such as, for instance, a policy on the part of the Council which resulted in there being no sex shops anywhere in Belfast, there cannot be said to have been any Article 10 infringement. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, it seems to me that Weatherup J reached the right conclusion on this issue also. The Court of Appeal appears to have reached the opposite conclusion, not so much on the basis that the Council's refusal of the Application represented a substantive breach of the respondent's Article 10 rights, but more on the basis that in failing to consider the respondent's Article 10 rights, the refusal was, in effect, procedurally defective. Apart from the facts that it is at least arguable that the council did in fact consider and take into account the respondent's Article 10 rights (albeit only cursorily), and that I would not accept that the Court of Appeal's conclusion follows from its premises, it seems to me that this analysis fell foul of the proper approach as laid down by this House in the <i>Denbigh</i> case (and it should be added that the decision of the Court of Appeal in this case predated your Lordships' decision that case). </p>
<i></i><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 1 of the First Protocol</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98.&nbsp;&nbsp;In his submissions for the respondent, Mr Larkin QC, who appeared with Mr Reel, realistically accepted that, if he could not persuade your Lordships to uphold the decision of the Court of Appeal under Article 10, then he would be bound to fail, essentially for the same reasons, insofar as his case rested on Article 1 of the First Protocol. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99.&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 1 of the First Protocol provides as follows:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Protection of property<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law…<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest…." <p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my judgement, it is highly questionable whether the respondent's case can even get as far on Article 1 of the First Protocol as it gets on Article 10. In this case, your Lordships are concerned with the third limb of that Article, control of use, in relation to which it is well established that member states are accorded a wide margin of appreciation when striking the balance between the general interest of the community and the requirement of the protection on an individual's rights under the Article: see for instance the observations of the Strasbourg court in <i>Jacobson v Sweden </i>(1989) 12 EHRR 56 at paragraph 55. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100.&nbsp;&nbsp;While Article 1 of the First Protocol is, as I see it, engaged in the present case, I find it impossible to conceive of circumstances in which a disappointed applicant for a sex establishment licence who could not show that a refusal contravened his Article 10 rights could nonetheless succeed on the ground that it infringed his rights under Article 1 of the First Protocol. It would be wrong to express a concluded view to that effect, because experience shows that circumstances can arise which are not foreseen by judges. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, it is appropriate briefly to refer to two decisions in this connection. The first is <i>ISKCON v United Kingdom</i> 18 EHRR CD 133, where the Commission, in a decision that the application in question was inadmissible, observed "that, as a general principle, the protection of property rights ensured by Article 1 of Protocol Number 1…cannot be used as a ground for claiming planning permission to extend permitted use of property". Secondly, there is the reasoning of the Court of Appeal in <i>re UK Waste Management Limited's Application </i>[2002] NI 130, where the Court of Appeal similarly held that a refusal of planning permission could not give rise to an infringement of Article 1 of the First Protocol. Carswell LCJ, giving the judgment of the court, said at 143F that the applicant's "peaceful enjoyment of its property has not been disturbed" and that "[s]till less is it a deprivation of [its] possessions". He also stated that, if there had been any relevant interference "it was in the public interest and proportionate".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is perhaps also worth mentioning the decision of the Strasbourg court in <i>Fredin v Sweden </i>[1991] ECHR 12033/86 which concerned the revocation of an existing licence to extract gravel from land owned by the applicant. It was held that this did not infringe the applicant's rights under Article 1 of the First Protocol on the grounds that, even though the applicant suffered a substantial financial loss as a result of the revocation, and received no compensation therefore, the revocation, which was for environmental reasons, was within the wide margin of appreciation afforded to the state under the third limb of the Article. Of course each case turns on its own facts, but if the revocation of an existing licence, with its substantial financial detrimental effect on the landowner, can be justified, it is indeed hard to conceive circumstances in which the refusal of the grant of a licence for the use of a property for the selling of pornographic articles on any of the grounds set out in paragraph 12 could fall foul of the property owner's rights under Article 1 of the First Protocol. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, I consider that the respondent's case on Article 1 of the First Protocol is hopeless. That was the view of Weatherup J, but the Court of Appeal, again approaching the issue in the wrong way (for the reasons given in <i>Denbigh</i>), held that the decision of the Council was flawed because it had not specifically addressed the respondent's rights under Article 1 of the First Protocol. I am bound to add that, even if that had been a good point, it would seem to me fanciful to think that the Council would (or even could) have come to a different conclusion from that which it did, if it had taken into account those rights.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104.&nbsp;&nbsp;In all these circumstances, I would allow the appeal and restore the Order of Weatherup J dismissing the respondent's application for judicial review. </p>
