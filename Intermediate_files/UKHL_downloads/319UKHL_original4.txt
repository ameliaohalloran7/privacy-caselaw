<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92.&nbsp;&nbsp;The surgeon's duty to advise his patient (and in particular, to warn of unavoidable risks of surgery) is a very important part of his professional duty.  In <i>Sidaway v Board of Governors of the Bethlem Royal Hospital and the Maudsley Hospital</i> [1985]  AC 871, 882,  Lord Scarman described the patient's right to make his own decision as a basic human right.  Lord Scarman was delivering a dissenting speech, but the whole House recognised this right (see Lord Diplock, at p 895, Lord Bridge of Harwich, at pp 897 and 900, and Lord Templeman, at p 904); and during the twenty years which have elapsed since <i>Sidaway</i> the importance of personal autonomy has been more and more widely recognised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93.&nbsp;&nbsp;The surgeon's duty to advise and warn his patient is closely connected with the need for the patient's consent to submit, under anaesthesia, to invasive surgery which would (in the absence of consent) be an assault.  The advice is the foundation of the consent.  That is why it is so important.  And for that reason I derive very little assistance from analogies based on quite different facts (such as a landowner's duty to warn of the remote risk of a hiker being injured by a landslide or a falling tree).  In this case the surgeon failed to warn of the risk of the very calamity which occurred in the course of the operation which he performed three days later.  As Kirby J said in <i>Chappel v Hart</i> (1998)  195 CLR 232, 277, para 96,</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is true to say that the inherent risks of injury from rare and random causes arise in every surgical procedure.  A patient, duly warned about such risks, must accept them and their consequences.  Mrs Hart was ready to accept any general risks of the operation of which she was warned.  However, she declined to bear the risks about which she questioned the surgeon and received no adequate response.  When those risks so quickly eventuated, commonsense suggests that something more than a mere coincidence or irrelevant cause has intervened.  This impression is reinforced once it is accepted that Mrs Hart, if warned, would not have undergone the operation when she did".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a patient in the position of Miss Chester or Mrs Hart had been injured by some wholly unforeseeable accident of anaesthesia (the scenario suggested by Gummow J in <i>Chappel v Hart</i> at para 66) or because the operating theatre was struck by lightning (Hayne J's more fanciful scenario at para 129) the injury could have been described as coincidental in the sense indicated by Mason CJ in <i>March v E &amp; MH Stramare Pty Ltd</i> (1991)  171 CLR 506, 516, </p>
<p></p><ul>"A factor which secures the presence of the plaintiff at the place where and at the time where he or she is injured is not causally connected with the injury, unless the risk of the accident occurring at that time was greater."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a traveller was delayed through a railway company's fault and a lamp exploded in the hotel where she was compelled to spend the night (the well-known case of <i>Central of Georgia Railway v Price</i> (1898)  32 SE 77) that was simply an unfortunate coincidence.  Similarly, if a taxi-driver drives too fast and the cab is hit by a falling tree, injuring the passenger, it is sheer coincidence.  The driver might equally well have avoided the tree by driving too fast, and the passenger might have been injured if the driver was observing the speed limit.  But to my mind the present case does not fall into that category.  Bare "but for" causation is powerfully reinforced by the fact that the misfortune which befell the claimant was the very misfortune which was the focus of the surgeon's duty to warn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95.&nbsp;&nbsp;Against this must be set the cogent argument, lucidly developed by McHugh J in his minority judgment in <i>Chappel v Hart,</i> that the surgeon's failure to warn did not increase the patient's risk (para 27, footnotes omitted):</p>
<p></p><ul>"Before the defendant will be held responsible for the plaintiff's injury, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant's conduct materially contributed to the plaintiff suffering that injury.  In the absence of a statute or undertaking to the contrary, therefore, it would seem logical to hold a person causally liable for a wrongful act or omission only when it increases the risk of injury to another person.  If a wrongful act or omission results in an increased risk of injury to the plaintiff and that risk eventuates, the defendant's conduct has materially contributed to the injury that the plaintiff suffers whether or not other factors also contributed to that injury occurring.  If, however, the defendant's conduct does not increase the risk of injury to the plaintiff, the defendant cannot be said to have materially contributed to the injury suffered by the plaintiff.  That being so, whether the claim is in contract or tort, the fact that the risk eventuated at a particular time or place by reason of the conduct of the defendant does not itself materially contribute to the plaintiff's injury unless the fact of that particular time or place increased the risk of the injury occurring".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That argument has even more force on the facts of this appeal, since in the Australian case Mrs Hart would have gone to another surgeon, the most experienced who could be found, whereas in this case no one has suggested that Mr Afshar was not a leading expert in this type of surgery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96.&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge carefully considered what would have happened if Mr Afshar had given his patient an adequate warning at the consultation held three days before the operation.  The judge made such findings of fact as he could (para 69) and summarised his limited findings (para 70):</p>
<p></p><ul>"Accordingly—while it is impossible to say what the probable outcome would have been if the claimant had sought a further opinion or opinions—I think it improbable that any surgery she might eventually have agreed to undergo would have been <i>identical</i> in circumstances (including nature of surgery, procedure and surgeon) to the operation she actually underwent on 21 November 1994."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97.&nbsp;&nbsp;Was this enough to justify the judge in finding a sufficient causal link between the surgeon's omission to warn and the nerve damage which ensued?  My noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann would reject that view.  He puts forward a vivid analogy from roulette.  But the 1 in 37 chance of a particular number coming up (assuming the roulette wheel to be properly made and operated) is a matter of simple and precise mathematical calculation.  By contrast the chance of nerve damage occurring (without negligence) during lumbar surgery can be calculated only with hindsight, as a more or less accurate approximation, by compiling and analysing statistics as to the outcome of that type of surgery.  The risk no doubt varies with the skill and experience of the surgeon, the severity of the patient's condition, and the precise type of surgery undertaken (for instance whether there is an operation on only one disc level, a point on which the judge made a detailed review of the expert evidence).  There may be other less easily identifiable factors which also affect the risk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not accept, on the strength of the roulette analogy, that these should be regarded as changing the scenario only in some irrelevant detail.  Nor, I suspect, would anyone who was suffering the same pain and distress as Miss Chester was suffering, and who was faced with the same dilemma as she faced (a dilemma which would have been even more anxious if she had been told of the risk of nerve damage).  In making a decision which may have a profound effect on her health and well-being a patient is entitled to information and advice about possible alternative or variant treatments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99.&nbsp;&nbsp;I accept that (as Kirby J said in <i>Chappel v Hart</i> at para 94) a surgeon should not be penalised for chance alone.  It would be irrational superstition to suppose that Mr Afshar, who had performed hundreds of similar operations without mishap, was somehow fated to meet with cauda equina syndrome, ("the terror of neurosurgery" as one of the experts put it) during the operation which he performed on Miss Chester on 21 November 1994; and that a postponement of the operation by a month (or even a day) would somehow have completely averted the risk.  It was no more "in the stars" that it would happen on that particular day than it was "in the stars" that the delayed vessel in <i>Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers (1900)Ltd v Houlder Brothers &amp; Co Ltd</i> (1917)   86 LJKB 1495 would be torpedoed on 25 May 1916, but would not have been torpedoed if making the same voyage two or three days earlier.</p>
<i>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is to my mind a criticism of the reasoning of the Court of Appeal [2003] QB 356, 377, paras 40-41:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The defendant does change the risk in a material way: he causes the patient to have an operation which she would not otherwise have had then and there and possibly not at all.  Logically, the correct comparison of risk is between having that operation on that occasion and not having it … If it is more likely than not that the same damage would not have been suffered, then by causing her to have the operation that day he has caused her to sustain it."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this passage the words "<i>possibly</i> not at all" (emphasis supplied) are difficult to reconcile, on normal principles of causation, with the requirement that it is for the claimant to prove her case, including loss caused by the defendant's negligence; and the last sentence quoted seems to stack the odds against the surgeon, since it compares a random misfortune which has actually and unexpectedly occurred with the statistical improbability of its occurring on one particular occasion in the future.</p>
