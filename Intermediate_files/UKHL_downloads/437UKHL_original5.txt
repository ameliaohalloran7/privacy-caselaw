<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100. In deciding whether there is a criminal charge for the purposes of article 6 the European Court of Human Rights ("the European Court") stated in <i>Engel v The Netherlands (No 1)</i> [1976]  1 EHRR 647, 678, para 82 that it has regard to three criteria, which are the classification of the proceedings in domestic law, the nature of the offence, and the severity of the penalty which may be imposed.  Whilst I am satisfied that the application for an anti-social behaviour order is a civil proceeding in domestic law the European Court has stated that the classification of the proceedings in domestic law is of limited value and that the other two criteria are considerations of greater weight:  see <i>Öztürk v Germany</i> (1984)  6 EHRR 409, 422, para 52.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101. In relation to the second and third criteria the European Court stated in <i>Öztürk,</i> at pp 423-424, para 53:</p>
<p></p><ul>"according to the ordinary meaning of the terms, there generally come within the ambit of the criminal law offences that make their perpetrator liable to penalties intended, inter alia, to be deterrent and usually consisting of fines and of measures depriving the person of his liberty.…<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>…. the general character of the rule [of law infringed by the applicant] and the purpose of the penalty, being both deterrent and punitive, suffice to show that the offence in question was, in terms of article 6 of the Convention, criminal in nature."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102. The complaints against the defendants under section 1 of the 1998 Act do not allege the commission of criminal offences for which punishment is sought.  The fact that the backgrounds to the complaints were the alleged commission of a number of criminal offences does not mean that the complaints constituted charges of criminal offences.  In <i>S v Miller</i> 2001  SC 977, the Inner House was considering section 52(2)(i) of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 which provides that a child may be in need of compulsory measures of supervision where he "has committed an offence", and Lord President Rodger stated, at pp 989-990, para 23:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In my view, once the procurator fiscal has decided not to proceed with the charge against a child and so there is no longer any possibility of proceedings resulting in a penalty, any subsequent proceedings under the 1995 Act are not criminal for the purposes of article 6.  Although the reporter does indeed intend to show that the child concerned committed an offence, this is not for the purpose of punishing him but in order to establish a basis for taking appropriate measures for his welfare.  That being so, the child who is notified of grounds for referral setting out the offence in question is not thereby 'charged with a criminal offence' in terms of article 6."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103. In relation to the third criteria, I consider that the making of an anti-social behaviour order does not constitute a punishment or penalty imposed on the defendant.  In my opinion the magistrate who heard the complaint against the defendant Clingham was correct when in the case stated for the opinion of the High Court he stated: </p>
<p></p><ul>"These were civil proceedings of an injunctive nature imposing no penalty on the appellant but providing such measure of restraint as the court may find necessary to protect members of the public from his misbehaviour."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104. The defendants relied on the decision of the European Commission of Human Rights ("the Commission") and of the European Court in <i>Steel v United Kingdom</i> (1998)  28 EHRR 603.  In that case some of the applicants who had been charged with a breach of the peace were committed to prison for refusing to agree to be bound over to keep the peace.  The applicants complained (inter alia) that their rights under article 5 and article 6(3)(a) had been violated.  In considering the claims of the applicants both the Commission and the European Court expressed the opinion that, notwithstanding that breach of the peace is not classified as a criminal offence under English law, breach of the peace must be regarded as an "offence" within the meaning of article 5(1)(c).  The Commission stated in its opinion, at pp 615-616:</p>
<p></p><ul>"66. …. The Commission notes that under the domestic legal system, breach of the peace is not a criminal offence and binding over is a civil procedure.  However, as the European Court of Human Rights has held [<i>Öztürk v Germany</i> (1984)  6 EHRR 409, 423-424, para 53]:<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>'[T]here generally come within the ambit of the criminal law offences that make their perpetrator liable to penalties intended, inter alia, to be deterrent and usually consisting of fines and of measures depriving the person of his liberty … [The rule at issue] prescribes conduct of a certain kind and makes the resultant requirement subject to a sanction that is punitive … the general character of the rule and the purpose of the penalty, being both deterrent and punitive, suffice to show that the offence was, in terms of article 6 of the Convention, criminal in nature.'<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>67.  The proceedings brought against the first applicant for breaching the peace also display these characteristics:  their deterrent nature is apparent from the way in which a person can be arrested for breach of the peace and subsequently bound over 'to keep the peace or be of good behaviour', in which case no penalty will be enforced, and the punitive element derives from the fact that if a person does not agree to be bound over, he will be imprisoned for a period of up to six months.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>68.  In these circumstances, the Commission considers the charge of breach of the peace to be a criminal offence and binding over proceedings to be 'criminal' in nature, for the purposes of article 6 of the Convention."<p></p></ul>
<p>The court stated, at pp 635-636:</p>
<p></p><ul>"48.&nbsp;&nbsp;Breach of the peace is not classed as a criminal offence under English law.  However, the court observes that the duty to keep the peace is in the nature of a public duty;  the police have powers to arrest any person who has breached the peace or whom they reasonably fear will breach the peace;  and the magistrates may commit to prison any person who refuses to be bound over not to breach the peace where there is evidence beyond reasonable doubt that his or her conduct caused or was likely to cause a breach of the peace and that he or she would otherwise cause a breach of the peace in the future.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>49.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing in mind the nature of the proceedings in question and the penalty at stake, the court considers that breach of the peace must be regarded as an 'offence' within the meaning of article 5(1)(c)."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105. The defendants' principal submission in reliance on <i>Steel</i> was that both in proceedings for a breach of the peace and in proceedings for an anti-social behaviour order there was a two stage process.  First, there was a finding of a breach of the peace or a finding of anti-social behaviour and, secondly, there was imprisonment if the defendant refused to be bound over or if the defendant chose to disobey the anti-social behaviour order.  Accordingly if binding over proceedings are criminal proceedings for the purposes of article 6 it follows that an application for an anti-social behaviour order is also a criminal proceeding within the meaning of article 6.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106. I am unable to accept the defendants' submissions for the reasons given by Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers MR in his judgment in <i>McCann</i> [2001] 1 WLR 1084, 1100-1101, para 62 with which I am in respectful agreement.  In particular I consider that the view expressed by the European Commission and the court is primarily based on the consideration that in the proceedings for breach of the peace before the magistrates' court the court has power in those proceedings themselves to commit the defendant to prison if he or she refuses to be bound over.  Thus the Commission stated, at 28 EHRR 603, 616, para 67:  </p>
<p></p><ul>"the punitive element derives from the fact that if a person does not agree to be bound over, he will be imprisoned for a period of up to 6 months"<p></p></ul>
<p>and the court stated, at p 636, para 49:  </p>
<p></p><ul>"Bearing in mind the nature of the proceedings in question and the penalty at stake, the court considers that breach of the peace must be regarded as an 'offence' within the meaning of article 5(1)(c)."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107. The importance of the distinction between the power to commit to prison immediately on refusal to be bound over and the need for a subsequent prosecution to impose a punishment for breach of an anti-social behaviour order or a sex offender order under section 2 of the 1998 Act is referred to by Lord Bingham of Cornhill CJ in <i>B v Chief Constable of Avon and Somerset Constabulary</i> [2001]  1 WLR 340, 353, para 27:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In [<i>Percy v Director of Public Prosecutions</i> [1995] 1 WLR 1382] the defendant had a choice between agreeing to be bound over and going to prison.  Her refusal to agree to be bound over had an immediate and obvious penal consequence without any intervening stage.  The threat of imprisonment was no doubt intended to be coercive but it was also punitive.  In my judgment that is a crucial distinction between <i>Percy's</i> case and any injunctive procedure such as in play here."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108. The fact that the defendant would be liable to imprisonment under section 1(10) of the 1998 Act if he chooses within the period specified in the order without reasonable excuse to do anything which he is prohibited from doing by the order, does not mean that the order itself constitutes a punishment or penalty.  In my opinion, the reasoning of Lord Bingham in <i>B v Chief Constable of Avon and Somerset Constabulary</i> [2001]  1 WLR 340, 352B, para 25 in respect of a sex offender order made under section 2 of the 1998 Act applies with equal force to section 1:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The rationale of section 2 was, by means of an injunctive order, to seek to avoid the contingency of any further suffering by any further victim.  It would also of course be to the advantage of a defendant if he were to be saved from further offending.  As in the case of a civil injunction, a breach of the court's order may attract a sanction.  But, also as in the case of a civil injunction, the order, although restraining the defendant from doing that which is prohibited, imposes no penalty or disability upon him."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109. The jurisprudence of the European Court recognises that proceedings taken to obtain an order designed to prevent future harmful conduct, but not to impose a penalty for past offences, does not constitute the bringing of a criminal charge.    In<i> Guzzardi v Italy</i> (1980)  3 EHRR 333  the complainant, a suspected Mafioso, by an order of the Milan Regional Court was placed under special supervision for three years with an obligation to reside within an area of 2.5 square kilometres on an island.  He brought proceedings challenging the order and the proceedings terminated in the Court of Cassation which dismissed Guzzardi's appeal.  The European Court held that article 6 was not engaged and stated, at pp 369-370,  para 108:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In the court's opinion, those proceedings did not involve the 'determination …. of a criminal charge', even when these words are construed within the meaning of the Convention.  Whether the right to liberty, which was at stake (see paragraph 62 above), is to be qualified as a 'civil right' is a matter of controversy;  in any event, the evidence does not reveal any infringement of paragraph 1 of article 6."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110. In <i>Raimondo v Italy</i> (1994)  18 EHRR 237 the applicant who was suspected of association with a Mafia-type organisation, was made subject to preventive measures which included being placed under special police supervision.  He complained (inter alia) that the proceedings relating to his appeal against the special supervision had taken an unreasonable time in violation of article 6(1) of the Convention.  The European Court rejected his complaint and held, referring to <i>Guzzardi</i>, at p 264, para 43 of its judgment:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The court shares the view taken by the Government and the Commission that special supervision is not comparable to a criminal sanction because it is designed to prevent the commission of offences.  It follows that proceedings concerning it did not involve 'the determination …. of a criminal charge'."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111. In the present cases the determination of the applications did not involve "the determination …. of a criminal charge" and the orders were designed to prevent the commission of anti-social behaviour in the future.</p>
<i><p>A Fair Hearing in the determination of Civil Rights</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112. A further question arises whether the admission of hearsay evidence against the defendants constitutes a violation of their rights under article 6 to have a fair hearing in the determination of their civil rights.  A person against whom an anti-social behaviour order is made can have no valid claim that those parts of the order which prohibit him from using or engaging in any abusive, insulting, offensive, threatening or intimidating language or behaviour or from threatening or engaging in violence or damage against any person or property relate to his civil rights.  A person has no civil right under domestic law to engage in such  behaviour.  To the extent that the order prohibits a defendant from entering a particular area or engaging in some activity which is prima facie lawful it can be argued that that part of the order affects his civil rights so that article 6(1) is engaged.  Articles 8(2) and article 11(2) of the Convention permit such restrictions on the rights specified in them as are necessary in a democratic society for the prevention of disorder or crime or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others, and Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead has discussed the relationship between civil rights under domestic law (to which article 6(1) relates) and the rights guaranteed by the Convention in paragraphs 65 to 72 of his judgment in<i> In re S (Minors) (Care Order: Implementation of Care Plan)</i> [2002]  2 AC 291, 319-320.  I wish to reserve my opinion on the question whether article 6(1) is engaged, but if there is a valid argument that the hearing of an application for an anti-social behaviour order against a defendant involves a determination of his civil rights and engages article 6(1), I am of the opinion that there is no unfairness in the admission of hearsay evidence against him, because the provisions of section 4 of the Civil Evidence Act 1995 lay down considerations which ensure that hearsay evidence is fairly weighed and assessed, section 4 providing:</p>
<p></p><ul>"(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;In estimating the weight (if any) to be given to hearsay evidence in civil proceedings the court shall have regard to any circumstances from which any inference can reasonably be drawn as to the reliability or otherwise of the evidence.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Regard may be had, in particular, to the following—<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;whether it would have been reasonable and practicable for the party by whom the evidence was adduced to have produced the maker of the original statement as a witness;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;whether the original statement was made contemporaneously with the occurrence or existence of the matters stated;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;whether the evidence involves multiple hearsay;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;whether any person involved had any motive to conceal or misrepresent matters;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;whether the original statement was an edited account, or was made in collaboration with another or for a particular purpose;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;whether the circumstances in which the evidence is adduced as hearsay are such as to suggest an attempt to prevent proper evaluation of its weight."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113. The submissions of counsel on behalf of the defendants and on behalf of Liberty have laid stress on the human rights of the defendants.  However the European Court has frequently affirmed the principle stated in <i>Sporrong and Lönnroth v Sweden</i> (1982)  5 EHRR 35, 52, para 69, that the search for the striking of a fair balance "between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual's fundamental rights" is inherent in the whole of the Convention.  In these cases which your Lordships have held are not criminal cases under the Convention and therefore do not attract the specific protection given by Article 6(3)(d) (though even in criminal cases the European Court has recognised that "principles of fair trial also require that in appropriate cases the interests of the defence are balanced against those of witnesses or victims called upon to testify":  see <i>Doorson v Netherlands</i> (1996)  22 EHRR 330, 358,  para 70), and having regard to the safeguards contained in section 4 of the 1995 Act, I consider that the striking of a fair balance between the demands of the general interest of the community (the community in this case being represented by weak and vulnerable people who claim that they are the victims of anti-social behaviour which violates their rights) and the requirements of the protection of the defendants' rights requires the scales to come down in favour of the protection of the community and of permitting the use of hearsay evidence in applications for anti-social behaviour orders.</p>
<i><p>The standard of proof</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114. I am in agreement with the opinions of my noble and learned friends Lord Steyn and Lord Hope of Craighead on this point and for the reasons which they give I would hold that in proceedings under section 1 of the 1998 Act the standard of proof that ought to be applied to allegations about the defendants' past behaviour is the criminal standard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115. For the reasons which I have given I would dismiss the appeals of the McCann defendants and would declare that the House had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal of the defendant Clingham.</p>

<p><b>LORD HOBHOUSE OF WOODBOROUGH</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116. For the reasons given by my noble and learned friends Lord Steyn and Lord Hope of Craighead and in agreement with the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Hutton, in particular what he has said in paragraph 113 of his opinion, I too would make the orders proposed.</p>

<p><b>LORD SCOTT OF FOSCOTE</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117. I agree that for the reasons given in the opinions of my noble and learned friends, Lord Steyn, Lord Hope of Craighead and Lord Hutton, the appeal in the <i>McCann</i> cases should be dismissed and in the <i>Clingham</i> case the House should make the order proposed by Lord Steyn. I, like my noble and learned friend Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough, am in full agreement with what Lord Hutton has said in paragraph 113 of his opinion.</p>
