<p align="right"><a href="banc-6.htm">(back to preceding text)</a></p>

<p class="para">150.&nbsp;&nbsp;The present case concerns the legitimacy of using the royal prerogative to introduce into a constitution for BIOT a provision that no Chagossian has a right of abode or a right to enter or be present in BIOT except as authorised under the constitution (which contains no presently relevant authorisation) or by any other law (the only other relevant law being the Immigration Ordinance, under which entry and presence depend on executive discretion).   It would be surprising if any precedent could be found for such a provision, and none has been shown. The operational words of section 9 of the BIOT Order 2004 (“no person has the right of abode”) were prefaced by the apologia that BIOT was “constituted and is set aside to be available for the defence purposes” of the two governments. That would be innocuous if BIOT had been without inhabitants or (to use a word much deployed at the time in government and civil service memoranda) “belongers” when BIOT was in 1965 constituted by its separation from other British territories. But the history of this sad case shows that, despite attempts to make the facts fit another picture, BIOT had a not inconsiderable number of such inhabitants, certainly hundreds, maybe approaching a thousand. Once BIOT was created with such inhabitants, they in Lord Mansfield’s words were by virtue of their connection with BIOT “under the King’s protection, …. subjects and are to be universally considered in that regard, not as enemies or aliens".</p>
<p class="para">151.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Crow submits nevertheless that the Crown’s subjects inhabiting BIOT had in public law no right of abode, and nothing of which they could therefore be deprived. It is common ground that this would not be the position in the United Kingdom. The right is fundamental and, in the informal sense in which that term is necessarily used in a United Kingdom context, constitutional. Chapter 29 of Magna Carta provides that “No freeman shall be …. exiled …. but by lawful judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land". Blackstone (<i>Commentaries on the Laws of England</i> Book I, p 136) states the position in these terms:</p>
<p class="para">“A natural and regular consequence of this personal liberty is, that every Englishman may claim a right to abide in his own country so long as he pleases; and not to be driven from it unless by the sentence of the law. The king indeed, by his royal prerogative, may issue out his writ <i>ne exeat regno</i>, and prohibit any of his subjects from going into foreign parts without licence. …. But no power on earth, except the authority of parliament, can send any subject <i>out of</i> the land against his will; no, not even a criminal. For exile, and transportation, are punishments at present unknown to the common law; ….”</p>
<p class="para">The power which Shakespeare records that Richard II, with the advice of his Council, exercised in banishing Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Hereford, and Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, (<i>King Richard II, Act I, Sc. III</i>) had by the time of  Blackstone long since disappeared. In the Divisional Court in <i>Bancoult I </i>Laws LJ cited international text-book and case-law authority to like effect to Blackstone: see also Chalmers’ <i>Opinions of Eminent Lawyers</i> (1814), vol 1, p 4 and Joseph Chitty, <i>A Treatise on The Law of the Prerogatives of the Crown </i>(1820) p 21. In <i>R v Bhagwan </i>[1972] AC 60, Lord Diplock identified the right of a British subject at common law “to enter the United Kingdom without let or hindrance when and where he pleased and to remain here as long as he listed” (p 74B-C), and of such subjects “to go wherever they like within the realm” (p 77G). In respect of persons who were British citizens by virtue of their connection with a part of the Commonwealth other than the United Kingdom, that right was from 1962 onwards made subject progressively to statutory qualifications: see <i>R v Bhagwan </i>and <i>R v Governor of Pentonville Prison, Ex p Azam </i>[1974] AC 18 (CA). Thus, from 1973 when the Immigration Act 1971 came into force, all Commonwealth citizens entering the United Kingdom without leave were liable to prosecution. But the common law right to enter and remain within the United Kingdom remains unchanged in respect of those with British citizenship based on their connection with the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="para">152.&nbsp;&nbsp;The common law position relating to aliens differs significantly. “One of the rights possessed by the supreme power in every State is the right to refuse to permit an alien to enter that State, to annex what conditions it pleases to the permission to enter it, and to expel or deport from the State, at pleasure, even a friendly alien, especially if it considers his presence in the State opposed to its peace, order, and good government, or to its social or material interests: Vattel, Law of Nations, book 1, s 231; book 2, s.125": <i>Attorney General for Canada v Cain </i>[1906] AC 542, 546; and see Chalmers’ <i>Opinions of Eminent Lawyers</i> (1814), vol 1, p 4 and <i>R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p Khawaja </i>[1984] 1 AC 74, 111F-G, where Lord Scarman proceeded on the basis that “an alien is liable to expulsion under the royal prerogative and a non-patrial has no right of abode". </p>
<p class="para">153.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Crow submits that the common law principles governing persons with a right of abode in England have no relevance to ceded territories like BIOT. In this submission, inhabitants of BIOT never had any right of abode, and certainly none which could survive or be the basis of any objection to section 9 of the BIOT Order 2004. In any event, he submits, the concept of an inhabitant of BIOT is too uncertain to receive legal recognition. As to the latter submission, there may be issues about who in and after 1965 was an inhabitant of the BIOT, as opposed to an inhabitant of, say, Mauritius or the Seychelles working as temporary labour in BIOT. However, it is clear enough that there were at the least hundreds of persons who could only properly be described as Chagossians, even though they may have had no property rights in BIOT as a matter of private law.  Above all, it is, as Sir Sydney submitted, clear that Mr Bancoult was a Chagossian by birth. And there was no difficulty in identifying the concept of a Chagossian for the purposes of the 2000 Ordinance (see section 4(3) quoted in para 140 above).</p>
<p class="para">154.&nbsp;&nbsp;As to Mr Crow’s former submission, the common law position must in my opinion be that every British citizen has a right to enter and remain in the constitutional unit to which his or her citizenship relates. That is the case with the United Kingdom. In relation to overseas territories acquired by the Crown, there exists in relation to private law a distinction between those acquired by settlement on the one hand and those acquired by conquest or cession on the other. In the case of the former, the settlers take with them English private law. In the case of the latter, the local private law remains in place, subject to potential but presently irrelevant qualifications, unless and until varied (as it was in the case of BIOT under the British Indian Ocean Territory Courts Ordinance 1983 which provided for English law to apply in BIOT so far as applicable and suitable and subject to any necessary modifications, adaptations, qualifications and exceptions as local circumstances rendered necessary). </p>
<p class="para">155.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, no such distinction exists as regards public law, or in particular as regards constitutional questions including the nature and extent of the Crown’s prerogative. Even where the Crown acquires overseas dominions by conquest or cession, the relationship between the Crown and its subjects becomes subject to the like public law principles to those applicable in the United Kingdom: see <i>Sammut v Strickland </i>[1938] AC 678, 697, <i>Madzimbamuto v Lardner-Burke </i>[1969] 1 AC 645, 721C-F, <i>Kodeeswaran v Attorney General of Ceylon </i>[1970] AC 1111, 1118A-D (referring to <i>Ruding v Smith</i> (1821) 2 Hag Con 371, 382, a case concerning the validity of a marriage in the English form in the Cape Colony after its conquest from the Dutch in 1795, where Lord Stowell said that “Even with respect to the ancient inhabitants, no small portion of the ancient law is unavoidably superseded, by the revolution of government that has taken place. The allegiance of the subjects, and all the law that relates to it - …. and all the laws connected with the exercise of the sovereign authority - must undergo alterations adapted to the change”), <i>Burmah Oil Co (Burma Trading) Ltd v Lord Advocate </i>[1965] AC 75 and Halsbury’s Laws of England (4th ed) (2003 reissue), vol 6,  Title: Commonwealth, p 515, para 878. The inhabitants of BIOT came in Lord Mansfield’s words under the protection of the Crown, became subjects and were to be universally considered in that regard, not as enemies or aliens. They acquired as against the Crown the like constitutional right of abode and the like immunity from exile as the common law confers on citizens of the United Kingdom: see para 151 above. After 1965, the only constitutional unit to which Mr Bancoult’s and other Chagossians’ citizenship and right of abode related was BIOT. As Mr J H Lambert pointed out in a confidential memorandum on the Status of the inhabitants of BIOT dated 4 September 1968 (disclosed by the government in these proceedings), if such Chagossians applied for a UK passport, “presumably the Colonial endorsement could only reveal that they belonged to BIOT since there was no other British colony to which they could belong". Mr Crow’s submission that Chagossians had no common law right of abode in BIOT comes close to treating them as if they were aliens, and is one that I would reject.</p>
<p class="para">156.&nbsp;&nbsp;That does not resolve this appeal, because of Mr Crow’s further and principal submission that any common law right of abode in BIOT that Chagossians may have had could always be and was overridden and removed by Her Majesty in Council. This, Mr Crow submits, is what section 9 of the BIOT Order 2004 on any view achieves. Within the United Kingdom, such a result could only be achieved by Parliament, whereas in territories such as BIOT it is submitted that the royal prerogative reigns unlimited in scope, subject only (Mr Crow’s contrary submission being already rejected) to judicial review. </p>
<p class="para">157.&nbsp;&nbsp;This submission treats BIOT and the prerogative power to make constitutional or other laws relating to BIOT as if they related to nothing more than the bare land, and as if the people inhabiting BIOT were an insignificant inconvenience (a phrase which reflects the flavour of some of the government’s internal memoranda in the 1960s), liable to be dispossessed at will for any reason that might seem good to the executive in the interests of the United Kingdom. Sir Sydney accepts that in administering BIOT the Crown in Council was entitled to have regard to the interests of the United Kingdom and its territories generally, and was not confined to consideration of the benefits to BIOT alone. He also accepts that the United Kingdom could, in the defence interests of itself and its ally, require Chagossians resident in one part of the territory (Diego Garcia) to move to another part, and that there might be extreme circumstances of necessity (eg where a whole territory became unsafe for inhabitation, due to volcanic eruption or imminent threat of inundation) where the United Kingdom could by order in council require its evacuation. But enacting a constitution for a conquered or ceded colony which has the aim of depopulating the whole of a habitable territory in the interests of the United Kingdom or its allies is another matter. A colony, whether conquered, ceded or settled, consists, first and foremost, of people living in a territory, with links to a parent state. The Crown’s “constituent” power to introduce a constitution for a ceded territory is a power intended to enable the proper governance of the territory, at least among other things for the benefit of the people inhabiting it. A constitution which exiles a territory’s inhabitants is a contradiction in terms. The absence of any precedent for the exercise of the royal prerogative to exclude the inhabitants of a colony from the colony is significant, although to my mind entirely unsurprising. Until the present case, no-one can have conceived of its exercise for such a purpose. Territories, such as Gibraltar or Malta, have been conquered or ceded with military purposes in mind, but never, so far as appears, has there been either an original purpose or a subsequent attempt compulsorily to exclude their natural inhabitants.  It may not have been necessary in the present case to use force to empty BIOT, but the logic of the government’s position is that this too would have been permissible.</p>
<p class="para">158.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only two cases which offer any support to Mr Crow’s position in this connection are <i>Co-operative Committee on Japanese Canadians v Attorney General for Canada </i>[1947] AC 87, where a Dominion statute was interpreted as authorising removal from Canada not merely of persons of Japanese origin who requested repatriation, but also of their wives and children under 16 who resisted their own removal, and <i>Zabrovsky v General Officer Commanding Palestine </i>[1947] AC 246, where the Privy Council in dicta endorsed the decisions of Palestinian courts below which had accepted the legality of a deportation order, made in respect of a Palestinian citizen under an Order in Council and Emergency Regulations, as not being ultra vires a limited territorial power like Palestine, citing the cases of <i>Attorney General for Canada v Cain </i>and the<i> Co-operative Committee on Japanese Canadians</i> case. No close examination appears to have been undertaken in the former case of the scope of the power of the Dominion legislature or in the latter case of the power which could be or was conferred by the Order in Council. Both cases were concerned with emergency situations and in the latter the Board relied upon <i>Liversidge v Anderson </i>[1942] AC 206 as support for an extended and more “permissive” interference with personal liberty in “the troublous times of war". As both courts below have noted, that precedent is not a happy one, and I for my part think that <i>Co-operative Committee on Japanese Canadians</i> and<i> Zabrovsky </i>must be regarded as of no real assistance on the fundamental point which now arises. </p>
<p class="para">159.&nbsp;&nbsp;Had the present issue arisen two hundred and twenty-five years ago when Lord Mansfield was developing and examining the principles governing overseas colonies, the reasoning in <i>Campbell v Hall </i>leaves no real doubt about his answer. I do not believe that the common law has over the last two hundred years taken in this respect a more amenable line towards the exercise of executive power over the removal or exiling of a whole population. To treat an executive decision of this nature as non-justiciable is, in my view, even less easy to justify today when, I understand, all your Lordships agree that the reasonableness of such a decision is reviewable on grounds of, inter alia, rationality: see paras 141 above and 162 et seq below. No doubt it is true, and I accept, that Parliament could by statute achieve the result at which the BIOT Order 2004 aimed. But that is not, as Mr Crow urged in his written case and oral submissions, a reason for holding that the Queen in Council can or must “logically” be able to do the same. On the contrary, as Waller LJ rightly observed in the Court of Appeal (para 106), there are fundamental differences between legislation enacted by the executive through Her Majesty in Council and legislation subject to democratic debate in Parliament. In the present case, the process adopted affected basic common law rights without any form of consultation whatever with the Chagossians affected. The only justification advanced for this by Mr Rammell, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, in the Parliamentary debate on 7 July 2004 was that “There is no settled population within BIOT and that is why we have to make decisions that we have to make". But section 9 affected the rights to enter BIOT of a category of persons defined by the 2000 Ordinance, with a number of known representatives. Not only was there no opportunity for democratic debate outside or within Parliament, but the process of Parliamentary scrutiny of orders in council by the Foreign Affairs Committee could be and was overridden by the executive, with the result that the Committee only learned of the BIOT Order 2004 after it was made. (The Secretary of State’s evidence is that this usual process was supplemented in mid-2002 by specific Committee request to see any draft orders effecting constitutional changes in overseas territories, a request in which the Foreign Secretary said in reply that he saw “merit". The explanation given after 10 June 2004 for the scrutiny override was that complete confidentiality needed to be preserved if “the risk of an attempt by the Chagossians to circumvent the Orders before they came into force” was to be avoided.)</p>
<p class="para">160.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, the royal prerogative to legislate in relation to BIOT did not extend to enacting legislation aimed at depriving BIOT of its inhabitants’ right to enter and be present there, if they wished, and so reducing BIOT to mere territory (apart from the military use of Diego Garcia reserved to the United States). There is no legal obligation to facilitate this entry or presence. Still less is there any to fund resettlement: that has been established by the dismissal of the claims in <i>Chagos Islanders v Attorney General</i> by Ouseley J in October 2003 and the Court of Appeal’s refusal of permission to appeal against that dismissal in July 2004, and Mr Bancoult through Sir Sydney Kentridge QC accepts and is entitled to rely on this, without agreeing to forego such moral pressure as it may be possible to bring to bear to obtain voluntary support. The Crown having, it is understood, acquired by purchase all the land on the Chagos Islands may also have private law rights and remedies which would enable it to prevent any private initiative to settle there. But the present proceedings are concerned with the public law rights of the Chagossian inhabitants.</p>
<p class="para">161.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reasons I have given, it would not as a matter of public law have been permissible for the Crown to legislate by order in council to introduce a provision such as section 9 of the BIOT Order during the period 1965 to 1973 while Chagossians continued to live in BIOT. Chagossians who were British citizens by virtue of their connection with BIOT in the period 1965 onwards retain any right of abode that they had during that period, although many now appear also to have British citizenship with the right to come to the United Kingdom under sections 2 and 6 of the British Overseas Territories Act 2002. It has not been suggested that this (as opposed to the BIOT Order 2004) deprives them of any right of abode they may have in respect of BIOT, although it has been submitted that the force of their connection with BIOT diminishes with time. The present issue is however concerned with <i>vires</i>, and, if section 9 could not have been enacted by order in council during the period 1965 to 1973, it remained in my opinion outside the legitimate scope of the exercise of the legislative prerogative in 2004. That, I reiterate, would not prevent the Crown legislating by United Kingdom statute in any terms which proved acceptable to Parliament, a process which would involve open debate.</p>
<i><p class="para">Judicial review</p></i>
<p class="para">162.&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn to the position on the hypothesis that the conclusion expressed in the previous paragraphs is not accepted. On that basis, there was no absolute fetter to prevent the Crown in Council from exiling the Chagossian inhabitants of the Chagos Islands, either in 1971 or in 2004. However, in the courts below, the Crown’s decision to do so has been held void on judicial review grounds. In the Divisional Court these were expressed in terms of irrationality. In the Court of Appeal, all three members of the Court reached the same conclusion on the grounds of a legitimate expectation generated by Mr Cook’s 3 November 2000 press release accompanied by the 2000 Ordinance. Sedley LJ (paras 68-71) and Sir Anthony Clarke MR (para 123) also based their decision on the separate ground of irrationality.</p>
<p class="para">163.&nbsp;&nbsp;I start with the United Kingdom government’s reasons given for introducing the BIOT Order of 10 June 2004. Unusually, for any form of legislation, section 9 contains in its text the explanation, to which I have already referred, for the provision that no person has the right of abode in BIOT: BIOT was, it says, “constituted and is set aside to be available for the defence purposes” of the United Kingdom and United States. Mr Crow rightly submits that this explanation involves an area which courts themselves should be cautious about entering. The executive is <i>par excellence </i>better placed to judge the imperatives of the defence interests of this country and its ally. However, the present case presents striking and unusual features. The only letters produced by the appellant dealing with the position in relation to Chagos Islands other than Diego Garcia come from United States sources, in each case after the commencement of the proceedings in which they were produced, although similar sentiments in relation to landings on the outer Chagos Islands are said to have been repeated from time to time informally. The letters are dated 21 June 2000, 16 November 2004 and 18 January 2006. </p>
<p class="para">164.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first, the author, Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs, described the central defence role played by Diego Garcia and the advantages of its strategic location and isolation, and then argued that “the settlement of a permanent civilian population on the islands of the Chagos archipelago, even those at some distance from Diego Garcia, would seriously diminish that isolation and as a consequence erode the island’s nearly unparalleled strategic importance". He referred to the “alarming prospect of the introduction of surveillance, monitoring and jamming devices that have the potential to disrupt, compromise or place at risk vital military operations", arguing that in Western Europe or the United States, efforts to introduce surveillance, monitoring and jamming devices carry a considerable risk of discovery “if only because of the large number of people in the surrounding area", whereas “the return of small and scattered populations onto islands of the archipelago would make introduction and use of such devices possible with much less risk of discovery because this would occur in an isolated and undeveloped area", with the “Peros Banhos and Salomon atolls … located only about 140 miles north of Diego Garcia". He referred to the introduction of settlements on the outlying islands as putting “Diego Garcia more easily within potential reach of hostile states or terrorists operating by boat", to difficulty and a risk of diversion of resources involved in ensuring the safety of any resident population in the event of an attack on the Chagos Islands, to the inability of Diego Garcia to serve as a back-up airport “in the unlikely event that an international airport were built on one of the outer islands to support limited touristic activities” and to the absence of other sources of back-up supplies and services for the nearby civilian population as “one of the most telling factors distinguishing the situation of the military facility on Diego Garcia from US bases in the United Kingdom". Finally, he observed that the United States might in “currently unforeseeable circumstances” one day require use of the outer Chagos Islands for defence purposes, something to which it would in that event be entitled under the inter-governmental agreement between the United Kingdom and the United States. </p>
<p class="para">165.&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter of 16 November 2004 was written five months after the making of the BIOT Order 2004 and three months after the commencement of these proceedings. It referred to discussions “over the past several months” and said that, post 11 September 2001, the considerations explained in the letter of 21 June 2000 “have become even more cogent", that “an attempt to resettle any of the islands of the Chagos Archipelago would severely compromise Diego Garcia’s unparalleled security and have a deleterious impact on our military operations” and that “we appreciate the steps taken by Her Majesty’s Government to prevent such resettlement". The letter of 18 January 2006, written at the request of representatives of the United Kingdom government and no doubt again intended for use in this litigation, was in similar but more extended vein. Noting that “it has been argued that vessels routinely pass within close proximity of Diego Garcia” (ie on the high seas, outside it appears a three mile territorial limit), and that “the low density and irregularity of such vessel transits afford military operators the opportunity to identify and closely monitor their movement and activity", it went on to say that the same level of tracking and surveillance “would not be possible if the volume or density of the vessels indiscriminately transiting in the vicinity of Diego Garcia or the outer islands on a routine basis increased due to repopulation of the islands", and that the United States was moreover seriously concerned that repopulating the outer islands “would provide terrorists the cover and concealment to establish permanent operating bases from which they could monitor island operations with minimum risk of counter detection". </p>
<p class="para">166.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all the points made in these letters (particularly the primary letter of 21 June 2000) are easy to follow, and some of them raise on their face more questions than they resolve. The letters appear all to have been addressed to the possibility of permanent and extensive re-settlement of the outer islands, an unlikely future event in June 2000 or 2004 or 2006. In any event, it is clear that the United Kingdom government in 2000 either did not share the United States’ assessment or did not consider that it bore on or precluded the grant to the Chagossians of a right to enter and be present in the outer islands. This is clear from the terms of Mr Robin Cook’s press statement and the BIOT Ordinance issued on 3 November 2000 after the decision in <i>Bancoult 1</i>. The United States authorities themselves also appear to have recognised a reality in somewhat different terms to that indicated in their letter of 21 June 2000, in view of the affirmative answer given (subject to correction, but none occurred) by Mr John Battle, Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, on 9 January 2001 to the Parliamentary question: “has the US agreed that the islanders may return to any of the outlying islands? The letter of 21 June stated that that could imperil the base’s status. Has that now changed?” (193WH).</p>
