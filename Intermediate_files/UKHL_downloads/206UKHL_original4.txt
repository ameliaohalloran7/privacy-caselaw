<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether or not that is, however, accepted, no English authority indicates and I do not consider that the Society's present cause of action should be regarded as accruing before any change in its legal position occurred and it received any claim on the Fund. First and foremost, the Society's legal position remained unchanged, even in public law, at least until after it received a claim. Second, it was not possible until after a claim was received for anyone to know which client(s) of Payne &amp; Co might suffer what loss, whether any of them might be able, and choose, to assert that they had as a result suffered hardship justifying a grant out of the Fund and what the circumstances were in which the Society would have to exercise its discretion to make or refuse a grant. Third, in this situation, it is not appropriate to talk of the Fund or any other specific asset of the Society as having suffered any loss at least until after a hardship claim was made on the Society.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77.&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be that, if the facts had been known contemporaneously, some statistical or experience-based assessment could have been made of the likelihood of a claim or claims emerging, and of the Fund having eventually to make payments, as a result of Mr Payne being able to continue his scheme of fraud. A similar assessment might be made of the risk of future loss of a physical asset (deeds or valuables) of which a solicitor was failing to take reasonable care, but which had not yet been lost or stolen. But I do not consider that the law should treat purely contingent loss assessed on so remote a basis as sufficiently measurable, in the absence of any change in the claimant's legal position and of any diminution in value of any particular asset. Even where negligence brings about a specific transaction and thus a change in the claimant's legal position, Lord Nicholls observed in <i>Nykredit </i>[1997] 1 WLR 1627 in the passage at p.1631C-D cited in paragraph 73 above, that the mere entry into the transaction under which "Financial loss is possible, but not certain" is not sufficient detriment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78.&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the matter more generally, I also see no particular reason to accelerate the accrual of a cause of action where there has been no transaction changing the claimant's legal position and no diminution in value of any particular asset. Where such factors are present the English authorities considered in paragraphs 67-70 above take a clear-cut, though perhaps strict, view. The House has not been asked to review such authorities, nor would I think it appropriate to do so in the light of the way that they and the English legislation have developed. But where such factors are not present, I see attraction in the approach taken by the Australian High Court in <i>Wardley</i> 175 CLR 514, the effect of which is that unless and until a remote contingency eventuates the claimant is not expected to issue proceedings which he would not normally issue or wish to issue unless and until that point arrives.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sephtons point out that in <i>Nykredit </i>[1997] 1 WLR 1627, 1630 Lord Nicholls endorsed the Court of Appeal's approval in <i>Forster v. Outred &amp; Co. </i>of counsel's submission that actual damage meant "any detriment, liability or loss capable of assessment in money terms". There can, as I have said, be situations of measurable monetary detriment or loss, even though there has been no change in a person's legal position. But the passage which I have quoted from p.1631C-D in <i>Nykredit </i>shows that Lord Nicholls was far from accepting that everything that can loosely be described as "detriment" will constitute damage for the purposes of a tort claim. Lord Nicholls' words are not in any event to be read as a statute.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sephtons also rely on Lord Nicholls' statement at p.1633C-D that "within the bounds of sense and reasonableness the policy of the law should be to advance, rather than retard, the accrual of a cause of action" and that </p>

<p></p><ul>"This is especially so if the law provides parallel causes of action in contract and in tort in respect of the same conduct. The disparity between the time when these parallel causes of action arise should be smaller, rather than greater". <p></p></ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Differences between the limitation periods in contract and tort do however exist. These were indeed a central part of the argument mounted unsuccessfully in <i>Henderson v. Merrett Syndicates Ltd.  </i>[1995] 2 AC 145 to the effect that concurrent causes of action in contract and tort should not be recognised at all (cf pp. 151H-152B and 162G-163D). In his speech (with whom all other members of the House agreed) Lord Goff of Chieveley rejected what he described as "the temptation of elegance" (p.186B). He said that</p>

<p></p><ul>"The result may be untidy; but, given that the tortious duty is imposed by the general law, and the contractual duty is attributable to the will of the parties, I do not find it objectionable that the claimant may be entitled to take advantage of the remedy which is most advantageous to him …" (cf p.194A-E).<p></p></ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, there is no question of the Society having any concurrent remedy in contract, and, even if there had been, there are limits to the extent to which the accrual of causes of action in contract and tort can be assimilated. No issue regarding relevant and measurable damage can arise in contract, since nominal damages can be awarded for any breach. Even in <i>Nykredit </i>[1997] 1 WLR 1627 any contractual claim accrued at a different time to any tortious claim. Here, the requirement of relevant and measurable damage before the accrual of a tortious claim has to be interpreted in the context of purely contingent liability occurring without any immediate change in the claimant's legal position, and I see no reason to add to the strictness of the English legal position by treating the claimant as having suffered measurable loss before the contingency materialised.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sephtons rely on the further Court of Appeal authority of <i>Gordon v. J. B. Wheatley &amp; Co. </i>[2000] Lloyd's Rep PN 605. There, due to the defendant solicitors' alleged negligence, the claimant was led to carry on, through various companies, business operations in a manner which amounted to the carrying on by such companies of unauthorised investment business within the Financial Services Act 1986, section 3. Under section 6 of that Act the court had power to order any person contravening section 3 "and any other person who appears to the court to have been knowingly concerned in the contravention to take such steps as the court may direct for restoring the parties to the position in which they were before the transaction was entered into". In due course the Securities and Investments Board ("SIB") investigated the claimant's operations and alleged a breach of section 3. The claimant approached fresh solicitors and on their advice resolved the matter by agreeing to indemnify the companies for over £676,000. He sued the defendant solicitors within six years of doing this, but more than six years after the entry into of the unauthorised investment transactions (and also more than six years after he approached the fresh solicitors and incurred their fees). Kennedy LJ, with whom Kay LJ agreed, held that actual loss was incurred once the unauthorised investments were made, since "the plaintiff was exposed to the risk of being required by a court … to restore the parties (i.e. investors and borrowers) to the position in which they were before the transactions were entered into" (p.612). This was, he went on "a liability, albeit a contingent liability, a fetter on his assets".</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view this reasoning is open to the objection that there was no liability, no change in the claimant's legal position, unless and until the SIB intervened and the court ordered or the claimant agreed. Further, unlike the position in for example <i>D W Moore &amp; Co. Ltd. v. Ferrier </i>[1988] 1 WLR 267 or <i>Knapp v. Ecclesiatical Insurance Group plc </i>[1998] PNLR 172, the risk to which the claimant was exposed did not directly arise from or affect the transaction into which the defendant negligently allowed the claimant to cause his companies to enter. Rather it arose from the collateral regulatory powers and intervention of third parties, the SIB and the court, under independent legislation. I do not think that the analysis applied in <i>Knapp </i>to a voidable contract between two parties can stretch to cover this situation. In my view, therefore, this aspect of the Court of Appeal's decision is unsustainable. The actual outcome in the case may have been justified by the Court's further conclusion (about which I need express no view) that actual loss was incurred when the fresh solicitors were instructed and liability for their fees was incurred.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the above reasons, as well as those given in the opinions of Lord Hoffmann and Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe, I would conclude that a cause of action in tort did not accrue in the Law Society's favour against Sephtons until it first received a claim on its Fund from one of Payne &amp; Co's clients.  This is sufficient to lead to the dismissal of this appeal. Although it is not material on the facts, I would not, as at present advised, accept the Society's argument that such accrual was further postponed until whenever the Society resolved to meet a claim. It appears to me more realistic to identify the fulfilment of the contingency on which the Society's liability depended with the time when it received a claim in relation to which it became bound to exercise its statutory discretion to make a payment in accordance with its public law duties.</p>
