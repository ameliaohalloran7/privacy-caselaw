<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91. As I have already explained, the Court of Appeal by a majority (Evans and Ward LJJ, Aldous LJ dissenting) held that Mr Forster had undertaken responsibility for advising Aneco, not only with regard to the availability of reinsurance, but with regard to the market's assessment of the risks inherent in the Bullen treaty. Evans LJ held, at p 156, para 82 of his judgment, that the fact that no reinsurance cover was available in the market introduced an additional breach of duty by the appellants.  They were liable not only for failing to obtain effective cover on the terms which they reported to Aneco, but also for failing to report that no cover could be obtained. He said that this meant that the <i>SAAMCO</i> principle (compensating the plaintiff only for the consequences of the defendant's advice being wrong) failed to provide proper compensation in the present case. He held, at p 156, para 83 that:</p>
<p>"Aneco is . . . reasonably entitled to compensation for [the appellants'] failure to report correctly the current market assessment of the reinsurance risks which Aneco was proposing to undertake" (ie. the Bullen treaty). "Those risks were central to Aneco's decision and Mr Forster took it upon himself to advise Mr Crawley with regard to them".</p>
And, at p 156, para 84, that:
<p></p><ul>"Aneco is entitled to recover damages for the whole of the losses which it suffered in consequence of entering into the Bullen treaty, acting on [the appellants'] advice with regard to the availability of reinsurance (retrocession) <i>and therefore</i> on the current market assessment of the risk" (emphasis added).<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92. It is sufficient for the moment to observe that there is no "therefore". The conclusion in para 84 follows if, but only if, the premise in paras 82 and 83 is correct. If it is then the conclusion  of the Court of Appeal is an application of the <i>SAAMCO</i> principle and not (as Evans LJ thought) an exception to it. Aneco is entitled to recover damages for the full amount of the loss which is attributable to the appellants' breach of duty. The greater the scope of their duty, the greater the scope for the attribution of loss to the breach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93. Ward LJ agreed with Evans LJ but added some further reasons of his own. He, too, relied on the fact that reinsurance was not available at all, or at least on terms acceptable to Aneco, and that, in order to discharge their duty, the appellants should have told Aneco that the market would not cover the risk. This, of course, is not disputed. But more problematically he continued, at pp 164-165:</p>
<p></p><ul>"They knew that the availability of satisfactory reinsurance was a precondition to Aneco entering into the Bullen treaty. They accepted the responsibility of there being no contract without cover. <i>In my judgment that imposed upon the brokers a duty of care to Aneco in respect of their entering into the transaction</i>" <i>[ie the Bullen treaty] "as such</i>. Their duty was to protect Aneco from the very risk they knew Aneco would not accept if no satisfactory reinsurance was available." (emphasis added)<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This passage is open to a number of criticisms, but it is sufficient for the moment to observe that the words in italics are impossible to reconcile with the <i>SAAMCO</i> principle.</p>
<i><p>Argument in the House</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94. In the course of argument before your Lordships counsel for Aneco made two significant but inevitable concessions. First, he accepted that Mr Crawley did not seek to use the market's reaction to the reinsurance layers as "a barometer" of the risks inherent in the Bullen treaty. Secondly, he accepted that even if Mr Forster had discovered that underwriters were almost universally hostile to the Bullen treaty - they "wouldn't touch it with a barge pole" - but had nevertheless been able, albeit with great difficulty, to place the required layers of reinsurance with good and sufficient counterparties and on a fair presentation of the risk, Aneco would have had no complaint. Counsel frankly acknowledged that Mr Forster was under no obligation to report anything beyond the bare fact that the desired reinsurance was available and had been obtained (or not as the case might be).  He did not suggest that Mr Forster undertook any responsibility for advising Aneco what course of action to take in relation to the Bullen treaty.</p>
<i><p>The scope of Mr Forster's duty: the question of fact</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95. In my opinion these concessions are entirely inconsistent with paragraphs 83 and 84 of Evans LJ's judgment. But they were correctly made. Mr Forster was not bound <i>as a matter of legal obligation</i> to report the unfavourable comments of those underwriters who had declined the risk or their reasons for doing so or to warn Mr Crawley that market sentiment was adverse and that he should reconsider his decision to enter into the Bullen treaty.  No such duty was pleaded or made out on the evidence.  The appellants did not complain of the breach of any such duty and no such complaint was put to Mr Forster. If it were the ordinary duty of a broker instructed to obtain reinsurance cover in the market, one would have expected Mr Crawley to have asked to see     Mr Forster's marketing sheets and Mr Forster to have provided them unasked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96. Mr Forster was instructed to obtain reinsurance for Aneco.  He had to test the market to find out if it was available and at what rates it could be obtained.  He undertook these duties as Aneco's broker, but he undertook them in relation to the reinsurance, not in relation to the Bullen treaty.  He had no responsibility for advising or reporting with regard to Mr Crawley's conditional decision to enter into the Bullen treaty.  He was a broker, not an underwriter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97. By reporting that he had obtained reinsurance Mr Foster implicitly represented that reinsurance was available.  He could not avoid doing so.  But this did not involve any representation that market sentiment was favourable. No such representation was pleaded or put to Mr Forster.  Had Mr Forster reported that reinsurance was not available Mr Crawley would not have entered into the Bullen treaty. But as his own evidence demonstrates, this would not have been because of market sentiment: he would have been disappointed at his inability to do what he conceived to be good business. It would not have mattered to him why reinsurance was unavailable: it would have been enough that reinsurance was not available for whatever reason. That is why the issue cannot be tested by asking whether Mr Crawley would have entered into the Bullen treaty if reinsurance had not been available. It is necessary to consider whether Mr Foster was under a legal obligation to report adverse market sentiment even if he had been able to obtain the desired reinsurance; and what (if any) loss is attributable to the breach of that particular duty. Unless Mr Crawley was intent on using the market as a barometer of the merits of the Bullen treaty, which has been expressly disclaimed, it would seem that no loss is attributable to this particular breach, for Mr Crawley would still have gone ahead despite his knowledge of the market's attitude provided only that effective reinsurance had been obtained.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98. As I have already mentioned, Evans LJ held, at p 156, para 82 of his judgment that the appellants are liable not only for failing to obtain effective reinsurance, but also for failing to report that no cover could be obtained. Thus far I agree with him. It is at the next step that I respectfully part company from him. He held, para. 83, that the appellants are liable for their failure to report correctly the current market assessment of "the reinsurance risks which Aneco was proposing to undertake", ie. the risks inherent in the Bullen treaty. As Evans LJ rightly observed, those risks were central to Aneco's decision to participate in the Bullen treaty; but it does not follow that (as he found) "Mr Forster took it upon himself to advise Mr Crawley with regard to them". There is simply no basis, in the pleadings or the evidence, for finding that the appellants undertook any such duty, and it is inconsistent with the concessions made by Aneco's counsel in argument before your Lordships.  No such duty would have arisen merely from the fact that, as the appellants knew, Aneco's decision to participate in the Bullen treaty was conditional on obtaining reinsurance (and therefore on the reinsurance being available). It makes no difference to the scope of the appellants' duty whether reinsurance was available or not. They were bound to report correctly whether reinsurance was available and had been obtained or not.  Beyond this they were not bound to report the market's response to the risk. It was enough for     Mr Crawley that the reinsurance had been obtained (or not). He did not ask to be informed, and was not concerned to know, how easy or difficult it was to obtain it.  As para 84 of his judgment demonstrates, Evans LJ thought that a duty to advise on the current market assessment of the Bullen treaty followed automatically from a duty to advise in regard to the availability of reinsurance.  But it does not.  The two duties are quite distinct and are capable of generating different mechanisms of loss.  An express representation that reinsurance has been obtained necessarily involves an implicit representation that it is available.  But the only reason Mr Crawley wanted to know in advance that reinsurance was available was that it would be a waste of time to proceed any further if it was not; and his only interest later was to know that it had been obtained, and therefore implicitly that it was available.  Breach of the duty to report in advance that reinsurance was available  was not in itself causative of any additional loss beyond, perhaps, some trivial expenses. Breach of the representation that reinsurance was available which was implicit in the representation that it had been obtained was incapable in itself of generating any additional loss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99. I have already described Ward LJ's reasoning, at pp 164-165, as inconsistent with the <i>SAAMCO</i> principle.  The appellants did accept the responsibility of "there being no contract without cover" as he stated. The "but for" test is satisfied, as it was in <i>SAAMC</i>O. It simply does not follow that the appellants assumed responsibility for Aneco entering into "the transaction as such." Nor does it follow that their duty was "to protect Aneco from the very risk they knew Aneco would not accept if no satisfactory reinsurance was not available." What follows in my opinion is that they assumed a duty to protect Aneco from loss on the transaction to the <i>extent that Aneco wished to reinsure it and relied on them to do so.</i></p><i>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100. In my opinion, the appellants did not assume responsibility for advising on the market's assessment of the risks inherent in the Bullen treaty. They were not asked to give such advice and did not do so. No such duty was pleaded or proved. The appellants' only duty was to take reasonable care to ensure that the information which they did supply, viz. that the desired reinsurance was available and that they had obtained it, was correct; and they are responsible for all the foreseeable consequences of that information being wrong.</p>
<i>
<p>The measure of damages: the question of law</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101. The proper measure of damages must reflect the fact that the appellants are not liable for the foreseeable consequences of Aneco's entering into the Bullen treaty, but only the consequences of Aneco's having done so on a false basis, that is to say, on the basis that it had effective reinsurance cover.  It is not liable for the consequences which would have occurred even if the appellants' advice (that reinsurance was available and had been obtained) had been correct.  They are not liable for these because they are the consequences of risks Aneco would have taken if the appellants' advice had been sound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102. As I have already observed, by reporting that they had obtained the desired reinsurance as instructed, the appellants implicitly represented that such reinsurance was available. Is the proper measure of damages aggravated by the fact that such reinsurance was not in fact available?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103. In examining this question it is convenient to take first the common case where the principal has already written the underlying risks before he instructs the broker to obtain reinsurance. If such reinsurance is available in the market and the broker reports that he has obtained it when he has not, his liability is limited to the value of the lost cover. So much is clear. Where such reinsurance is not available, however, the broker is not liable for the loss of cover which no amount of care and skill could have obtained. His negligence will have caused no loss beyond some trivial expenses. Failure to obtain the unobtainable is not in itself causative of loss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104. But where, as in the present case, the principal has not yet written the underlying risk and is not prepared to write it without the reinsurance, and the broker knows this, the position is different.  Once the principal has acted to his potential detriment by writing the underlying risk in reliance on the broker's statement that cover has been obtained (and implicitly is available), the broker cannot reduce or avoid his liability by leading evidence that, contrary to what he told his principal, cover was not in fact available. So his liability is not less than it would have been if reinsurance had been available. But why should it be more?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105. Since a representation that cover has been obtained necessarily implies that it is available, it would be surprising if the measure of damages were greater where cover is not available than where it is. The absence of available cover in itself generates no additional loss beyond that due to the fact that it has not been obtained. What is the mechanism which caused Aneco to suffer an additional $24m of loss which it would not have suffered if the reinsurance had been available in the market?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106. Aneco argues as follows.  If the appellants had performed their duty, they would have discovered that the reinsurance was not available and would have been bound to report the fact to Aneco.  If Mr Crawley had asked why not, the appellants would have reported the market's assessment of the risks inherent in the Bullen treaty.  So, it is said, the distinction between the availability of reinsurance and the market's assessment of the Bullen treaty is artificial; they go hand in hand; and should generate the same measure of damages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107. I cannot accept this for several reasons, not least because it is inconsistent with Lord Hoffmann's rejection of Nyekredit's argument in <i>SAAMCO</i> [1997] AC 191, 223 to which I have already referred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108. In the first place, the reasoning is speculative and implausible. Why should Mr Crawley ask why cover was unobtainable? It was enough for him that it was unobtainable; he was not concerned to know why.  Without it he would not go ahead with the Bullen treaty anyway. But this is a minor quibble.  The essential point is that Aneco entered into the Bullen treaty because it was led to believe that the reinsurance had been obtained. It would have done the same whatever the true state of affairs and irrespective of the availability of reinsurance in the market. If the reinsurance was not obtained in fact, Aneco would have suffered the same loss whether or not it was available. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109. In the second place, it does not matter what the appellants would have done as a matter of fact; what matters is what they were bound to do as a matter of legal obligation. This is because their liability is measured by the scope of their <i>duty</i>. It is not measured by what would have happened if they had acted in a way in which they were not bound to act. The distinction between liability for the consequences of information they were bound to provide and liability for the consequences of information they would probably have volunteered is not an artificial one. It lies at the heart of an inquiry into the scope of a defendant's liability for the consequences of his actions. Aneco must show, not that Mr Foster would probably have reported the market's reactions in fact, but that he was legally bound to do so, and for the reasons I have given this it cannot do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110. In the third place, this is not the purpose for which Aneco wanted to know that cover was available.  Nyekredit argued that, if it had been provided with the information it had asked for, it would have realised that the project was not viable. That was a stronger case than the present, for the valuers were asked to provide the information in question.  Nyekredit's claim failed because the information was provided for a different purpose (assessing the sufficiency of the security and not the viability of the project.)  In the present case, the appellants were not asked for the market's assessment of risk; and their advice as to the availability of reinsurance was provided for a different purpose, viz. to satisfy Mr Crawley that the condition on which alone Aneco would participate in the Bullen treaty could be satisfied, and not to enable him to judge the merits of the Bullen treaty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111. Finally, Aneco's argument, like that of Nyekredit, employs an illegitimate mechanism of loss and yields the wrong measure of damages. The court does not engage in speculating on what would have happened if the defendant had performed his duty.  That is not the basis of his liability.  The court asks only what loss is attributable to his failure to perform his duty. He is liable for all the consequences of his advice being wrong; he is not liable for the consequences which would have occurred even if the facts had been as he represented them to be. The appellants are not liable for the $24m loss which would still have occurred if the reinsurance had been available as they said it was and had been obtained as they said it had. </p>
