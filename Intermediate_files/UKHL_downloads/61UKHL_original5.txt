<p class="para">83.&nbsp;&nbsp;As to procedure, the Fourth Section expressed their understanding  in paragraphs 52 and 55.  They said this -</p>
<p class="paraleft">“52. … under domestic law … in summary proceedings such as those brought against the applicant, it was not open to the county court to consider any issue concerning the proportionality of the possession order, save in exceptional cases where, as the Court of Appeal put in the present case, ‘something has happened since the service of the notice to quit, which has fundamentally altered the rights and wrongs of the proposed eviction'.  No such exceptional circumstances applied in the present case.  Furthermore, although since the applicant’s landlord was a public authority it was open to him to challenge the decisions to obtain the notice to quit and to bring possession proceedings in an application for judicial review, his application failed because the local authority had not acted unlawfully.</p>
<p class="paraleft">53. … the procedural safeguards required by Article 8 for the assessment of the proportionality of the interference [with the applicant’s right to respect for his home] were not met by the possibility for the applicant to apply for judicial review and to obtain a scrutiny by the courts of the lawfulness and reasonableness of the local authority’s decisions.  Judicial review procedure is not well adapted for the resolution of sensitive factual questions which are better left to the County Court responsible for ordering possession.  In the present case, the judicial review proceedings, like the possession proceedings, did not provide any opportunity for an independent tribunal to examine whether the applicant’s loss of his home was proportionate under Article 8 para.2 to the legitimate aims pursued.”</p>
<p class="para">84.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Hope, in paragraph 110 of his opinion in <i>Kay </i>and <i>Price</i>, a paragraph which formed a critical part of the majority opinion, described and recommended a procedure which would enable any defendant to possession proceedings brought by a local authority to raise as a defence in the possession proceedings themselves the question whether the local authority’s decision to institute the possession proceedings was a lawful one.  Local authorities, being public authorities, are obliged by section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998 to act in accordance with the Convention rights incorporated by the Act into domestic law.  They are obliged when deciding to terminate tenancies and recover possession of residential properties to act consistently with article 8.  If a decision, for example to serve a notice to quit, is inconsistent with the article 8 rights of the person on whom it is served the decision would be unlawful and the notice to quit devoid of effect.  Lord Hope’s paragraph 110 establishes that a point of that sort can be raised as a defence to the possession proceedings.  Such a defence would, if raised, be dealt with by a county court judge as part of the possession proceedings.  A separate judicial review application to the High Court<i> </i>is not necessary.  If factual issues need to be resolved in order for the article 8 defence to be dealt with, that can be done before the county court judge in the same way as any other factual issues arising in the possession proceedings..  The Fourth Section’s apparent understanding to the contrary was mistaken.</p>
<p class="para">85.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, an article 8 defence, like any other defence, would need to be pleaded, or set out, together with the relevant facts relied on, in an affidavit.  If an application for summary judgment were made, the County Court judge dealing with the case might conclude that the article 8 defence, as disclosed in the pleadings or in the affidavit, could not succeed.  In that case the judge, unless there were some other arguable defence, would be entitled, and would be expected, to deal with the case summarily and make an order for possession.  The Fourth Section appear to believe that on an application for a summary judgment the court cannot consider “any issue concerning the proportionality of the possession order".  Not so.  An article 8 defence requires the judge to review the lawfulness of the local authority’s decision to recover possession of the property in question and, in doing so, to review the factors that a responsible local authority ought to have taken into account in reaching its decision.  The proportionality of the decision in all the circumstances of the case would be central to the review and if the local authority’s decision could be shown to be outside the range of reasonable decisions that a responsible local authority could take, having regard both to the circumstances of the defendant as well as to all the other relevant circumstances, the decision would be held to be unlawful as a matter of public law.  But in a case in which it is not reasonably arguable on the face of the pleadings, or from the contents of the affidavits that have been filed, that that is so, the judge can be expected to make a summary order for possession.  The adjective “summary” in this context does not mean that the judge would not have considered the proportionality of the requested possession order.  It means that the article 8 case put forward by the defendant for a conclusion that a possession order would be disproportionate is not, in the opinion of the judge, capable of being sustained by serious argument.  The notion that a defence based on an article 8 right to respect for a home requires the case to proceed to a full trial even though it is apparent that the defence cannot succeed is clearly absurd.  An application for a summary judgment does require the defendant’s contention that a possession order would be disproportionate to be given proper attention and, if reasonably arguable, to be permitted to proceed to a full trial.</p>
<p class="para">86.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Proportionate” for article 8 purposes must mean proportionate in all the circumstances of the case.  The Fourth Section comment, in their paragraph 52, that “the local authority chose to bypass the statutory scheme by requesting Mrs McCann to sign a common law notice to quit” and that “it does not appear that the authority, in the course of this procedure, gave any consideration to the applicant’s right to respect for his home".  I find these comments quite astonishing in the context of the actual facts of the <i>McCann </i>case as recited in the judgment.  The essential facts were these.  The applicant was a man whose marriage had broken down and against whom a 3 month non-molestation order and an ouster order had been made.  These orders required him to leave the house that had been his, his wife’s and his two children’s home.  The orders had been made for the protection of his wife and children.  In breach of the orders he made a forcible entry into the house, using a crowbar in order to do so.  His wife and children had to take refuge out of the house as a result.  The local authority found them another house in which they could live.  On 8 August 2001 the wife returned the house-keys of her former home to the local authority with a note saying she was giving up the tenancy.  The local authority subsequently discovered that the house had been seriously damaged by the removal of fixtures so that in excess of £15,000 would need to be expended to make it again habitable. From August to November the house was uninhabited.  In November 2001 Mr McCann returned to the house, did some renovation work and resumed living there.  In January 2002, having realised that the house was no longer uninhabited the local authority asked Mrs McCann to sign a notice to quit terminating the tenancy that she and Mr McCann had jointly held.  She did so.  The local authority later commenced possession proceedings against Mr McCann: see paragraph 13 of the <i>McCann </i>judgment.</p>
<p class="para">87.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the background to Mr McCann’s claim that the local authority’s possession proceedings were contrary to his article 8 right to respect for his home.  The home, of course, had not been his home alone.  It had been the family home, a home for which he, himself, in the events of April 2001 had shown a truly lamentable want of respect.  It was his want of respect for his home and for his wife’s and children’s article 8 rights to respect for their home that had led to their departure from the home, to his wife’s termination of the tenancy and to the local authority’s possession proceedings, an aspect of the matter that the Fourth Section’s judgment completely ignores.  Moreover, the applicant, his wife and children had been occupying as their home a three bedroom house.  Housing is, for local authorities in general, a scarce commodity.  Mr McCann’s conduct in April 2001 had required the local authority to rehouse Mrs McCann and the children in suitable alternative accommodation.   It was, or ought to have been, obvious that Mr McCann could not expect to be allowed to remain in the three bedroom house.  The house would be required for allocation to some other family that needed a house of that size.  It was obvious that the local authority would need to recover possession of the house in order to allocate it to someone else on their housing list.  Mrs McCann had given back her keys and had said she was giving up the tenancy.  The proposition that in these circumstances the local authority’s request to her that she sign a notice formally terminating the joint tenancy was inconsistent with Mr McCann’s right to respect for his home seems to me at variance with the facts.  Its apparent acceptance by the Fourth Section suggests that in addressing the proportionality issue they overlooked the facts that any domestic judge would be bound to have taken into account.  The domestic court that heard Mr McCann’s judicial review application would not have committed that error.  The court would, or should, have examined the contention that the local authority’s decision first to ask Mrs McCann to sign a notice terminating the tenancy and then to commence possession proceedings was in breach of Mr McCann’s right to respect for his home and therefore unlawful.  It would, or should, have done so against the background of all the circumstances of the case, including the degree of respect for his home to which Mr McCann could still claim to be entitled.  If all the circumstances of the case are taken into account, the conclusion that Mr McCann’s article 8 defence was unarguable is, in my respectful opinion, inevitable and plainly right.  I do not understand how the Fourth Section could have thought otherwise.</p>
<p class="para">88.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons I feel unable to place any weight on the Fourth Section’s conclusions regarding the alleged inadequacies of the domestic procedures for enabling article 8 rights to be raised and relied on as a defence to possession proceedings.  Section 2(1)(a) of the 1998 Act requires courts of this country to take into account Strasbourg court decisions regarding the meaning and effect of the articles of the Convention incorporated into domestic law.  But the domestic courts are not bound by those decisions and where, as here, they appear to be based on an imperfect understanding of domestic law or procedure, they need not, and in my opinion should not, be followed.  I wish to add, also, that I am in full agreement with all the comments made by Lord Hope on the <i>McCann </i>case.</p>
<p class="para">LORD RODGER OF EARLSFERRY</p>
<p class="para">My Lords,</p>
<p class="para">89.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the opportunity to consider your Lordships’ speeches in draft.  On a subject already traversed in so many different ways in so many speeches, both today and in the past, it would, I believe, be less than helpful for me to add yet another discourse to the mix.  I shall accordingly confine myself to saying that, for the reasons given by my noble and learned friends, Lord Hope of Craighead and Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe, I too would allow the appeal, and remit the case to the judge in the High Court.</p>
<p class="para">LORD WALKER OF GESTINGTHORPE</p>
<p class="para">My Lords,</p>
<p class="para">90.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the third time in five years that your Lordships’ House has had to grapple with the problems posed by local authority landlords seeking possession of tenanted (or licensed) property from tenants (or licensees) who seek to rely on rights under article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and sections 6 and 7 of the Human Rights Act 1998 (“the HRA”).  The first occasion was <i>Harrow LBC v Qazi</i> [2004] 1 AC 983, on which the House was divided.  On the second occasion (<i>Kay v Lambeth LBC</i> and <i>Leeds City Council v Price</i> [2006]  2 AC 465) an Appellate Committee of seven sat in order to consider the effect on <i>Qazi</i> (both in terms of judicial precedent and as to its practical implications) of the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in <i>Connors v United Kingdom</i> (2004) 40 EHRR 189.  (I shall refer to these two cases as <i>Kay</i> except where it is necessary to refer separately to <i>Price</i>.)  Although the Appellate Committee that heard <i>Kay </i>were unanimous on the issue of judicial precedent, they were unfortunately again divided by the narrowest of margins on other issues; and there have been difficulties in determining how far the majority decision goes.  One reason for the difficulties is that neither <i>Kay</i> nor <i>Price</i> had any factual similarity to <i>Connors</i> (<i>Price</i> was concerned with a gipsy family but it was not seriously arguable that the recreation ground which they had occupied as trespassers for two days had become their home).  The present appeal, by contrast, arises on facts closely similar to those of <i>Connors.  </i>Moreover it raises for the first time (at any rate in your Lordships’ House, and in the context of local authority landlords) important and difficult issues as to the application of the HRA to an infringement of human rights said to arise from the deficiencies of the common law (and not from statute).  These issues were not canvassed in <i>Connors</i> because in that case all the relevant events occurred before the HRA came into force.</p>
<p class="para">91.&nbsp;&nbsp;I gratefully adopt the summaries of the relevant facts and legislation set out in the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Hope of Craighead.  The respondent, Birmingham City Council, the landlord, is of course a public authority within the meaning of the HRA.  But so, under section 6(3)(a), is the court—in this case HHJ McKenna (sitting initially in the Birmingham County Court but then, after a transfer, as a High Court judge).  Before the Court of Appeal and again before your Lordships, counsel for the appellant (Mr Luba QC) and counsel for the intervener, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government (Mr Stilitz in the Court of Appeal and Mr Sales QC in this House) have placed great emphasis on the Court’s position as a public authority.  They have also energetically submitted that in making a possession order in favour of the City Council the judge was applying the common law, and not some statutory provision.  Therefore, they have submitted, section 6(2) of the HRA (the general effect of which is to protect public authorities acting in obedience to statutory provisions) does not apply.  That is the first of two distinct points on section 6(2) (both of which are important and difficult) arising in this appeal.  The other is as to whether, and how, section 6(2)(b) applies in a case where a public authority has a statutory power or discretion which could be exercised in a way that is incompatible with Convention rights but could also be exercised compatibly with Convention rights.</p>
<p class="para">92.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first of these points was raised only peripherally in <i>Qazi</i> and <i>Kay</i>.  In <i>Qazi</i> the issue which attracted the most attention was the autonomous meaning of the expression “home” in article 8.  Two of the majority (Lord Millett at para 108 and my noble and learned friend Lord Scott of Foscote at paras 142-144) disapproved of the <i>obiter</i> suggestion made by Waller LJ in <i>R (McLellan) v Bracknell Forest Borough Council</i> [2002] QB 1129, para 42, that the court as a public authority may have to consider article 8 even in a possession claim by a private landlord.  Lord Millett saw the court’s position quite differently (para 108):</p>
<p class="paraleft">“The fact that a person cannot be evicted without a court order does not mean that the court, as a public authority, is bound in each case to consider whether an order for possession would be disproportionate and infringe article 8 rights.  The court is merely the forum for the determination of the civil right in dispute between the parties: see <i>Di Palma v United Kingdom</i> (1986) 10 EHRR 149.  Its task is to resolve the dispute according to law.  In doing so it would, of course, have to consider whether the landlord was entitled to possession as a matter of our ordinary domestic law (i e apart from the Human Rights Act 1998), taking into account the various statutory provisions which operate in this field.  But once it concludes that the landlord is entitled to an order for possession, there is nothing further to investigate.”</p>
<p class="para">93.&nbsp;&nbsp;A little earlier in his speech Lord Millett had said (para 103):</p>
<p class="paraleft">“The premises were Mr Qazi’s home, and evicting him would obviously amount to an interference with his enjoyment of the premises as his home.  But his right to occupy them as such was circumscribed by the terms of his tenancy and had come to an end.  Eviction was plainly necessary to protect the rights of the local authority as landowner.  Its obligation to ‘respect’ Mr Qazi’s home was not infringed by its requirement that he vacate the premises at the expiry of the period during which it had agreed that he might occupy them.  There was simply no balance to be struck.”</p>
<p class="para">The metaphorical question of whether there is a balance to be struck (or conversely whether Parliament, by its frequent and complex modifications of the common law of landlord and tenant, has conclusively struck the balance) has increasingly dominated the debate.  For instance in <i>Kay</i> Baroness Hale of Richmond observed (para 182):</p>
<p class="paraleft">“As I understand it, none of your Lordships accepts that the sequential approach adopted in Strasbourg to the cases which it declares admissible should be adopted in the general run of possession actions.  This is because the Court is entitled to make two assumptions.  The first is that the domestic law has struck the right balance between the competing interests involved: those of a person occupying premises as his home and those of the landowner seeking to regain possession of those premises in accordance with the law.  The second is that the landowner, if a public authority, has acted compatibly with the Convention rights of the individual occupier in deciding to enforce its proprietary rights.”</p>
<p class="para">But it is clear from the following paragraphs of her speech that Baroness Hale was speaking of prima facie assumptions, not irrebuttable presumptions (para 185):</p>
<p class="paraleft">“My Lords, we are all agreed that it must be possible for the defendant in a possession action to claim that the balance between respect for his home and the property rights of the owner, struck by the general law in the type of case of which his is an example, does not comply with the Convention.  We also agree that the cases in which such a claim will have a real prospect of success are rare.”</p>
<p class="para">94.&nbsp;&nbsp;Baroness Hale was in the majority in <i>Kay</i>, together with Lord Hope, Lord Scott and Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood.  In the Court of Appeal in this case, Carnwath LJ embarked on a very careful analysis of how far para 110 of Lord Hope’s speech in <i>Kay</i> addressed a local authority’s claim for possession which (in the words of Carnwath LJ at para 47, summarising counsel’s submissions) “depended on its common law rights, not on any statutory entitlement.”  Counsel submitted that Lord Hope and (probably) Lord Brown had taken a different view from Lord Scott and Baroness Hale. Carnwath LJ concluded that there was no such division, and that the majority treated the case as covered by section 6(2)(b) of the HRA (which Lord Hope had expressly mentioned in paras 86 and 114 of his speech).</p>
<p class="para">95.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, it is not for me to try to put a gloss on the speeches of any of the majority in <i>Kay</i>, but my clear recollection, confirmed by the full reported summary of counsel’s arguments ([2006] 2 AC 465, 470-482) is that the boundary between statute and common law was simply not an issue in the case.  There was no question of the court exercising its interpretative function under section 3 of the HRA, or making a declaration of incompatibility under section 4.  Section 6 of the HRA does not get a single mention in the law reporter’s summary of counsel’s arguments (although <i>McLellan</i> was cited by both sides).  Throughout the summary there are many phrases suggesting that the subject-matter was statutory: “statutory code", “statutory regime", “statutory scheme", “considered legislative choice", “legislative scheme".  There are others suggestive of statutory and common law taken together: “relevant regulatory framework", “general scheme of property law", “statutory overlay", “general law endorsed or laid down by the legislature” (this last from the argument of Mr Sales and Mr Stilitz at p 481C, which seems a little difficult to reconcile with their submissions in the present case).</p>
<p class="para">96.&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of the boundary between statute and common law (or to put it another way, the sometimes inextricable tangle between the two) was therefore near the surface in <i>Kay</i>, but my recollection is that it did not surface as a clearly identified issue which needed to be decided.  Baroness Hale certainly did spot it but did not feel it necessary to express a definite view about it: see paras 187 and 192 of her speech, the latter quoted by Carnwath LJ at para 52 of his judgment.  The same is true of the speeches of Lord Hope, Lord Scott and Lord Brown, as I read them: see paras 110, 169 and 202.  My strong impression is that in this case the Court of Appeal was loyally attempting to extract from these passages in the speeches in <i>Kay</i> a decision (or at least a clear expression of opinion) on a point which had been adumbrated but by no means fully argued by counsel, because it was not regarded as necessary to the disposal of the appeal.  It is possible to see, with hindsight, that guidance to lower courts, if it was to be fully comprehensive, needed to explore this aspect more fully.  But even in your Lordships’ House it is often unwise to go far beyond what is needed to dispose of the appeal, especially if there is some moot point which has not been fully argued.  In this case the point has been squarely raised and it must be decided—and decided on the arguments addressed to us rather than by searching for clues scattered through the speeches in <i>Kay</i>.</p>
<p class="para">97.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion the House should not accept the submissions as to the inapplicability of section 6(2) of the HRA put forward by Mr Sales (in support, on this point, of Mr Luba for the appellant).  The Secretary of State is understandably anxious that the United Kingdom should not again be subject to an adverse finding, as it was in <i>Connors</i>, if this case proceeds to Strasbourg.  Another adverse finding at Strasbourg would indeed be regrettable, but it would in my opinion be a smaller misfortune (given that the relevant statutory provision is to be amended in any event) than the long-term damage involved in what I see as a distortion of the proper development of the principles underlying the HRA.  One of the most important of those principles, repeatedly emphasized in this House in its judicial capacity, is the continuing sovereignty of Parliament.</p>
<p class="para">98.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appellant’s case, vigorously supported (on these points) by the Secretary of State, has two main pillars.  One is that it was not as a result of “one or more provisions of primary legislation” (see section 6(2) of the HRA), but as a result of the common law, that the judge made an order for possession against the appellant (and the other original defendants).  The other is that the City Council’s decision to seek possession, and the judge’s order for possession, were not therefore covered by section 6(2) of the HRA, and were unlawful since they infringed the appellant’s article 8 rights.</p>
<p class="para">99.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second pillar of this argument starts to raise the spectre of courts at every level having to remould or develop the common law (for instance, by developing common law rights of privacy not derived from confidence) in order to make it fully compatible with the HRA.  That is a course which this House was so far firmly and unanimously rejected (<i>Wainwright v Home Office</i> [2004] 2 AC 406; compare the views expressed by the Court of Appeal in <i>Douglas v Hello! Ltd</i> [2001] QB 967 in the earliest days after the HRA came into force, especially Sedley LJ at paras 128-129).  The whole issue of the HRA’s “horizontal effect” (between parties who are not public authorities, but are engaged in litigation before a court which is a public authority) was the subject of enormous academic interest when the HRA had been enacted, but was not yet in force (for instance (2000) 116 LQR contains four separate articles and notes on this topic, all by distinguished authors).  Since then this topic has been overtaken by others, and the law may still have some way to go before it is fully developed.  But it is not necessary to consider it further here, in my opinion, because the first pillar of the argument (that section 6(2) is inapplicable) is in my view mistaken.</p>
<p class="para">100.&nbsp;&nbsp;At common law, a landlord is entitled to possession of the demised premises if the tenant’s lease or tenacy has expired or been validly terminated, and similarly <i>a fortiori</i> if there was only a licence.  To that extent the appellant and the Secretary of State are correct in saying that the City Council was, in seeking possession, relying on a common law right.  That is part of the picture, but it is far from the whole picture, and in my opinion it would be unrealistic, and productive of error, not to look at the whole picture. The fact is that the City Council’s common law right was surrounded on all sides by statutory infrastructure, like a patch of grass in the middle of a motorway junction.  The field of social housing is, as Baroness Hale of Richmond observed in <i>Kay</i> (para 185)</p>
<p class="paraleft">“an area of the law much trampled over by the legislature as it has tried to respond to shifting and conflicting social and economic pressures.”</p>
