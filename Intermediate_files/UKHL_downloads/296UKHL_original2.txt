<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20.&nbsp;&nbsp;That conclusion makes it necessary to consider the other major question debated in argument, whether the Board has power to adopt this procedure.  The Board was first established by section 59 of the Criminal Justice Act 1967, and was continued in existence by section 32 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991, which was in force when the appellant's current parole review began.  Section 32, so far as material and as amended, provided:</p>
<p></p><ul>"(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parole Board shall be, by that name, a body corporate and as such shall<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;be constituted in accordance with this Part;  and<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;have the functions conferred ….. by Chapter II of Part II of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 ('Chapter II') in respect of life prisoners within the meaning of that Chapter.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board shall deal with cases as respects which it gives directions under ….. Chapter II on consideration of all such evidence as may be adduced before it.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;Without prejudice to [subsection] ….. (4) above, the Secretary of State may make rules with respect to the proceedings of the Board, including provision authorising cases to be dealt with by a prescribed number of its members or requiring cases to be dealt with at prescribed times.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary of State may also give to the Board directions as to the matters to be taken into account by it in discharging any functions under ….. Chapter II;  and in giving any such directions the Secretary of State shall in particular have regard to—<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;the need to protect the public from serious harm from offenders;  and<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;the desirability of preventing the commission by them of further offences and of securing their rehabilitation.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;Schedule 5 to this Act shall have effect with respect to the Board."<p></p></ul>
Chapter II of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 includes section 28, subsection (5) of which now obliges the Secretary of State to release a tariff expired mandatory life sentence prisoner whose release the Board has directed, thus engaging section 32(4) above.  Schedule 5 to the 1991 Act provided in para 1(2)(b), under the hearing "Status and capacity":
<p></p><ul>"It shall be within the capacity of the Board as a statutory corporation to do such things and enter into such transactions as are incidental to or conducive to the discharge of . . .<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul><ul>"(b) its functions under Chapter II of Part II of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 in respect of life prisoners within the meaning of that Chapter."<p></p></ul></ul>
<p>Section 32 of and Schedule 5 to the 1991 Act were repealed and replaced by section 239 of and Schedule 19 to the Criminal Justice Act 2003, but it was not suggested in argument that this change had any bearing on the issue to be decided by the House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21.&nbsp;&nbsp;The House was referred to Parole Board Rules made by the Secretary of State under section 32(5) of the 1991 Act in 1992, 1997 and 2004.  The 1992 and 1997 Rules were in very much the same terms, although the 1997 Rules applied to wider classes of life sentence prisoners, and neither applied to mandatory life sentence prisoners until section 28 of the 1997 Act was amended by section 275 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which came into force on 18 December 2003.  Common to the 1992 and 1997 Rules was a requirement in rule 5(1) to serve relevant information and reports on the prisoner or his representative.  But this requirement was qualified by paras (2) and (3):</p>
<p></p><ul>"(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Any part of the information or reports referred to in paragraph (1) which, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, should be withheld from the prisoner on the ground that its disclosure would adversely affect the health or welfare of the prisoner or others, shall be recorded in a separate document and served only on the Board together with the reasons for believing that its disclosure would have that effect.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a document is withheld from the prisoner in accordance with paragraph (2), it shall nevertheless be served as soon as practicable on the prisoner's representative if he is -<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul><ul>(a) a barrister or solicitor,<p></p></ul></ul>
<p></p><ul><ul>(b) a registered medical practitioner, or<p></p></ul></ul>
<p></p><ul><ul>(c) a person whom the chairman of the panel directs is suitable by virtue of his experience or professional qualification;<p></p></ul></ul>
<p></p><ul><ul>provided that no information disclosed in accordance with this paragraph shall be disclosed either directly or indirectly to the prisoner or to any other person without the authority of the chairman of the panel."<p></p></ul></ul>
<p>A right to be represented (subject to certain exclusions) was provided in rule 6, and a right for the prisoner to call witnesses and adduce evidence, subject to certain procedural conditions, by rules 7 and 8.  The chairman of the panel had power to give directions (rule 9), among them a direction (rule 9(1)(d)):</p>
<p></p><ul>"as regards any documents which have been received by the Board but which have been withheld from the prisoner in accordance with rule 5(2), whether the disclosure of such documents would adversely affect the health or welfare of the prisoner or others . . ."<p></p></ul>
<p>There was to be an oral hearing of the prisoner's case unless otherwise agreed (rule 10) and the hearing was to be at the prison or other institution where the prisoner was detained (rule 12(1).  It was provided in rule 13(2) that:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Subject to this rule, the panel shall conduct the hearing in such manner as it considers most suitable to the clarification of the issues before it and generally to the just handling of the proceedings . . ."<p></p></ul>
<p>This paragraph was subject to paragraph (3) which provided:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The parties shall be entitled to appear and be heard at the hearing and take such part in the proceedings as the panel thinks proper; and the parties may hear each others' evidence, put questions to each other, call any witnesses who the Board has authorised to give evidence in accordance with rule 7, and put questions to any witness or other person appearing before the panel."<p></p></ul>
<p>Rule 15(2) provided:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The decision by which the panel determines a case shall be recorded in writing with reasons, signed by the chairman of the panel, and communicated in writing to the parties not more than seven days after the end of the hearing."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2004 Rules come into force on 1 August 2004, and are accepted by the appellant as applying to his case, which was referred to the Board again by the Secretary of State on 21 February 2005.  In these Rules certain changes were made.  Rule 6(2) and (3) reproduce rule 5(2) and (3) of the 1992 and 1997 Rules, but with some expansion and qualification:</p>
<p></p><ul>"(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Any part of the information or reports referred to in paragraph (1) which, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, should be withheld from the prisoner on the grounds that its disclosure would adversely affect national security, the prevention of disorder or crime or the health or welfare of the prisoner or others (such withholding being a necessary and proportionate measure in all the circumstances of the case), shall be recorded in a separate document and served only on the Board together with the reasons for believing that its disclosure would have that effect.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a document is withheld from the prisoner in accordance with paragraph (2), it shall, unless the chair of the panel directs otherwise, nevertheless be served as soon as practicable on the prisoner's representative if he is -<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul><ul>(a) a barrister of solicitor,<p></p></ul></ul>
<p></p><ul><ul>(b) a registered medical practitioner, or<p></p></ul></ul>
<p></p><ul><ul>(c) a person whom the chair of the panel directs is suitable by virtue of his experience or professional qualification;  <p></p></ul></ul>
<p></p><ul><ul>provided that no information disclosed in accordance with this paragraph shall be disclosed either directly or indirectly to the prisoner or to any other person without the consent/authority of the chair of the panel."<p></p></ul></ul>
<p>Rule 8, which in part reproduces rule 9 of the earlier rules in relation to the giving of directions, provides in (2)(d) that a direction:</p>
<p></p><ul>"(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;as regards any documents which have been received by the Board but which have been withheld from the prisoner in accordance with rule 6(2), whether withholding such documents is a necessary and proportionate measure in all the circumstances of the case."<p></p></ul>
<p>The prisoner must give notice whether he wishes to attend the hearing (rule 14(3)).  Rule 15 entitles him to call witnesses if he obtains leave to do so.  Rule 18(1) provides that:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The hearing shall be held at the prison or other institution where the prisoner is detained, or such other place as the chair of the panel, with the agreement of the Secretary of State, may direct."<p></p></ul>
<p>Rule 19(2) and (3) reproduce rules 13(2) and (3) of the earlier rules.  Rule 19(6) is new and provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The chair of the panel may require the prisoner, any witness appearing for the prisoner, or any other person present, to leave the hearing where evidence is being examined which the chair of the panel, in accordance with rule 8(2)(d) (subject to any successful appeal under rule 8(2)), previously directed should be withheld from the prisoner as adversely affecting national security, the prevention of disorder or crime or the health or welfare of the prisoner or others."<p></p></ul>
<p>Rule 20, relating to the panel's decision provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The panel's decision determining a case shall be recorded in writing with reasons, signed by the chair of the panel, and provided in writing to the parties not more than 7 days after the end of the hearing; the recorded decision with reasons shall only make reference to matters which the Secretary of State has referred to the Board."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23.&nbsp;&nbsp;A statutory tribunal has such powers as its parent statute confers upon it, whether expressly or impliedly, and no more.  Where the power is express, no difficulty should arise.  For purposes of implication, the test propounded by Lord Selborne LC in <i>Attorney-General v Great Eastern Railway Co</i> (1880)  5 App Cas 473, 478,  has been treated as generally applicable, whether to companies, local authorities or statutory corporations.  He agreed with James LJ that:</p>
<p></p><ul>"this doctrine [of <i>ultra vires</i>] ought to be reasonably, and not unreasonably, understood and applied, and that whatever may fairly be regarded as incidental to, or consequent upon, those things which the Legislature has authorized, ought not (unless expressly prohibited) to be held, by judicial construction, to be <i>ultra vires.</i>"<p></p></ul>
<p>Section 111 of the Local Government Act 1972 empowers local authorities to do anything which is calculated to facilitate, or is conducive or incidental to, the discharge of any of their functions.  Paragraph 1(2) of Schedule 5 to the 1991 Act, as already noted, empowers the Board to do such things and enter into such transactions as are incidental or conducive to the discharge of its statutory functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing in the 1991 Act or the 2003 Act which expressly authorises the Board to hold an oral hearing to review a tariff-expired mandatory life sentence prisoner's application for parole in a manner that does not accord with the well-known principles of natural justice.  There is in particular nothing in either Act which expressly authorises the Board to make a decision adverse to a prisoner without disclosure to the prisoner of the case against him, so that he may answer it if he can; to deny him the benefit of an adversarial hearing; to provide for the exclusion of himself or his legal representative from the hearing; or to adopt a specially appointed advocate procedure.  The Board and the Secretary of State did not argue otherwise.  Rules made by the Secretary of State under section 32(5) cannot enlarge the powers conferred by the Act.  This is trite law, and Mr Owen was right to concentrate his argument on lack of power in the Act and not on the effect of the Rules.  But in any event, the 1992 and 1997 Rules do not begin to authorise the steps listed above; nor do the 2004 Rules purport to authorise them, despite some steps in that direction.  If, therefore, the taking of those steps are to be justified as within the powers of the Board it must be because they are incidental or conducive to the discharge of the Board's functions.  The Board and the Secretary of State contended that power to take such steps is indeed incidental and conducive to the discharge of the Board's functions, pointing to the undoubted importance of the Board's functions in protecting the public against the risk of injury or death and protecting witnesses against the risk of retaliation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are in my opinion two reasons, each of them independently conclusive, why this argument cannot be accepted.  The first depends on the presumption that Parliament does not intend to interfere with the exercise of fundamental rights.  It will be understood to do so only if it does so expressly.  In <i>R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p Pierson</i> [1998]  AC 539, 574 Lord Browne-Wilkinson said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Where wide powers of decision-making are conferred by statute, it is presumed that Parliament implicitly requires the decision to be made in accordance with the rules of natural justice: <i>Bennion on Statutory Interpretation,</i> p 737.  However widely the power is expressed in the statute, it does not authorise that power to be exercised otherwise than in accordance with fair procedures."<p></p></ul>
<p>Lord Steyn spoke to similar effect: pp 587-590.  In <i>R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p Simms</i> [2000]  2 AC 115, 131, Lord Hoffmann expressed the point very clearly:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Parliamentary sovereignty means that Parliament can, if it chooses, legislate contrary to fundamental principles of human rights.  The Human Rights Act 1998 will not detract from this power.  The constraints upon its exercise by Parliament are ultimately political, not legal.  But the principle of legality means that Parliament must squarely confront what it is doing and accept the political cost.  Fundamental rights cannot be overridden by general or ambiguous words.  This is because there is too great a risk that the full implications of their unqualified meaning may have passed unnoticed in the democratic process.  In the absence of express language or necessary implication to the contrary, the courts therefore presume that even the most general words were intended to be subject to the basic rights of the individual.  In this way the courts of the United Kingdom, though acknowledging the sovereignty of Parliament, apply principles of constitutionality little different from those which exist in countries where the power of the legislature is expressly limited by a constitutional document."<p></p></ul>
<p>For reasons given above, the course proposed and so far adopted in the conduct of the appellant's parole review involves a substantial departure from the standards of procedural fairness which would ordinarily be observed in conducting a review of this kind.  It would in my opinion violate the principle of legality, strongly relied on in argument by Mr Owen, and undermine the rule of law itself, if such a departure were to be justified as incidental or conducive to the discharge of the Board's functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26.&nbsp;&nbsp;My second reason for rejecting the implication argument is based on the historical record, which demonstrates that the presumption to which I have referred is not a lawyer's fiction but a practical reality.  The procedure formerly adopted for handling deportation challenges raising sensitive questions of national security was finally condemned by the European Court in <i>Chahal v United Kingdom</i> (1996)  23 EHRR 413.  In para 131 of its judgment in that case the Court referred with approval to a form of judicial control obtaining in Canada, apparently somewhat analogous to the special advocate procedure (although the Court has suspended judgment on the conformity of that procedure with the Convention:  <i>Al-Nashif v Bulgaria</i> (2002)  36 EHRR 655, para 97).  Parliament acted on this indication.  In response to the judgment the Special Immigration Appeals Commission Act 1997 was enacted to establish the Commission.  That Act conferred power on the Lord Chancellor to make rules (section 5(1)) and gave express power in section 5(3) to make rules which would:</p>
<p></p><ul>"(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;make provision enabling proceedings before the Commission to take place without the appellant being given full particulars of the reasons for the decision which is the subject of the appeal,<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;make provision enabling the Commission to hold proceedings in the absence of any person, including the appellant and any legal representative appointed by him,<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;make provision about the functions in proceedings before the Commission of persons appointed under section 6 below, and<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;make provision enabling the Commission to give the appellant a summary of any evidence taken in his absence."<p></p></ul>
<p>Such rules were to be made by statutory instrument (section 5(8)) of which a draft was to be laid before and approved by resolution of each House.  Seeking the House of Lords' approval of the first rules made under the Act, the Lord Chancellor acknowledged that the Commission's procedures departed from what would ordinarily be required to satisfy natural justice: House of Lords Hansard, 29 July 1998, Col 1587.  Section 6 of the Act provided for the appointment of special advocates (not so described), who would not be responsible to the person whose interests they were appointed to represent.  The Special Immigration Appeals Commission (Procedure) Rules 2003 (SI 2003/1034), now in force, lay down detailed provisions governing the withholding of material from the applicant and his legal representative (e.g. rules 10(3), 16(3), 37), the appointment and role of special advocates (rules 34-36), the holding of hearings in the absence of the appellant and his legal representative (rule 43), qualification of the appellant's right to cross-examine opposing witnesses (rule 44(5)) and a qualification of the Commission's duty to give reasons for its decision (rule 47).  Thus whatever the merits of these procedures (which have caused concern to the House of Commons Constitutional Affairs Committee and a number of special advocates, as evidenced by the report referred to in para 18 above, but on which the House is not required to rule in this appeal), it seems clear that they have been authorised by primary legislation and by rules approved in Parliament.  Reliance has not been placed on implication to warrant so significant a departure from ordinary standards of procedural fairness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;27.&nbsp;&nbsp;Schedule 3 to the Terrorism Act 2000, governing the Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission, contained provisions very similar to those already noted in the Special Immigration Appeals Commission Act 1997, including (in paragraph 7) provision for special advocates, and was followed by the Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission (Procedure) Rules 2001 (S1 2001/443) similar in effect to the SIAC Rules already mentioned.  The Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000, inserted a section directed to national security into the Race Relations Act 1976, and contained express statutory authority to make rules which would exclude a claimant and his representatives from the hearing and for the appointment of a special advocate who would not be responsible to the person whose interests he was appointed to represent.  Schedule 6 to the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, governing the Pathogens Access Appeal Commission, was very closely modelled on that pertaining to proscribed organisations in Schedule 3 to the 2000 Act, containing almost identical provisions.  The Pathogens Access Appeal Commission (Procedure) Rules 2002 (S1 2002/1845) were closely modelled on the Proscribed Organisations Rules.  Section 80 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 made special provision for the appointment of a person to represent the interests of any person who would be prevented from hearing or inspecting any evidence at a local inquiry on grounds of national security.  Rules made under the section to regulate this procedure were to be contained in a statutory instrument subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House.  The Schedule to the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 contains detailed provisions governing the making of procedural rules, varying the ordinary rules of procedural fairness, in the context of control orders.  Such rules are required to be laid before Parliament and are to cease to have effect if not approved by a resolution of each House within 40 days of the making of the rules.  The Civil Procedure (Amendment No. 2) Rules 2005 (SI 2005/656 (L16)), made on 11 March 2005, contain detailed provisions governing the exclusion of a party and his legal representative from the hearing and the appointment of special advocates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28.&nbsp;&nbsp;Reference was made in argument to four instances in which there had been a departure from the ordinary rules of procedural fairness in Northern Ireland:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998 provided for prisoners serving sentences for scheduled offences to apply to Sentence Review Commissioners for early release if they were able to meet certain statutory conditions.  By Schedule 2 to the Act the Secretary of State was empowered to make rules which might, among other things, provide for the withholding of evidence about a prisoner, the holding of hearings in the absence of the prisoner and his legal representative and the appointment of a person to represent the prisoner when he and his representative were excluded.  Schedule 2 came into force on 28 July 1998 and on 30 July the Secretary of State, acting under the authority of Schedule 2, made the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998 (Sentence Review Commissioners) Rules 1998 (SI 1998/1859), which contained more detailed provisions to the same effect.  Information could be withheld from the prisoner and his representative as a safeguard against dangers which included not only threats to national security but also adverse effects on the health, welfare or safety of any person.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 85(1) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 empowered Her Majesty by Order in Council to make provision dealing with a number of reserved matters listed in Schedule 3, one of which (para 9(e)) was the treatment of offenders.  It was a broad power, extending (section 85(1)(c)) to the amending or repealing of any provision made by or under any Act of Parliament or Northern Ireland legislation.  But (section 85(3)) no recommendation might be made to Her Majesty to make an Order in Council under the section unless a draft of the Order had been laid before and approved by resolution of each House of Parliament.  In exercise of this power, by the Life Sentences (Northern Ireland) Order 2001 (SI 2001/2564) Her Majesty in Council made provision for the appointment of Life Sentence Review Commissioners to deal with tariff and release decisions.  Schedule 2 to the Order empowered the Secretary of State to make procedural rules, subject to annulment by resolution of either House.  Such rules might provide for the withholding of evidence from a prisoner (para 3(e)), the conduct of proceedings in the absence of the prisoner and his legal representative (para 6(1)) and the appointment of a person to represent the interests of the prisoner when he and his representative were excluded (para 6(2)).  Pursuant to Schedule 2, the Secretary of State made the Life Sentence Review Commissioners' Rules 2001 (SR 2001/317), which provided in rule 10(8) for conducting parts of the hearing in the absence of the prisoner and his legal representative, in rule 15(2) for the withholding from the prisoner and his legal representative of any information certified by the Secretary of State to be confidential, as defined, and in rule 16(2) for the appointment of a special advocate to represent the interests of the prisoner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Northern Ireland (Remission of Sentences) Act 1995 came into force on 17 November 1995 (SI 1995/2945) and was significantly amended by the Terrorism Act 2000.  Section 1(3) of the 1995 Act empowered the Secretary of State to revoke the licence of a person released from prison in specified circumstances </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"if it appears to him that the person's continued liberty would present a risk to the safety of others or that he is likely to commit further offences;  and a person whose licence is revoked shall be detained in pursuance of his sentence and, if at large, be deemed to be unlawfully at large."</p>
<p>A person whose licence was revoked was entitled under section 1(4) to make representations in writing to the Secretary of State about the revocation and to be informed as soon as practicable of the reasons for the revocation and of his right to make representations.  There was no provision in the statute enabling the person whose licence had been revoked to seek a review of the lawfulness of his detention by any independent court or tribunal, and section 1(3) and (4) was plainly incompatible with article 5(4) of the Convention:  see for example <i>Waite v United Kingdom</i> (2002)  36 EHRR 1001.   This decision was made on 10 December 2002.  On 13 January 2003 the Secretary of State issued a "Written Statement" in which he stated:</p>
<p></p><ul>"I have put in place additional safeguards for persons, whose licences are revoked.  These include the appointment of independent Commissioners, who hold or have held judicial office, to consider and advise me upon any representations made by recalled prisoners.  I will also make available funds to meet the reasonable legal expenses of prisoners in connection with making such representations whether in writing or at any oral hearing the Commissioners may decide is necessary.  Further details of the procedures and how they will operate will be placed in the libraries of both Houses."<p></p></ul>
<p>Annexed to this document was a note listing the additional safeguards the Secretary of State would apply.  This provided that the Commissioner would decide the procedure for dealing with any representations, subject to paragraphs 5 and 6 which read:</p>
<p></p><ul>"5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the Secretary of State certifies any information as 'damaging information' (as defined in Rule 22(1) of the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998 (Sentence Review Commissioners) Rules 1998), the Commissioner shall not in any circumstances disclose it to the prisoner, his legal representative or any other person except any special advocate appointed by the Attorney General to safeguard the interests of the prisoner.  A special advocate shall not disclose the damaging information to anyone.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;The prisoner, his legal representative and any witness appearing for him shall be excluded from any oral hearing whilst evidence is being examined or argument is being heard relating to 'damaging information'.<p></p></ul>
<p>These paragraphs were supplemented by paragraphs 7-9:</p>
<p></p><ul>"7.&nbsp;&nbsp;A special advocate may communicate with the prisoner he has been appointed to represent at any time before the Secretary of State makes 'damaging information' available to him.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;At any time after the Secretary of State has made 'damaging information' available to him, a special advocate may seek direction from the Commissioner authorising him to seek information in connection with the proceedings from the prisoner.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where information has been certified as 'damaging information' the Secretary of State shall, within such period as the Commissioner may determine, give to the Commissioner and to the prisoner a paper setting out the gist of the damaging information insofar as he considers it possible to do so without causing damages of the kind referred to in Rule 22(1) of the 1998 Rules."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 24(1)(c) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 provided that a minister or department of the Northern Ireland government should have no power to do anything which discriminated against a person or class of person on the ground of religious belief or political opinion.  Section 76 of the Act, applying to public authorities, was to similar effect, although expressly conferring a right of action.  Where a person claimed to be a victim of discrimination in contravention of section 24 or 76, it was open to the person against whom the claim was made to propose to rely (section 90(1)(b) of the Act) on a certificate purporting to be signed by or on behalf of the Secretary of State certifying</p>
<p>"(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;that an act specified in the certificate was done for the purpose of safeguarding national security or protecting public safety or public order;  and</p>
<p>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;that the doing of the act was justified by that purpose."</p>
<p>A claimant might appeal against the certificate to a Tribunal established under section 91, in accordance with rules made by the Lord Chancellor (section 90(2)), which might uphold or quash the certificate (section 90(3)).  Section 91(1) established the Tribunal and section 91(2)-(6) governed the Lord Chancellor's rule-making power.  It was specifically enacted that rules might provide for the withholding of information from the claimant, for the conduct of proceedings in the absence of the claimant and his legal representative and for regulating the functions of persons who might be appointed to represent the interests of the claimant when he and his legal representative were excluded (subsections 4(a), 4(b) and 4(c)).  Power to appoint such persons was conferred on the Attorney General for Northern Ireland by subsection (7).  In exercise of his rule-making power, the Lord Chancellor made the Northern Ireland Act Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 1999 (SI 1999/2131), which were laid before and approved by resolution of each House as required by section 96(6) of the 1998 Act.  These rules made provision for the appointment of special advocates (rule 9), the withholding of information from the claimant (rules 10 and 11), the exclusion of the claimant and his legal representative from the hearing (rule 18) and the issue of incomplete reasons (rule 22).</p>
