<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125.&nbsp;&nbsp;The complaint in <i>Issa</i> concerned the activities of Turkish forces during a military campaign in northern Iraq.  It was dismissed because the applicants had failed to establish that Turkish troops had "conducted operations in the area in question."  The Court, however, "[did] not exclude the possibility that, as a consequence of this military action, the respondent state could be considered to have exercised, temporarily, effective overall control of a particular portion of the territory of northern Iraq.  Accordingly, if there is a sufficient factual basis for  holding that, at the relevant time, the victims were within that specific area, it would follow logically that they were within the jurisdiction of Turkey . . ." (para 74).  Earlier in its judgment, moreover, the Court had referred to the principle of effective control of the territory established in <i>Loizidou</i> and reiterated in <i>Bankovic</i>, <i>Assanidze</i> and <i>Ilascu</i> and added (at para 71):</p>
<p></p><ul>"Moreover, a state may also be held accountable for violation of the Convention rights and freedoms of persons who are in the territory of another state but who are found to be under the former state's authority and control through its agents operating—whether lawfully or unlawfully—in the latter state (see … <i>M v Denmark, …</i>. <i> Sánchez Ramirez v France</i> … <i>Coard et al v United States</i> … and the views adopted by the Human Rights Committee … in the cases of <i>López Burgos v Uruguay</i> and <i>Celiberti de Casariego v Uruguay</i> … ).  Accountability in such situations stems from the fact that article 1 of the Convention cannot be interpreted so as to allow a state party to perpetrate violations of the Convention on the territory of another state, which it could not perpetrate on its own territory (<i>ibid</i>)."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;126.&nbsp;&nbsp;This, plainly, represents the high watermark of the appellants' case.  For my part, however, I find it unconvincing.  Much, of course, depends upon how precisely para 71 of <i>Issa</i> is to be understood.  Insofar as it supports the view that article 1 jurisdiction extends to encompass cases like <i>M v Denmark</i> (an embassy case—see para 122 above) and <i>Sánchez Ramirez v France</i> (an irregular extradition case—see para 119 above) (two of the authorities cited in paragraph 71), it is plainly unexceptionable.  The two cited cases involving Uruguay (<i>López</i> 68 ILR 29 and <i>Celiberti de Casariego </i>68 ILR 41) were also concerned with irregular extraditions—of citizens of Uruguay kidnapped in  respectively Argentina and Brasil by Uruguayan security forces working with their Argentine and Brasilian counterparts—and it was in these two cases that the Human Rights Commission said that "it would be unconscionable to so interpret the responsibility under article 2 of the [ICCPR] as to permit a state party to perpetrate violations of the covenant on the territory of another state, which violations it could not perpetrate on its own territory," a comment applied without more by the Court to the ECHR itself.  <i>Coard et al v US </i>(1999) 9 BHRC 150, the final case cited in support of para 71, had been specifically considered in <i>Bankovic </i>(at paras 23, 48 and 78), the Grand Chamber there noting that article 2 of the American Declaration on the Rights and Duties of Man 1948 contained no explicit limitation of jurisdiction whatever.  Overall, the Grand Chamber in <i>Bankovic</i> (para 78) derived no assistance from "the allegedly similar jurisdiction provisions in the international instruments" (including article 2 of the ICCPR).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;127.&nbsp;&nbsp;If and insofar as <i>Issa</i> is said to support the altogether wider notions of article 1 jurisdiction contended for by the appellants on this appeal, I cannot accept it.  In the first place, the statements relied upon must be regarded as obiter dicta.  Secondly, as just explained, such wider assertions of jurisdiction are not supported by the authorities cited (at any rate, those authorities accepted as relevant by the Grand Chamber in <i>Bankovic</i>).  Thirdly, such wider view of jurisdiction would clearly be inconsistent both with the reasoning in <i>Bankovic</i> and, indeed, with its result.  Either it would extend the effective control principle beyond the Council of Europe area (where alone it had previously been applied, as has been seen, to Northern Cyprus, to the Ajarian Autonomous Republic in Georgia and to Transdniestria) to Iraq, an area (like the FRY considered in <i>Bankovic</i>) outside the Council of Europe—and, indeed, would do so contrary to the inescapable logic of the Court's case law on article 56.  Alternatively it would stretch to breaking point the concept of jurisdiction extending extra-territorially to those subject to a state's "authority and control".  It is one thing to recognise as exceptional the specific narrow categories of cases I have sought to summarise above; it would be quite another to accept that whenever a contracting state acts (militarily or otherwise) through its agents abroad, those affected by such activities fall within its article 1 jurisdiction.  Such a contention would prove altogether too much.  It would make a nonsense of much that was said in <i>Bankovic</i>, not least as to the Convention being "a constitutional instrument of European public order", operating "in an essentially regional context", "not designed to be applied throughout the world, even in respect of the conduct of contracting states" (para 80). It would, indeed, make redundant the principle of effective control of an area: what need for that if jurisdiction arises in any event under a general principle of "authority and control" irrespective of whether the area is (a) effectively controlled or (b) within the Council of Europe?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;128.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other central objection to the creation of the wide basis of jurisdiction here contended for by the appellants under the rubric "control and authority", going beyond that arising in any of the narrowly recognised categories already discussed and yet short of that arising from the effective control of territory within the Council of Europe area. <i>Bankovic</i> (and later <i>Assanidze</i>) stands, as stated, for the indivisible nature of article 1 jurisdiction: it cannot be "divided and tailored". As <i>Bankovic</i> had earlier pointed out (at para 40) "the applicant's interpretation of jurisdiction would invert and divide the positive obligation on contracting states to secure the substantive rights in a manner never contemplated by article 1 of the Convention."  When, moreover, the Convention applies, it operates as "a living instrument."  Ö<i>calan</i> provides an example of this, a recognition that the interpretation of article 2 has been modified consequent on "the territories encompassed by the member states of the Council of Europe [having] become a zone free of capital punishment" (para 163). (Paragraphs 64 and 65 of <i>Bankovic</i>, I may note, contrast on the one hand "the Convention's substantive provisions" and "the competence of the Convention organs", to both of which the "living instrument" approach applies and, on the other hand, the scope of article 1—"the scope and reach of the entire Convention"—to which it does not.)  Bear in mind too the rigour with which the Court applies the Convention, well exemplified by the series of cases from the conflict zone of south eastern Turkey in which, the state's difficulties notwithstanding, no dilution has been permitted of the investigative obligations arising under articles 2 and 3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;129.&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is this: except where a state really does have effective control of territory, it cannot hope to secure Convention rights within that territory and, unless it is within the area of the Council of Europe, it is unlikely in any event to find certain of the Convention rights it is bound to secure reconcilable with the customs of the resident population.  Indeed it goes further than that.  During the period in question here it is common ground that the UK was an occupying power in Southern Iraq and bound as such by Geneva IV and by the Hague Regulations.  Article 43 of the Hague Regulations provides that the occupant "shall take all the measures in his power to restore and ensure, as far as possible, public order and safety, while respecting, unless absolutely prevented, the laws in force in the country."  The appellants argue that occupation within the meaning of the Hague Regulations necessarily involves the occupant having effective control of the area and so being responsible for securing there all Convention rights and freedoms.  So far as this being the case, however, the occupants' obligation is to respect "the laws in force", not to introduce laws and the means to enforce them (for example, courts and a justice system) such as to satisfy the requirements of the Convention.  Often (for example where Sharia law is in force) Convention rights would clearly be incompatible with the laws of the territory occupied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;130.&nbsp;&nbsp;Realistically the concept of the indivisibility of the Convention presents no problem in the categories of cases discussed in paras 119-126 above: these concern highly specific situations raising only a limited range of Convention rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;131.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my judgment <i>Issa</i> should not be read as detracting in any way from the clear—and clearly restrictive—approach to article 1 jurisdiction adopted in <i>Bankovic.</i>  I recognise that in two later decisions other chambers of the Court have, as so commonly occurs in Strasbourg judgments, repeated the substance of para 71 of <i>Issa.</i>  But in neither of them does there appear to have been any relevant argument on the reach of article 1.  <i>Isaak v Turkey </i>(Application No 44587) (unreported) 28 September 2006 concerned the death of a demonstrator through the actions of Turkish protesters and police in the UN buffer zone separating northern Cyprus from the south.  The Court held (at page 20) that "Turkey's jurisdiction must be considered to extend to securing the entire range of substantive rights set out in the Convention and those additional protocols which she has ratified, and that violations of those rights are imputable to Turkey."  <i>Ben El Mahi v Denmark </i>(Application No 5853/06) (unreported) 11 December 2006 concerned the publication in Denmark of cartoons allegedly breaching the Moroccan applicants' article 9 rights.  The application was unsurprisingly ruled inadmissible on the ground that there was no "jurisdictional link" between the respondent state and the applicants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;132.&nbsp;&nbsp;Taken as a whole, therefore, and according particular weight to Grand Chamber judgments, so far from weakening the principles established in <i>Bankovic</i>, subsequent Strasbourg case law to my mind reinforces them.  Certainly, whatever else may be said of the Strasbourg jurisprudence, it cannot be said to establish clearly that any of the first five appellants come within the UK's article 1 jurisdiction.  As for the sixth case, I for my part would recognise the UK's jurisdiction over Mr Mousa only on the narrow basis found established by the Divisional Court, essentially by analogy with the extra-territorial exception made for embassies (an analogy recognised too in <i>Hess v United Kingdom</i> (1975) 2 DR 72, a Commission decision in the context of a foreign prison which had itself referred to the embassy case of <i>X v Federal Republic of Germany</i>).  In the light of those conclusions as to the reach of the Convention I come now to the Human Rights Act 1998.</p>
<i><p><i>The reach of the Human Rights Act</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;133.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I respectfully disagree with the conclusion reached by my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill on this issue, I am in agreement with much of what he says in the course of his consideration of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;134.&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree, of course, that there is a distinction between rights arising under the Convention and rights created by the Act by reference to the Convention.  A plain illustration of this arises from the temporal limitations imposed by the Act: its non-retrospectivity as established in <i>In re McKerr</i> [2004] 1 WLR 807.   Another illustration is the Act's non-applicability in article 56 cases.  Consider <i>R (Quark Fishing Ltd) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs</i> [2006] 1 AC 529, discussed by Lord Bingham at paras 18-20.  Even had the UK extended article 1 of the First Protocol to "SGSSI", no claim would have been available against the Secretary of State under the Act although the UK would clearly have been liable internationally for any breach.  It is for the dependent territory's own legislation to give effect to Convention rights, just as for Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;135.&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree too with Lord Bingham's main conclusion upon the many detailed arguments addressed to the House on the language of the Act:  that none of the suggested textual indications compellingly favour either side.  For my part, indeed, I find no real force in any of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;136.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also share Lord Bingham's view about the limited relevance of <i>Quark</i> in the present context: it cannot be treated as reliable authority on the particular point here at issue, although undoubtedly there are dicta in the case favouring the appellants.  Nor is any real assistance to be derived from <i>R (European Roma Rights Centre) v Immigration Officer at Prague Airport (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees intervening)</i> [2005] 2 AC 1 or from <i>R (Carson) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions </i>[2006] 1 AC 173<i>  </i>(the cases mentioned at para 21 of Lord Bingham's opinion).  Nor is either party assisted by the statements in the White Paper or by the Bill's promoters during its passage through Parliament.  Nor is there any comparability between the Crown's case in <i>McKerr</i> based on the presumption against retrospectivity and that advanced by the Crown here based on the presumption against extra-territoriality: as Lord Bingham points out at para 22, the decision in <i>McKerr</i> was centred on section 22(4) of the Act and there is no corresponding provision dealing with the Act's territorial scope.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;137.&nbsp;&nbsp;How, then, should the presumption against extra-territoriality—the presumption that, unless the contrary intention appears from the "language", "object", "subject-matter" or "history" of the enactment (see <i>Maxwell</i> <i>on The Interpretation of Statutes</i> quoted by Lord Bingham at para 11 of his opinion), Parliament does not intend a statute to operate beyond the territorial limits of the UK—apply in the case of the Human Rights Act?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;138.&nbsp;&nbsp;The object, subject-matter and history of this Act all seem to me highly relevant to this question.  It cannot simply be treated as just another domestic statute.  Rather it is focused upon the Convention (although not, of course, incorporating it), its very purpose being to ensure that, from the date it took effect, it would no longer be necessary for victims to complain about alleged violations of the Convention internationally in Strasbourg instead of domestically in the UK.  It is less than obvious that Parliament would have wanted to confine its effect rigidly within the borders of the UK rather than allow it to extend also to the handful of cases where Strasbourg recognises an extra-territorial reach for the Convention itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;139.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 6 of the Human Rights Act makes it unlawful for a "public authority" to "act" in a way incompatible with "a Convention right".  There can be no doubt that a "public authority" means a public authority of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, just as the "legislation" referred to in sections 3 and 6 of the Act means legislation enacted in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  It is not, however, suggested that the claimant (the alleged victim) need be present in the UK (let alone a British citizen) nor that the decision complained of need have been taken in the United Kingdom (consider, for example, a decision taken by a minister travelling abroad).  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;140.&nbsp;&nbsp;What object would be served by construing and applying the Act so that Convention rights only take effect within the territory of the UK i.e. only where the result of the violation is actually felt within the UK?  Suppose British police were responsible for a forcible extradition (as in the <i>Öcalan</i> line of cases), or that British Embassy officials were wrongly to refuse diplomatic asylum (as was asserted but not substantiated in <i>R (B) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs</i> [2005] QB 643), or that British judges were to sit as such overseas (as asserted in respect of French judges in <i>Drozd</i> and as Scottish judges in fact did sit in Holland on the <i>Lockerbie</i> case).  Or suppose that Corporal Payne, who pleaded guilty to ill-treating Mr Mousa and has recently been sentenced to a year's imprisonment, had instead been court-martialled in Iraq.  What good reason could there be for requiring any human rights complaints arising in any of these situations (article 6 complaints, for example, in the last two cases) to be taken to Strasbourg rather than brought under the Act?  Similarly, surely, in the case of the sixth appellant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;141.&nbsp;&nbsp;The essential rationale underlying the presumption against extra-territoriality is that ordinarily it is inappropriate for one sovereign legislature to intrude upon the preserve of another.  As Lord Hoffmann recently observed in <i>Lawson v Serco Ltd</i> [2006]  ICR 250, 254: </p>
<p></p><ul>"The United Kingdom rarely purports to legislate for the whole world. . . . [U]sually such an exorbitant exercise of legislative power would be both ineffectual and contrary to the comity of nations."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was accordingly there decided that section 94(1) of the Employment Rights Act 1996—which provides that: "An employee has the right not to be unfairly dismissed by his employer"—"must have implied territorial limits".  Recognising the difficulty of saying exactly what those limits are and that "the question of territorial scope is not straightforward", Lord Hoffmann said that in principle the question is always one of construction.  As to this he cited Lord Wilberforce's speech in <i>Clark v Oceanic Contractors Inc</i> [1983] 2 AC 130, 152, saying that the question "requires an inquiry to be made as to the person with respect to whom Parliament is presumed, in the particular case, to be legislating.  Who, it is to be asked, is within the legislative grasp, or intendment, of the statute under consideration?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;142.&nbsp;&nbsp;In that case section 94(1)'s "legislative grasp" was held to extend to an employee summarily dismissed from his employment at an MoD military establishment in Germany.  Why then should the Human Rights Act's legislative grasp not extend to encompass a human rights complaint arising out of such employment abroad and, indeed, such other few categories of claimants as the Strasbourg jurisprudence suggests to be within the UK's article 1 jurisdiction? </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;143.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already acknowledged that the House's decision in <i>Quark</i> cannot be regarded as reliable authority on the present question given that it was not directly in issue there.  It is nonetheless noteworthy that in Lord Nicholls' view (at para 34) "the territorial scope of the obligations and rights created by sections 6 and 7 of the Act was intended to be co-extensive with the territorial scope of the obligations of the United Kingdom and the rights of victims under the Convention."  In <i>Quark</i>, moreover, no adverse comment was made about the Court of Appeal's decision in <i>B</i> which had been cited to the House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;144.&nbsp;&nbsp;As to <i>B</i> itself, the decision of a strong Court of Appeal which <i>is</i> directly in point, again it seems to me noteworthy that the Court "reached the conclusion that the Human Rights Act 1998 requires public authorities of the United Kingdom to secure those Convention rights defined in section 1 of the Act within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom as that jurisdiction has been identified by the Strasbourg Court."  (para 79).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;145.&nbsp;&nbsp;True it is, as Lord Bingham points out at para 17, that in reaching that conclusion the Court relied strongly on section 3 of the Act which (and again I agree with Lord Bingham) cannot properly be used to determine the reach of the Act—see in this regard the House's recent decision in <i>R (Hurst) v London Northern District Coroner</i> [2007] 2 WLR 726, 741 at paras 43 and 44.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;146.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, however, be hesitant about accepting Lord Bingham's wider statement at para 15 (2) that section 3 was not intended to be used (implicitly, in any circumstances) in construing the Act itself.  Take the case of <i>Cream Holdings Ltd v Banerjee</i>, concerning the correct interpretation of section 12(3) of the 1998 Act.  Certainly each of the judgments in the Court of Appeal proceeded on the basis that section 3 could be invoked to arrive at a construction compatible with Convention rights ([2003] Ch 650, at paras 55, 83 and 129).  And in the only reasoned speech in the House of Lords Lord Nicholls too, albeit without express mention of section 3, concluded his discussion of the correct approach to section 12(3) with the comment that "this interpretation of section 12(3) is Convention-compliant" ([2005] 1 AC 253, 262, para 23).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;147.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst, however, I agree with Lord Bingham that section 3 is not available to the Court as an interpretative tool to secure compliance with the UK's obligations under international law (as opposed to its obligations under domestic law—which depend upon the true construction of the Act without reference to section 3), I respectfully take a different view as to the application here of the presumption considered by Lord Bingham at para 12.  Diplock LJ in <i>Salomon v Commissioners of Customs and Excise </i>[1967] 2 QB 116, 144 referred to this as "a <i>prima facie</i> presumption that Parliament does not intend to act in breach of international law, including therein specific treaty obligations".  Certainly the UK undertook no <i>specific treaty obligation </i> to incorporate the Convention into domestic law; the Strasbourg Court has said that many times.  Article 13 does, however, impose upon the UK an international law obligation to afford "everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated . . . an effective remedy before a national authority".  As the Court explained in <i>James v United Kingdom</i> (1986)  8 EHRR 123, 158-159: </p>
<p></p><ul>"Although there is thus no obligation to incorporate the Convention into domestic law, by virtue of article 1 of the Convention the substance of the rights and freedoms set forth must be secured under the domestic legal order, in some form or another, to everyone within the jurisdiction of the contracting states.  Subject to the qualification explained in the following paragraph [the qualification that article 13 does not go so far as to guarantee a remedy allowing a contracting state's laws as such to be challenged before a national authority on the ground of being contrary to the Convention, the qualification which defeated the applicant in the <i>James</i> case itself], article 13 guarantees the availability within the national legal order of an effective remedy to enforce the Convention rights and freedoms in whatever form they may happen to be secured."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;148.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the <i>Observer</i> case and in <i>McCann</i> (both cited by my Lord at para 12) article 13 presented no problem: it had not been breached.  In the <i>Observer</i> case domestic common law, and in <i>McCann</i> the Gibraltar Constitution, enabled the respective complaints to be considered on their merits.  The position, however, was different in <i>Smith and Grady v United Kingdom</i> (1999) 29 EHRR 493.  There article 13 <i>was</i> held to be violated:  "the threshold at which [the domestic courts] could find the Ministry of Defence policy irrational was placed so high that it effectively excluded any consideration by the domestic courts of the question of whether the interference with the applicants' rights answered a pressing social need or was proportionate to the national security and public order aims pursued . . . "  So too article 13 would be found violated here if the Act were held not to apply to Mr Mousa's case: his complaints could not then be considered on their merits under domestic law. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;149.&nbsp;&nbsp;If, therefore, it were necessary to resort to a countervailing presumption to justify construing the Act so as to apply extra-territorially to the limited extent necessary to correspond with the Strasbourg case law on the reach of article 1, I would conclude that the <i>Salomon</i> presumption is indeed available to the appellants here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;150.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only, of course, did <i>B</i> conclude that the Act has extra-territorial application but so too, in fully and carefully reasoned judgments, did both courts below.  In para 301 of its judgment, cited by Lord Bingham at para 25, the Divisional Court found it "counter-intuitive [where article 1 has been given an essentially territorial effect] to expect to find a parliamentary intention that there should be gaps between the scope of the Convention and an Act which was designed to bring rights home".  True, at para 304, the Divisional Court also found it "intuitively difficult to think that Parliament intended to legislate in foreign lands".  But that was in the context of the "effective control of an area" exception.  As foreshadowed in para 103 above, I, like the Divisional Court, am readier to conclude that Parliament intended the Act to operate extra-territorially in a case where article 1 jurisdiction falls within one of the narrow categories of exception established under the Strasbourg case law (as in the sixth appellant's case), than I might be were Strasbourg to construe the reach of the Convention substantially more widely.  Even then I would probably still feel bound to conclude that Parliament intended the Act to have the same extra-territorial effect as the Convention.  Indeed, having now had the advantage of reading in draft the speech prepared by my noble and learned friend Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, I think that likely.  But I would certainly feel less surprised by a suggestion to the contrary.  I do not, however, expect to be faced with this difficulty.  Rather I am confident, the Parliamentary Assembly's exhortation of 24 June 2004 notwithstanding, that the Strasbourg court will continue to maintain the <i>Bankovic</i> approach which seems to me only logical.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;151.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final result I would dismiss the appeals of each of the first five appellants and dismiss too the cross-appeal by the respondent as to the applicability of the Human Rights Act to the sixth appellant's case.  That being so it is agreed between the parties that, in the light of factual developments since the Court of Appeal's order, the sixth appellant's case should be remitted to the Divisional Court to join the other cases which have been stayed for the substantive issues to be decided in the light of up to date evidence and amended pleadings.</p>
