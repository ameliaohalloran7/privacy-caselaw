<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;281.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lindsay J ([2003] 3 All ER 996) made a thorough survey of the developing law of confidentiality.  He noted (para 186) the effect of the Human Rights Act 1998 and referred to Council of Europe Resolution 1165, quoted by the Court of Appeal in <i>A v B Plc</i> [2003]  QB 195, para 11(xii)) that,</p>
<p></p><ul>". . . people's private lives have become a highly lucrative commodity for certain sectors of the media.  The victims are essentially public figures, since details of their private lives serve as a stimulus to sales."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lindsay J went on to hold (paras 196 and 197):</p>
<p></p><ul>". . . that the claimants had here a valuable trade asset, a commodity the value of which depended, in part at least, upon its content at first being kept secret and then of its being made public in ways controlled by Miss Zeta-Jones and Mr Douglas for the benefit of them and of the third claimant.  I quite see that such an approach may lead to a distinction between the circumstances in which equity affords protection to those who seek to manage their publicity as part of their trade or profession and whose private life is a valuable commodity and those whose is not but I am untroubled by that; the law which protects individual confidences and a law of privacy may protect the latter class and provide no reason to diminish protection for the former.  So far as concerns OK!, the right to exclusivity of photographic coverage of the wedding was, in contrast with the nature of the confidence as to the first and second claimants, even more plainly a right in the nature of a trade secret.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>I thus regard photographic representation of the wedding reception as having had the quality of confidence about it.  Of course, the general appearance of both Mr Douglas and Miss Zeta-Jones was no secret; what they looked like was well known to the public.  But that does not deny the quality of commercial confidentiality to what they looked like on the exceptional occasion of their wedding."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge did not to my mind fully explain why he was not troubled by the thought that the persons whom the Council of Europe termed "the victims" were themselves cashing in their "valuable trade asset" in a manner and at a time of their own choosing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;282.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal dealt with this part of the case in a judgment of the Court [2006] QB 125, paras 122-137.  It observed (para 128) that Lindsay J treated information about the wedding "rather as if it were property" when he referred to its being shared between co-owners.  Whether or not there is force in that observation (it is in practice quite difficult to address the subject of confidential information without slipping into metaphorical language literally appropriate only to property rights) it is clear that that is not how OK!'s case is now put.  In fact much of Mr Millett's criticism of the Court of Appeal was for having fallen into precisely the same error—treating confidential information as an item of property—as that for which the Court of Appeal had criticised the judge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;283.&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of the Court of Appeal's reasoning on this part of the case is in para 136:</p>
<p></p><ul>"On analysis, OK!'s complaint is not that Hello! published images which they had been given the exclusive right to publish, but that Hello! published other images, which no one with knowledge of their confidentiality had any right to publish.  The claimants themselves argued that 'the unauthorised photographs were taken at different moments to the authorised ones, showed different and informal incidents at the reception, and were naturally much less posed.'  These photographs invaded the area of privacy which the Douglases had chosen to retain.  It was the Douglases, not OK!, who had the right to protect this area of privacy or confidentiality.  Clause 10 of the OK! contract expressly provided that any rights not expressly granted to OK! were retained by the Douglases."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas the judge saw the arrangement as a sharing of confidentiality in photographic information about the wedding, the Court of Appeal analysed it as the retention (by Mr and Mrs Douglas alone) of part of that information (that is, all except the information in the authorised photographs published by OK!).</p>
<i><p><i>The scope of breach of confidence</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;284.&nbsp;&nbsp;Expressed in these terms, both competing submissions seem to me to be on the way to becoming so abstract as to risk losing touch with reality.  Reality was, if I may respectfully say so, restored when on the third day of the hearing my noble and learned friend Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead observed,</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is not the same, is it, because obviously a picture of the bride looking nice is different from a picture of the bride caught at an unfortunate moment."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Douglases were content to have wedding photos published, for a handsome fee, so long as they had strict control over the selection of the pictures.  This was reflected in the evidence of Miss Zeta-Jones herself, quoted by Lindsay J [2003] 3 All ER 996, para 195:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Both Michael and I are in the business of 'name and likeness.'  Any photographs of us that are published are important to us, not just personally but professionally as well.  People go to see movies specifically because either Michael or I are in them and they have expectations, among other things, of the way we will look.  Those expectations are created to a significant degree by the images they see of us in the media.  Directors take into account the public's perception of actors and actresses when casting for films.  The hard reality of the film industry is that preserving my image, particularly as a woman, is vital to my career."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;285.&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the confidentiality which the Douglases claimed, and which OK! also claims, is of a specialised commercial character, far removed from the sort of intrusion on the privacy of a seriously ill patient which the Court of Appeal considered (but felt unable to remedy) in <i>Kaye v Robertson</i> [1991]  FSR 62.  Their claims come close to claims to a "character right" protecting a celebrity's name and image such as has consistently been rejected in English law: see the <i>Elvis Presley trademarks</i> case [1999] RPC 567, 580-582, 597-598, and also Brooke LJ in the interlocutory appeal in this case, [2001] QB 967, paras 74 and 75.  The present limits of the law of passing off as a protection of a celebrity complaining of "false endorsement" were thoroughly reviewed by Laddie J in <i>Irvine v Talksport</i> [2002]  1 WLR 2355. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;286.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Lindsay J and the Court of Appeal referred to the decision of the High Court of Australia in <i>Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd</i> (2001)  208 CLR 199, a case concerned with the public interest defence to unauthorised and clandestine filming in an abbatoir.  Your Lordships were not referred to the earlier case in the High Court, discussed in the <i>Australian Broadcasting Corporation</i> case, of <i>Victoria Park Racing and Recreation Grounds Co Ltd v Taylor</i> (1937)  58 CLR 479.  In that case the defendant built a platform on his land, which bordered the plaintiff's racecourse, and allowed race commentaries to be broadcast from it.  The plaintiff failed in a claim for an injunction.  The claim was put primarily in the law of nuisance, but confidence and copyright (in the board displaying the numbers of starters and winners) was also relied on.  Latham CJ said (at pp 496-7):</p>
<p></p><ul>"I find difficulty in attaching any precise meaning to the phrase 'property in a spectacle.'  A 'spectacle' cannot be 'owned' in any ordinary sense of that word.  Even if there were any legal principle which prevented one person from gaining an advantage for himself or causing damage to another by describing a spectacle produced by that other person, the rights of the latter person could be described as property only in an metaphorical sense.  Any appropriateness in the metaphor would depend upon the existence of the legal principle.  The principle cannot itself be based upon such a metaphor."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;287.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case the claimants did not claim any quasi-proprietorial rights in the spectacle of the wedding.  They claimed non-proprietorial rights of confidence in wedding photographs as a generic class, regardless of who owned the copyright in those photographs.  English law has (especially in the decision of this House in <i>Campbell v MGN Ltd</i> [2004] 2 AC 457) recognised that there may be something special about photographs, but I think that it is necessary to see how far this approach has gone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;288.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Campbell</i> some of your Lordships mentioned the familiar saying that "a picture is worth a thousand words."  My noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann was rather less enthusiastic about the saying, observing (para 72):</p>
<p></p><ul>"In my opinion a photograph is in principle information no different from any other information.  It <i>may</i> be a more vivid form of information than the written word ('a picture is worth a thousand words'). [emphasis supplied].<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Photographs are in a special position in that if a photograph is a blatant and obviously unjustifiable invasion of personal privacy, its publication by the perpetrator will not give him a "public domain" defence for further publication: see the Court of Appeal's judgment [2006] QB 125, paras 84-90, citing <i>Theakston v MGN Ltd</i> [2002]  EMLR 398, para 68 (Ouseley LJ) and <i>D v L</i> [2004]  EMLR 1, para 23 (Waller LJ).  Photographs are also regarded (despite the ample opportunities for manipulation which modern technology affords) as providing powerful corroboration of written reports of conduct which the person photographed might wish to deny.  But this is not that sort of case.  The world was not in doubt that the Douglases did get married at the Plaza Hotel in New York on 18 November 2000; and the photographs published by Hello! may have been un-posed and un-focused, but none of them was even faintly embarrassing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;289.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Lordships were referred to two interlocutory decisions at first instance in which injunctions were granted to restrain publication of unauthorised photographs of scenes which were claimed to be entitled to commercial confidentiality.  In <i>Shelley Films Ltd v Rex Features Ltd</i> [1994] EMLR 134, a photographer had found his way onto a film set where "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" was being filmed.  It was a high-budget film with several big stars.  There was a conflict of evidence as to whether the photographer evaded security guards and ignored notices forbidding photography.  The claim was put primarily as a breach of copyright in costumes and prosthetic features (especially those of Robert de Niro, the "sharp featured man" who was to be hanged and brought back to life by Frankenstein).  The judge accepted that there was an arguable case on copyright infringement but also considered breach of confidence, and found that the claimant had an arguable case there also.  He seems to have accepted counsel's submission that there was a legitimate interest in the confidentiality of making this film of Mary Shelley's gothic tale, especially (at p139):</p>
<p></p><ul>". . . that Robert de Niro's appearance, mainly as 'the creature' but also as 'the sharp featured man' should be kept secret so as to maintain the interest of the public in one of the essential elements of the film, namely, the appearance of Dr Frankenstein's creation."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was, in the context of a serious film with a $40m budget, not a trivial matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;290.&nbsp;&nbsp;The other case is <i>Creation Records Ltd v News Group Newspapers Ltd.</i> [1997] EMLR 444, in which a photographer had taken pictures (again, with a conflict of evidence as to the circumstances) of a photo shoot for a poster for a forthcoming Oasis album.  The poster was to show a white Rolls Royce apparently emerging from a swimming pool, with the members of the group and various other unrelated objects also in the picture.  The most striking feature of the case, to my mind, is the lengths to which the record company's counsel went in seeking to establish an arguable case as to the infringement of some recognised intellectual property right.  He argued that the Rolls Royce, the group members and the other objects were (i) a dramatic work or (ii) a sculpture or (iii) a collage or (iv) a work of artistic craftsmanship.  So the barrel of intellectual property rights was thoroughly scraped before the judge came to the claim for breach of confidence, which he regarded as arguable.  The judge said at pp454-455,</p>
<p></p><ul>"Mr Garnett argues that, despite all of that, no arguable case is made out for breach of confidence, or indeed for the existence of confidentiality, and says correctly that merely because a well-known person tries to stop people taking photographs of him or her it does not follow that any picture taken in evasion or defiance of those attempts is in breach of confidentiality.  That seems to me to be a perfectly sound proposition but very far from this case."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge went on to stress the evidence as to restrictions on intrusion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;291.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Oasis case the defendants seem not to have relied on Lord Goff's second limiting principle (in <i>Attorney-General v Guardian Newspapers Ltd No. 2</i> [1990] 1 AC 109, 282), that the law of confidence does not protect trivia.  Photographs of a white Rolls Royce in a swimming pool may be thought to be a fairly trivial trade secret.  The argument that information is trivial or anodyne carries much less weight in a case concerned with facts about an individual's private life which he or she reasonably expects to be kept confidential: <i>McKennitt v Ash</i> [2006]  EMLR 10, para 58 (Eady J). </p>
<i><p><i>Conclusions on breach of confidence</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;292.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Attorney General v Guardian Newspapers Ltd (No 2)</i> [1990]  1 AC 109 the law took an important step forward with the holding that an actual, deliberate confiding of private information is not necessary to establishing a cause of action for breach of confidence.  But there would be some danger of that principled and progressive step turning into an uncontrolled and unprincipled explosion if we were to disregard Lord Goff's three limiting factors, of which the first ("the principle of confidentiality only applies to information to the extent that it is confidential") and the second ("it applies neither to useless information, nor to trivia") are potentially relevant to this appeal.  Uncontrolled growth of the law of confidence would also tend to bring incoherence into the law of intellectual property. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;293.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the position is different in other jurisdictions, under English law it is not possible for a celebrity to claim a monopoly in his or her image, as if it were a trademark or brand.  Nor can anyone (whether celebrity or nonentity) complain simply of being photographed.  There must be something more: either that the photographs are genuinely embarrassing (<i>Theakston v MGN Ltd</i> [2002]  EMLR 398) or that their publication involves a misuse of official powers (<i>Hellewell v Chief Constable of Derbyshire</i> [1995]  4 All ER 473) or that they disclose something which merits temporary protection as a commercial secret (<i>Shelley Films Ltd v Rex Features Ltd</i> [1994]  EMLR 134, in which a photograph of Robert De Niro in the guise of Frankenstein's creature would no doubt have been worth a thousand words of description).  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;294.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was nothing embarrassing or offensive about the Hello! photographs of the wedding, apart from the fact that Mr and Mrs Douglas did not want them to be taken, and indeed were contractually bound to do their best to see that they were not taken.  The fact that stringent security arrangements were in place cannot by itself invest the wedding reception with the quality of confidentiality, if it did not otherwise attract it: see the observations of Lloyd J in <i>Creation Records Ltd v News Group Newspapers Ltd</i> [1997]  EMLR 444, 454-455, which I have already quoted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;295.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no cross-appeal by Hello! against the Court of Appeal's dismissal of its appeal challenging the judge's award to the individual claimants, Mr and Mrs Douglas.  That issue is not therefore before your Lordships, and I should not be taken as expressing the view that the judge and the Court of Appeal were wrong about the modest awards of damages made in their favour.  Mr and Mrs Douglas had both a personal and a commercial interest in the matter, even if the two sat uneasily together.  But the interest of OK! was wholly commercial, and its case on breach of confidence must stand or fall on the ground of a right to short-term confidentiality for a trade secret.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;296.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Gilbert v Star Newspaper Co Ltd</i> (1894)  11 TLR 4, W S Gilbert obtained protection for the plot of his forthcoming comic opera, but only until its first night, and in the <i>Shelley Films </i>case it was recognised that the injunction could not continue after the film was released.  In this case, by contrast, the wedding was over before any photographs were published, and the Hello! photographs and the first batch of OK! photographs were published almost simultaneously.  OK! had no intellectual property rights in the Hello! photographs, or in the "spectacle" of the wedding (compare the Australian <i>Victoria Park</i> case and the risible arguments advanced in <i>Creation Records Ltd v News Group Newspapers Ltd</i>).  The appellant's reliance on a generic class of photographic information about the wedding is ingenious, but I share the view of the Court of Appeal that it is unsound.  OK! no more had a monopoly in any possible photograph of the spectacle than it had in the spectacle itself, or in any other event of which it hoped to carry exclusive coverage. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;297.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already noted that neither Lord Nicholls nor Lord Hoffmann regards <i>RCA Corporation v Pollard</i> [1983]  Ch 135 and <i>Isaac Oren v Red Box Toy Factory Ltd</i> [1999]  FSR 785 (both unsuccessful claims by exclusive licensees) as having been wrongly decided.  It would in my opinion be anomalous if the principle in <i>RCA Corporation v Pollard</i> and <i>Isaac Oren v Red Box Toy Factory Ltd</i> were limited to exclusive licences of copyright or other intellectual property rights protected by an exhaustive statutory code, and were not applied to the analogous case of OK!'s exclusive contractual licence in respect of what might loosely be called quasi-copyright (not protected by statute).  In respectful disagreement with Lord Hoffmann I think it would go some way to creating an unorthodox and exorbitant form of intellectual property. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;298.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, my respectful dissent from the views of the majority arises not from any distaste for the modern celebrity world but from my perception (shared, no doubt, by all of us) of the need for consistent and rational development of the law of confidentiality.  My initial inclination was to conclude that Hello! was liable to pay damages to OK! under the "unlawful means" tort.  But in my opinion it would be impossible to reach that conclusion without either overturning <i>RCA Corporation v Pollard</i> or distinguishing it on unsatisfactory grounds.  An exclusive licensee of real intellectual property rights suffers economic loss as a direct result of a bootlegger's activities, but has no cause of action against him because his exclusive licence remains intact as a matter of law.  One reason for the decision was the Court of Appeal's conclusion that there was an exhaustive statutory code.  But another, simpler reason was that the exclusive licence was not destroyed; it was simply made less valuable.  The fact that it was no longer truly exclusive did not alter that conclusion. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;299.&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the licensee's lack of a remedy under the "unlawful means" tort be made good by relying on the law of confidence, even in a case where there is no separate element of unlawful means?  The answer must be (in a case where personal privacy is not an issue) that the law of confidence can be invoked only if the information in question meets the law's requirements for the protection of information that is, in the eyes of the law, confidential.  Lord Hoffmann suggests, in an appeal to economic realities, that if OK! thought that it was worth paying £1m for its "exclusive" contractual right (and Hello! was willing to pay the same price) then there is no reason why there should not be an obligation of confidentiality.  But the confidentiality of any information must depend on its nature, not on its market value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;300.&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, a newspaper or television company might be willing to pay a large sum to the promoter of some important sporting event for the "exclusive" right to all motion pictures and photographs of the event, and it might go to great lengths to publicise its exclusive right (partly to attract custom, and partly in the hope of engaging the law of confidence).  If the event (for instance, figure-skating or show-jumping) was held in a relatively small indoor venue, with tight security, the hoped-for exclusivity might actually be achieved.  If the event was a motor rally or a marathon foot-race held on public roads it would be unachievable (although the newspaper or television company might still make a worthwhile profit).  But in neither case, in my opinion, should the law of confidentiality afford the protection of exclusivity in a spectacle (the term used by the High Court of Australia in <i>Victoria Park Racing and Recreation Grounds Co Ltd v Taylor</i> (1937)  58 CLR 479).  That would stretch the law of confidence from its proper function (in this commercial context, the protection of trade secrets) and would in effect confer on the exclusive licensee a form of property right which the courts have (in cases like <i>RCA Corporation v Pollard</i>) rightly withheld from exclusive licensees of established intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;301.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore dismiss all three appeals. </p>
<p><b>BARONESS HALE OF RICHMOND</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;302.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have read your lordships' opinions with admiration. On many issues, in particular the general shape of the economic torts, there is complete agreement. On three issues, there is disagreement. On two of these, I agree with the conclusions and reasoning of my noble and learned friend, Lord Hoffmann: these are "what should count as unlawful means" in the tort of causing economic loss by unlawful means and "what should count as a secret" in the law of breach of confidence. On the third issue, the application of the tort of conversion to contractual rights of action, I agree with the conclusions and reasoning of my noble and learned friend, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;303.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first two issues, Lord Hoffmann's view is shared by a majority. The least said by the rest of us who take the same view, therefore, the better. There should be no doubt, and no room for argument, about what has been decided and why. Any perceived inconsistency between what I say and what he says is to be resolved in favour of the latter. Indeed, there would be much to be said for our adopting the practice of other supreme courts in having a single majority opinion to which all have contributed and all can subscribe without further qualification or explanation. There would be less grist to the advocates' and academics' mills, but future litigants might thank us for that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;304.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third issue, on the other hand, Lord Nicholls and I are in the minority. I can do less harm, therefore, by contributing my own twopenn'orth to the debate. Once again, however, any perceived inconsistency between what I say and what he says is to be resolved in his favour. As my noble and learned friend, Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe, acknowledges, Lord Nicholls makes a powerful case. Peter Gibson LJ reached the conclusion that such a development was not open to the Court of Appeal "with regret": see [2005] QB 762, at 778, para 58. Carnwath LJ's "initial instinct" was also "that the receivers should be strictly liable for all the consequences of their unlawful appropriation of the business, by analogy with the long-established principles applied to unlawful receiverships under the law of trespass and conversion": <i>ibid</i>, 799, para 115.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;305.&nbsp;&nbsp;For those of us who share that general view, the question is whether this is simply the development of established principles of the common law to meet the demands of the modern world or whether it is a more radical step which should be left to Parliament. The great strength of the common law is that the judges are free to develop it on a case by case basis as new factual situations arise. There comes a point when, as Scrutton LJ once said, "If there is no authority for this it is time that we made one": see <i>Ellerman Lines Ltd v Read </i>[1928] 2 KB 144, 152. But on what basis do the judges decide to make authority where there was none before? Or to modify or adapt such authority as there is? There is no easy answer to this. Whatever we do must be consistent with the underlying principles and policy of the law. It must not overstep that indefinable line between the development and elaboration of existing principles and the making of brand new law which is unquestionably the province of Parliament. It must work with, rather than against, the grain of legal policy. It must go forward when the law is going forward and draw back when the law is drawing back. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;306.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I have no difficulty with the first two issues. The underlying rationale of both the <i>Lumley v Gye </i>2 E &amp; B 216 and the unlawful means torts is the same: the defendant is deliberately striking at his target through a third party. But the means used to strike must be unlawful: see <i>Allen v Flood</i> [1898] AC 1. They may either be a wrong committed by the third party against the target or be a wrong committed by the defendant against the third party. But the rules governing each are different: in particular, the intention is different and the damage procured is different. Nevertheless, the common thread is striking through a third party who might otherwise be doing business with your target, whether by buying his goods, hiring his barges or working for him or whatever. The refinement proposed by my noble and learned friend, Lord Hoffmann, is entirely consistent with the underlying principles to be deduced from the decided cases. It is also consistent with legal policy to limit rather than to encourage the expansion of liability in this area. In the modern age, Parliament has shown itself more than ready to legislate to draw the line between fair and unfair trade competition or between fair and unfair trade union activity. This can involve major economic and social questions which are often politically sensitive and require more complicated answers than the courts can devise. Such things are better left to Parliament. The common law need do no more than draw the lines that it might be expected to draw: procuring an actionable wrong between the third party and the target or committing an actionable (in the sense explained by Lord Hoffmann at para 49 above) wrong against the third party inhibiting his freedom to trade with the target.  I too have found the discussion by my former colleague, Hazel Carty, in <i>An Analysis of the Economic Torts</i>, chapter 5, most helpful.</p>
