<p class="para">88.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because so much of the argument before the Tribunal, the Court of Appeal, and this House, turned on the application of what is known as the <i>Pointe Gourde </i>principle, to which I shall have to revert, it would be convenient if I were at this point to quote its classic formulation: “It is well settled that compensation for the compulsory acquisition of land cannot include an increase in value which is entirely due to the scheme underlying the acquisition": <i>Pointe Gourde Quarrying and Transport Co,  Ltd v Sub-Intendent of Crown Lands</i> [1947] AC 656, 572, per Lord MacDermott (PC). There is a valuable survey of the principle, its antecedents and its subsequent use in Law Commission, <i>Towards a Compulsory Purchase Code: (I) Compensation</i>, Cm 6071 (2003), App D, prepared when Carnwath J was Chairman of the Law Commission.</p>
<p class="para">89.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some elementary principles of the law of compensation for compulsory acquisition provide a starting point. First, the underlying principle is that fair compensation should be given to the owner claimant whose land has been compulsorily taken.  The aim of compensation is to provide a fair financial equivalent for the land taken. The owner is entitled to be compensated fairly and fully for his loss, but the owner is not entitled to receive more than fair compensation: <i>Director of Buildings and Lands v Shun Fung Ironworks Limited </i>[1995] 2 AC 111, at 125 (PC); <i>Waters v Welsh Development Agency </i>[2004] UKHL 19, [2004] 1 WLR 1304 at [4].</p>
<p class="para">90.&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the basis of compensation is the value to the owner, and not its value to the public authority. In the first edition of Cripps (later Lord Parmoor), <i>Principles of the Law of Compensation</i>, 1881 it was said (at 144):</p>
<p class="qt">“The basis on which all compensation for lands required or taken should be assessed, is their value to the owner, and not their value when taken to the promoters.  The question is not, what the persons who take the land will gain by taking it; but what the person from whom it is taken will lose, by having it taken from him.”</p>
<p class="para">91.&nbsp;&nbsp;The classic example mentioned by Cripps is <i>Stebbing v Metropolitan Board of Works</i> (1870) LR 6 QB 37, 42 where Cockburn CJ said that it was intended that the landowner should be compensated to the extent of his loss and “his loss shall be tested by what was the value of the thing to him, not by what will be its value to the persons acquiring it.”</p>
<p class="para">92.&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, and directly in point on this appeal, one plainly relevant element in the value to the owner is the prospect of exploiting the property. I have already mentioned <i>R v Brown </i>(1867) LR 2 QB 630, in which Cockburn CJ (at 631) said that the jury assessing compensation under the 1845 Act had to consider “the real value of the land, and may take into account not only the present purpose to which the land is applied, but also any other more beneficial purpose to which in the course of events at no remote period it may be applied, just as an owner might do if he were bargaining with a purchaser in the market.” </p>
<p class="para">93.&nbsp;&nbsp;As Cripps, <i>Principles of the Law of Compensation</i>, put it in the first edition, 1881, p.153:</p>
<p class="qt">“The present value of lands is enhanced by the probability of their more profitable use, and the assessment of compensation should be made on the potential, as well as on the actual value of lands to the owner.  When lands used for agriculture are suitable for building purposes, this is necessarily an important element in their value, and a matter for which the owner should be compensated. …”</p>
<p class="para">94.&nbsp;&nbsp;The same point was made more elaborately, when the Privy Council said (through Lord Romer) in <i>Gajapatiraju v Revenue Divisional Officer, Vizagapatam</i> [1939] AC 302, 313:</p>
<p class="qt">“[T]he land is not to be valued merely by reference to the use to which it is being put at the time at which its value has to be determined … but also by reference to the uses to which it is reasonably capable of being put in the future … No one can suppose in the case of land which is certain, or even likely, to be used in the immediate or reasonably near future for building purposes, but which at the valuation date is waste land or is being used for agricultural purposes, that the owner, however willing a vendor, will be content to sell the land for its value as waste or agricultural land. It is plain that, in ascertaining its value, the possibility of its being used for building purposes would have to be taken into account. It is equally plain, however, that the land must not be valued as though it had already been built upon … [I]t is the possibilities of the land and not its realized possibilities that must be taken into consideration.</p>
<p class="para">But how is the increase accruing to the value of the land by reason of its potentialities or possibilities to be measured? In the case instanced above of land possessing the possibility of being used for building purposes, the arbitrator … would probably have before him evidence of the prices paid, in the neighbourhood, for land immediately required for such purposes. He would then have to deduct from the value so ascertained such a sum as he would think proper by reason of the possibility that the land might never be so required or might not be so required for a considerable time.”</p>
<p class="para">95.&nbsp;&nbsp;I emphasise that the reference is to “possibilities of the land and not its realized possibilities", and that a deduction would have to be made to take account of the fact that the land might not be required for building or might not be required for a considerable time. This is a powerful confirmation of a principled approach to valuation. There is no reason why the same principles should not apply when the modern law of town planning is factored in. It is elementary that the price which the land in question might reasonably be expected to fetch on the open market at the valuation date would be expected to reflect whatever development potential the land has:<i> Mon Tresor &amp; Mon Desert Ltd v Ministry of Housing and Lands </i>[2008] UKPC 31, [2008] 3 EGLR 13, at [27], per Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood.</p>
<i><p class="para">The present case</p></i>
<p class="para">96.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is common ground that none of the statutory assumptions in the 1961 Act relating to planning permission applied. For convenience I repeat what I consider to be the crucial provisions in the 1961 Act.</p>
<p class="para">97.&nbsp;&nbsp;By Rule (2) of section 5 “The value of land shall …be taken to be the amount which the land if sold in the open market by a willing seller might be expected to realise.” By section 9, no account is to be taken of any depreciation of the value of the land which is attributable to the fact that an indication has been given that the relevant land is to be acquired by an authority possessing compulsory purchase powers. Section 14(3) provides that it is not to be assumed that planning permission would necessarily be refused for any development which is not development for which the granting of planning permission is to be assumed under the 1961 Act. This underlines the point that, whether or not the case can be brought within any of the specific provisions, it is open to a claimant to seek to persuade the Tribunal that the value of the site would have been enhanced by a permission, or the prospect of a permission, for some valuable development.</p>
<p class="para">98.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tribunal concluded, on the balance of probability, that planning permission would have been granted for the specified redevelopment of the land but for the scheme of acquisition and that the permission would have existed at the valuation date. The Tribunal expressed the finding of fact in various ways.   It said: “there was a reasonable prospect of planning permission being obtained for the development” ([88]); “the prospects of obtaining planning permission at the valuation date would have been good” ([89]); “there was a strong likelihood that the … scheme as proposed would have gained consent if an application had been made at the valuation date” ([133]); “a good chance of getting permission for the scheme that has been the subject of the residual valuation  …” ([134])  and the conclusion was expressed “on the basis that planning permission for a mixed use development would have been granted at the valuation date, which we find on the facts to be the case” ([135(a)]). These formulations are different ways of putting the same point, namely that, on the balance of probability, permission for mixed-use development would have been granted as at the valuation date. There is no basis for any suggestion that the Tribunal found that permission would certainly have been granted.</p>
<p class="para">99.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of this finding of fact, it seems to me to be plain on the basis of the statutory provisions and of authority going back more than 100 years, which is entirely in accordance with commercial common sense, that (a) the value of the land is the open market value; (b) any depression in the price which the land might be expected to fetch which is caused by the scheme is to be disregarded; (c) the valuation must take into account the potential of the land, including its potential for development; and (d) the development potential must be valued in the normal way, by discounting for future uncertainties. If that is right, it provides a clear answer to the question on this appeal, namely that the valuation on the “hope value” basis is the appropriate one.</p>
<p class="para">100.&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, then, did the Tribunal and the Court of Appeal come to a different conclusion?</p>
<i><p class="para">The Tribunal</p></i>
<p class="para">101.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tribunal decided that the land should be valued on the assumption that permission would actually have been obtained. The essence of the decision was that the 1961 Act makes provision for compensation to be assessed in certain circumstances on the assumption that planning permission has been granted, and that even though those statutory assumptions did not in terms apply, authorities in the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council established that the Tribunal could apply them by analogy.</p>
<p class="para">102.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tribunal considered, first, that the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> principle could be applied as an adjunct to the statutory provisions relating to assumed planning permissions, with the result that for valuation purposes it could be assumed that planning permission would be granted even if the statutory assumptions did not apply. Second, it thought that that conclusion was supported by the decision of the Privy Council in <i>Melwood Units Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Main Roads</i> [1979] AC 426 (PC) and of the Court of Appeal in <i>Jelson Ltd v Blaby District Council</i> [1977] 1 WLR 1020, each of which (according to the Tribunal) proceeded on the basis of assumed planning permission; and <i>Porter v Secretary of State for Transport</i> [1996] 3 All ER 693, which proceeded on the basis of a percentage chance of obtaining planning permission, was distinguishable because it was a case of a claim under the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965, section 7, for severance and/or injurious affection of the retained land. Third, the Tribunal took the view that <i>Jelson Ltd v Blaby District Council </i>was binding authority for the proposition that section 9 of the 1961 Act had the result that planning permission should be assumed. To restrict compensation to a value based on hope value alone where the evidence showed that permission would have been granted would not be fair compensation.</p>
<i><p class="para">The Court of Appeal</p></i>
<p class="para">103.&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasoning of the Court of Appeal dismissing an appeal from the decision of the Tribunal was as follows. First, the resolution of the issue depended on the correct application of the <i>Pointe Gourde </i>rule.  Second, the Tribunal was right to find that <i>Porter v Secretary of State for Transport</i> [1996] 3 All ER 693 did not assist. Third, the law did not offer a single solution to the standard of proof for establishing hypothetical events and policy considerations were an important factor. Fourth, the Tribunal’s approach was supported by <i>Melwood Units Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Main Roads</i> and <i>Jelson Ltd v Blaby District Council</i>, although the Court of Appeal accepted that there was no reasoned binding authority on the issue<i>. </i>The Court of Appeal concluded:</p>
<p class="qt">“65…. First and foremost, the 1961 Act is intended to provide a statutory code, in which … there is apparent a legislative intention to assimilate the various versions of the rule.  It is accepted that, where the statutory assumptions apply, probability of a permission is converted into full value for valuation purposes.   … [T]he claimant was unable to take advantage of the statutory assumptions because of an anomaly in the provisions fixing the date of consideration.  As far as possible, we would interpret the no-scheme rule so as to remedy the anomaly rather than extend it.  Further, reflecting the same point, it is plainly desirable that there should be consistency in the assessment of compensation for compulsory acquisition of land in materially similar cases, whether or not the statutory assumptions apply.</p>
<p class="qt">66.  The statutory policy reflects the common assumption and practice of tribunals, courts, practitioners and valuers.  That policy and practice has obvious merit in simplifying the task of valuation for the purpose of assessing compensation.  In doing so, it reduces the likelihood of disputes and litigation, it promotes compromise, and will save costs both in and out of court.</p>
<p class="qt">67.  In our view there is no anomaly in giving a hope value in cases where there would have been a possibility, but less than a probability, of planning permission.  It is one thing, in the interests of consistency and simplicity, to assume the grant of planning permission when it would probably have been granted.  It is quite a different thing to deprive the land owner of any hope value when such value would have been reflected in the market even though planning permission was improbable.  To exclude such value would be contrary to the fundamental principles of assessment of compensation under the 1961 Act.</p>
<p class="qt">68.  In our view, the policy considerations in favour of the tribunal’s conclusion are powerful.  For the reasons we have given, there is no authority or other good reason for not giving effect to them ….”</p>
<p class="para">104.&nbsp;&nbsp;In substance what the Court of Appeal did was to apply the <i>Pointe Gourde </i>principle to fill what it perceived to be an anomaly or gap in the legislation caused (at least in this case) by the fact that the critical date for the section 17 application by virtue of section 22(2)(a) was the date in the autumn of 1993 when statutory notice was first published of the making of the London Underground (East London Line Extension) Order. As I have said, at that time there would have been little prospect of obtaining planning permission for a mixed use development.</p>
<i><p class="para">The authorities relied on by the Tribunal </p></i>
<i><p class="paraleft">Jelson Ltd v Blaby District Council </p></i>
<p class="para">105.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jelson Ltd owned land on the route of a proposed ring road round Leicester. Land on either side of the road was shown in the development plan as allocated primarily for residential purposes. Jelson (and Wimpeys) built large housing estates adjoining the proposed ring road. In 1962, because of the construction of the M1, the ring road project was abandoned. After planning permission to build houses on the site of the former proposed ring road was refused, the Council was forced to acquire the strip of land that had been reserved for it pursuant to a purchase notice. Jelson sought a section 17 certificate for residential development. On appeal the Minister issued a “nil certificate” (i.e. a certificate under section 17(4)(b) that permission would not have been granted for development other than the development for which the land was compulsorily acquired). He did so on the basis that the correct time at which to consider whether planning permission might reasonably have been expected to be granted was the date of the deemed notice to treat. At that time housing estates had been built on either side of the proposed road. Although it was a fair assumption that but for the ring road proposal the strip of land in question would have been included in the housing estates, at the section 17 determination date planning permission would not have been obtained for residential housing on the strip. It was held by the Court of Appeal in <i>Jelson Ltd v Minister of Housing and Local Government </i>[1970] 1 QB 243<i> </i>that the Minister’s approach to the time at which the determination was to be made was right as a result of the combined effect of sections 17(4) and 22(2) of the 1961 Act.</p>
<p class="para">106.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Jelson Ltd v Blaby District Council</i> [1977] 1 WLR 1020 was an appeal from the Tribunal on the claim for compensation for the deemed compulsory purchase of land following the purchase notice. There were three agreed alternative valuations between the parties on the amount of compensation. The first was on the assumption that any decrease in value due to the effect of the road scheme was to be ignored and consequently that the land would have been developed as part of the neighbouring estate, which gave a figure of £60,000. The second was on the assumption that planning permission could reasonably have been expected to be granted for a 31 unit residential development, which gave a loss of £26,350. The third was an assumption that at the date of valuation there was no prospect of planning permission being granted for residential development but that there was some “hope value", which gave a figure of £6,700. The second basis was rejected by the Tribunal, on the ground that planning permission for that layout could not have been reasonably expected, or indeed expected at all: (1974) 28 P &amp; CR 450, at 459. The Tribunal found for the first method because the valuation exercise was to be approached on the basis that there had been no road scheme and said (quoted at [1977] 1 WLR at 1025): “… if the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> principle does not require a diminution in value entirely due to the scheme underlying the acquisition to be left out of account, section 9 of the Act of 1961 provides the analogous principle … in rather wider terms than the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> principle is usually expressed.”</p>
<p class="para">107.&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal: [1977] 1 WLR 1020.  Lord Denning MR, with whom Stephenson and Waller LJJ agreed, said (at 1027):  “The position is, to my mind, that there is a depreciation here which is covered both by the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> principle and by section 9 of the Land Compensation Act 1961.” In <i>Fletcher Estates Ltd v Secretary of State</i> [2000] 2 AC 307 this House left open the “wider issues” raised by<i> Jelson Ltd v Blaby District Council</i>, namely whether the 1961 Act required the question whether planning permission would have been granted for any classes of alternative development to be determined by reference to events which might or might not have happened in the past if the proposal had not come into existence: [2000] 2 AC at 325, per Lord Hope of Craighead.</p>
<p class="para">108.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case the Tribunal considered that since none of the statutory assumptions as to planning permission could have applied on the facts of <i>Jelson Ltd v Blaby District Council</i> so as to give rise to an assumption of permission for residential development, it is necessarily implicit in the conclusion of the Court of Appeal that, applying <i>Pointe Gourde</i>, it was appropriate to assume the grant of such planning permission.</p>
<p class="para">109.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not agree. The point was not discussed or considered, and the parties proceeded on the basis that planning permission would have been granted at the relevant date had there been no road scheme. The existing houses were built facing the proposed ring road. Jelson made the application in accordance with a layout previously agreed with the county planning officer and an official of the acquiring authority, but the application was refused because of objections of the residents in the housing estates who said that their houses were built with the advantage of facing on to the ring road, The evidence was that, but for the road scheme and the building of the housing estates, permission would actually have been obtained for the building of housing estates including the strip. This decision did not justify the conclusion by the Tribunal that it was authority for the proposition that the grant of planning permission is to be assumed once it is shown that it would probably have been granted.</p>

<p class="para">110.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor is <i>Melwood Units Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Main Roads</i> [1979] AC 426 (PC) such an authority. A developer had acquired 37 acres of land in Brisbane. Two areas of the land, totalling 4 acres, were subject to an expressway proposal which would have the effect of severing the land, leaving 25 acres to the north and about 7 acres to the south. The developer sought planning permission for development of the 37 acres as a drive-in shopping centre and parking space, but the application was treated as an application for planning permission for the 25 acres only, and permission was granted on that basis. The land for the expressway was compulsorily acquired. The developer claimed compensation for the value of the acquired 4 acres and for loss due to the severance of the 7 acres to the south.</p>
<p class="para">111.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Land Appeal Court in Queensland awarded compensation on the basis that the land acquired and the land to the south never had any potential as part of a shopping centre. The Full Court of the Supreme Court of Queensland declined to answer questions in the case stated by the Land Appeal Court. The Privy Council held that the proceedings should be remitted to the Land Appeal Court. The principal issue was whether the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> principle as a whole could apply to a decrease in value caused by the scheme. The conclusion was (at 435):</p>
<p class="qt">“… it is a part of the common law deriving as a matter of principle from the nature of compensation for… compulsory acquisition, that neither relevantly attributable appreciation nor depreciation in value is to be regarded in the assessment of land compensation.”</p>
<p class="para">112.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is plain from the decision that the evidence was that permission would have been granted. The Privy Council accepted “as findings of fact … that but for the expressway project and its impact on the 37 acres an application to develop the whole area for a drive-in shopping centre with ancillary parking area would have been granted by the registration board, including the resumed land and south land” (at 433) and said that “it is established that, without the expressway project, .. planning permission would have been given for the whole 37 acres” (at 434).</p>
<p class="para">113.&nbsp;&nbsp;The questions in the case stated included a question whether the Land Appeal Court should have assessed compensation on the basis that, but for the compulsory acquisition, planning permission “would or would probably have been granted” for the whole of the 37 acres, and the Privy Council answered “yes” to that question: [1979] AC at 438. But the Privy Council said (ibid.) that the answers by themselves “may not serve any very useful purpose” and adopted the developer’s formulation of the questions. The developer’s formulation was that the assessment should proceed on the basis that there was no expressway proposal and that “planning permission would have been obtainable” for the whole site. The Privy Council concluded that the developer’s formulation was not substantially different from its own answers, and was prepared to adopt it: at 439.</p>
<p class="para">114.&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, neither <i>Jelson Ltd v Blaby District Council</i> nor <i>Melwood Units Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Main Roads </i>proceeds on the basis that once a landowner has shown on the balance of probabilities that permission would have been granted, it will be assumed that it would have been obtained. There was no persuasive, still less binding, authority to that effect.</p>
<i></i><p class="para"><i>Porter v Secretary of State for Transport</i> </p>
<p class="para">115.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore not necessary to discuss at length <i>Porter v Secretary of State for Transport</i> [1996] 3 All ER 693, which the Tribunal and the Court of Appeal were at pains to distinguish. In that decision land had been acquired for a road. The plaintiff was granted on appeal under section 18 of the 1961 Act a certificate of appropriate alternative development in respect of the land acquired, namely that the land acquired would have been suitable for residential development. Among the questions for the Court of Appeal was whether the section 18 determination was res judicata or gave rise to an issue estoppel so as to bind the Tribunal in determining compensation for diminution in the value of land retained by the plaintiff under the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965, section 7. By a majority (Peter Gibson LJ dissenting on this point) it was held that the section 18 determination did not have that effect because (among other reasons) the question in the section 18 determination and the question in the 1965 Act proceedings were different. </p>
<p class="para">116.&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Tribunal had to assess was the diminution in value, if any, of the retained land. Stuart-Smith LJ (with whom Peter Gibson and Thorpe LJJ agreed) said (([1996] 3 All ER 693 at 704):</p>
<p class="qt">“Where a court or tribunal has to decide what would have happened in a hypothetical situation which does not exist, it usually has to approach the matter on the basis of assessing what were the chances or prospect of it happening. The chance may be almost a certainty at one end to a mere speculative hope at the other. The value will depend on how good this chance is. Where, however, the court or tribunal has to decide what in fact has happened as an historical fact, it does so on balance of probability; and once it decides that it is more probable than not, then the fact is found and is established as a certainty. This distinction is well illustrated by <i>Davies v Taylor</i> [1972] 3 All ER 836, [1974] AC 207 and <i>Allied Maples Group Ltd v Simmons &amp; Simmons (a firm)</i> [1995] 4 All ER 907, [1995] 1 WLR 1602. </p>
<p class="qt">It would be unnecessary for the Secretary of State to evaluate the chance of the eastern route being the preferred alternative route in the event that the actual route was not chosen, provided it was more than 50%; but the Lands Tribunal would be concerned in assessing value to evaluate the chances of this happening more precisely.”</p>
