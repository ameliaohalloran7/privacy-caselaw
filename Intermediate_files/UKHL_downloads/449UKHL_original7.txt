<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;155. I recognise that under the procedural rules which governed the proceedings before him in the Outer House, Lord Philip may have been justified in refusing to allow the cases before him to go to proof and it seems that the subsequent history of the actions bears out that the parties apparently shared this view.  As regards the proceedings in the case of <i>Morris</i>, the situation was less clear cut and I will have to revert to this point later in this Opinion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;156. But two mistakes in the reasoning of the courts below need to be emphasised.  The scientific developments have not changed the meaning of the Article.  The meaning of the phrase <i>bodily injury</i> has not changed.  The criterion or test remains the same.  All that has changed is the ability of certain plaintiffs to bring their cases within it.  The historical argument of saying one must look to some meaning existing in 1929 is, quite apart from the other objections to the argument, simply misconceived.  Air transport has been transformed since 1929, mainly because of the invention of the jet engine and its use in civilian aircraft.  Land-based planes are no longer confined to a range of 500 miles or less nor civilian aircraft to daytime flight and an operating height of 3 or 4 thousand feet.  A delegate to the Warsaw conference asked what he thought about jet engines, helicopters or pressurised aircraft flying at 30,000 feet or more carrying hundreds of passengers or the risk of hijacking would probably have merely looked bemused as he no doubt would have if asked about monamine neurotransmitters, noradrenaline or changes in the size of the hippocampus.  But this ignorance or lack of imagination does not affect the meaning of the words which for better or worse they decided in 1929 to use in the text of the Convention.</p>
<i></i><p><i>The Use of Language</i>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;157. The third point leads on from the second.  Lawyers are not expert scientists nor are they always familiar with the accurate use of medical language.  This is no criticism of them unless they have had the assistance of expert evidence.  For example, they cannot be expected to know the character of the DSM classification unless they have at one time or another been informed of it or have had the professional opportunity to inform themselves.  But, on the other hand, it should be possible to detect the shortcomings of arguments which, citing from the works of Descartes (as did counsel for the carriers in these appeals), invoke primitive and patently unscientific dualist theories.  Similarly it is not sound to use such expressions as "mental injury", an expression which forms the corner-stone of the reasoning of the Court of Appeal.  The adjective <i>mental</i> means relating to the mind.  The mind is a metaphysical concept associated with the self-consciousness of human beings.  The word can be used in a descriptive but not a substantive sense.  One can have a mental illness or disorder just as one can have a respiratory illness or disorder.  But one cannot usefully refer to having a <i>mental</i> injury.  Little more helpful is the expression <i>psychic</i> injury (though it may have the meaning psychological injury in the United States where it seems to have its main currency).  However none of these expressions, nor the confusion of psychiatry with psychology, assist to answer the question what is a <i>bodily injury</i>.  At the best they identify that class of complaints which represent normal responses to external experiences, fright, grief, anguish, feeling sad or unhappy, feeling depressed but not clinically, and so on.  These emotional upsets are real and unpleasant but they are not <i>bodily injuries</i>.  Indeed they will not cross the threshold into what are properly described as <i>injuries</i> at all.  It is this class of unpleasant experiences which, without more, do not suffice to ground a recovery under Article 17 and which, as I read them, the American authorities are seeking to exclude.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;158. The reasoning of the Court of Appeal discloses a striking combination of the various features to which I have referred, most fundamentally, the errors which arise from the use of a phrase which does not occur in the Convention, 'mental injury', and which is devoid of actual meaning.  This phrase is then used to create a false antithesis with a phrase which is used, <i>bodily injury</i>, bolstered by a supposed investigation of what delegates to the 1929 conference would have actually had in mind when they agreed to the Convention and the proposition that the absence of travaux préparatoires to support a particular reading should be treated as if there were such travaux préparatoires.  The conclusion then arrived at is that although a passenger may be able to adduce evidence to prove that she has suffered an injury which comes within the ordinary meaning of <i>bodily injury</i>, she must be precluded from doing so.  The quotations which I have made from the judgment of the Master of the Rolls also illustrate a use of language which inevitably tends to confuse the reasoning.  'Mental <i>injury</i>' is used interchangeably with 'mental <i>illness</i>' and then 'mental <i>illness</i>' is contrasted with '<i>physical injury</i>' and '<i>physical</i>' is apparently being used as a substitute for '<i>bodily</i>'.  The picture is not made any clearer by the fact that in intervening passages the phrases "damage to the mind" and "mental disorders" are used. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;159. I therefore disagree with the reasoning and conclusion of the Court of Appeal.  Whilst I agree with much of the language and reasoning of Lord Philip and Lord Reed, I do not agree with them that the correct reading of the American cases is that they would exclude more than emotional upset.</p>
<i></i><p><i>The Overseas Authorities</i>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;160. As stated in the judgments of the courts below, the relevant question under Article 17 has been discussed by jurists in civilian jurisdictions but without disclosing a consistent view independent of domestic law considerations.  For present purposes I believe that the most useful assistance can be found in the reported decisions of courts.  However here as well there are difficulties since the decision may have been given on the basis of assumed facts, imprecisely defined, or without a clear statement in the report of the actual facts found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;161. The first cases to which your lordships were referred were ones which arose from the hijacking in 1970 of a TWA flight from Frankfurt to New York.  It gave rise to the <i>Rosman</i> case (1974), already referred to, and to a case in the US District Court <i>Burnett v Trans World Airlines Inc</i> (1973)  12 Avi 18405 .  It has been suggested that the fact that there do not seem to have been earlier cases under this part of Article 17 shows the artificiality of a construction which had never previously been thought to be arguable.  The reports do not bear this out.  The new factor appears to have been the occurrence of very unpleasant experiences without any actual impact but causing temporary distress and mental anguish.  Until the first spate of terrorist hijackings occurred there was little scope for any such incident or claim.  The metamorphosis of the carriage of passengers by air into a mass market serving consumers from a wide range of backgrounds also led to novel situations giving rise to the possibility to argue that damage had been caused by an 'accident'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;162. The <i>Burnett</i> case arrived at similar conclusions to those of the New York Court of Appeals in <i>Rosman</i>.  Thus the claim for 'mental anguish' <i>not</i> caused by any bodily injury was held to be irrecoverable: "Therefore, plaintiffs may recover in this action for any such emotional anxiety that they can demonstrate resulted from a bodily injury suffered as a consequence of the hijacking." (p.18,409)  The 'contact' argument was rejected - "that any bodily injury sustained must be the result of physical contact between the body and another object" - described as "a sterile interpretation":  "Brief reflection allows one to pose many instances in which a bodily injury may result without any physical contact whatsoever." (<i>ib.</i>)  The decision therefore is fully consistent with <i>Rosman</i> though the discussion of the Convention is different, drawing on various French materials.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;163. In <i>Rosman</i>, an argument based upon French domestic law was specifically rejected:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p><ul>"It does not follow from the fact that the treaty is written in French that in interpreting it we are forever chained to French law, either as it existed when the treaty was written or in its present state of development." (p.394)<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same vein they rejected the subjective approach to construction:  "Nor do we see any useful purpose to be served by [an investigation of French law] to search out the intent of the drafters of Warsaw." (p 395)  The conclusions in <i>Rosman</i> can be summarised:  (a) Mere 'psychic' trauma, mental anguish and emotional distress are not <i>bodily injury</i> and do not on their own give a basis of recovery under Article 17.  But, (b) such trauma etc may provide the causal link between the accident and the <i>bodily injury.  (c)</i> If a <i>bodily injury</i> is proved, all the consequences of that <i>bodily injury</i> should be taken into account in assessing the passenger's damage, including any consequential mental suffering.  This, if I may respectfully say so, is a coherent scheme which reflects the language of the Article and is one with which I agree. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;164. The penultimate paragraph of the judgment of Judge Rabin draws a distinction between the "non-bodily or behavioral manifestations" of the psychic trauma of the accident and the "palpable, objective bodily injuries" which may have been caused by that trauma.  The former does not, without more, amount to a <i>bodily injury</i> whereas the latter clearly does.  I do not read the word "palpable" (the use of which I have already commented upon in paragraph 142 above) as adding anything more than emphasis and a requirement for proof to the phrase "objective bodily injuries".  However, the carriers relied before your Lordships in this connection upon some of the language which Judge Rabin had used earlier on at p.397:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Rather, in seeking to apply the treaty's terms to the facts before us, we ask whether the treaty's use of the word 'bodily', in its ordinary meaning, can fairly be said to include 'mental'.  We deal with the term as used in an international agreement written almost 50 years ago, a term which even today would have little significance in the treaty as an adjective modifying 'injury' except to import a distinction from 'mental'.  In our view, therefore, the ordinary, natural meaning of 'bodily injury' as used in article 17 connotes palpable, conspicuous, physical injury and excludes mental injury with no observable bodily, as distinguished from 'behavioral', manifestations."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This passage is expressly governed by the context of the facts of the <i>Rosman</i> case and the limited question which it raised.  It is not evident what is the justification for the inclusion of the words "palpable" and "conspicuous" or what is gained by substituting "physical" for "bodily".  The passage is open to the same criticisms as those which I have made of the reasoning of the Court of Appeal in the <i>Morris</i> case.  I do not accept that this passage of the judgment is meant to contradict what Judge Rabin says more cogently on pages 399 and 400 which I have quoted in paragraph 144 above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;165. Next in time came a decision of the Israel Supreme Court, <i>Daddon v Air France,</i> (1984)  1 S&amp;B Av R VII/141.  It arose out of the Entebbe hijacking of 1976.  The passengers were eventually rescued.  The passengers, after nearly six years' delay, sued the airline for "damages in respect of the mental anguish caused to them and for the pain and suffering sustained by them due to what was involved" in the hijacking.  The court held (in anticipation of <i>Sidhu v BA</i> and <i>El Al v Tseng</i>) that the Warsaw Convention (with the Guatemala protocol) was exhaustive of the passengers' rights.  The court concluded that, in view of the objects of the Convention and its background, Article 17 should be interpreted "in the widest possible way so that it would be possible in pursuance thereof to award compensation also for pure mental anguish". (p.153)  This interpretation stands alone internationally and is not one I would agree with.  It deprives the words <i>bodily injury</i> of their ordinary meaning and equates them with a legal category, personal injury. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;166. The leading decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, <i>Eastern Airlines Inc v Floyd</i> (1991)  499 US 530, arose from an incident during a flight to the Bahamas from Miami.  Shortly after take-off, all 3 of the plane's engines failed.  It lost height and a crash landing into the sea seemed inevitable.  However at the last moment one of the engines restarted and the plane was able to land safely at Miami.  No one was hurt but the passengers claimed "damages solely for mental distress arising out of the incident".  The Court held that "Article 17 does not allow recovery for purely mental injuries". (pp.533-4)  The decision of the case therefore poses no problems for any save those who would support the extreme <i>Daddon</i> view, as had the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals.  The subject matter of the case naturally governed the language used in the judgment delivered by Justice Marshall - "when a passenger has suffered only a mental or psychic injury" - "recovery for purely psychic injuries". (pp.536-7)  In a footnote to p.540, he seems to have equated these expressions with "emotional distress" and "grief".  No doubt because of the judgment below and the arguments presented to them, the judgment spends some time considering the French text and the jurist's commentaries before coming to the conclusion (p.542) that the French legal sources were ambiguous and did not help to resolve the relevant question.  After a historical review, taking in subsequent conferences and conventions and the <i>Daddon</i> case, the Court declined to agree with the Israel Supreme Court and rejected its wide interpretation of Article 17.  Reverting to the expression "mental distress", they consider how recovery in respect of it has been treated in America and elsewhere and adds that</p>
<p></p><ul>"We have no doubt that subjecting international carriers to <i>strict</i> liability for purely mental distress would be controversial for most signatory countries." (p.552)"<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;167. Justice Marshall concluded -</p>
<p></p><ul>"....an air carrier cannot be held liable under Article 17 when an accident has not caused a passenger to suffer death, physical injury or physical manifestation of injury.  .....  we express no view as to whether passengers can recover for mental injuries that are accompanied by physical injuries.  That issue is not presented here because [the passengers] do not allege physical injury or physical manifestation of injury." (p.552-553)<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also declined to decide the question whether the Convention was exhaustive of the parties' rights and liabilities.  Thus the Supreme Court strictly confined their decision to the facts of the case before them and the question whether to follow <i>Daddon</i> and reverse to that extent <i>Rosman</i>.  They rejected <i>Daddon</i> and preferred <i>Rosman</i> although they chose to leave open some of the points <i>Rosman</i> had decided.</p>
<i>
</i><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;168. Jack v Trans World Airlines Inc</i> (1994)  854 F.Supp.654, District Judge Caulfield:  This case arose from an incident at John F Kennedy airport New York when a plane was taking off for a flight to San Francisco.  The take-off had to be aborted and the plane caught fire.  During the evacuation of the plane some passengers suffered minor injuries and many passengers claimed to have suffered "emotional distress" as a result of the incident which was undoubtedly traumatic.  The carrier sought to strike out the claims for "emotional distress", in respect of those who had not been injured at all, on the ground that the claims were barred by <i>Floyd</i> and, in respect of those who had been injured during the evacuation, on the ground that emotional distress damages are not allowed.  The carrier also complained that the evidence relied upon by the passengers in connection with their emotional distress claims was self-contradictory  and sham, a submission which the judge accepted. (p.661)  The judge did not accept the evidence of the psychiatrist relied upon by the passengers describing it as speculative. (pp.663-4)  The judge however went on to discuss the right to recover  for emotional distress following on an injury.  His conclusion was to adopt a similar analysis to that in <i>Rosman</i>: see paragraph 163 above.  Damages for emotional distress are not recoverable as such but may be recovered if consequent upon a bodily injury.  The judge, notwithstanding his views about the passengers' evidence, declined to strike out the claims by passengers who were alleging "physical manifestations" of their emotional distress or had suffered impact injuries. (p.668)  This case therefore provides an example of the application of the decisions in <i>Floyd</i> and <i>Rosman</i> but no more.  The judge at p.664 sought to define his terms; his definitions do not assist as they raise as many questions as they purport to answer.</p>
<i>
</i><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;169. American Airlines v Georgeopoulos </i>(1996 and 1998)<i> </i>[1998]  NSWSC 463, Supreme Court of Appeal, New South Wales:  This case first came before the Court of Appeal on agreed findings which included "that the [passenger] claims damages for nervous shock or mental suffering and no other basis".  The carriage was agreed to be governed by the Warsaw Convention.  The appeal therefore raised the bare question whether the Australian courts should follow <i>Daddon</i> or <i>Floyd</i>.  The court preferred <i>Floyd</i>.  They held the question of liability could not be decided without further findings of fact; absent such findings it was impossible to decide whether the passenger suffered <i>bodily injury</i> within the meaning of the Article.  To quote the headnote - </p>
<p></p><ul>"'Nervous shock' as a condition or a cause of a condition for which a defendant may be liable in negligence describes a non-impact injury which may or may not give rise to a body tissue alteration.  Assuming shock occurs, the question is whether that shock caused injury and the nature of that injury.  These evidentiary findings are essential to any conclusion whether the injury complained of was a 'bodily injury' for the purposes of Article 17".<p></p></ul>
<p>This decision is therefore in line with the view I have expressed.  The case was remitted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;170. Before <i>Georgeopoulos </i>returned to the Court of Appeal for the second time, the case of <i>Kotsambasis v Singapore Airlines Ltd</i> (1997)  42 NSWLR 110, had come before it.  The plaintiff in this case had been a passenger on a flight from Athens to Sydney.  Shortly after take-off one of the engines caught fire and, after dumping fuel, the plane returned safely to Athens.  The trial judge accepted that the plaintiff had been severely frightened and anxious during the incident.  Her onward flight was diverted via Paris and she strained her back carrying her heavy luggage.  Meagher JA said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"I am of the opinion that the term "bodily injury" was not intended to, and on a proper interpretation of the Convention does not, include purely psychological injury.  I note that the decision in <i>Eastern Airlines Inc v Floyd</i> specifically left open the possibility that recovery might be available where psychological injury was accompanied by physical injury." (p.115)<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the judge's findings she had not suffered any injury which had anything to do with the fright and anxiety of which she complained nor was it in the course of any embarkation or disembarkation.  Powell JA agreed.  Stein JA, also agreeing, followed the first <i>Georgeopoulos</i> case and expressly preferred <i>Floyd</i> to <i>Daddon</i>.  He said that <i>Floyd</i> "held that there could be no recovery for 'psychic' injury unaccompanied by physical injury" and continued - </p>
<p></p><ul>"However where mental anguish follows and is caused by physical injury, recovery for both injuries is covered.  I would agree with this latter statement.  Moreover, if the psychological injury is proven to be a species of bodily injury, then it would constitute 'bodily injury' within the article." (p.121)<p></p></ul>
<p>He later summarised his view as being that bodily injury in Article 17 was not intended to include "<i>purely</i> psychological injury". (p.122, his emphasis.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;171. On the return of <i>Georgeopoulos </i>for the second time to the Court of Appeal, the court included Sheller JA who had given the leading judgment on the first appeal and Meagher JA who had presided on <i>Kotsambasis</i>.  The additional facts found by the magistrate were not helpful to the passengers.  He found that all they had suffered was a "mild post traumatic stress disorder" which had not resulted from "any physical or bodily injury" to either passenger nor "any structural alteration to body tissues or alteration in the function of an organ or neurochemical change or any other form of damage to tissues or organs".  Sheller JA again delivering the agreed leading judgment expressly adopted and approved what Stein JA had said at p.121 of <i>Kotsambasis</i> and accordingly dismissed the passengers' appeals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;172. The importance of these Australian cases is that they follow the lead given by the US cases; they reject the proposition that there can be a recovery for emotional distress as such; they accept that an accident can cause a 'psychological' (<i>sic</i>, clearly meaning psychiatric) injury which may be proved to be a <i>bodily injury</i>; they do not criticise the criteria "structural alteration in bodily tissues", "alteration in the function of an organ or neurochemical change" and "any other form of damage to tissues or organs"; they see no inconsistency between this and what was said in <i>Floyd</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;173. It is not necessary to refer to <i>El Al v Tseng</i> (1999)  525 US 576, US Supreme Court, the case of the over-intrusive security search, as it was deliberately argued as a case which fell outside of Article 17.  There probably had been no accident.  It was doubtful whether the material events occurred within the period covered by Article 17.  The plaintiff's evidence was that she was "emotionally traumatised and disturbed", "really sick and very upset" and that is all. (p.587)  The decision in <i>Floyd</i> was not questioned.  The Plaintiff's argument was that she should be allowed to bring a tort claim.  The question for the decision of the Supreme Court was that left open in <i>Saks</i> and <i>Floyd</i>.</p>
<p></p><ul>"Her case presents a question of the Convention's exclusivity: When the Convention allows no recovery for the episode-in-suit, does it correspondingly preclude the passenger from maintaining an action for damages under another source of law, in this case, New York law?" (Justice Ginsberg at p.585)<p></p></ul>
<p>The Supreme Court following, among other authorities, <i>Sidhu</i>, held that the Convention was exhaustive.  It adds nothing presently material to <i>Rosman</i> and <i>Floyd</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;174. Of the later US cases, only a few need be referred to since most are merely examples of the application of <i>Floyd</i> to facts which were not materially different from those on which <i>Floyd</i> was based.  Where those facts have included some injury, the injury had no causative or other relevance to the emotional distress.  (<i>eg</i>, <i>Alvarez v American Airlines</i> (1999) 27 Avi 17,214 and (2000) 27 Avi 17,475)  In two cases <i>Terrafranca v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd</i> (1998)  151 F.Supp 3d 108, Third Circuit Court of Appeals, and <i>Carey v United Airlines</i> (2001)  28 Avi 15,408, Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, the passenger sought to satisfy the criteria in <i>Floyd</i> by saying that the accident had caused emotional distress and the emotional distress had caused physical symptoms like, in <i>Terrafranca</i>, loss of weight and, in <i>Carey</i>, sleeplessness, nausea, perspiration etc.  These consequences it was argued amounted to "physical manifestations" for the purpose of Article 17 so as to bring what would otherwise be mere emotional stress within the terms of that Article.  It will be appreciated at once that I myself would not accept that argument.  What the passenger has to prove is a <i>bodily injury</i>, not something less but with physical manifestations.  The argument was based upon the language used in <i>Floyd</i>: but the phrase used there is "physical injury or physical manifestation of injury". (pp.552-553)  If it is simply emotional stress which is causing the person to lose weight, no injury, bodily or otherwise, is proved.  For the argument to succeed the plaintiff must prove either that the manifestation proves that there is or has been an underlying <i>bodily injury</i> or that the manifestation itself is a <i>bodily injury</i>.  As <i>Rosman</i> shows, provided that causation by the accident can also be proved, in the former instance the plaintiff can recover damages for the underlying <i>bodily injury</i> and its consequences and in the latter for the bodily injury but not what preceded it.  What I have said corresponds to the reasoning of the Court of Appeals in <i>Terrafranca</i>: see page 15,777 where <i>Rosman</i> is cited.  In <i>Carey</i> (at p.15,414) Circuit Judge Nelson followed <i>Terrafranca</i>, saying,</p>
<p></p><ul>"The Third Circuit concluded ... that there was no support for the argument that the plaintiff's physical manifestations of her emotional injury satisfied the 'bodily injury' requirement.  Because the plaintiff could not 'demonstrate direct, concrete, bodily injury as opposed to mere manifestation of fear or anxiety', the court held that she did not satisfy the conditions for liability under Article 17 and thus could not recover for her emotional distress.  For reasons similar to those articulated by the Third Circuit in <i>Terrafranca,</i> we hold that physical manifestations of emotional and mental distress do not satisfy the 'bodily injury' requirement in Article 17."<p></p></ul>
<i></i><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carey</i> came after <i>Weaver</i> (<i>inf</i>) and the Court of Appeals referred to it in footnote 47 to its Opinion without expressing either approval or disapproval.  The value of <i>Terrafranca</i> and <i>Carey</i> is that they implicitly approve <i>Rosman</i> and confirm the primacy of the simple <i>bodily injury</i> criterion, not any gloss or paraphrase of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;175. There have been two cases where the passenger claimants took upon themselves and discharged the burden of proof contemplated by <i>Rosman</i> and the Australian cases.  The first is <i>Weaver v Delta Airlines</i> <i>Inc </i>(1999) 56 F. Supp 2d 1190, Chief Judge Shanstrom.  The plaintiff was a passenger on a flight from London to Billings.  Mechanical problems necessitated an emergency landing at Dayton Ohio.  She claimed that during the landing she had been terrified and had subsequently had to be medically treated for emotional and physical problems attributable to her flight experiences with a diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder.  The carrier sought to strike out her claim, relying on <i>Floyd</i>.  The judge refused the application.  The plaintiff filed affidavits providing uncontradicted expert evidence that "extreme stress causes actual physical brain damage, <i>ie</i>, physical destruction or atrophy of portions of the hippocampus of the brain".  "The impact upon [the plaintiff] of the events which occurred on that flight was extreme and included biochemical reactions which had physical impacts upon her brain and neurological system".  She had thus presented evidence of "physical injury" and was entitled to say that "her diagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder arose from the physical changes in her brain brought on during the extreme stress of the emergency landing". (p.1191)  The judge therefore distinguished her case from "<i>Floyd</i> and its progeny": she was relying upon "an injury to her brain, and the only reasonable conclusion is that it is, in fact, a bodily injury". (p.1192)  It is hard to see any basis for disagreeing with the conclusion that, if the passenger can prove that his or her brain was damaged as a result of the accident, the passenger has suffered a <i>bodily injury</i>.</p>
