<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77.&nbsp;&nbsp;Class (f) seems to me to pre-suppose a situation where an employer may or may not decide to treat a particular description of worker as having a different type of contract and differently on that ground, and, where if the employer is reasonable in so doing, that particular description of worker is to be regarded as having a different type of contract, although otherwise he or she would not be so regarded. The word "other" on this basis is simply referring to the particular description of worker so identified. That description will necessarily be different from any of those previously listed, in that it must at least involve additional and more specific criteria and will therefore be an "other description" from any of them, even though, apart from it, the particular workers to whom it applies would also be regarded as falling within one of the more general earlier classes. The problem to which my noble and learned friend, Baroness Hale of Richmond, refers in paragraph 31 of her opinion does not in these circumstances arise on the respondents' approach, but only on the appellants' approach. On the respondents' approach, if the employer is unreasonable in treating the particular part-time worker differently from other workers on the ground that he or she has a different type of contract from workers in one of the earlier classes, clause (f) simply does not apply and the part-time worker falls back into whichever of the earlier classes he or she would fall without class (f). On the appellants' approach, there is by definition no earlier class into which the part-time worker can fall apart from class (f), and the worker must end up in limbo if the employer is unreasonable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the appellants' approach, class (f) seems inexplicable, except as very hesitant and faltering drafting. The respondents' approach gives sensible effect to class (f). The classification achieved in classes (a) to (e) has a certain formulaic rigidity. It distinguishes, as being employed under different types of contract falling within classes (a) and (b) respectively, employees who may be doing precisely the same work over a long period, e.g. two employees, one employed under an indefinite length contract, the other employed under a fixed term contract. So the regulations cannot be as tightly controlling in their requirement that employers justify differences in treatment on objective grounds as the appellants' case and the reasoning of the Court of Appeal would suggest. However, each of classes (a) to (e) would at the same time by itself be capable of embracing a wide variety of contractual engagements, which might in reality be very different in character. Thus class (a), taken by itself, would assimilate all employees under contracts which are not for a fixed term and not for apprenticeship, while class (b) would assimilate all employees under contracts which are for a fixed term and not for apprenticeship. In these circumstances, class (f) is entirely explicable on the ground that so crude a categorisation might ignore real differences which could reasonably justify employers treating as quite different in character the contracts of particular workers who would otherwise fall within one and the same earlier class. (This is, one might add, consistent with the background to the Regulations, which shows that their aim was deliberately restricted to employees or other workers on "the same type of contract", under what was described as a "light-touch" approach: see the Department of Trade and Industry's Consultation Document on Part-time Work (January 2000; URN 99/1224) and House of Commons Research Paper 00/50 of 15 May 2000 on Part-time Work).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further (contrary to Maurice Kay LJ's statement that "such an approach forms no part of Directive 97/81 which gave rise to the Regulations" and to Longmore LJ's statement that it would make it "difficult for the Directive to have its intended effect"), it is the respondents', rather than the appellants', approach that gives better effect to the underlying Council Directive 97/81/EC of 15 December 1997 concerning the Framework Agreement of 6 June 1997 on part-time work. By clause 3(2) of the Framework Agreement:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The term 'comparable full-time worker' means a full-time worker in the same establishment having the same type of employment contract or relationship, who is engaged in the same or a similar work/occupation, due regard being given to other considerations which may include seniority and qualification/skills.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>…"<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80.&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Directive, as stated in its article 1, "is to implement the Framework Agreement" and, by its article 2, Member States were obliged to "bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive". Recital (14) records that the Directive "binds the Member States as to the result to be achieved, whilst leaving national authorities the choice of form and methods". Recital (16) recites that</p>
<p></p><ul>"… with regard to terms used in the Framework Agreement which are not specifically defined therein, this Directive leaves Member States free to define those terms in accordance with national law and practice ….. provided that the said definitions respect the content of the Framework Agreement".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81.&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition in clause 3(2) of the Framework Agreement involves on its face a general test, whether or not the employment contracts or relationships under comparison are of the same or a different type. The European Court of Justice in its decision in <i>Wippel v. Peek &amp; Cloppenburg GmbH &amp; Co KG </i>(Case C-313/02) looked accordingly at all aspects of a part-time worker's contract of employment, before concluding that it "differs, as to subject matter and basis" and so as to type from that of any full-time worker employed by the defendant. The part-time worker in <i>Wippel</i> was engaged under a framework contract of employment which lasted in the event from October 1998 to June 2000, but under it the duration and scheduling of any work was determined by agreement (in practice from week to week) between the parties and she was paid on an hourly basis for any hours she was asked and agreed to work (plus sales commission on sales thereby achieved). Her contention was that she was discriminated against because her contract did not contain a fixed weekly working time with a predetermined salary, whether or not she did or did not work for the whole of that working time. It is of interest that the Court disposed of this ambitious argument, not under clause 4 of the Framework Directive (equivalent to regulation 5(2)(b) of the United Kingdom Regulations) on the basis that her different treatment was justified on objective grounds (because it was her choice whether or not to work), but rather under clause 3 of the Directive on the basis that her employment was not of the same type as that of the full-time employees with whom she sought to compare herself. Clause 3 is thus a threshold which must be crossed before one gets to detailed examination of objective justification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of clause 3(2) of the Framework Agreement, reinforced by the decision in <i>Wippel</i>, it again seems to me likely that class (f) was conceived to introduce a greater element of flexibility than the rigid classification of classes (a) to (e) could allow, in order to cater for particular employees or workers who would otherwise fall within one of such classes and to allow them to be treated differently and as having a different type of contract, if reasonable so to do on the stated ground. Indeed, unless this were so, Ms Wippel's "framework contract of employment" might even under English and Scottish law have to be treated as being of the same type as the contracts of the full-time workers with whom she sought to compare herself, contrary to the intent of the Framework Agreement and Directive as explained by the European Court of Justice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal's other objection of substance, as opposed to linguistic analysis, to the above conclusion was that the protection intended would otherwise be undermined. It was, Maurice Kay LJ said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"always open to an employer to justify less favourable treatment on objective grounds under regulation 5(2)(b) once the threshold tests of the same type of contract and engagement in the same or broadly similar work have been satisfied. It is neither necessary nor desirable to bring forward an objective test based on reasonableness to enable an employer to remove an employee who would otherwise fall into one of (a) to (e). To do so would unduly complicate eligibility and would run counter to the purpose of the legislation" (para. 12, p. 908E).<p></p></ul>
<p>Longmore LJ added:</p>
<p></p><ul>"There are, to my mind, serious difficulties about accepting this construction of regulation 2(3), because it effectively permits the employer to decide for himself who is and is not to be regarded as a comparable full-time worker. If an employee can "reasonably" treat part-time workers differently from full-time workers and say that the ground on which he is so doing is that part-time workers have a different type of contract from full-time workers, there will be little or no scope for an employment tribunal to assess for itself, as it is obliged to do under regulation 5, whether the employer is treating the part-time worker less favourably than a comparable full-time worker as regards "the terms of his contract". All the more will this be the case if it is "the terms of his contract" on which the employer is entitled to rely for the purpose of asserting that it is reasonable to treat his part-time workers differently for the purposes of regulation 2(3)(f)." (para. 28, pp.95-96)<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it was the clear intention of the Framework Agreement to create a general threshold to any comparison and to any requirement on the part of an employer to justify, on objective grounds, a difference in treatment of different workers doing the same or similar work. The threshold was that the workers being compared should have "the same type of employment contract or relationship". That general threshold appears to me, as I have said, to be reflected in, and to explain, the introduction of class (f). The element of judgment, introduced by the reference to "any other description of worker that it is reasonable for the employer to treat differently", is limited both by the boundaries of reasonableness and by the fact that the employer can only treat another description of worker differently "on the ground that workers of that description have a different type of contract". Mere differences in contractual terms would not achieve this result. The European Court of Justice's decision in <i>Wippel</i> illustrates the type of relatively uncommon situation in which class (f) might apply. I do not think that there is any risk that the construction I prefer would undermine the purposes of the Directive, or of the United Kingdom legislation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85.&nbsp;&nbsp;The question on this basis is whether the present case falls within the relatively confined class (f). This was essentially a matter for the employment tribunal to assess. It did so after many days of evidence and deliberation, and expressed its reasons and conclusions with great care. This House should be slow to interfere with them, although I acknowledge that it is always possible that such a tribunal may get too close to the detailed facts to be able to stand back and make a valid overall judgment. Here, I cannot see how this can be said to have been the case. The retained firefighters were engaged on special contracts, under which they only made themselves available on call within specified and agreed hours and were bound, for this purpose, to live within five minutes of the relevant station. They had the burden of having to be prepared for a turn-out during those hours, but benefits in the form of a substantial annual "retaining" fee (apparently in the region of £2000 p.a.), remuneration on different scales for attendance for drill or other duties, turn-out and attendance as well as "bounty" payments for long service. (I add that the tribunal also found that full-time firefighters' contracts include one main field of duty and responsibility without counterpart in retained firefighters' contracts; that is to assist with the fire safety workload of the brigade by becoming familiar with the relevant legislation and carrying out routine inspections and visits, and to provide advice for other organisations and the general public - cf paragraph 6 in the list of their duties set out by my noble and learned friend Baroness Hale in paragraph 39 of her opinion; and this is a field of work in which the Tribunal found that full-time firefighters spend about one-third of their time.) The employment tribunal regarded the "ad hoc demand led nature of the role of attending call outs to emergency situations" as "virtually unique" in their experience (para.31), and reached the overall conclusion "that on all the evidence before us as a group of employees it is obvious that the Applicants are a very special anomalous atypical and possibly unique group of employees". They considered whether it was reasonable for the respondents to treat them as a different description of worker to the full-time firefighters put forward as comparators, and concluded that it was. Further, if and in so far as it was relevant to look at the comparative merits of the different packages provided to retained and full-time firefighters, they concluded that the overall package offered to and accepted by the retained firefighters could not be said to be "anywhere like 'oppressive'", and that they had insufficient material to assess "whether taken as a whole the package is 'equitable' or properly described as 'equal value'" (para 146).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86.&nbsp;&nbsp;No basis has in my view been shown for disagreeing with the tribunal's assessment of the facts regarding the differences in the type of contracts, and I would disagree with the Court of Appeal and restore the conclusions reached by the employment tribunal and employment appeal tribunal in favour of the respondents on this ground, and dismiss the appellants' appeals accordingly.</p>
