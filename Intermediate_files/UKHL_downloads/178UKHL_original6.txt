<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;129.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of section 6(3)(b), section 6(1) has been interpreted as applying to two types of public authority, namely "core" public authorities "whose nature is governmental in a broad sense", and "hybrid" (or "functional") public authorities, only some of whose functions are of a public nature - see the discussion in the speech of Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead in <i>Aston Cantlow and Wilmcote with Billesley Parochial Church Council v Wallbank </i>[2003] UKHL 37, [2004] 1 AC 546, at paras 7 to 9. Under section 6(5), an entity which would otherwise be a hybrid public authority is nonetheless not to be treated as such in relation to an act "the nature of [which] is private", but this exception does not apply to core public authorities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;130.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 6 is, at least in some respects, not conspicuous for the clarity of its drafting. Thus, there was some debate before your Lordships as to whether there was a distinction between "acts" and "functions" in the section. In my view, both as a matter of ordinary language and on a fair reading of the section, there is a difference between "functions", the word used in section 6(3)(b), and "act[s]", the word used in section 6(2) and (5) and defined in section 6(6). The former has a more conceptual, and perhaps less specific, meaning than the latter. A number of different acts can be involved in the performance of a single function. So, if this appeal succeeds, a proprietor providing care and accommodation pursuant to section 26(1) of the 1948 Act would be performing a "function", which, while "of a public nature", would involve a multitude of acts, many of which would be private - eg contracting for the purchase of food or for the consumption of electricity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;131.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, a core public authority is bound by section 6(1) in relation to every one of its acts whatever the nature of the act concerned; there is therefore no need to distinguish between private and public acts or functions of a core public authority. On the other hand, a hybrid public authority is only bound by section 6(1) in relation to an act which (a) is not private in nature and (b) is pursuant to or in connection with a function which is public in nature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;132.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having made those preliminary points about section 6, I turn to the specific issue in the present case. In that connection, in the light of the arguments addressed to us, I propose to consider that issue in three stages. First, I shall discuss the individual specific factors which are said to bring the performance of a contract for the provision of care and accommodation between a proprietor and a resident, paid towards or arranged by a local authority pursuant to sections 21 to 26 of the 1948 Act, within the ambit of section 6(3)(b). Secondly, I shall address a policy argument based on those factors which involve "contracting-out", that is, the system whereby a core public authority, most commonly a local authority, contracts to pay a private company to carry out services which the authority is statutorily liable to provide. Thirdly and finally, I shall express my conclusion by considering these various factors together in the context of wider issues of principle. </p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A particulate analysis</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;133.&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be helpful to start by considering a simple case of a person who independently enters into a contract with a proprietor for the provision to her of care and accommodation in a privately owned care home. In such a case, I have some difficulty with the notion that the proprietor would be thereby performing a function within section 6(3)(b). Although Mr Pannick QC, for Mrs YL, did not concede this, Mr Sales QC, on behalf of the Secretary of State, did so. That concession was, in my view, at least on the face of it, realistic and correct. In such a case, there would simply be a private law contract for the provision of care and accommodation. At any rate at first sight, it is hard to see why, in performing such a contract, the proprietor would be carrying out a function "of a public nature".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;134.&nbsp;&nbsp;Reliance was placed on the fact that care homes are subject to detailed rules and supervision under the provisions of the Care Homes Regulations 2001 (SI 2001/3965). That is not, in my opinion, a telling reason for saying that, in providing care and accommodation to a private person, the proprietor of a care home is carrying out a function of a public nature. There is no identity between the public interest in a particular service being provided properly and the service itself being a public service. As a matter of ordinary language and concepts, the mere fact that the public interest requires a service to be closely regulated and supervised pursuant to statutory rules cannot mean that the provision of the service, as opposed to its regulation and supervision, is a function of a public nature. Otherwise, for example, companies providing financial services, running restaurants, or manufacturing hazardous material would ipso facto<i> </i>be susceptible to being within the ambit of section 6(1).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;135.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also said that it is in the public interest that the old and infirm are cared for, and that there are charities which offer the sort of services which care homes provide. In my opinion, that feature does something, but relatively little, to justify the view that section 6(3)(b) applies where care and accommodation are provided in a privately owned care home. The fact that a service can fairly be said to be to the public benefit cannot mean, as a matter of language, that it follows that providing the service itself is a function of a public nature. Nor does it follow as a matter of logic or policy. Otherwise, the services of all charities, indeed, it seems to me, of all private organisations which provide services which could be offered by charities, would be caught by section 6(1). It is in the public interest that health, education, housing, indeed food, is available to everyone. That cannot mean that those who provide such commodities on a commercial basis (including private hospitals, private schools, private landlords, and food retailers and distributors) therefore fall within the scope of section 6(3)(b).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;136.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also suggested that the fact that it will almost always be the vulnerable who are provided with care and accommodation in care homes indicates that such provision falls within section 6(3)(b). This point was advanced partly on the basis that the Strasbourg court has indicated that such people are entitled to particular protection under the Convention: see for example <i>Botta v Italy </i>(1998) 26 EHRR 241, para 32. I do not think that that point goes much further than the argument based on the quasi-charitable nature of, and the detailed regulations applicable to, the function. The fact that the vulnerable are entitled to particular protection ties in with the detailed regulatory regime which the government has imposed on those who run care homes, but it does not appear to me to go to the point in the present case. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;137.&nbsp;&nbsp;The factors so far mentioned are not, I accept irrelevant to the issue that has to be decided on this appeal, but I do not find them persuasive on their own. Accordingly, subject to wider policy considerations indicating otherwise,  it appears to me that a straightforward arrangement whereby a proprietor of a care home agrees to provide care and accommodation for a person under a private contract would not engage section 6(3)(b). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;138.&nbsp;&nbsp;The same conclusion must logically apply where the contract for the provision of care and accommodation in a privately owned care home is arranged and/or paid for by a third party, such as a relative of the person concerned. In other words, by entering into (whether pursuant to an arrangement with that person or a third party) and performing a contract for the provision of care and accommodation for a person "who by reason of age, illness [or] disability [is] in need of care and attention which is not otherwise available to [her]", a care home proprietor does not appear to me to be performing a "function" which is, at least intrinsically, "of a public nature", at least in the absence of telling reasons of policy or principle to the contrary. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;139.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it, the basis for justifying a different conclusion in this case essentially rests on three further factors. First, the contract whereby Southern Cross Healthcare Ltd agreed to provide Mrs YL with care and accommodation was made as a result of Birmingham City Council carrying out its duty to arrange for care and accommodation for Mrs YL under section 21(1) of the 1948 Act under its "umbrella agreement" with Southern Cross. Secondly, the majority of the care home charges for Mrs YL's care and accommodation were paid to Southern Cross by Birmingham, pursuant to the same statutory duty. Thirdly, Birmingham itself could have provided Mrs YL with care and accommodation pursuant to the 1948 Act.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;140.&nbsp;&nbsp;While the statutory involvement of Birmingham can fairly be said to give the function performed by Southern Cross in providing care and accommodation for Mrs YL a public connection, I do not consider that it can, at least on its own, convert that function into one "of a public nature" which engages section 6(3)(b). Birmingham's function in connection with the provision of the care and accommodation, according to its counsel, Mr Arden QC, fairly can be described as being of a public nature, but that is not really in point for two reasons. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;141.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, at any rate in the context of section 6, it is meaningless, and therefore potentially misleading, to describe a function of a core public authority as being "of a public nature", as that concept (like that of "an act which is private") has relevance only to hybrid authorities. Secondly, even if Birmingham performed a function of a public nature by arranging the care and accommodation in accordance with its statutory duty, that would not mean, either as a matter of logic or policy, that the actual provision of the care and accommodation to Mrs YL by Southern Cross pursuant to a private law contract must thereby be converted from what would otherwise be a function of a private nature into one of a public nature. If the Ministry of Defence placed an order for military materiel with a private manufacturer, the Ministry could fairly be said, as a matter of ordinary language, to be carrying out a function of a public nature in placing the contract, but it would not follow, in my opinion, that the manufacturer would be carrying out a function of a public nature in performing the contract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;142.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that Southern Cross was paid by Birmingham for the provision in its care home of care and accommodation for Mrs YL does not appear to me to render such provision a "function of a public nature", at any rate on its own. It may well be that an activity of an entity which is not a core public authority is often unlikely to be a "function of a public nature" if it is not ultimately funded by a core public authority, but, again as a matter of logic and language, it cannot be a sufficient condition, in my view. Otherwise, the activities of every employee and every supplier of a core public authority would be within section 6(1). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;143.&nbsp;&nbsp;The existence of the umbrella agreement between Birmingham and Southern Cross does not, in my view, take matters further. It merely reflects the fact that Birmingham recognises that it will have to perform its statutory duty under section 21(1) of the 1948 Act to a number of persons, and that it wishes to have the basis on which it gives effect to the "arrangements", which it has to make under section 21(1) of the 1948 Act, identified in advance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;144.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that Birmingham, as a core public authority, could have provided care and accommodation for Mrs YL in a care home which it ran itself seems to me to be a factor which assists the contention that Southern Cross is performing a function of a public nature, but only to a limited extent. It is certainly not a sufficient condition: indeed, it appears to me to be more like a necessary condition. While it would be wrong to be didactic in this difficult area, I suspect that it would be a relatively rare case where a company could be performing a "function of a public nature" if it was carrying on an activity which could not be carried out by any core public authority. On the other hand, I would not accept that the mere fact that a core public authority, even where it is the body funding the activity, could carry out the activity concerned must mean that the activity is such a function. Apart from anything else, there must scarcely be an activity which cannot be carried out by some core public authority. </p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The argument based on "contracting-out"</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;145.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, I think, appropriate to consider in a little more detail the combined effect of two of the factors just discussed, namely the fact that Birmingham paid for the care and accommodation and the fact that Birmingham could have provided the care and accommodation itself. It was suggested that these two factors throw up a general point of principle, namely that section 6(3)(b) should apply to a case where a core public authority contracts-out one or more of its functions to a private company. This was a concern which weighed heavily with the Joint Committee [of the House of Lords and the House of Commons] on Human Rights, as may be seen in two of their reports on "The Meaning of Public Authority under the Human Rights Act" - [2003-4] HL Paper 39, HC 382 and [2006-7] HL Paper 77, HC 410.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;146.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is undoubted force in the point that, if a person would have Convention rights if a service was provided by a core public authority, she should not lose them merely because the service is contracted-out by that authority to a private company. It is a point which has been made in a number of articles and reports. In paragraph 41 of the first of the two reports, quoted in support of Mrs YL's case before your Lordships, the Joint Committee said that it would mean that the existence of Convention rights would be "dependent not on the type of power being exercised, nor on its capacity to interfere with human rights, but on the relatively arbitrary (in human rights terms) criterion of the body's administrative links with institutions of the state". However, it seems to me that there are several countervailing arguments, some of which apply to the present type of case, while others are of more general application. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;147.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, this is not a case of contracting out a duty: under the 1948 Act, Birmingham does have a duty to arrange for the provision of care and accommodation for Mrs YL, but it has no duty to provide such care and accommodation itself. The 1948 Act requires a local authority to arrange and, where necessary, to pay towards or for, care and accommodation for a person falling within section 21(1)(a); however, the 1948 Act does no more than to permit a local authority to provide the care and accommodation through its own care homes (and your Lordships were told Birmingham did not have any homes capable of providing for Mrs YL's needs). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;148.&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, where a company carries on a business providing services for individuals, it appears to me that there is a difference between (a) a core public authority supporting, or subsidising, the business generally (eg a care home all of whose expenses are met either as they arise or by a grant intended to cover all such expenses), and (b) such an authority funding services provided by the business to specific individuals (eg some or all of a care home's care and accommodation charges for a person who is not well off). I consider that it is easier in the former case to contend that the business as a whole is therefore a function "of a public nature", than it is in the latter case to contend that the services provided to the specific individuals constitute such a function. That is not so much because it seems unattractive to have two categories of resident in a single care home. It is more that section 6(3)(b) appears to me to be concerned primarily with "functions", or services, as such, rather than with the identity of the person who is paying for the provision of the services, or the reason for payment (although such factors are not, in my view, irrelevant). I agree in this connection with the views expressed by my noble and learned friend, Lord Scott of Foscote in paragraph 27 of his opinion which I have had the benefit of seeing in draft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;149.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Mrs YL continues to enjoy Convention rights in respect of the provision of care and accommodation provided under section 21 of the 1948 Act against Birmingham, even after the care and accommodation was provided to her. It is true that, at least in some circumstances, those rights could be of somewhat less value in practice than if they existed against the proprietor, but I am not persuaded that any such disadvantage would be likely to be significant, let alone substantial. Further, as the documentation in this case illustrates, the contractual terms which a local authority is often able to impose on a proprietor of a care home with whom it makes arrangements under the 1948 Act may well ensure that a person's rights against the proprietor are pretty similar in practice to those which would be enjoyed against the local authority. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;150.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, much of the concern of those who consider that contractors under contracting-out arrangements should have a Convention liability co-extensive with that which the contracting-out authority would have, is based on the nature of the powers given to contractors under such arrangements. This is illustrated by the reference to "the type of power" in the extract from paragraph 41 of the Joint Committee Report quoted above. In the present type of case, however, the proprietor of a care home is not given significant, if any, statutory powers, a point discussed in a little more detail below. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;151.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, the arbitrariness identified in the same extract from the Joint Committee report, if this appeal fails, is at least equalled by the arbitrariness, if this appeal succeeds, of the existence of Convention rights of a private care home resident depending on whether her care and accommodation is being paid for (or was arranged by) the local authority, as opposed to herself or her family. Quite apart from that, I agree on the aspect with what Lord Scott says in paragraphs 29 and 30 of his opinion.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;152.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixthly and more generally, I consider that, in answer to the policy argument for allowing this appeal on the basis of contracting-out, there is a policy argument for dismissing it on the same basis. It is thought to be desirable, in some circumstances, to encourage core public authorities to contract-out services, and it may well be inimical to that policy if section 6(1) automatically applied to the contractor as it would to the authority. Indeed, unattractive though it may be to some people, one of the purposes of contracting-out at least certain services previously performed by local authorities may be to avoid some of the legal constraints and disadvantages which apply to local authorities but not to private operators. I am in no position to decide on the relative strength of the two competing policy arguments: that is a matter for the legislature. However, the fact that there are competing arguments makes it hard to justify the courts resolving the instant issue by reference to policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;153.&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventhly, it does not seem to me that, as a matter of ordinary language, an activity is "a function of a public nature" merely because it is contracted-out, as opposed to its being provided directly, by a core public authority. If an activity were thereby automatically rendered such a function, it would mean that activities such as providing meals or cleaning and repairing buildings could be caught. Referring again to the Ministry of Defence contracting for the manufacture of military materiel, it seems to me that the private manufacturer's activities would not be within section 6(3)(b) even though the Ministry could have manufactured the materiel in its own factory.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wider perspective</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;154.&nbsp;&nbsp;The factors which I have so far considered to support the case for saying that, by providing care and accommodation for Mrs YL pursuant to an agreement with Birmingham, Southern Cross was performing a "function which is public in nature" are, in summary form:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;The existence and detailed nature of statutory regulation and control over care homes; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of care and accommodation for the elderly and infirm is a beneficial public service;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;The elderly and infirm are particularly vulnerable members of society;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.&nbsp;&nbsp;The care and accommodation was provided pursuant to the local authority's statutory duty to arrange its provision;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e.&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of the care and accommodation is funded by the local authority pursuant to its statutory duty;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f.&nbsp;&nbsp;The local authority has power to run its own care homes to provide care and accommodation for the elderly and infirm;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g.&nbsp;&nbsp;The contention that section 6(3)(b) should apply to a contracting-out case. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;155.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reasons so far given, I consider that each  factor, at least if taken individually, would be insufficient to render the provision of care and accommodation by Southern Cross in its care home to Mrs YL a "function of a public nature". However, it must be right to consider the effect of the various factors together, and, indeed, in the broader policy context. There is no doubt that, if one takes the various factors which I have summarised together, rather than examining the effect of each one separately, Mrs YL's case looks significantly stronger, but I still do not find it very persuasive. Each factor has some force, but, for the reasons already given, not very much force, at least in my opinion. Without some other, more powerful, wider, or policy, consideration to support the contention that section 6(3)(b) applies, I do not consider that the combination of the factors so far discussed serves to establish that Southern Cross is performing a function "of a public nature" in providing care and accommodation to Mrs YL in its care home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;156.&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn to what may be characterised as wider, policy, considerations. In that connection, the House was referred to a number of decisions concerning judicial review. The issue as to the meaning of the words "functions of a public nature" in a statute concerned with incorporating the Convention into domestic law does not necessarily involve quite the same principles as the question of whether a decision of a particular body is susceptible to judicial review. However, particularly given that the meaning of section 6(3)(b) is ultimately an issue of domestic law, the similarity in the character of the two issues, and the overlap of factors which come into play on the two issues, satisfies me that such decisions are of real assistance. So far as the effect of the cases on the present issue is concerned, there is nothing which I can usefully add to Lord Mance's analysis and conclusion in paragraphs 100 to 105 of his speech.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;157.&nbsp;&nbsp;While the question of the effect of section 6(3)(b) is one of domestic law, it seems to me that the Strasbourg jurisprudence is of also help, especially in the light of what has been said in your Lordships' House about the purpose of the 1998 Act, and section 6 in particular. In paragraph 34 of his speech in <i>R(Quark Fishing Ltd) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs </i>[2005] UKHL 57, [2006] 1 AC 529, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead said that the 1998 Act was "not intended to provide a domestic remedy where a remedy would not have been available in Strasbourg", and in paragraph 29 of his speech in <i>R(SB) v Governors of</i> <i>Denbigh High School</i> [2006] UKHL 15, [2007] 1 AC 100, my noble and learned friend, Lord Bingham of Cornhill said, to much the same effect, that the purpose of the 1998 Act "was not to enlarge the rights or remedies of those … whose Convention rights have been violated". These general observations are consistent with the views expressed by Lord Hope of Craighead and Lord Rodger of Earlsferry in relation to section 6(3)(b) at paragraphs 45 to 51 and paragraphs 158 and 159 respectively in <i>Aston Cantlow</i> [2004] 1 AC 546. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;158.&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the observations of this House in <i>Aston Cantlow</i> [2004] 1 AC 546 are in my opinion of more specific assistance to the resolution of the present appeal. Lord Hope and Lord Rodger said that the Strasbourg court jurisprudence on the effect of article 34 of the Convention (which restricts applications to the Strasbourg court to "any person, non-governmental organisation or group of individuals …") was relevant when considering whether an entity was a "core public authority". </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;159.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even more to the point, Lord Hope also said at paragraph 49 that "'public functions' in this context is thus clearly linked to the functions and powers, whether centralised or distributed, of government". In the following paragraph, he referred to article 34 as extending to "a person or body … established with a view to public administration as part of the process of government". Lord Rodger referred in paragraphs 159, 160 and 163 to entities "exercising governmental power", "carrying out the functions of government" and having the "public function of government". This is very much in line with the broader approach of Lord Nicholls: in paragraph 10, while stressing that it was "no more than a useful guide", he said that in the light of "the repetition of the description 'public'" in section 6(3)(b), "essentially the contrast being drawn is between functions of a governmental nature and functions, or acts, which are not of that nature". To similar effect, Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough invoked the test of a function which is "governmental in nature" and of entities which are "inherently governmental" in paragraph 88.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;160.&nbsp;&nbsp;With the assistance of this guidance, and looking at other policy issues, the following considerations (which, in some cases, have already been mentioned and, in other cases, overlap to some extent and are not ranked in order of importance), are in point:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;The activities of Southern Cross in providing care and accommodation for Mrs YL would not be susceptible to judicial review;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs YL would not, I think, be treated by the Strasbourg court as having Convention rights against Southern Cross, and she retains her Convention rights against Birmingham;</p>
