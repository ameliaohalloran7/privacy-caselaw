<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;49.&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows that the ruling of the Court of Appeal that an English court is entitled to proceed on the basis that, except for article 3, articles of the ECHR can never be engaged in respect of immigration decisions to expel an alien was wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50.&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be apparent from the review of Strasbourg jurisprudence that, where other articles may become engaged, a high threshold test will always have to be satisfied.  It will be necessary to establish at least a real risk of a flagrant violation of the very essence of the right before other articles could become engaged.</p>
<i></i><p><i>Disposal</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;51.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have read the opinions of my noble and learned friends Lord Bingham of Cornhill and Lord Carswell.  I agree with their opinions and conclusions.  I would also dismiss the appeals.</p>
LORD WALKER OF GESTINGTHORPE
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;52.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the great advantage of reading in draft the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill.  I agree that these appeals should be dismissed for the reasons given by Lord Bingham.  The difficulties which I perceive in this area are centred on article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and are better addressed in my opinion on the appeal in <i>R (Razgar) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </i> [2004]  UKHL 27, on which the House heard argument immediately after these appeals.</p>

BARONESS HALE OF RICHMOND
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;53.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the advantage of reading the opinions of my noble and learned friends, Lord Bingham of Cornhill, Lord Steyn and Lord Carswell. For the reasons they give, I agree that these appeals should be dismissed. In common with my noble and learned friend, Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe, I believe that the application of article 8 in this difficult area requires further analysis. This is addressed in my opinion in <i>R (Razgar) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</i> [2004] UKHL 27, where it arises directly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD CARSWELL</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;54.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appeal before the House furnishes a good illustration of the extent of the changes made to our domestic law by the incorporation by the Human Rights Act 1998 of provisions of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (the Convention), the enlargement of the source material which has to be taken into account by the courts of the United Kingdom and the way in which they have to approach the issues before them where Convention rights come into play.  Before the Act came into operation, the sole legal issue in an asylum case was whether the applicant came within the protection of the 1951 Geneva Convention and 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees (1951 (Cmd 9171) and 1967 (Cmnd 3906)), by establishing that he or she had a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion.  The Secretary of State for the Home Department retained a residual discretion to grant the applicant exceptional leave to remain in the United Kingdom on compassionate or humanitarian grounds, even though that legal condition had not been satisfied, and adopted policies to govern the grant of such leave.  Since the Human Rights Act came into operation public authorities (including the courts) may not act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right (section 6) and the courts must by section 2 take into account the body of material commonly known by the convenient term of "Strasbourg jurisprudence".  The differences which the Act has made in the approach to the issues in asylum appeals such as those before the House, in the material put before the courts and in the content and reasoning of decisions are profound, as may be seen from the opinions given by your Lordships.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;55.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahsan Ullah is a citizen of Pakistan who is an active member of the Ahmadiyya faith.  He has been an Ahmadi all his life, as have all the members of his family.  Members of his faith, according to the undisputed evidence before the adjudicator, suffer from a degree of religious persecution from Muslim extremists, who are opposed to the Ahmadiyya faith, and Mr Ullah claimed that he was subjected to a variety of restrictions of religious freedom and social discrimination.  He also claimed that he had suffered harassment and attacks on himself and his family since he began preaching his faith in December 1998.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;56.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ullah entered the United Kingdom on false documents in January 2001 and claimed asylum.  The Secretary of State refused asylum and certified the claim under paragraph 9 of Schedule 4 to the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.  The adjudicator dismissed Mr Ullah's claim to be entitled to asylum under the Geneva Convention and upheld the certificate, with the consequence that he was not entitled to appeal to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal.  Mr Ullah also alleged under section 65 of the 1999 Act that the Secretary of State in taking his decision to refuse him asylum had acted in breach of his human rights and appealed on this ground also to the adjudicator.  She dismissed Mr Ullah's claim under each of the articles of the Convention on which he relied.  She held that articles 2 and 3 were not engaged, as the appellant had not established that there were substantial grounds that his life would be at risk or that he would suffer any of the treatment prohibited by article 3.  She held that articles 6 and 7 were not engaged.  In relation to articles 9, 10 and 11 she held that although they might be engaged, each of them was a qualified provision and the Government's action in seeking to remove the appellant to Pakistan in pursuance of the need for proper immigration control was proportionate. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;57.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ullah sought to bring an application for judicial review of the adjudicator's decision and was given permission limited to the ground which he advanced under article 9 of the Convention, which provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief, in worship, teaching, practice and observance.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Freedom to manifest one's religion shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others."<p></p></ul>
<p>The application was dismissed by Harrison J, who was prepared to accept that article 9 could in principle be engaged but held that only a flagrant denial of the rights contained in that article would suffice to enable the appellant to resist being returned to Pakistan, a test which was not satisfied on the facts of the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;58.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thi Lien Do is a citizen of Vietnam, who entered the United Kingdom clandestinely on 20 November 2000 and shortly thereafter claimed asylum on the ground of her fear of persecution as the result of her religious beliefs as a Roman Catholic.  She practised her religion in Vietnam and taught the elements of her faith to children.  She claimed that she suffered from discrimination and experienced difficulties in following her faith.  There was evidence to support Miss Do's claim that her freedom to practise her religion was circumscribed in a number of respects and it was not in dispute that although she could return to Vietnam and practise her religion there, she would have to do so in reduced circumstances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;59.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary of State refused Miss Do's claim for asylum, on the ground that she had not established a well-founded fear of persecution, and certified the claim under paragraph 9(4)(a) of Schedule 4 to the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.  Miss Do appealed to the adjudicator against the Secretary of State's decision relating to persecution and also under section 65 of the 1999 Act, on the ground of breach of her Convention rights.  At the hearing her counsel relied on articles 3 and 5 of the Convention, but not on articles 8 and 9.  The adjudicator dismissed the asylum claim and the human rights appeal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60.&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Do appealed with leave to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal, which upheld the adjudicator's conclusion on the asylum claim.  The Tribunal considered the issue of the engagement of article 9 of the Convention, although it had not been relied upon before the adjudicator, and held that having regard to the adjudicator's findings on the evidence there was no infringement of this article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;61.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ullah appealed, with the judge's permission, to the Court of Appeal against the dismissal of his application for judicial review.  Miss Do appealed, with permission granted by Tuckey LJ, and the appeals were conjoined.  The court held that the adjudicator and the IAT were correct to dismiss Miss Do's appeal on the asylum issue.  The argument before the court and the thrust of its judgment were accordingly directed almost wholly to consideration of the engagement of article 9 of the Convention, the issue on which the appeal to this House turned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;62.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal dismissed both appeals on the ground that article 9 was not engaged: [2003] 1 WLR 770. At p 791, paras 63 and 64 of its judgment, which have been quoted in full in the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill, it committed itself firmly to the proposition that the only article of the Convention which could be engaged in cases such as those of the present appeals is article 3.  It stated categorically in para 64:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Where the Convention is invoked on the sole ground of the treatment to which an alien, refused the right to enter or remain, is likely to be subjected by the receiving state, and that treatment is not sufficiently severe to engage article 3, the English court is not required to recognise that any other article of the Convention is, or may be, engaged".<p></p></ul>
<p>This conclusion was strongly attacked by counsel for the appellants and the interveners.  For the reasons set out in the opinions of my noble and learned friends Lord Bingham of Cornhill and Lord Steyn, I agree that it cannot be upheld, and I propose to explore fairly shortly some aspects of the grounds for so deciding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;63.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not in dispute that sovereign states are entitled to regulate the entry of aliens into their territory, a principle, as Lord Bingham of Cornhill has set out in paragraph 6 of his opinion, which is fully recognised in the Strasbourg jurisprudence.  The primary focus of the Convention is territorial, but, as examination of the Strasbourg jurisprudence shows, it cannot now be said that persons seeking asylum in a member state of the Council of Europe are unable to invoke any of the provisions of the Convention when resisting an expulsion decision.  I do regard it as important, however, that member states should not attempt to impose Convention standards on other countries by decisions which have the effect of requiring adherence to those standards in those countries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;64.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Court of Appeal accepted the correctness of the argument advanced on behalf of the Secretary of State, which was the cornerstone of the Attorney General's argument in this House, that an exception to the territoriality principle exists when there is a real risk that an applicant for asylum will be ill-treated in his own country in a way which would constitute a serious breach of article 3 of the Convention, but that the exception is limited to that article.  It held at p 783, para 39 of its judgment that the underlying rationale is that </p>
<p></p><ul>"it is an affront to fundamental humanitarian principles to remove an individual to a country where there is a real risk of serious ill-treatment, even though such ill-treatment may not satisfy the criteria of persecution under the Refugee Convention.  Article 3 provides the test of such treatment".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;65.&nbsp;&nbsp;As authority for the existence of this exception the Court of Appeal recognised the weight to be given to the decision of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) in <i>Soering v United Kingdom </i>(1989) 11 EHRR 439, whose correctness has been accepted in a series of subsequent decisions (a number of which are listed in paragraph 12 of the opinion given by Lord Bingham of Cornhill).  <i>Soering </i>was a case of extradition rather than refusal of asylum, but although the two classes of case raise different issues, those differences are not material for present purposes and the principle laid down can be taken to apply with equal validity to expulsion cases, as the ECtHR held in <i>Chahal v United Kingdom </i>(1996) 23 EHRR 413 at p 457, para 80.  Lord Bingham of Cornhill has in paragraph 11 of his opinion set out extensive quotations from the decision in <i>Soering</i>, and it is not necessary to repeat them again.  It is sufficient to say that the basis for the Court's decision was that to return an applicant for asylum in such circumstances would conflict with "one of the fundamental values of the democratic societies making up the Council of Europe".  This approach finds an echo in the phrase adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Suresh v Canada </i>[2002] 1 SCR 3, at p 32, para 49, describing it as conduct that would "shock the Canadian conscience."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66.&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue is whether this exception is confined to cases falling within the bounds of article 3, as the Court of Appeal concluded, or whether it is capable of being of wider ambit, as the appellants and interveners contended.  One might indeed have preferred, if the matter were <i>res integra</i>, to see the exception expressed in terms of general humanitarian considerations, which could be applied flexibly throughout the states which are parties to the Convention, rather than being tied to specific articles of the Convention.  The risk in defining it by reference to the latter is that courts of law will tend to fit expulsion cases into a Procrustean bed of legal categories.  The matter is not, however, <i>res integra</i>, as examination of the Strasbourg jurisprudence shows, for the ECtHR has approached it by reference to the individual articles of the Convention.  It is to be hoped that the courts which have to apply the principles will be able to retain a substantial degree of flexibility in order to fulfil the humanitarian objectives of the Convention in such cases, while upholding the proper rights of states to decline to admit aliens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;67.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal concluded its review of the Strasbourg jurisprudence by stating at p 785,  para 47 of its judgment that: </p>
<p></p><ul>"To date, with the possible exception of <i>Bensaid v United Kingdom</i>, the application of this extension has been restricted to article 3 cases".<p></p></ul>
<p>It was correct to state that the only actual decisions applying the extension were <i>Soering v United Kingdom </i>and <i>Chahal v United Kingdom</i>, both article 3 cases.  But there is a strong current of authority contained in statements made by the ECtHR to the effect that other articles could be engaged.  Lord Bingham of Cornhill has set out in his opinion the roll-call of Strasbourg cases in which this possibility has been accepted by the Court, and I gratefully adopt this without repeating it.  Both Lord Bingham and Lord Steyn have set out reasons why in principle articles 2, 4, 5, 7 and 8 could be engaged in appropriate cases, and I respectfully agree with their reasons and conclusions.  I am myself satisfied that a fair reading of the Strasbourg cases requires a national court to accept that these articles could possibly be engaged and that the exception to the territoriality principle is not confined to article 3.  There does not appear to be any conceptual reason why article 9 should not be capable in principle of engagement, although I find it difficult to envisage a case, bearing in mind the flagrancy principle to which I am about to refer, in which there could be a sufficient interference with the article 9 rights which does not also come within the article 3 exception.  It may be for this reason that the ECtHR appeared in <i>Razaghi v Sweden </i>(Application No 64599/01) (unreported) 11 March 2003 to reject the possibility of engagement of article 9, although, as Lord Bingham of Cornhill has pointed out, the basis of the Court's ruling concerning article 9 is not entirely clear.  For present purposes I<i> </i>think it sufficient to say that I would not rule it out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;68.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ECtHR has consistently stated that before any article of the Convention other than article 3 could be regarded as engaged, it would require an extremely serious breach of the provisions of that article.  In <i>Soering v United Kingdom </i>it said at p 479, para 113 of its judgment:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The Court does not exclude that an issue might exceptionally be raised under article 6 by an extradition decision in circumstances where the fugitive has suffered or risks suffering a flagrant denial of a fair trial in the requesting country."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;69.&nbsp;&nbsp;The adjective "flagrant" has been repeated in many statements where the Court has kept open the possibility of engagement of articles of the Convention other than article 3, a number of which are enumerated in paragraph 24 of the opinion of Lord Bingham of Cornhill in the present appeal.  The concept of a flagrant breach or violation may not always be easy for domestic courts to apply - one is put in mind of the difficulties which they have had in applying that of gross negligence - but it seems to me that it was well expressed by the Immigration Appeal Tribunal in <i>Devaseelan v Secretary of State for the Home Department </i>[2003] Imm AR 1 at p 34, para 111, when it applied the criterion that the right in question would be completely denied or nullified in the destination country.  This would harmonise with the concept of a fundamental breach, with which courts in this jurisdiction are familiar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70.&nbsp;&nbsp;If it could be said that in principle article 9 is capable of engagement, it does not seem to me that the case of either appellant comes within the possible parameters of a flagrant, gross or fundamental breach of that article such as to amount to a denial or nullification of the rights conferred by it.  I accordingly agree that both appeals should be dismissed.</p>
