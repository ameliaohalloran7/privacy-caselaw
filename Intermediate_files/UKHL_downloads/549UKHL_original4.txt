<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;58. In combination the contextual factors which I have alluded to justify an initial disbelief that any of the articles of the European Convention could possibly bear the strong meaning for which counsel for Mrs Pretty must argue.  Despite his incisive arguments the position is in my opinion clear.  None of the articles can bear the interpretation put forward.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right to life.</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;59. Article 2 provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"1. Everyone's right to life shall be protected by law.  No one shall be deprived of his life intentionally save in the execution of a sentence of a court following his conviction of a crime for which this penalty is provided by law.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>2. Deprivation of life shall not be regarded as inflicted in contravention of this Article when it results from the use of force which is no more than absolutely necessary:<p></p></ul>
a) <p></p><ul>in defence of any person from unlawful violence;<p></p></ul>
b) <p></p><ul>in order to effect a lawful arrest or to prevent the escape of a person lawfully detained;<p></p></ul>
c) <p></p><ul>in action lawfully taken for the purpose of quelling a riot or insurrection."<p></p></ul>
<p>Counsel for Mrs Pretty argued that article 2 and in particular its first sentence acknowledges that it is for the individual to choose whether to live or die and that it protects her right of self determination in relation to issues of life and death.  This interpretation is not sustainable.  The purpose of article 2.1 is clear.  It enunciates the principle of the sanctity of life and provides a guarantee that no individual "shall be deprived of life" by means of intentional human intervention.  The interpretation now put forward is the exact opposite viz a right of Mrs Pretty to end her life by means of intentional human intervention.  Nothing in the article or the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights can assist Mrs Pretty's case on this article.</p>
<i><p>Prohibition of torture.</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60. Article 3 provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."<p></p></ul>
<p>The core of counsel's argument is that under article 3 the state's obligations are to take effective steps to ensure that no one shall be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment.  For my part article 3 is not engaged.  The word "treatment" must take its colour from the context in which it appears.  While I would not wish to give a narrow interpretation to what may constitute degrading treatment, the concept appears singularly inapt to convey the idea that the state must guarantee to individuals a right to die with the deliberate assistance of third parties.  So radical a step, infringing the sanctity of life principle, would have required far more explicit wording.  But counsel argues that there is support for his argument to be found in the jurisprudence of the ECHR on the "positive obligations" of a state to render effective the protection of article 3.  For this proposition he cites the decision of the ECHR in <i>D v United Kingdom</i> (1997)  24 EHRR 423.  The case concerned the intended deportation of an individual in the final stages of an incurable disease to St Kitts where there would not be adequate treatment for the disease.  The ECHR held that in the exceptional circumstances of the case the implementation of the decision to remove the individual to St Kitts would amount to inhuman treatment by the UK.  Unlike <i>D v United Kingdom</i> the present case does not involve any positive action (comparable to the intended deportation) nor is there any risk of a failure to treat her properly.  Instead the complaint is that the state is guilty of a failure to repeal section 2(1) of the 1961 Act.  The present case plainly does not involve "inhuman or degrading <i>treatment</i>".</p>
<i></i><p><i>Right to respect for Private Life and Family</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;61. Article 8 provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others."<p></p></ul>
<p>Counsel submitted that this article explicitly recognises the principle of the personal autonomy of every individual.  He argues that this principle necessarily involves a guarantee as against the state of the right to choose when and how to die.  None of the decisions cited in regard to article 8 assist this argument.  It must fail on the ground that the guarantee under article 8 prohibits interference with the way in which an individual leads his life and it does not relate to the manner in which he wishes to die.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;62. If I had been of the view that article 8 was engaged, I would have held (in agreement with the Divisional Court) that the interference with the guarantee was justified.  There was a submission to the contrary based on the argument that the scope of section 2(1) is disproportionate to its aim.  This contention was founded on the supposition that Mrs Pretty and others in her position are not vulnerable.  It is a sufficient answer that there is a broad class of persons presently protected by section 2 who are vulnerable.  It was therefore well within the range of discretion of Parliament to strike the balance between the interests of the community and the rights of individuals in the way reflected in section 2(1).</p>
<i></i><p><i>Freedom of thought, conscience and religion.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;63. Article 9 provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"1. Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief, in worship, teaching, practice and observance.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>2. Freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others."<p></p></ul>
<p>Counsel submitted that Mrs Pretty is entitled to manifest her belief in assisted suicide by committing it.  This cannot be right.  This article was never intended to give individuals a right to perform any acts in pursuance of whatever beliefs they may hold, e.g. to attack places where experiments are conducted on animals.  The article does not yield support for the specific proposition for which it is invoked.  In any event, for the reasons already discussed, section 2 is a legitimate, rational and proportionate response to the wider problem of vulnerable people who would otherwise feel compelled to commit suicide.</p>
<i></i><p><i>Prohibition of Discrimination.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;64. Article 14 provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status."<p></p></ul>
<p>Counsel submits that Mrs Pretty is in effect treated less favourably than those who are physically capable of ending their lives.  The Divisional Court held that article 14 is not engaged.  The alleged discrimination can only be established if the facts of the case fall within articles 2, 3, 8 or 9: <i>Botta v Italy</i> (1998)  26 EHRR 241, 259, para 39.  They do not.  This is a sufficient reason to reject this argument.  But there is a more fundamental reason.  The condition of terminally ill individuals, like Mrs Pretty, will vary.  The majority will be vulnerable.  It is the vulnerability of the class of persons which provides the rationale for making the aiding and abetting of suicide an offence under section 2(1) of the 1961 Act.  A class of individuals is protected by section 2(1) because they are in need of protection.  The statutory provision does not therefore treat individuals in a discriminatory manner.  There is no unequal treatment before the law.  In any event, for reasons already given, section 2(1) is fully justified.</p>
<i></i><p><i>VII.  The position of the DPP.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;65. This issue centres on the nature of the DPP's discretion to grant or refuse his consent to criminal proceedings under section 2(1) of the 1961 Act.  This is a provision of primary legislation.  The discretion under section 2(4) is contained in a criminal statute.  It is concerned with the deep-rooted sanctity of life principle.  In this context it is plainly beyond the power conferred by section 2(4) for the DPP to choose not to enforce section 2(1) or to dis-apply it.  These propositions are self evident and beyond reasonable challenge.  The DPP may not under section 2(4) exercise his discretion to stop all prosecutions under section 2(1).  It follows that he may only exercise his discretion, for or against a prosecution, in relation to the circumstances of a specific prosecution.  His discretion can therefore only be exercised in respect of past events giving rise to a suspicion that a crime under section 2(1) has been committed.  And then the exercise of this discretion will take into account whether there is a realistic prospect of securing a conviction and whether a prosecution would be in the public interest.  To hold that section 2(4) empowers the DPP to give the undertaking sought in this case is not justified by the statutory language, and would be contrary to the manifest limited purpose of section 2(4).  On this point I am in complete agreement with the careful judgment of the Divisional Court.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66. It is, however, necessary to consider whether, apart from the terms of the section 2(4) of the 1961 Act, the DPP has any power to undertake in advance not to bring criminal proceedings in respect of a contemplated course of action.  In agreement with the Divisional Court I would answer this question No.  But I would qualify the thrust of the valuable judgment of the Divisional Court in one respect.  The fact that there is a <i>duty</i> under section 10 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 on the DPP to issue a general code for Crown Prosecutors does not necessarily mean that he may not ever, in his absolute discretion, give guidance as to how the discretion will be exercised in regard to particular offences.  It is important to bear in mind what is under consideration, viz the width of the powers of the DPP.  One should not be over prescriptive on this subject.  An example from Scotland was given of the Crown Agent stating that no proceedings for a contravention of section 6(1)(a) of the Road Traffic Act 1972 would be instituted on the basis of a breath alcohol reading of less than 40 micrograms.  But I envisage that the occasions on which such statements would be appropriate and serve the public interest would be rare.  Subject to this narrow qualification I would accept as sound the policy of the DPP never to announce in advance, whether he will or will not bring criminal proceedings.  Certainly, it is beyond his power to indicate, before the commission of a particular crime, that he will or will not prosecute if it is committed.  But I regard this point as a diversion from the issues before the House.  The response of the DPP in this case cannot be faulted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;67. There was some debate about the possibility of judicial review of a decision by the DPP to refuse or grant consent to a prosecution.  If the DPP refuses consent, the only remedy is judicial review.  On the other hand, if he grants consent a defendant can raise any complaint in the criminal trial or on appeal.  Since satellite litigation should be avoided in such cases, I would stand by the rule in <i>R v Director of Public Prosecutions, Ex p Kebilene</i> [2000]  2 AC 326, that, absent dishonesty, mala fides or an exceptional circumstance, judicial review is not available in such cases.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VIII.  Conclusion.</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;68. The logic of the European Convention does not justify the conclusion that the House must rule that a state is obliged to legalise assisted suicide.  It does not require the state to repeal a provision such as section 2(1) of the 1961 Act.  On the other hand, it is open to a democratic legislature to introduce such a measure.  Our Parliament, if so minded, may therefore repeal section 2(1) and put in its place a regulated system for assisted suicide (presumably doctor assisted) with appropriate safeguards.</p>
<i></i><p><i>IX.  Palliative Care.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;69. The Report of the Select Committee on Medical Ethics stated in 1994 that in the United Kingdom palliative care has been developed to a high standard by the hospice movement: p 49, para 239.  The uncertainty in this case about the standard of palliative care which Mrs Pretty is receiving and will be entitled to receive in the last stages of her illness prompts me to express the hope that all is being done for her, and will be done, to make a little more tolerable what remains of her life.</p>
X. <i><p>Disposal.</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70. In this sad case the Human Rights Act does not avail Mrs Pretty.  For the reasons I have given, as well as the reasons given by Lord Bingham of Cornhill and Lord Hope of Craighead, the appeal must be dismissed.</p>
<p><b>LORD HOPE OF CRAIGHEAD</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;71. Mrs Pretty is burdened with a misfortune which has attracted widespread sympathy.  She is suffering from a terminal illness which she wishes to bring to an end at a time of her own choosing by committing suicide.  But she is unable to commit that act as the same illness has deprived of her of the ability to do it without help.  The fact that her illness has driven her to contemplate suicide might be thought to indicate a lack of judgment on her part.  But I believe that the decision which she has taken in such extreme circumstances ought not to be criticised.  It has been stressed she is well able to make rational decisions as to her own future.  I would accept her assurance that she has reached the decision to end her life of her own free will and that she has not been subjected to outside pressure of any kind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72. Important questions of medical ethics and of morality have been raised by her request that her husband should be allowed to help her to end her own life.  They are the subject of detailed comment in the helpful written submissions which have been submitted by the interveners in this appeal.  They are of great interest to society.  But they are not the questions which have brought this matter before the court.  The questions which your Lordships have to decide are questions of law.  Mrs Pretty has invoked the Human Rights Act 1998.  She is entitled to know where the law now stands on the issue of assisted suicide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73. The basic framework within which Mr Havers QC developed his arguments is clear.  The act of suicide itself, for long a common law crime in English law (Blackstone, <i>Commentaries on the Laws of England</i> (1769), vol 4, Chap 14, p 189) is no longer criminal.  Section 1 of the Suicide Act 1961 removed it from the criminal law.  This means that a person who attempts to commit suicide but survives can no longer be prosecuted.  But those who aid, abet, counsel or procure the suicide of another, or an attempt by another, to commit suicide commit an offence.  Section 2(1) of the 1961 Act provides that they shall be liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years.  That is the sanction which would confront Mr Pretty if in any way he were to help, or attempt to help, his wife to end her life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74. Proceedings for an offence under that section cannot be brought except by or with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions: section 2(4).  So Mrs Pretty has asked him to undertake that if Mr Pretty assists her to commit suicide he will not be prosecuted.  The Director says that he is unable to give the undertaking which has been sought.  The argument has therefore focused on Mrs Pretty's rights under the Human Rights Act 1998 and on the powers of the Director.  It proceeds in this way.  Firstly, it is said that the Director has power to give the undertaking which has been sought.  Second, there is the fact that section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998 makes it unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right.  So the argument asserts that the Director is obliged to give the undertaking, because to withhold it would be incompatible with Mrs Pretty's Convention rights.  Third, it is said that if the Director does not have power to give the undertaking, section 2(1) of the 1961 Act is incompatible with her Convention rights as it imposes a blanket and indiscriminate ban on all assisted suicides.</p>
<i><p><i>Section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act 1961</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75. Had it not been for the Human Rights Act 1998, Mrs Pretty's case that the Director was obliged to give the undertaking would have been unarguable.  Section 2(4) of the Suicide Act 1961 leaves no room for doubt on this point.  It leaves decisions as to whether or not a contravention of section 2(1) of the Act should be prosecuted to the discretion of the Director.  But the Director is a public authority for the purposes of section 6(1) of the 1998 Act.  It is unlawful for him to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right.  Section 6(6) provides that "an act" for this purpose includes a failure to act.  A decision as to whether or not to prosecute has been held to be an act for the purposes of section 57(2) of the Scotland Act 1998: <i>Brown v Stott</i> [2001]  2 WLR 817.  I see no reason why the word "an act" in section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998, which applies throughout the United Kingdom, should be construed differently.  I would hold that a decision by the Director whether or not to prosecute is an act for the purposes of that subsection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76. Mr Havers seeks to apply section 6(1) to the refusal of the Director to give an undertaking that he would not prosecute Mr Pretty.  But in my opinion the words "an act", construed with the benefit of section 6(6), do not require a public authority to do something which it has no power to do.  A refusal by a public authority to do something which it has no power to do is not a failure to act.  A public authority can only act within its powers.  Section 6(1) is concerned with acts which are otherwise lawful but are made unlawful by the 1998 Act on Convention grounds.  The Director cannot be held to have acted unlawfully within the meaning of section 6(1) of the 1998 Act when he declined to give the undertaking unless it can be demonstrated that the undertaking was one that he had power to give.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77. In <i>R v Director of Public Prosecutions, Ex p Kebilene</i> [2000]  2 AC 326 it was held that a decision by the Director to consent to a prosecution was not amenable to judicial review, in the absence of dishonesty, mala fides or an exceptional circumstance.  I would approach questions about a refusal by the Director to give an undertaking not to prosecute in the same way.  But a sound rule must not be applied so rigidly that it becomes a denial of justice.  It is important to observe the assumptions on which the rule that was described in that case by Lord Steyn, at p 371F-G, was based.  They were that to allow challenges to be made by means of the judicial review process would open the door to delay in the conduct of criminal proceedings, and that the challenges could and should take place in the criminal trial or on appeal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78. The argument in this case assumes that unless the undertaking is given Mr Pretty will not act to help Mrs Pretty to commit suicide.  If the undertaking is not given there will be nothing to prosecute.  We are not dealing in this case with the straightforward situation in which a person seeks an assurance after the event that he will not be prosecuted.  So it is no answer for Mrs Pretty to be told that the matter should be dealt with at a criminal trial or on appeal.  There will be no criminal trial in which the issue as to whether the Director is acting compatibly with Mrs Pretty's Convention rights can be tested.  In my opinion it is open to her to raise the issue by judicial review in these exceptional circumstances.</p>
<i><p><i>The Director's powers</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79. The question whether or not a law officer (I include in that expression the Director as well as the Government Law Officers) should or should not consent to a prosecution is one which the judiciary must approach with caution and with due deference.  Issues of policy may well be involved, and they should be left to the Government Law Officers to answer for in Parliament.  The issues of fact will be involved, and they may not be suitable for discussion in open court before trial.  In practice therefore our system of public prosecution depends to a large extent on the integrity and judgment of the public prosecutor.  He is likely to be in the best position to judge what is in the public interest.  His judgment must be respected by the judiciary.  It is against that background that I approach the question whether the Director has power to give the undertaking which has been sought.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80. It is important to identify precisely what it is that is being sought from the Director.  He is not being asked simply for a statement about the policy which he will follow in cases of assisted suicide.  If that was all that was being asked for, I would not regard it as beyond his powers to make the statement.  Mr Perry has submitted that he has no such power, but I would not accept that argument.  In my opinion the Director is entitled to form a policy as to the criteria which he will apply when he is exercising his discretion under section 2(4) of the 1961 Act.  If he has such a policy, it seems to me to follow that he is entitled to promulgate it.  I would hold that these matters lie entirely within the scope of the discretion which has been given to him by the Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81. Some guidance is to be found in the practice which is followed in Scotland in the exercise of his common law powers by the Lord Advocate.  A recent example, following the decision of the Court of Session in <i>Law Hospital NHS Trust v Lord Advocate</i>, 1996  SLT 848, is to be found in his statement of policy regarding prosecutions following the withdrawal of life sustaining treatment from patients in a permanent or persistent vegetative state: see pp 860D-E and 867B-C of that report.  Another is the statement issued in September 1983 by the Crown Agent on behalf of the Lord Advocate, following a statement to the same effect issued on 25 March 1983 by the Home Office (Home Office Circular No 46/1983), as to the policy which would be followed in the prosecution of drivers for drink driving offences based on evidence produced by a breath testing machine: see <i>Lockhart v Deighan</i>, 1985  SLT 549.  The Lord Advocate has not issued a statement as to his policy regarding the prosecution of assisted suicide, which in Scotland is a common law crime.  He would have power to do so if he thought that in the public interest this was appropriate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82. But I do not see how the Director could be compelled to issue a statement of policy.  In Scotland the question whether such statements should be issued are regarded as being entirely a matter for the Lord Advocate.  It has never been suggested that he could be ordered to do this by the court.  But in any event it is not as a statement of policy that the undertaking has been sought.  What Mrs Pretty seeks is an undertaking, before the event occurs, that if her husband helps her to commit suicide he will not be prosecuted.  I am not aware of any case where the Lord Advocate has given an undertaking of that kind.  It is not his function to permit individuals to commit acts which the law treats as criminal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83. Mrs Pretty contends that the Director is obliged to give the undertaking because, if he were to decline to give it, he would be acting incompatibly with her Convention rights.  As I see it, this argument raises two distinct issues.  The first is whether any of Mrs Pretty's Convention rights are engaged at all in this case.  Unless it can be shown that the Director's refusal is incompatible with at least one of them, the argument that section 6(1) of the 1998 Act makes it unlawful for him to refuse the undertaking disappears.  The second is whether, if Mrs Pretty's Convention rights are engaged, the undertaking which she has sought is one which the Director is obliged to give to her.  I have already indicated that this raises difficult issues of both fact and policy.  I shall deal first with Mrs Pretty's Convention rights. </p>
<i><p><i>The Convention rights</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84. Mr Havers submitted that Mrs Pretty has a Convention right to the assistance of her husband in committing suicide.  He was at pains to point out that her case under the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms was not that it gave her a right to die.  She was asserting a right to control how and when she died as part of her right to life, without being discriminated against on account of her physical disability.  She was also asserting a right of self-determination.  She had made up her own mind about the course which she wished to follow to end her life.  She would, but for her disability, have intended to follow that course without seeking assistance from anybody.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85. As I said earlier, it is not for us to form a judgment on the ethical or moral issues which these submissions have raised.  That they have a part to play in the making of our laws is not in doubt: see the Report of the House of Lords Select Committee on Medical Ethics 1994 (Session 1993-94, HL 21-I).  The Convention too is the product of a broad consensus of international opinion about the core values which demand respect for human life and human dignity.  It is against that background that we must answer the question which she has raised, which is a question of law.  It is whether the articles of the Convention on which she relies confer the rights she needs to demonstrate if she is to make good her argument that the Director's refusal to give the undertaking is unlawful under section 6(1) of the 1998 Act.  We must pay close attention to the words used in the Convention and, where appropriate, to the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights.  Throughout, we must bear in mind that the rights which are in question are rights which the individual has against the state.  They do not exist in the abstract.  Their function is to control the actions of the state in its relationship with the individual.</p>
<i><p><i>(a) article 2</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86. The short point here is whether the Director's refusal to give the undertaking is incompatible with the first sentence of this article.  It provides that everyone's right to life "shall be protected by law."  The remaining parts of the article deal with the circumstances in which a person may be deprived of life.  They plainly have nothing to do with Mrs Pretty's dispute with the Director.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87. It is important to observe both what the sentence says and what it does not say.  The right to which it refers is the right to life.  But it does not create a right to life.  The right to life is assumed to be inherent in the human condition which we all share.  Nor does it create a right to self-determination.  It does not say that every person has the right to choose how or when to die.  Nor does it say that the individual has a right to choose death rather than life.  What the first sentence does - and all it does - is to state that the right to life must be protected by law.  This protection operates both negatively and positively.  It enjoins the state to refrain from the intentional and unlawful taking of life.  It also enjoins the state to safeguard lives: <i>Osman v United Kingdom</i> (1998)  29 EHRR 245, 305, para 115.  But the protection of human life is its sole object.</p>
