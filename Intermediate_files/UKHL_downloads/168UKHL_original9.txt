<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;206.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although old and in some respects unsatisfactory, the case-law of the late 18th and early 19th centuries remains the relevant backdrop. Neither in debt nor in a claim for money had and received could interest be recoverable (save where agreed or in the case of a negotiable instrument): cf <i>Walker v. Constable </i>(1798) 1 B &amp; P 306, <i>De Bernales v. Fuller </i>(1810) 2 Camp. 426 and <i>Depcke v. Munn </i>(1828) 3 C &amp; P 112 (all cases of claims for money had and received), and <i>Page v. Newman </i>(1829) 9 B &amp; C 378 (interest not recoverable on loan not repaid when due). In <i>Arnott v. Redfern</i> (1826) 3 Bing 352, 359 Best CJ referred to the general rule that interest was not recoverable as one which</p>
<p></p><ul>"wisely prevents acts of kindness from being converted into mercenary bargains, and makes it in the interest of tradesmen to press their customers for payment of their debts; and thereby checks the extension of credit, which is often ruinous to tradesmen and customers".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he suggested that interest might be recovered in a case of "unjust detention", by which he meant wrongful refusal of payment after demand for payment. In <i>Page v. Newman</i>, Lord Tenterden CJ dismissed this suggestion, at p 381, on the basis that if there were such a rule "it might frequently be made a question …. whether the proper means had been used to obtain payment of the debt", which "would be productive of great inconvenience" and the court ought not to depart from the "long-established" contrary rule. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;207.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>London Chatham and Dover Railway Company v. South Eastern Railway Company </i>[1893] AC 429, 438 the House discounted as not "very satisfactory" rules (the last, that interest might be recovered where proof was "given of the money being used") suggested by Lord Ellenborough in <i>De Havilland v. Bowerbank </i>(1807) 1 Camp. 50, 52 (another claim for money had and received). The Act then promoted by Lord Tenterden in 1833 (3 &amp; 4 Wm. 4, c. 42) introduced only a very limited extension of the circumstances in which interest might be recovered.  Under s. 28 interest might on the trial of any issue or on any inquisition of damages be allowed, if thought fit, but only on "debts or sums certain …. payable by virtue of some written instrument at a certain  time, or if payable otherwise, then from the time when demand of payment shall have been made in writing" giving "notice to the debtor that interest will be claimed from the date of such demand". S. 29 also permitted an award of damages in the nature of interest on the value of goods in actions of trover or trespass <i>de bonis asportatis</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;208.&nbsp;&nbsp;Claims in debt and for money had and received were thus treated together in the early authorities, and it is I think clear that the wording of Lord Tenterden's Act covered both. This was indeed assumed by counsel in argument in <i>Fruhling v. Schroeder </i>(1835) 2 Bing (NC) 78, 80, where Tindal CJ held, following the early decisions, that "in money had and received, the net sum only can be recovered". The decisions of Brandon J in <i>The Aldora </i>[1975] QB 748 and Robert Goff J in <i>B. P. Exploration Co. (Libya) Ltd. v. Hunt (No 2) </i>[1979] 1 WLR 783, 835-7, affirmed in this House at [1983] 2 AC 352, 373-4, that restitutionary claims fell within the replacement 1934 Act were not revolutionary; the second case merely concerned a particular problem about bringing a claim under the Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943 within the statutory language.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;209.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am unpersuaded by the academic suggestion (Edelman &amp; Cassidy, <i>Interest Awards in Australia</i> (2003), Chap. 5, p. 93) that the law's attitude to interest in claims for money had and received was shaped by the fiction that such claims arose "as it were upon a contract". The full passage from Lord Mansfield's judgment in <i>Moses v. Macferlan </i>(1760) 2 Burr 1005, 1008 indicated where "the defendant be under an obligation, from the ties of natural justice, to refund", then "the law implies a debt, and gives this action, founded in the equity of the plaintiff's case, as it were upon a contract ('<i>quasi ex contractu</i>', as the Roman law expresses it)".  Lord Mansfield went on carefully to distinguish the features of claims in contract and for money had and received, and showed that he were well aware of the different considerations actually underpinning these different claims, consensus on the one hand and natural justice or equity in a broad sense on the other. It seems to me that the law's attitude to interest was shaped not by conceptual confusion, but by policy-driven concerns (however debatable) regarding interest which may well have had historical roots, and which find an echo to this day in modern legislation and Law Commission reports (including their most recent report <i>Pre-judgment Interest on Debts and Damages </i>dated 23 February 2004, (Law Com No 287) where it shaped their recommendations: cf especially at paras. 5.15 through 5.40). They also found an echo in the speech of Lord Lloyd of Berwick in <i>Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v. Islington London BC </i>[1996] AC 669, 741A-F.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;210.&nbsp;&nbsp;The legal position after Lord Tenterden's Act was considered in the <i>London, Chatham and Dover </i>case [1893] AC 429, where <i>De Havilland</i>, <i>Arnott v. Redfern </i>and <i>Page v. Newman </i>were examined. On the facts, the Act was inapplicable, and the House held, with some regret, that no claim could be made by the plaintiffs at common law "by way of damages in respect of the wrongful detention of their debt" (per Lord Herschell LC at p.437). Lord Herschell thought that the limits imposed by the Act "seem to be too narrow for the purposes of justice". But having regard to <i>Page v. Newman </i>"and to the statute passed subsequently with obvious reference to it by the Legislature", and the absence since that time" of any contrary case he did not "think it would be possible nowadays to reopen the question, even in this House, and to hold that interest under such circumstances could be awarded" (pp.440-1).  Lord Shand regretted that English law was not like the law of Scotland where "it is the common and ordinary practice, in bringing an action for money which is due, to conclude not only for the payment of that money but for the payment of interest upon it from the date of citation or service of the summons, and interest is decreed as a matter of course on whatever balance is found to be due" (p. 443).  But I note that Lord Shand spoke of interest only from citation or service, and also of an award that would, I understand, be of simple, not compound interest. In <i>Johnson v. The King </i>[1904] AC 817 the Privy Council held, consistently with the above, that, fraud aside, interest could not be recovered in law or equity on monies recoverable as having been paid under a mistake.  But it was submitted to the Board in support of an award of interest that "Johnson, who was a trader, must have made a profit by the use of the money which was in his hands for a year", and the way in which the Board dealt with this submission is of some interest, viz: "That is very probable, but there is no proof of it" (p. 822).  The case was one where the monies received were paid into court, and accepted in partial satisfaction of the claim, during the proceedings for their recovery, but the plaintiff had continued to trial to seek interest as "special damage for the loss of use of the money during the periods of detention".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;211.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1934 s.3(1) of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934 gave effect to the recommendations on interest in the Second Interim Report of a distinguished Law Revision Committee, chaired by Lord Hanworth MR (Cmd 4546). The Act expanded the circumstances in which interest might be awarded, to provide for the discretionary award of simple interest on any debt or damages for which judgment was given by a court. In June 1978 the Law Commission issued a Report on Interest (Law Com No 88; Cmnd. 7229) which recommended, first, a general rule that contract debts (but <i>not</i> "debts due in quasi-contract") should carry <i>simple</i> interest at a statutory rate (paras. 218 and 221), and, second, that the provisions of the 1934 Act should be replaced by a wider discretionary power for the court in any proceeding for debt or damages to award simple interest in respect of sums recovered or paid without a trial or before judgment (paras. 236-9). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;212.&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament adopted only the second recommendation when in 1982 it replaced the provisions of the 1934 Act with s. 35A of the Supreme Court Act 1981.  In the meanwhile, there had been a common law development. Building on remarks of Lord Denning in <i>Trans Trust Sprl v. Danubian Trading Co. Ltd. </i>[1952] 2 QB 297, the Court of Appeal in <i>Wadsworth v. Lydall </i>[1981] 1 WLR 598 allowed recovery of interest as "special damages" for failure to pay £10,000 to complete an agreement to dissolve a partnership. On the strength of the agreement, the claiming partner had committed himself to complete a purchase of another property which he was unable to complete on time, so becoming liable to pay his seller the interest for non-completion. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;213.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the <i>President of India v. La Pintada Co. Nav. SA </i>[1985] AC 104, the House re-affirmed the principle in the <i>London Chatham </i>case. Lord Brandon of Oakbrook (in a speech with which all other members agreed) observed in passing that the <i>London, Chatham and Dover </i>decision "was regarded as applying to any form of damages" (cf p.115F). However, he identified some common law exceptions, as well as the statutory interventions discussed above. One exception was Admiralty law, under which simple interest had been awarded on damages recovered in a damage action for more than a century and on sums recovered in a salvage action since 1975, and it had been assumed, he said, that interest would likewise also be recovered in an action for a contractual debt (p.115G-H). Another was equity, in which Chancery courts regularly awarded simple interest in respect of equitable remedies "such as specific performance, rescission and the taking of an account", and compound interest was awarded "when they thought that justice so demanded, that is to say in cases where money had been obtained and retained by fraud, or where it had been withheld or misapplied by a trustee or anyone else in a fiduciary position" (p.116A-B). Lord Brandon also identified and approved the "important judicial inroad into the previously accepted understanding of the scope of the decision" made in <i>Wadsworth v. Lydall </i>(p 125G-H). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;214.&nbsp;&nbsp;The House revisited the topic in <i>President of India v. Lips Maritime Corporation </i>[1988] AC 395, where a claim for a currency exchange loss through late payment of demurrage failed on the straightforward basis that demurrage is liquidated damages, and the law knows no such thing as a claim for damages for failing to pay damages. Lord Brandon, in a speech with which three other members of the House agreed, again considered the scope of the <i>London, Chatham and Dover </i>case at p.424B-G and indicated that (despite the understanding about its application to "any form of damages" - cf paragraph 213 above) its scope is strictly confined to claims to recover interest as damages for late payment of a debt. Claims for other losses (such as exchange losses) by way of damages for late payment of a debt differed significantly because there was no "previously established law comparable to that laid down in the<i> London, Chatham and Dover</i> …. case" and "no statutory provisions …. which could conflict with any right of recovery at common law" (p. 424D). Accordingly "claims to recover currency exchange losses as damages for breach of contract, whether the breach relied on is late payment of a debt or any other breach, are subject to the same rules as apply to claims for damages for breach of contract" (p.424E).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;215.&nbsp;&nbsp;As my noble and learned friend, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, points out in his opinion at paragraphs [85 to 89], it is difficult to follow or accept Lord Brandon's explanation of the term "special damages" by reference to the second rule in <i>Hadley v. Baxendale </i>(1854) 9 Exch. 34: see also the criticisms by Dr F. A. Mann in <i>On Interest, Compound Interest and Damages</i> (1985) 101 LQR 30, 34-35 and by Staughton LJ in <i>President of India v. Lips Maritime Corporation </i>[1985] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 180, 185. Since Lord Brandon described the first rule in <i>Hadley v. Baxendale </i>as dealing with "general damages", the difficulty is, if anything, greater. The two limbs of <i>Hadley v. Baxendale</i> are the practical expression of a single principle (inspired by the civil law) that parties should only be liable for damages which were when they contracted within their contemplation in the event of a breach. The precise line between the two limbs is itself hazy - especially in the modern legal environment where it is axiomatic and integral to contractual construction that it occurs not in a vacuum, but in the light of all surrounding circumstances within the parties' knowledge. When seeking to distinguish the two limbs for present purposes, Lord Brandon quoted Lord Denning's citation in the <i>Trans Trust</i> case, at p 306, of a passage from Bullen &amp; Leake (3rd ed., at p.51) stating that the ground on which the <i>London, Chatham and Dover </i>case rested was "that interest is generally presumed not to be within the contemplation of the parties" (the important word "not" is omitted from the quotation at p.124H in the Appeal Cases report of the <i>La Pintada </i>case). But Lord Denning's statement as to the general position does not exclude the existence of transactions, the very terms and nature of which makes it patent without more that loss of interest is likely to result from breach (i.e. falling within the first rather than the second limb of <i>Hadley v. Baxendale</i>). Further, when the Court of Appeal in <i>Wadsworth v. Lydall </i>[1981] 1 WLR 598 distinguished the <i>London, Chatham and Dover </i>case on the ground that it concerned general rather than special damages, I think it clear that they meant by special damages any damages provable under either limb of <i>Hadley v. Baxendale</i>: cf p. 603F-G. Indeed, the award of interest in<i> Wadsworth v. Lydall</i> itself was based as much on what was self-evident from the nature of the particular transaction as on any special communication: see per Brightman LJ at p.602E-F and Ormerd LJ at p.605 D-F. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;216.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, nevertheless, still fair to assume that loss of interest is not within the parties' contemplation under many everyday contracts. It is in this context material that a contracting party has the opportunity to stipulate for, or reserve the right to claim, interest in the event of breach.  The distinction emphasised by the House in <i>Koufos v. C. Czarnikow Ltd. </i>[1969] 1 AC 350 between, on the one hand, what is to be taken as within contracting parties' reasonable contemplation and, on the other hand, what may be said to be reasonably foreseeable for the purpose of a claim for purely tortious damages remains good. So, to take some examples within the first limb: a householder who pays a builder's or shop's account late or very late should not (in the absence of contractual agreement or special circumstances) be taken to have within his or her contemplation for the purposes of <i>Hadley v. Baxendale</i> damage in the form of interest (or <i>a fortiori </i>compound interest); in contrast, a loan contract made specifically to enable an individual to refinance pre-existing loans or complete a property purchase could appear of its nature very likely, if broken, to give rise to the individual incurring damage by way of interest. Again, in the business to business sphere, while the business context may make it easier to show that loss by way of interest was within the parties' reasonable contemplation, this cannot follow automatically. The Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998 (to which I refer later in this opinion) cannot be relegated to the status of a measure providing for simple interest either as a convenient and easier alternative to damages or in situations where no interest loss at all has been suffered. The present case should not therefore be seen as a charter for claims, still less for claims on a compound basis, in respect of interest losses following a breach of contract, where there is no contractual stipulation for its recovery, simply because it can be said that the situation was one where loss of interest might foreseeably, and did in fact, follow on breach. Neither general principle nor the cautious approach of Parliament and the Law Commission (to which I refer further below) would justify this. Before loss by way of interest is recoverable as damages, the higher threshold of reasonable contemplation must be crossed. Whether this has occurred depends on the particular case. But it is not appropriate to draw a line between the two limbs of <i>Hadley v. Baxendale </i>in the manner suggested in the <i>La Pintada </i>and <i>Lips </i>cases. Loss of interest is recoverable as damages for breach of contract, if it was within the reasonable contemplation of the parties, in the sense explained in <i>Koufos v. C. Czarnikow Ltd.</i>, under either limb when the contract was made and is specifically pleaded and proved on that basis. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;217.&nbsp;&nbsp;The rule in the <i>London, Chatham and Dover </i>case being thus confined, no reason appears why claims for loss of interest in tort, should be subject to special rules. In tort, there is generally no possibility of stipulating for the recovery of interest and the test of reasonable foresight, as opposed to contractual contemplation, operates as a significantly less strict pre-condition to recovery. The possibility of recovering such loss in tort has been recognised without reference to the <i>London, Chatham and Dover </i>case in <i>Brandeis Goldschmidt &amp; Co Ltd v. Western Transport Ltd </i>[1981] QB 864, 873 (Brandon LJ), <i>Swingcastle Ltd. v. Alastair Gibson </i>[1991] 2 AC 223 (where the defendant valuer was not in contractual relations with the claimant lender (cf p.227D-F), and was referred to accordingly by Lord Lowry at p.239C-D as the "tortfeasor"), <i>Nigerian National Shipping Lines Ltd. v. Mutual Ltd. (The Windfall) </i>[1998] 2 Ll.R. 664, (Rix J) and <i>The Mortgage Corporation v. Halifax (SW) Limited </i>[1999] 1 Ll.R Prof. Neg. 159 (HHJ Laurie). <i>La Pintada </i>was, on the other hand, referred to in <i>I. M. Properties Plc v. Cape &amp; Dalgleish </i>[1999] QB 297 and <i>Blue Circle Industries Plc v. Ministry of Defence</i> [1999] Ch 289, but in each case the Court of Appeal was concerned with claims to interest at conventional rates under s. 35A of the Supreme Court Act 1981 on moneys which had been recovered in mitigation of the claimants' loss prior to action brought. In the former case, the Court concluded, correctly in my view, that the similar award made in the <i>Westdeutsche </i>case had been made <i>per incuriam</i>. In both cases, the Court acknowledged the possibility that the claimants might have been able to plead and prove a claim for special damage consisting of loss of interest, but none had been. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;218.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v. Islington London BC </i>[1996] AC 669 the argument proceeded, not surprisingly, on the basis that there was no power at common law to award compound (or, indeed, apart from statute, simple) interest (cf per Lord Goff at p.684G-H, Lord Browne-Wilkinson at p.700H and 717E-H, Lord Slynn at p.718F-H (although referring to the common law "as presently formulated"), Lord Woolf at p.722C-F and 730H-731A and 731F and Lord Lloyd at p.737B-C). The common law recognises a claim for money had and received, but, in the absence of a proprietary claim (and none is advanced by Sempra in this case), the money received belongs to the recipient while he holds it. Any interest received thereon thus also becomes the recipient's. The common law does not recognise a claim against him for the use had of money had and received. Professor Birks points out that Lord Mansfield made clear in <i>Nightingale v. Bevisme </i>(1770) 5 Burr. 2589 (citing <i>Moses v. Macferlan </i>(1760) 2 Burr. 1005) that "'money received' meant what it said: the words could not be extended to other things" (cf An Introduction to the Law of Restitution, p 113). The subsequent cases cited in paragraph 206 above underline the point. The situation differs where there is a proprietary claim. The fruits or offspring of my property in your hands are mine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;219.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once a proprietary claim was ruled out, the issue in <i>Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v. Islington London BC </i>[1996] AC 669 became whether compound interest was recoverable in equity. The bank had paid £2.5 million to the council under a swap agreement, later established to be ultra vires the council. "Interest" payments totalling £1,354,474 were made by the council to the bank in 1988-89. The bank then commenced proceedings to recover the balance of the £2.5 million which it had paid, plus compound interest. The Court of Appeal awarded compound interest on the balance from time to time outstanding from 18th June 1987. Until the hearing before the House of Lords it was assumed in the light of <i>Sinclair v. Brougham </i>[1914] AC 398 that the council was liable as a fiduciary, and the claim for interest was made in equity on this basis (under the exception recognised by Lord Brandon in <i>La Pintada</i>). But, in the House of Lords, the House decided to hear argument on the correctness of <i>Sinclair v. Brougham</i>, and in the event held that it was wrongly decided. The width of equity's power to award compound interest came thus into focus, although only at the end of long argument on other matters and in circumstances where the council was unwilling to devote more resources to a further day's submissions (cf pp.679C, 717G-H and 738F-G).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;220.&nbsp;&nbsp;By a majority (Lord Goff and Lord Woolf dissenting) the House refused to award compound interest in equity. The majority felt that any amendment of the law was a matter for Parliament: cf per Lord Browne-Wilkinson at pp. 717G-718C, Lord Slynn at pp.718H-719A and Lord Lloyd at pp.738D-741G, especially at p740D-741A). I have noted above the Court of Appeal's conclusion in the <i>I. M. Properties </i>case that the order made in the <i>Westdeutsche </i>case was <i>per incuriam </i>so far as it awarded simple interest on the balance outstanding from time to time but paid by the date when action was commenced. The Court of Appeal assumed, rightly in my view, that this order was made under s.35A of the Supreme Court Act 1981. There is no sign of any submission that equity enabled an award of simple interest on a sum recovered prior to action brought. All three of the majority in the <i>Westdeutsche </i>case concentrated on rejecting the minority's argument that equity could award <i>compound </i>interest in aid of a personal common law claim for money had and received. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;221.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1996 Parliament enacted the Arbitration Act giving an arbitration tribunal express power, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, to "award simple or compound interest from such dates, at such rates and with such rests as it considers meets the justice of the case" (section 49(3)) In 1998 Parliament enacted the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998, later amended by the Late Payment of Commercial Debts Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No. 1674), providing for a right to <i>simple</i> interest on the unpaid price of goods or services as from any agreed date of payment, or otherwise as from 30 days after the supplier's performance or notice to the purchaser of the amount of the debt or, where that amount is unascertained, the amount claimed as the debt.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;222.&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the <i>Westdeutsche </i>decision, the Law Commission in its Seventh Programme of Law Reform (1999) Law Com 259. p. 11, recommended an examination of the courts' power to award compound interest. This led to its consultation paper (No. 167) in 2002 and its "Report on Pre-Judgment Interest on Debts and Damages" (No. 287) of 23 February 2004. The Law Commission proceeded in the light of authority on the basis that at common law no interest was recoverable on a claim for money had and received (para. 2.42 of the consultation paper). It understood (para. 5.16 of the Report) that:</p>
<p></p><ul>"… compound interest evokes deep-seated fears. Where people are too poor even to service a loan, interest can become 'a slippery slope to a situation of hopeless debt'. Where interest is compound, interest increases in an exponential rather than a linear way, which can make the calculation appear frightening and unpredictable."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this, one might add that it is not very many decades ago that double digit inflation was known in this country, and experience in the Privy Council of appeals from the West Indies, where it is still prevalent, includes banking cases where claims have multiplied several times in size with compound interest. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;223.&nbsp;&nbsp;To allay the fears it had identified, the Law Commission observed in para. 5.17 of the Report that compound interest was already paid in common situations and that</p>
<p></p><ul>"Following our recommendations, interest awards will remain discretionary. It will always be open to a court not to award any interest, or only to award it at a low rate".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In para. 5.27-5.28 it addressed three reasons put to it for preferring simple to compound interest (viz to protect poor consumers, to discourage claimants from deliberately delaying claims and to avoid the cost of calculating compound interest), by saying (para. 5.28) that</p>
<p></p><ul>"In most cases, however, the main way of protecting poor consumers is not to award interest at all (or only at a very low rate). The main way to discourage delay is for courts to exercise their existing discretion to award interest for only part of the period from cause of action to judgment or payment. The essential reason for preferring simple to compound interest lies in the cost of calculation. It therefore follows that there should be a presumption in favour of compound interest where the difference between the two is significant, and in favour of simple interest where the difference is insignificant."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;224.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the upshot the Law Commission, after consulting the judiciary, recommended that the Civil Procedure Rule Committee should have power to give guidance on when compound interest should be awarded a and that the rules should distinguish between awards or settlements of less than £15,000 (where there should be a rebuttable presumption that interest would be simple) and more than £15,000 (the reverse), and that the rules should exclude compound interest on any debts or damages outstanding for less than a year, unless the claimant could show exceptional contrary reasons. The Law Commission's "Annual Report 2006-7" (Law Com No 306) printed by order of the House of Commons dated 13 June 2007, para. 3.54 records that "after three years we have not yet heard whether our recommendations are accepted".</p>
