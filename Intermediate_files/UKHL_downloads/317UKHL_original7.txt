<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words Lord Brougham held that, since the debtor and the trustee in sequestration are different persons, the trustee is not affected by any personal obligations that may have affected the debtor.  On the other hand the trustee does take the heritable estate subject to the obligations that affected the estate in the debtor's hands.  But, since purely personal obligations do not affect the heritable estate as such, the real right that the trustee takes is not subject to any burden.  It followed that when Stuart's estate had vested in the hands of the trustee it had been unaffected by any possible obligation of Stuart to Walker to grant a heritable security over the remainder of the 95 acres.  Impliedly, at least, Lord Brougham rejected the more detailed argument for the appellants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;138.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Heritable Reversionary Co Ltd v Millar </i>(1892) 19 R (HL) 43, 48 Lord Watson was careful to distinguish and not to cast doubt on the decision in <i>Walker's Trs v Stuart's Tr </i>or in any of the earlier cases.  Indeed he expressly said, at p 48, that he had no doubt that the doctrine of <i>tantum et tale</i> had no application in the circumstances of <i>Russell v Ross's Creditors.  </i>He then went on to point out that in that case and in <i>Mitchells v Ferguson</i>, <i>Wylie v Duncan</i> and <i>Mansfield v Walker's Trs</i> the application of the <i>tantum et tale </i>doctrine had been rejected where the creditor was in competition "with others who had prior but merely personal rights to demand a conveyance from him [sc the debtor]."  There is therefore nothing in Lord Watson's reasoning that affects the clear line of authority which governs this case.  Similarly, in <i>Coloquhouns' Tr v Campbell's Trs</i> (1902) 4 F 739, 743 - 744 Lord Kinnear regarded <i>Mansfield v Walker </i>as a correct statement of the law.</p>
<i>
<p>The race to the register</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;139.&nbsp;&nbsp;In his <i>Commentaries on the recent statutes relative to... sequestration in mercantile bankruptcy </i>(1840), p 168, in Observation 2 on section 25 of the Bankruptcy (Scotland) Act 1839, Bell said that its effect with regard to such heritable property as requires sasine:</p>
<p></p><ul>"is to make the trustee run a race of diligence for the obtaining of sasine with creditors holding an inchoated security;  the first completed right being preferable."<p></p></ul>
<p>Bell's view is particularly authoritative since he had been the principal architect of the 1839 Act.  In his <i>Digest of the Bankruptcy (Scotland) Act 1856 </i>(1856), p 151 note at p 153 Alexander records that this view "does not appear to have been ever challenged."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;140.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Lord Melville v Paterson </i>(1842) 4 D 1311 a question arose about the application of the vesting provisions of the 1839 Act in a case where the debtor had died.  Citing Bell in support, the Lord Ordinary (Ivory), whose decision was affirmed by the Second Division, referred to the position in the sequestration of a living debtor in this way, at p 1315:</p>
<p></p><ul>"No doubt, the right thus declared to be vested in the trustee, will be no more than a right tantum et tale with what actually belonged to the bankrupt at the date of sequestration;  and where the bankrupt, therefore, has previously granted a prior <i>personal right</i>, in the shape of a conveyance or security, to an individual creditor or other third party, upon which it would be in the power of such a party to run a race against the trustee, it may be necessary for the latter, with a view to exclude the completion of this inchoate adverse right, to obtain his own title <i>first completed</i> according to all the feudal forms, and so entered upon the records."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same idea of a race for the first registration between the uninfeft purchaser from the debtor and the uninfeft trustee in his sequestration is found, for example, in J Burns, "English and Scottish Bankruptcies" (1913) 29 LQR 460, 463.  Contrary to what Lord Maclean supposed, 2002 SLT 699, 707C, in the present case the parties were taking part in just such a race.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;141.&nbsp;&nbsp;For modern readers at least, the image of a race tends to conjure up a sporting contest played according to rules - in which, to use Lord Justice Clerk Thomson's slightly mixed metaphor, offside goals are not allowed.  Nothing could be more misleading.  In Scots law the competition between the trustee and the uninfeft purchaser or creditor with an unrecorded heritable security is a struggle in deadly earnest with the aim of destroying the other competitor's chance to obtain the real right by recording the relevant deed and infefting himself first.  Those taking part in this race are no Corinthians and swear no Olympic oath of sportsmanship.  If your opponent is slow off the mark, mistakes the way or stumbles, you do not chivalrously wait for him to catch up:  you take full advantage of his mistakes.  Nice guys finish last and don't get the real right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;142.&nbsp;&nbsp;A purchaser cannot knowingly enter such a race with an earlier purchaser.  Rather, if a purchaser becomes aware "that there may be a prior purchaser in the same queue for Register House he must ask the latter if he be such a purchaser and in the event of a positive, correct answer yield place to him":  <i>Alex Brewster v Caughey </i>2002 GWD 15-506, at para 73 per Lord Eassie.  But Stair, <i>Institutions of the Law of Scotland </i>1.14.5 draws the critical distinction between purchasers and those, such as adjudging creditors, exercising legal diligence, who are aware that someone has bought the property but is not yet infeft:</p>
<p></p><ul>"But certain knowledge, by intimation, citation, or the like, inducing <i>malam fidem</i>, whereby any prior disposition or assignation made to another party is certainly known, or at least interruption made in acquiring by arrestment or citation of the acquirer, such rights acquired, not being of necessity to satisfy prior engagements, are reducible <i>ex capite fraudis, </i>and the acquirer is partaker of the fraud of his author, who thereby becomes a granter of double rights;  but this will not hinder legal diligence to proceed and be completed and become effectual, though the user thereof did certainly know any inchoate or incomplete right of another."<p></p></ul>
<p>Any right that the purchaser acquires when he knows of the previous sale is reducible on the ground that he is participating in the seller's fraud.  But knowledge of a previous sale does not prevent a creditor from completing his diligence and acquiring a real right:  he is entitled to proceed on the basis of the feudal right of the debtor to heritable subjects as recorded in the register and to disregard any personal right relating to those subjects.  That principle underlies the decisions in <i>Douglas v Adjudging Creditors of Kelhead</i> (1765) 3 Ross's LC 169 and <i>Mitchells v Ferguson </i>(1781) M 10296;  Hailes 879;  3 Ross's LC 120.  Moreover, as the pleadings show, in <i>Mitchells </i>counsel for the adjudgers argued successfully that, if Ferguson had not himself chosen</p>
<p></p><ul>"to take this step of diligence, or omitted to do it while it was in his power, the fault is his own, and he ought to suffer for his negligence.  But the respondents surely cannot be blamed for employing the diligence of the law, in order to recover payment of a just debt.  The maxim of law is <i>Vigilantibus jura subveniunt</i>."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;143.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Russell v Ross's Creditors,</i> sub nom <i>Pierse v Ross </i>(1792) 3 Ross's LC 177, 181 Lord Justice Clerk Braxfield made very clear the wholly different standards that the law applies to purchasers as opposed to creditors who are trying to secure their right:</p>
<p></p><ul>"There is a great distinction between voluntary conveyances and legal diligence of creditors.  When a person takes a voluntary conveyance, the law presumes that he will take care that he will not accept of a conveyance but from a person having a good right, and the fair presumption is, that to be satisfied of this he has searched the records, and among others the Register of Tailzies, and if he there find an entail on record, though no infeftment upon it, he would be in <i>mala fide</i> to accept of a conveyance from the heir of entail.  But where a creditor has lent money, he is in law and in justice entitled to take every lawful means to secure his payment, and therefore though a creditor should discover that his debtor was heir in an entail that had been recorded, but upon which infeftment had not been taken, the creditor is in <i>bona fide</i> to disregard this personal deed of entail, and proceed to attach his debtor's estate by means of a charge to enter heir to his predecessor, and to adjudge, and by doing so he will take the estate free from the fetters of a personal deed of entail."<p></p></ul>
<p>Referring to this case, in his observations on <i>Calder v Stewart</i> (1806) Hume 440, 443, Baron Hume speaks of the creditor affecting his debtor's lands with diligence "in contempt of the tailzie" for payment of his debts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;144.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Mansfield v Walker's Trs </i>(1833) 11 S 813, 828, under reference to <i>Duke of Norfolk v Annuitants of the York Buildings Co </i>(1752) M 7062, Lord Craigie observed:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is a rule established with us, beyond all memory, that there are no equities in competitions among creditors.  This principle was adopted, and carried to its fullest extent, in the case of the Duke of Norfolk in 1752….  It has been held, that vigilantibus non dormientibus jura subveniunt;  and although no one ought to become locupletior aliena jactura, yet in damno vitando, every one is entitled to avail himself of the blunders of those whose interests are opposed to his.  However clear and honest the intentions of parties may have been, yet, if the writings used are liable to objection in point of form or solemnity, and still more, if, as in this case, they are defective in the substantial parts, they are in a competition held as inoperative and null….  So, after a competition has begun, a party conscious of a defect in his own right may, by any lawful means, but always without the aid of the bankrupt, direct or indirect, correct the defect pendente lite, so as to be preferred to his adversary, although formerly in a better situation than himself.  On looking into the books of authority and the decisions of the court, to be found under the titles of Competition, Execution and Writ, it will be seen that the most minute and critical objections, in point of external formality, or arising from the want of proper and technical words in the instrument, have been sustained.  In such circumstances, and notwithstanding the most satisfactory evidence of intention to give a right, the existence of another deed, followed with infeftment, before the former one has been completed, must create an undoubted preference.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>These observations are not disputed in the general case.  It is the first regular infeftment in real estate - the first act of delivery in the transfer of moveables - and the assignation or conveyance first intimated in personal rights, that is preferred;  although before any of these forms have been gone through, an obligation to dispone, or to make delivery, or to give a valid assignation, can be shown.  Particularly in recorded real rights, if appearing in the appropriate register, unless fraud can be proved, the entry in the record is the only evidence that can be depended upon;  without this a form calculated to give security to creditors and purchasers would become a snare to them."<p></p></ul>
<p>Having mentioned more recent cases where there had been an attempt to question the position in the case of adjudications of lands, Lord Craigie referred to earlier cases and continued, at p 829:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Thus, in the case of base rights prior to the establishment of the registers for publication, a later conveyance or adjudication, if followed by possession, was preferred to the former ones, although clearly importing an obligation to make an effectual transmission of the right;  and so, in the case of personal rights of lands, he who obtains the first infeftment will be preferred.  In the these cases, although before possession has followed in the one case, or infeftment in the other, the party so situated may have become acquainted with the conveyance prior in date, still he will be preferred;  and it would be singular if the result were different."<p></p></ul>
<p>Lord Balgray, at p 831, referred to the mistake made by Stuart in conveying only five instead of 95 acres of land and said that this no doubt created an obligation on him to apply the proper correction</p>
<p></p><ul>"- but this extends no further than the parties immediately concerned.  Creditors certainly cannot benefit themselves by fraud, but being certantes de damno vitando they have been always considered to be entitled to take advantage of errors and mistakes, to the effect of obtaining a fair and equal distribution of their debtor's effects."<p></p></ul>
<p>Similarly, in <i>Earl of Fife v Duff</i> (1862) 24 D 936, 942 the Whole Court were careful to say that the personal fee was of no effect "against third parties who may attach the estate by legal execution for the debts of the disponer, or who may in bona fide purchase it from him, and be first infeft."  The requirement of good faith applies only to purchasers.</p>
<i>
<p>The winner of the race</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;145.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, in the present case the respondent has done nothing more than take advantage of the mistake or error of his rivals, the appellants, in failing to get off their mark and record the disposition from Mrs Burnett promptly.  Even once their agents had become aware that her estate had been sequestrated and that the respondent had been appointed as permanent trustee, for whatever reason, they failed to act.  In retrospect at least, that was a mistake, since it allowed the respondent to record his notice of title before the appellants.  As the authorities show, even although the respondent was well aware that the appellants held a disposition from Mrs Burnett, he was fully entitled to take advantage of their mistake by recording the notice of title and so completing the diligence by acquiring the real right in the subjects for the creditors.  At times during his submissions Mr Hodge appeared somewhat apologetic about what the respondent had done:  conspicuously, he was unable to say whether the respondent had recorded the notice of title with the deliberate purpose of defeating the appellants' rights.  I have little doubt, however, that this is exactly what he did, since there appears to be no other good reason for taking the step.  After all, he did not need to do so in order to grant a disposition to a purchaser since he could have deduced title from Mrs Burnett.  Moreover, in his pleadings the respondent avers that he sought the advice of his law agents on or about 25 November - not long before he recorded the notice of title.  In reality, when he recorded his notice of title at the expense of the appellants, the respondent acted in the spirit of the established law by exploiting their failure to record the disposition in their favour.  He did nothing more than his duty on behalf of the creditors.  To have done less for them would have been questionable, to say the least.  Therefore, in this case the law of bankruptcy worked as it has been intended to work for at least 200 years.  Whether that law is - in the words of Lord Macnaghten in <i>Heritable Reversionary Company Ltd v Millar </i>(1892) 19 R (HL) 43, 52 - "in a condition altogether satisfactory" obviously involves fundamental issues of legal policy.  But they are of a kind that must be left to the legislature.  Your Lordships have to apply the existing law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;146.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the result, Mrs Burnett's right to the flat vested in the respondent as part of her "whole estate" under section 31(1) of the 1985 Act.  Since the respondent then recorded his notice of title and became infeft in October 1991, by reason of the Real Rights Act 1693 his infeftment is to be preferred to the infeftment of the appellants who recorded their disposition in January 1992.  The respondent is therefore entitled to declarator in terms of the second crave in the initial writ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;147.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I should wish to reserve my opinion on a point that was not fully explored at the hearing of the appeal:  whether, when the uninfeft proprietor's rights are destroyed by the trustee recording a notice of title, the uninfeft proprietor can rank as an unsecured creditor in the sequestration.  Mr Hodge asserted that he could, and there is support for that view in a comment of Bell, <i>Treatise on the Law of Bankruptcy</i> Vol 1, p 82.  I remain unclear, however, as to the exact basis of such a claim - which arises only after the date of sequestration - in warrandice or otherwise.  It follows that I would also reserve my opinion on the, not unrelated, point about unjust enrichment which Lord Hoffmann has mentioned but which was not argued in the appeal.</p>
