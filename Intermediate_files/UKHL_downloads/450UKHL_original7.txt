<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;195. The public policy argument is no better.  Reliance was placed on <i>Oppenheimer v Cattermole</i> [1976]  AC 249, in which a Nazi law which discriminated against Jews had to be considered.  Lord Cross of Chelsea said, at p 278:</p>
<p></p><ul>"To my mind a law of this sort constitutes so grave an infringement of human rights that the courts of this country ought to refuse to recognise it as a law at all." <p></p></ul>
<p>The issue in the <i>Oppenheimer</i> case was whether the appellant was entitled under United Kingdom fiscal legislation to double taxation relief.  He claimed relief on the ground that he had dual nationality, British and German.  One of the Revenue's arguments was that because he had been deprived of his German nationality under the discriminatory legislation in question, he was not entitled to the double taxation relief.  In the event, despite the odious nature of the discriminatory legislation, the House agreed with the Revenue that for other reasons Mr Oppenheimer was not a German national at the relevant time and so was not entitled to double-taxation relief.  In my opinion, the <i>Oppenheimer</i> case, far from assisting KAC, identifies the flaw in the public policy objections that KAC is taking.  Lord Cross, at an earlier passage in his speech than that cited, postulated discriminatory legislation by Ruritania under which the property of a Ruritanian citizen who had been convicted of treason was forfeited and he was deprived of his Ruritanian citizenship.  Lord Cross continued, at p 276:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Our courts would certainly refuse to entertain an action by the Ruritanian state to obtain possession of the traitor's property here; but I can see no sufficient reason why we should continue to regard him as a Ruritanian citizen for the purpose of deciding whether or not he was entitled to property here, his right to which depended on his being or not being a Ruritanian citizen at some point of time." <p></p></ul>
<p>It is implicit in Lord Cross' example that although the courts of this country may refuse to give effect to odious or barbarous foreign legislation the existence of the legislation may nevertheless have to be recognised as a fact.  So here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;196. In paragraph 117 of his opinion my noble and learned friend Lord Steyn has postulated the case of an action in tort brought in England for recovery of loss caused by negligent mis-statement inducing a contract.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He postulates a negligent mis-statement that would prime facie be actionable under the law of the foreign country where it was made and would also be actionable in England.  But the contract contains a clause excluding all liability for negligent mis-statement.  The contract is valid under the law of the foreign country, presumably its proper law, but for some reason or other it would be contrary to English public policy to enforce it or to recognise it.  Is the defendant entitled, in an action in England on the tort claim, to rely on the exclusion clause in the contract?  The answer given by my noble and learned friend is 'No'.  He says that to permit the defendant to do so would be an affront to English public policy.  But since the contract is valid under the law of the foreign country, its proper law, the exclusion clause would be binding on both parties under the law of the foreign country.  That being so, the question whether the tort action could succeed if brought in England would require the court to decide whether England or the foreign country was the country with the most significant relationship with the circumstances of the case and with the parties: see the <i>Red Sea Insurance</i> case [1995] 1 AC 190.  In effect, the court would have to decide whether the tortious cause of action sued on was one which could derive its existence from English law or whether the relationship with England was so slight that the cause of action could only be derived from the foreign law.  In the latter case there would be no cause of action on which the plaintiff could sue in England.  The "affront to English public policy" said to be constituted by the refusal of the foreign law to recognise the existence of the tortious cause of action cannot, in my opinion, be a sufficient condition for the creation by English law of a cause of action out of facts with no significant relationship to England. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;197. My noble and learned friend's point that it would be an affront to English public policy not to recognise the tort claim in England could apply equally well to contract claims.  Suppose a contract between two citizens of a foreign country made in the foreign country and the proper law of which is the law of the foreign country.  One party commits, or is alleged to have committed, a breach of the contract.  There is then an event in the foreign country that purports to bar the action for breach of contract.  The event might be a discriminatory and odious piece of legislation.  It might be a release which the would-be claimant has been procured to sign by means which by English standards would be repugnant and unacceptable.  Nonetheless, under the law of the foreign country, the proper law of the contract, the event has had the result that the claimant has no cause of action for the alleged breach of contract.  Would English law permit the contractual cause of action to succeed notwithstanding that under the proper law of the contract the action would fail?  The question is indistinguishable from that posed by my noble and learned friend.  It could not, in my opinion, be argued that English law would create an in personam contractual cause of action that was incompatible with the proper law of the contract.  Why should there be any difference where the cause of action is a tortious one and the only connection with England is that England is the forum for the action?  The "affront" to English public policy would be the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;198. This brings me back to my fundamental objection to the application of the double-actionability rule proposed by my noble and learned friends.  It cannot, in my opinion, be English law that is the system of law from which KAC's cause of action derives its existence.  The only connection between the conversion and England is that England is the forum of the suit.  It is not a function ever claimed for English law to provide tortious causes of action to citizens of foreign countries who are injured by acts in those countries committed by other citizens of foreign countries.  Nor should it be.  <i>Phillips v Eyre</i> LR 6 QB1 and <i>Carr v Fracis Times &amp; Co</i> [1902] AC 176 constitute high authority that a foreign tort not actionable in the foreign country in question cannot be sued on in England.  On the facts of this case there is, in my opinion, neither principle nor authority that justifies English law in providing KAC with a cause of action in conversion against IAC.  I would, therefore, allow IAC's appeal and dismiss KAC's appeal on this ground.</p>
<i><p>The Mosul Four</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;199. On the footing that KAC's action can surmount the double-actionability hurdle, I respectfully agree with the reasons given by my noble and learned friend Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead for dismissing KAC's appeal regarding the Mosul Four.</p>
<i><p>The Iran Six</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;200. On the footing that KAC succeed on the double-actionability issue, the House must decide the issues relating to the damages KAC is entitled to recover from IAC.  The six aircraft were all eventually recovered by KAC but KAC is claiming various heads of consequential loss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;201. The first essential, in my opinion, is to identify the wrongful acts or omissions from which the losses in question are said to flow.  There were a number of individual acts of IAC eg re-registration of the aircraft in IAC's name, repainting the aircraft in IAC livery, use of one of the aircraft for commercial flights within Iraq, that were relied on by KAC as acts of conversion.  However, the conversion or usurpation that was proved against IAC was essentially the incorporation of the aircraft into IAC's fleet.  The individual acts were simply indicative of that process: see p 1146, para 73 of the judgment of Brooke LJ in the Court of Appeal.  But IAC's incorporation of the aircraft into its fleet was, on the facts of this case, a conversion/usurpation of a very peculiar sort.  It was not a misappropriation of the aircraft from KAC.  The aircraft had already been misappropriated by the state of Iraq.  That usurpation was protected from civil action by state immunity.  This House so held.  Nor is it possible to contend that IAC's incorporation of the aircraft into its fleet deprived KAC of them.  If IAC had not incorporated them into its fleet, KAC would still not have recovered them.  Moreover, it was not within the power of IAC to restore the aircraft to KAC.  Lord Nicholls in his opinion has analysed the position that arises where there is a series of conversions with each person in the series wrongfully excluding the owner from possession of his goods.  Each successive converter is liable to the true owner.  Each has, consciously or unconsciously, withheld the goods from the true owner.  This analysis does not seem to me to work in the present case.  True it is that IAC was treating KAC's aircraft as its own but IAC was not in any meaningful sense depriving KAC of the aircraft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;202. Accordingly, in my opinion, the approach to the damages issue should be one which holds IAC responsible for damage to the aircraft caused by IAC's retention of them but which does not hold IAC responsible for loss suffered by KAC through being deprived of the aircraft.  The latter loss was, on the facts of this case, not caused by IAC's acts of usurpation but would have been suffered anyway.</p>
<i></i><p><i>The removal of the Iran Six to Iran and the payment of the $20 million</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;203. The removal of these six aircraft to Iran was, as Lord Nicholls has observed, done on the orders of the Iraq Government.  It was not, on the facts, something for which IAC were responsible.  Nor, in my opinion, was their removal to Iran a likely or foreseeable result of the incorporation of the aircraft into the IAC fleet.  A fortiori, their continued detention in Iran after hostilities had ceased and Iran's extraction of $20 million as the price of their release cannot, in my opinion, be described as consequences flowing naturally or directly from IAC's incorporation of the aircraft into its fleet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;204. These conclusions do not, I think, depend upon any controversial opinion as to the rule of remoteness of damage in conversion cases.  They depend upon the limited nature of the conversion/usurpation for which IAC can be held responsible and the absence of any sufficient causal connection between that usurpation and the end result for which damages are sought.</p>
<i><p>Conclusion on damages</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;205. If, therefore, contrary to any opinion, KAC has a cause of action for conversion, I would, in relation to the Iran six, confine KAC's claim to the deterioration suffered by the aircraft while they were being retained by IAC as part of its fleet.  I would allow IAC's appeal and dismiss KAC's cross appeal accordingly.</p>
