<p class="para">244.&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Lord Phillips, paras 133-154, and with Lord Hoffmann, paras 195-203, that SIAC was entitled to find in favour of the Secretary of State on this issue. Here too the questions that are raised are essentially questions of fact. The issue is whether no reasonable tribunal, properly instructed as to the relevant law, could have come to the same conclusion on the evidence. As to the law, there are two points that must be considered in addition to the need for a sufficient degree of scrutiny. The first is the approach that must be taken, where a person is being removed to a third country which is not bound by the European Convention on Human Rights, to the guarantee of a fair trial. The second is the approach that must be taken where it is suggested that evidence which is to be led against an accused may have been obtained by torture.</p>
<p class="para">245.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first point, the Strasbourg court has said repeatedly that the possibility of a violation of article 6 cannot be excluded where the person expelled risks suffering a flagrant denial of a fair trial in the receiving country: see the joint partly dissenting opinion of Judges Bratza, Bonello and Hedigan in <i>Mamatkulov and Askarov v Turkey</i> (2005) 41 EHRR 494, pp 537-539. In that case political dissidents claimed that they would not receive a fair trial if they were extradited to Uzbekistan because, among other things, torture was routinely used to secure guilty verdicts and because suspects were frequently denied access to a lawyer. Their case was that they ran a real risk of a flagrant denial of justice.  In para O-III14 the judges said:</p>
<p class="qt">“In our view, what the word ‘flagrant’ is intended to convey is a breach of the principles of fair trial guaranteed by Article 6 which is so fundamental as to amount to a nullification, or destruction of the very essence, of the right guaranteed by that Article.”</p>
<p class="paraleft">In paras O-III17 and O-III19 they used the expression “a real risk” to describe the standard which the evidence has to achieve in order to show that the expulsion or extradition of the individual would, if carried out, violate the article.  </p>
<p class="para">246.&nbsp;&nbsp;The test which SIAC applied in para 451 was whether there would be “total denial” of the right to a fair trial, taking these words to be the equivalent of “complete” denial in the decision of the Immigration Appeal Tribunal in <i>Devaseelan v Secretary for the Home Department</i> [2003] Imm AR 1, 34, para 111, which the House had approved in <i>R (Ullah) v Special Adjudicator</i> [2004] UKHL 26; [2004] 2 AC 323.  It did not have the benefit of the House’s observations in <i>EM (Lebanon) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</i> [2008] UKHL 64; [2008] 3 WLR 931, in which it was recommended that the test as explained in <i>Mamatkulov</i> should be adopted. But, as Ouseley J explained in para 454, SIAC understood this concept to involve an analysis of the degree and gravity of the shortfall. So in substance they were applying the same test. In <i>EM (Lebanon) </i>the House disapproved of observations in the Court of Appeal [2006] EWCA Civ 1531; [2007] 1 FLR 991, paras 37-38 that suggested that the words “complete denial” and “flagrant breach” indicated different tests. As I said in para 4, there is only one test. For this reason I think that the Court of Appeal was wrong in Abu Qatada’s case to say that SIAC erred because it treated the possible use of evidence obtained by torture pari passu with complaints about the court’s independence. The proper approach, which SIAC adopted, was to take all the various factors together and to ask whether, when looked at in the round, there was a real risk of a flagrant denial of a fair trial.</p>
<p class="para">247.&nbsp;&nbsp;SIAC examined the issues about the court’s independence with great care, accepting that the trial process before a military court called for particularly careful scrutiny: <i>Ergin v Turkey (No 6)</i>, (Application No 47533/99) (unreported), 4 May 2006. It took account of the lack of independence of the court and noted that the fact that the prosecutor and the majority of judges were part of the same military hierarchy did not add to the appearance of justice or independence: para 433. As against that, it found that it could not conclude that, for all the deficiencies of independence, the courts would not endeavour to apply the law conscientiously or would reach decisions which were manifestly unreasonable or arbitrary: para 438.     <i> </i>   </p>
<p class="para">248.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of evidence obtained by torture, the Strasbourg court has adopted an uncompromising approach to the use at a trial of evidence that is found to have been obtained as a result of torture: see <i>Harutyunyan v Armenia</i>, (Application No 36549/03) (unreported) 28 June 2007. In <i>Gäfgen v Germany</i>, (Application No 22978/05) (unreported), 30 June 2008, para 99, it held that the use at a trial of real evidence recovered as a direct result of ill-treatment, at least if the acts could be characterised as torture, should never be relied upon as proof of guilt, irrespective of its probative value. But the evidence that was before SIAC did not come up to that standard. There were allegations, but there was no proof. It followed the majority view in <i>A (No 2) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </i>[2006] 2 AC 221 that, where it is alleged that the evidence has been obtained by torture, the court should refuse to admit it only if it concludes on a balance of probabilities that it was obtained by torture.  The assertion that there is a real risk that it was obtained in this way is not enough.  As article 15 of the International Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment 1984 (1990) (Cm 1775) puts it, a statement which “is established” to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence. SIAC noted that Jordanian law does not permit evidence that is found to have been obtained involuntarily to be admitted, but that statements to a prosecutor which might have been obtained by prior duress are not excluded because they have not been shown to have been so obtained.  Making the best use of the information that was available it could not conclude that the evidence was probably obtained by torture, although there was a very real risk that it had been: para 437. The question it then asked itself was whether it was unfair for the burden of proof in Jordan to lie where it does, as <i>(A (No 2)) </i>says<i> </i>it does here, on this issue.    </p>
<p class="para">249.&nbsp;&nbsp;Drawing these points together along with the lack of other basic protections, SIAC concluded that the retrial would probably not comply with the requirements of article 6 if Jordan were a party to the Convention. But it would not involve a complete denial of the right to a fair trial before an independent and impartial body: para 442; see also para 451. Its discussion shows beyond question that the importance of the issue has been fully addressed and subjected to a careful and frank analysis. It is plain that in several material respects the circumstances in which the retrial will take place will give rise to the risk of unfairness.  In <i>Öcalan v Turkey</i> (2005) 41 EHRR 985, para 112 the Grand Chamber said that the court has consistently held that certain aspects of the status of military judges sitting as members of the State Security Courts made their independence from the executive questionable; see also <i>Haci Özen v Turkey</i>, (Application No 46286/99) (unreported) 12 April 2007. But here again, as in the case of the assurances, there is no absolute rule.  The question whether or not there will be a flagrant breach must be evaluated. SIAC noted, in paras 443-446, that the retrial will take place within a legally constructed framework and that there was sound evidence that the military court, which is not a mere tool of the executive, appraises the evidence and tests it against the law. I do not think that, looking at the matter overall, SIAC can be faulted on the ground that it failed to subject the issues to anxious scrutiny or that its decision that there would not be a complete denial of a fair trial was one which it was not entitled to reach on the evidence.</p>
<p class="hditl">Article 5; the Refugee Convention</p>
<p class="para">250.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have nothing to add to what Lord Phillips, paras 127-132, and Lord Hoffmann, paras 205 - 207, have said on these issues, with which I am in full agreement.  </p>
<p class="hditl">Conclusions </p>
<p class="para">251.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would dismiss the appeals of RB and U. I would allow the Secretary of State’s appeal in the case of Abu Qatada and restore the decision of SIAC. </p>
<p class="lawlord">LORD BROWN OF EATON-UNDER-HEYWOOD</p>
<p class="mylords">My Lords,</p>
<p class="para">252.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the advantage of reading in draft the very full opinions of my noble and learned friends Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, Lord Hoffmann and Lord Hope of Craighead and, finding myself in substantial agreement with them all readily recognise that there is much to be said for my saying little, little to be said for my saying much.  Really my only concern is to give such emphasis as I may to what seemed to me to be the three core holdings which I understand all your Lordships to be agreed upon in deciding these appeals: first, that SIAC’s conclusions on the central issues raised are not merely to be treated with respect but are quite simply unassailable unless it can be shown that the Commission actually erred <i>in law</i>; secondly, that the judgment of the majority of the House in <i>Secretary of State for the Home Department v MB and AF</i> [2008] 1 AC 440 has no direct application to the very different jurisdiction which SIAC exercise under the Special Immigration Appeals Commission Act 1997; and, thirdly, that the Court of Appeal in <i>Othman’s</i> case misdirected itself in holding that SIAC’s finding that there would be a “very real risk” of evidence procured through torture being adduced to convict Othman upon his proposed retrial for terrorist offences in Jordan necessarily precludes his return there on article 6 grounds. I shall take as read all the basic material set out in Lord Phillips’ opinion and confine myself to a very few paragraphs on each of the three points just identified.</p>
<i><p class="para">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;Appeal only on a point of law</p></i>
<p class="para">253.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 7 of the 1997 Act restricts the right of appeal from SIAC to the Court of Appeal to “any question of law material to [SIAC’s] determination". Your Lordships are well familiar with the difficulty in various contexts of determining the precise borderline between questions of fact and points of law. It is, for example, now recognised that questions of proportionality which necessarily arise when striking the balance between private and public interests in cases involving qualified Convention rights cannot be regarded as pure questions of fact.  Nothing, however, could be clearer than that in the present context the distinction between fact and law, wherever clearly identifiable, should be faithfully honoured. SIAC is a highly expert and experienced tribunal, custom-built for the challenging and sensitive tasks involved in deciding these expulsion cases, and vested with particular powers and procedures—above all the use of closed material under the special advocate scheme—which make its determinations peculiarly inappropriate for further factual reappraisal and appeal. Take the determinations in these very cases. One (<i>Othman</i>) involved a five-day hearing before SIAC and resulted in both open and closed judgments, the former extending to 136 pages. RB’s appeal to SIAC lasted 4 days; U’s some 7 days. The fact that Strasbourg itself might choose to carry out a close factual re-examination of these cases to reach its own decision upon whether expulsion would involve a Convention breach is simply nothing to the point; I agree entirely with what Lord Phillips says about this at para 66 and Lord Hoffmann at para 190.</p>
<p class="para">254.&nbsp;&nbsp;The most critical question raised in each appeal is whether the proposed deportees would face a real risk of article 3 ill-treatment on return.  <i>Par excellence</i> this is a question of fact calling for an evaluation of all the evidence and ultimately a single factual judgment. Obviously if SIAC had made the egregious mistake of failing to understand the basic legal principle enshrined in the <i>Soering, Chahal</i> and <i>Saadi</i> line of Strasbourg authority, its determination would have been open to attack.  Such argument as was advanced to that effect, however, was in my judgment hopeless and is comprehensively dealt with by Lord Phillips at paras 111-114. As for the suggestion that SIAC wrongly took account, or took excessive account, of assurances given respectively by Algeria and Jordan that the deportees would not be ill-treated on return, the Strasbourg jurisprudence makes it absolutely plain that the question whether in any particular case the assurances given obviate the risk is a question of fact to be decided in the light of all the circumstances pertaining at the material time. It could hardly be suggested that SIAC failed in these cases to give the fullest and most scrupulous attention to all the relevant considerations raised by these assurances (and, indeed, by the need for them in the first place).  The very fact that in <i>AS</i> and <i>DD (Libya) v Secretary of State for the Home Department (Liberty intervening)</i> [2008] EWCA Civ 289 SIAC (chaired by the same judge as chaired SIAC in <i>Othman</i>) <i>allowed</i> the aliens’ appeals against deportation to Libya on article 3 grounds despite the assurances contained in a Memorandum of Understanding between the UK and Libya is surely some indication of the conscientiousness with which SIAC discharges its responsibilities.</p>
<p class="hditl">(ii) Closed evidence</p>
<p class="para">255.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the occasion to examine the precise scope and application of <i>Secretary of State for the Home Department v MB and AF</i>—there will be a full opportunity for that on the hearing of AF’s further appeal to the House in March. What is critical for present purposes is to understand the all-important difference between control orders such as were in issue there and deportation orders with which your Lordships are here concerned. The former, although falling short of constituting article 5 detention, in almost every other respect are highly restrictive of the controlees’ ordinary rights and freedoms. Moreover such orders are made domestically and can be (and are) made against UK citizens no less than against aliens. (It is, of course, High Court judges alone who exercise this jurisdiction, not SIAC.) Inevitably, therefore, such orders engage article 6 of the Convention. In contrast, the expulsion of aliens involves no determination of civil rights and is therefore beyond the reach of article 6—see the Grand Chamber’s judgment in <i>Maaouia v France</i> (5 October 2000, Application No 39652/98); (2000) 33 EHRR 1037.<i> </i>The only exception to this (see <i>Chahal</i>) is where the alien is detained pending expulsion, not a problem now arising in either of these appeals. None of that, of course, is to deny an alien such rights as the Convention may give him not to be deported, whether such rights arise under article 3 or under any other Convention provision. As <i>Chahal</i> makes clear, however, the independent scrutiny of any such claim  which is required to give aliens an effective remedy in this regard need not even be by way of a judicial hearing. Such being the case, it becomes difficult indeed for the proposed deportees here to question the adequacy of the SIAC regime and the legitimacy of its use of special advocates as a means of effectively safeguarding their Convention rights in certain exceptional circumstances not to be deported.</p>
<p class="para">256.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bear in mind too in this regard that the Convention rights sought to be invoked in any expulsion case will necessarily involve, as in the present appeals, the contention that on return the proposed deportee will be at risk of article 3 ill-treatment or be in danger of flagrant violation of some other Convention right. No case is being made <i>against him</i>—again, a striking difference from control order appeals where inevitably the central issue arising is the risk posed by the controlee to UK security.  Rather the alien is himself making a case against the state to which it is proposed to expel him. That some of the material in response to the case he makes against the foreign state may in the public interest be kept from him is accordingly less prospectively damaging to his cause than where (as in a control order case) he may be left entirely in the dark as to why he is alleged to constitute a terrorist threat.  </p>
<p class="para">257.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of these various considerations, the attack on the use of closed material in the present context is to my mind wholly unwarranted.</p>
<p class="hditl">(iii) Article 6 in a foreign case</p>
<p class="para">258.&nbsp;&nbsp;In many parts of the world judicial procedures are markedly different (and to our way of thinking much inferior) to those required by article 6 of the Convention and under other similar constitutional guarantees of due process. No one suggests, however, that people coming from such places are immune from expulsion lest they become subject on return to what we would regard as a defective legal process.  True it is that ever since <i>Soering v UK</i> (1989) 11 EHRR 439, Strasbourg has contemplated that “an issue might exceptionally be raised under article 6 by an extradition decision in circumstances where the fugitive has suffered or risks suffering a flagrant denial of a fair trial in the requesting country". Not once, however, in the subsequent twenty years has an expulsion or extradition order in fact been held to violate article 6—not even in the somewhat shocking circumstances which arose in <i>Mamatkulov</i> <i>and</i> <i>Askarov v Turkey</i> (2005)  41 EHRR 494 where the dissenting minority noted as features of the applicants’ terrorist trial in Uzbekhistan that “the applicants were denied the right to be represented by counsel of their own choice, defending counsel being appointed by the public prosecutor; the applicants were held incommunicado until the commencement of their trial in June 1999 [some three months after Turkey had extradited them in the face of a rule 39 order prohibiting such action]; the trial was closed to the general public, to all family members of the applicants and to attorneys hired on behalf of the defence; and the self-incriminating statements used to convict the applicants included those signed during the pre-trial police investigation, while the applicants were in custody and without access to their own lawyers". This, moreover, against the background of an Amnesty International briefing document affording “credible grounds for believing that self-incriminating evidence extracted by torture was routinely used to secure guilty verdicts".</p>
<p class="para">259.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Phillips must surely be right (at paras 136-138 of his opinion) in supposing that only where a prospectively unfair trial would be likely to lead to a serious violation of some substantive human right—for example, an unjust conviction involving grave consequences such as capital punishment or a substantial deprivation of liberty—would article 6 fall for consideration in a foreign case. Lord Phillips suggests (at para 139) that a different approach will be appropriate in an extradition case since the very object of extradition is to stand trial and no one should be sent abroad specifically to undergo an unfair trial process. Whilst, however, I agree that in the context of extradition certain considerations may militate against an order—because, for example, such proceedings are subject to whatever express limitations are provided for in the relevant bilateral agreement and, indeed, because extradition may involve the sending country’s own nationals or others with rights of residence and not merely aliens—it should be recognised too, and countervailingly, that there may be compelling reasons in favour of extradition rather than that the suspect should enjoy an undeserved safe haven from prosecution—see the recent decision of the House in <i>R (Wellington) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </i>[2008] UKHL 72.</p>
<p class="para">260.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately it is unnecessary in the present context to explore these problems further: Mr Othman is being expelled as an undesirable alien rather than extradited to stand trial and, if returned, tried and convicted, he will plainly suffer ample deprivation of liberty to warrant consideration of his case under article 6 before he comes to be expelled.  All that said, I find SIAC’s judgment on this issue perfectly clear, measured and sensible and the Court of Appeal’s criticisms of it  misplaced. Essentially the Court of Appeal appears to have held that SIAC’s finding that there exists “a very real risk” of evidence obtained by article 3 ill-treatment being used in Jordan to convict the accused of itself necessarily precludes his expulsion. Strikingly, both the authorities principally relied on to support this conclusion—<i>Jalloh v Germany</i> (2006) 44 EHRR 667 and <i>A v Home Secretary (No 2)</i> [2006] 2 AC 221—were domestic cases which simply never addressed what in this context would be required to constitute a flagrant denial of justice (so fundamental a breach of the principles of fair trial as to destroy the very essence of the right) and thus prevent expulsion. True it is that in cases envisaged by the majority of the House in <i>A (No 2)</i>, SIAC, in deciding whether to exclude evidence as probably obtained by torture, would be altogether readier than it appears the Jordanian Court is likely to be to find that the accused has discharged the burden of proof upon him (to this extent I agree with paras 60 and 61 of the Court of Appeal’s judgment). It by no means follows, however, that the anticipated process in Jordan is to be characterised not merely as one which domestically would violate article 6 (as SIAC rightly held) but as one so fundamentally inconsistent with the right to a fair trial as to bar the alien’s expulsion. One day, no doubt, a case will come before the courts where, however compelling the security interests of the state which proposes to expel an alien, those interests will fall to be sacrificed to the alien’s article 6 right not to be returned to face a flagrantly unjust trial.  If, however, as the majority of the Grand Chamber held in <i>Mamatkulov</i>, extradition was not unlawful even in the circumstances arising there, in my judgment expulsion most certainly is not unlawful here. SIAC’s judgment on the article 6 issue is to my mind no less persuasive and sustainable than on all the many other issues which it had to address in Othman’s case.</p>
<p class="para">261.&nbsp;&nbsp;I too, therefore, would allow the Secretary of State’s appeal and restore SIAC’s decision in <i>Othman’s</i> case and in the other case would reject <i>RB’s</i> and <i>U’s</i> appeals.</p>
<p class="lawlord">LORD MANCE</p>
<p class="mylords">My Lords,</p>
<p class="para">262.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the benefit of reading in draft the speeches of my noble and learned friends, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, Lord Hoffmann, Lord Hope of Craighead and Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood. I am in agreement with all of your Lordships as to the outcome of these appeals, and, in view of the large measure of my agreement with the reasoning in your Lordships’s speeches, there is little that I wish to add.</p>
<p class="para">263.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue whether it was open to SIAC to use closed material relating to the issue of safety on return, I share the view that the statute unequivocally permits this. I do not consider that anything said by the European Court of Human Rights or by the junior Home Office Minister on the third reading of the Bill (see Lord Phillips’ judgment paras 79 and 80) related to the question whether sensitive material bearing on national security might be relevant to an issue of safety on return, and might require special treatment accordingly. In my view, all that the European Court was concerned to stress in <i>Chahal v United Kingdom </i>(and again in <i>Saadi v </i>Italy) was that there was no trade-off between the extent of any threat to national security that a person might pose in country A and the extent of any risk that he might be mistreated contrary to article 3 in country B to which country A was seeking to expel him.</p>
<p class="para">264.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Maaouia v France </i>establishes that deportation proceedings in respect of an alien do not as such engage civil rights or therefore article 6 of the Convention. No question arises in these cases as to the legality of any detention. What is required in this country, in respect of any risk of mistreatment contrary to articles 3, 5, 6 or 8 in the countries (Algeria and Jordan) to which RB, U and Abu Qatada are proposed to be deported, is “independent scrutiny of the claim” which is, in my opinion, provided by SIAC and the statutorily regulated or authorised procedures under which it operates. I do not consider that the use of the closed material in the present context of deportation offends against either Convention or domestic principles of fairness. Assuming that such principles required sufficient disclosure to enable RB, U and Abu Qatada to meet the case against them, I also agree, for reasons given by Lord Phillips and Lord Brown, that nothing in the House’s decision in <i>Secretary of State for the Home Department v MB and AF </i>[2007] UKHL 46 leads to a conclusion that such disclosure was essential or that Rule 4 must be read down to permit such disclosure, in the different context of the present cases involving a challenge to deportation.</p>
