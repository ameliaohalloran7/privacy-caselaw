<p class="para">85.&nbsp;&nbsp;    The respondents’ argument, which was accepted by the Court of Appeal, is that, under section 9(1A), the landlord cannot claim hope value in addition to marriage value because it is subsumed by marriage value. At first, that contention seemed to me to be unanswerable, particularly now that the landlord is entitled to half the marriage value under section 9(1D). As half the marriage value is what the tenant would pay if he was in the market (as explained in <i>Lloyd-Jones </i>[1982] 1 EGLR 209, 211L-M), it seems logically inconsistent that he should have to pay yet more on the basis that, although not in the market, he might be in the future. To put the point another way, if it is right to split the marriage value equally between the parties, it would, at first blush at any rate, seem to give the landlord more than half the marriage value, through the medium of an additional sum for hope value, which can fairly be characterised as a sum in respect of deferred contingent marriage value. In other words, as Carnwath LJ put it at [2008] 1 WLR 2142, para 48 in the Court of Appeal, the argument is that, as the landlord is entitled to half the marriage value, “[t]o include a further element of hope value would involve double counting".</p>
<p class="para">86.&nbsp;&nbsp;    I have come to the conclusion that this conclusion is correct, although I have found the point more difficult than it initially seemed. Although hope value can be characterised as deferred marriage value, and including hope value in the valuation of the freehold interest will reduce the marriage value, and although one might quantify the hope value by reference to the amount of the marriage value (as in <i>Shulem B </i>[2001] 1 EGLR 105), there is considerable force in the point that hope value is not the same as marriage value. It is something which (at least if the surveyors’ evidence in the particular case supports it) the market will pay for when a landlord is selling his freehold reversion at a time when the tenant is not in the market. It therefore could be said to follow that, provided it was justified on the evidence, a landlord in the hypothetical friendly negotiations with his tenant for the sale of the freehold reversion, as described in <i>Lloyd-Jones </i>[1982] 1 EGLR 209, 211L-M, would negotiate on the basis that (a) the investment value of his interest should include hope value (as that is how the price would be calculated if the tenant was not in the market), and (b) he should be able to seek half the marriage value in addition, as that reflects the special value of the freehold to the tenant.</p>
<p class="para">87.&nbsp;&nbsp;    Such an approach to the inclusion of hope value under section 9(1A) appears to be largely consistent with the views of the Lands Tribunal in <i>Pitts v Earl Cadogan </i>[2007] 3 EGLR 86. At para 14, the Tribunal said that, at least in the absence of section 9(1D), “there would be no obvious constraint on the method of valuation", and that it could not be “a matter of law as to what constitutes marriage value and whether the value of the landlord’s interest can include hope value". However, in para 20, the Tribunal concluded that, by providing in section 9(1D) that marriage value must be divided equally, it was “likely” that Parliament intended hope value to be disregarded. </p>
<p class="para">88.&nbsp;&nbsp;    Although I have concluded that the Tribunal reached the right conclusion in para 20, my conclusion, like that of the Court of Appeal, is based on the fact that the price payable under section 9(1A) includes a proportion of the marriage value, and is reached irrespective of the provisions of section 9(1D). The contention that the landlord can have both hope value and half the resultant marriage value is, I think, based on two assumptions, which, on analysis, appear to me to be unsound. The first assumption is that one can build up the valuation of the landlord’s interest in two stages (the investment value stage and the marriage value share) on the assumption that each stage is wholly independent of the other. The second assumption is that the tenant is the hypothetical buyer of the landlord’s interest, which is to be found in the otherwise impeccable reasoning of the Lands Tribunal in the passage quoted above from <i>Lloyd-Jones </i>[1982] 1 EGLR 209, 211L-M, and supported by the extract from the 2nd edition of <i>Hague</i>.</p>
<p class="para">89.&nbsp;&nbsp;    So far as the second assumption is concerned, the existence of a special purchaser does not actually mean that one assumes that he is the buyer in the hypothetical sale one is required to postulate. The seller of the landlord’s interest under section 9(1A) is expressly not assumed to be the actual landlord, but a hypothetical “willing seller” (whereas, of course, the landlord is very rarely anything of the kind). The buyer is similarly a hypothetical person, not an actual person; section 9(1A) makes no express reference to a “willing buyer", but it is implied by the assumption of a sale in the “open market” - see per Fox LJ in <i>Dennis &amp; Robinson Ltd v Kiossos Establishment </i>[1987] 1 EGLR 132, at 134K, and see also the analysis of Donaldson J in <i>F R Evans (Leeds) Ltd v English Electric Co Ltd </i>(1977) 36 P &amp; C R 185 (affirmed 11 November 1977), relying on the reasoning in <i>Inland Revenue Commissioners v Clay </i>[1914] 3 KB 466. The notion that the buyer is a hypothetical person, rather than the actual tenant, also accords with practical sense, as otherwise the tenant could argue that he would not have been prepared, or able, to pay more than a certain sum. </p>
<p class="para">90.&nbsp;&nbsp;    Once one considers a hypothetical prospective buyer negotiating with the landlord, one can see that, if the landlord sought hope value at the first, investment, stage, and then sought half the marriage value at the second stage, he would be seeking to have his cake and eat it. That is because the price he would be seeking for his interest would assume both the fact that the tenant was in the market (as the landlord is seeking half the marriage value) and that the tenant was not in the market (as the landlord is seeking hope value on the basis that the tenant is not in the market, but may be in the market in the future). Thus, as Carnwath LJ said, at [2008] 1 WLR 2142, para 48, taking account of hope value when assessing the investment value, when the landlord is also to be accorded half the marriage value, would involve double counting. </p>
<p class="para">91.&nbsp;&nbsp;    In fact, the same analysis would apply if the actual tenant were assumed to be the hypothetical buyer, although it is harder to appreciate that there is double counting in such a case. That is, I think, because it is less obviously illogical that the landlord should be able to build up the value of his interest on the basis of two inconsistent assumptions, when those assumptions concern the hypothetical activities of the very person with whom he is assumed to be negotiating.</p>
<p class="para">92.&nbsp;&nbsp;    Although it does not directly arise on these appeals, it is sensible to deal with the question whether hope value can be claimed in those section 9(1A) cases where marriage value is excluded by virtue of the provisions of section 9(1E). In my opinion, the purpose of those provisions is the same as that of the words added to section 9(1) by section 82 of the 1969 Act. Although I accept that hope value is not the same as marriage value, it appears to me unreal to attribute to Parliament the intention to allow for the prospect of marriage value being taken into account, when it has specifically excluded marriage value from the valuation exercise. Just as it is unrealistic under section 9(1) to assume that the tenant might be in the market the next day, if the section excludes the tenant from the market on the valuation date, so is it unrealistic to allow for hope value where the statute specifically excludes marriage value.</p>
<p class="para">93.&nbsp;&nbsp;    There is a potential complicating factor I should mention. In a case where the marriage value is shared equally, just as the landlord’s interest should be valued excluding hope value, so, I am inclined to think, should the tenant’s leasehold interest. In some cases, the valuation of the tenant’s interest may include hope value, as the President recognised in <i>Pitts</i> [2007] 3 EGLR 86, para 16, where he said that “hope value does not necessarily exclusively reside in the landlord’s interest". It may well be unfair on the landlord if he is precluded from seeking hope value in circumstances where, for the purpose of assessing the marriage value, the tenant’s leasehold interest is valued including hope value. So, while, as a matter of principle, it appears to me that, under section 9(1A), the valuation of the landlord’s interest should not include hope value, if it could be shown that the valuation of the tenant’s interest included hope value and that this was illogical and unfair on the landlord, then an adjustment would have to be made.</p>
<i><p class="para">Schedule 13 to the 1993 Act and hope value</p></i>
<p class="para">94.&nbsp;&nbsp;    The arguments about marriage value and hope value where a tenant is seeking a new lease of his flat under Schedule 13 to the 1993 Act are similar, in valuation terms, to those which can be raised in relation to the tenant’s acquisition of the freehold of his house under section 9 of the 1967 Act, although the calculation is a little more complex as the tenant is acquiring a new lease rather than the freehold.</p>
<p class="para">95.&nbsp;&nbsp;    In those circumstances, it seems to me that the arguments which establish that the words “(with the tenant not buying or seeking to buy)” in para 3(2) of Schedule 13 have the same force as the very similar words inserted into section 9(1) of the 1967 Act by section 82 of the 1969 Act. There is no doubt that they bar marriage value from being included in the valuation of the landlord’s interest, and, for the same reasons as contained in the section of this opinion dealing with section 9(1), I consider, in agreement with the Court of Appeal, that they also bar the inclusion of hope value. For completeness, I should add that, for the reasons discussed in para 92, the effect of the new para 4(2A) is to exclude hope value as well as marriage value in the case of leases with more than eighty years to run.</p>
<i><p class="para">Schedule 6 to the 1993 Act and hope value</p></i>
<p class="para">96.&nbsp;&nbsp;    It is clear from the bracketed words in para 3(1), “with no person who falls within sub-paragraph (1A) buying or seeking to buy", and the provisions of para 3(1A), with its reference to “a tenant of premises contained in the [building]", that every tenant of a flat in the building, whether or not participating in the proposed purchase, is deemed to be out of the market. It is also seems clear from the wording of sub-paras (a) and (b) of para 2(1), the opening part of para 4(2), and the unambiguous terms of para 4(2)(a) that marriage value can only be taken into account in so far as it is attributable to the ability of the participating tenants, through the nominee purchaser, to grant new long leases of their respective flats to themselves. The way in which paras 2(1)(a) and (b) are worded also confirm that the only aspect of marriage value in respect of which the landlord can claim is that identified in para 4. But that does not necessarily exclude hope value: as I have explained, it may be similar to, and based on the existence of, marriage value, its inclusion may serve to reduce any marriage value and it may be assessed by reference to marriage value, but it is not marriage value.</p>
<p class="para">97.&nbsp;&nbsp;    The Court of Appeal concluded that hope value could not be taken into account under the para 3 valuation, whether it is attributable to the ability of either participating tenants or non-participating tenants to acquire new leases of their respective flats. This conclusion was primarily based on their view that the exclusion of all such tenants, whether participating or not, from the market under para 3(1) and 3(1A)(b) meant that they were excluded for the purposes of any hope value, consistently with their conclusion in relation to Schedule 13.</p>
<p class="para">98.&nbsp;&nbsp;    It would be both arbitrary and unfair, in my judgment, if a landlord, who can recover marriage value in relation to the participating tenants’ flats, could not recover hope value in respect of the non-participating tenants’ flats. It would be arbitrary because, in so far as they are purchasing the reversion to non-participating tenants’ leases, the participating tenants are acquiring an investment, whereas, in so far as they are purchasing the reversion to their own leases, they are acquiring greater security in their homes. They are plainly anxious to enhance the value of their interests in their respective flats, as otherwise they would not be exercising their chapter I rights. It is therefore quite logical to oblige them to pay a share of the resultant marriage value, as envisaged by para 4: Parliament could have decided to release them from that obligation, as it did to tenants under section 9(1) of the 1967 Act, but it did not do so. Given that it was thought to be fair to make the participating tenants pay a true market price for the reversion to their own flats, it would be surprising if they did not have to pay a true market price for the investment part of their purchase, and that would include paying for any hope value in respect of the prospect of negotiating new leases of their flats with non-participating tenants. By the same token, it would be unfair on the landlord.</p>
<p class="para">99.&nbsp;&nbsp;    In the Court of Appeal, at [2008] 1 WLR 2142 para 54, Carnwath LJ accepted that the denial of hope value to the landlord under Schedule 6 result “seem[ed] unfair". However, he said that hope value “may have been thought so speculative that it could be disregarded without injustice". I am not convinced by that argument. It has some force in a valuation dispute involving a single relatively low-value house under section 9(1) of the 1967 Act, but not to a dispute under Schedule 6, which applies to collective enfranchisement, and extends to very valuable flats and buildings. In most of the cases where hope value has been found to be allowable in principle under schedule 6, it has been included in the investment value of the landlord’s interest in some form, and has had a significant effect on the price payable, in percentage terms or in the actual amount, or indeed in both. </p>
<p class="para">100.&nbsp;&nbsp;     In the following paragraph of his judgment, Carnwath LJ referred to the submission (repeated before your Lordships) that there was a counterbalancing benefit for the landlord, in that it would suffer no discount for improvements effected by non-participating tenants to their flats (as para 3(1)(c) of Schedule 6 only applies to participating tenants) whereas if such tenants then sought extended leases under chapter II, para 3(1)(c) would entitle them to a discount on the price payable, to take into account their improvements. I am unpersuaded by that argument also: there is no correspondence between the two factors, save that they could suggest a rough and ready approach to valuation. However, in the case of flats subject to long leases, there must be very few cases indeed where improvements by the tenant have much effect on the value of the reversion.</p>
<p class="para">101.&nbsp;&nbsp;     Excluding hope value in respect of non-participating tenants would be unfair on a landlord for another reason. In many cases, all, or at least the great majority, of the tenants of flats in a building wish to buy the freehold, but, if they are well-advised, they would ensure that only the minimum number of them formally participate in the purchase under Schedule 6 (on the basis that they agreed appropriate terms with the other tenants). Such an arrangement would artificially reduce the price that they would have to pay for the freehold under Schedule 6, as there would be neither marriage value nor hope value in respect of non-participating tenants’ flats.</p>
<p class="para">102.&nbsp;&nbsp;     I have seen, in draft, my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann’s opinion, which, as always, I have read with pleasure and admiration. Despite his cogently expressed reasons to the contrary, I consider that, on a fair reading of para 3 of Schedule 6, hope value can be taken into account in so far as it is attributable to the possibility of non-participating tenants seeking new leases of their respective flats by negotiation (and not, it should be emphasised, as of right under chapter II). </p>
<p class="para">103.&nbsp;&nbsp;     I agree with the Court of Appeal that the bracketed words in the opening part of para 3(1), when read together with para 3(1A), exclude all flat tenants from the market, and they exclude hope value as well as marriage value because the words “buying or seeking to buy” are, for the reasons given when considering section 9(1), apt to cover the future as well as the present. But this conclusion begs the question of what precisely it is that the flat tenants are not buying or seeking to buy. The natural meaning of the opening part of para 3(1) is that they are not buying, or seeking to buy, that which is described immediately before as being “sold on the open market", namely the freehold of the building. At least as a matter of words, that would not extend to excluding from account the possibility of flat tenants seeking in the future to acquire new long leases of their respective flats: they would not be “buying” anything, let alone the building. On that basis, there is nothing in para 3 which excludes the hope value for which the appellants contend in these appeals.</p>
<p class="para">104.&nbsp;&nbsp;     However, I accept that, as Carnwath LJ said at [2008] 1 WLR 2142, para 50, such a literal reading of the bracketed words in the opening part of para 3(1) will not do. The words “buying” and “buy” in para 3(1) must cover seeking a 999-year lease at a peppercorn or any similar interest: otherwise they would have no real effect; for the same reasons, the bracketed words would extend to buying (or acquiring a 999-year lease at a peppercorn of) all but a small part of the building. However, those considerations by no means necessarily require one to construe the bracketed words so as to exclude the possibility of the flat tenants acquiring any interest in any part of the building, especially if there are good reasons, based on other provisions of the 1993 Act, to hold that they should not be so construed. In my opinion, when one turns to provisions other than the opening part of para 3(1) and para 3(1A)(b), it is apparent that such hope value is not to be excluded.</p>
<p class="para">105.&nbsp;&nbsp;     Of course, as Lord Hoffmann implies, if one accepts (as I do) that the bracketed words in the opening part of para 3(1) of Schedule 6 should be given a wide meaning, any cutting down of that wide meaning  must be on a principled and clear basis, and must be justified by the provisions of the Schedule. In this connection, para 3(1)(b) and para 4 are important. First, if, as the respondents contend and the Court of Appeal held, the bracketed words in the opening part of para 3(1) require one to assume that none of the flat tenants are or will ever be interested in acquiring new leases of their flats, there would be no point in including the requirement in the opening part of para 3(1)(b) that one disregards the fact that they have the right to do so. That therefore suggests that, for para 3 purposes, one should not disregard the possibility of the market taking into account at least some of the flat tenants seeking to negotiate new leases of their respective flats. It is perfectly true that words such as those in the opening part of para 3(1)(b) are commonplace compulsory acquisition valuation assumptions (as evidenced by para (a) of sections 9(1) and 9(1A) of the 1967 Act). However, that does not invalidate the point, although I accept that, if it stood on its own, it would be a shaky foundation for my conclusion that hope value can be included in relation to non-participating tenants’ flats.</p>
<p class="para">106.&nbsp;&nbsp;     However, the bracketed words of para 3(1)(b), which permit taking into account a notice under section 42 - i.e. a notice seeking a new lease under chapter II - served by a non-participating tenant, are also of significance in this connection. Lord Hoffman suggests that they merely indicate that the valuation can take into account the fact that such a tenant has exercised his chapter II right, in the same way as one can take into account the fact that such a tenant has actually been granted a new lease pursuant to chapter II. However, it appears to me that this is inconsistent with an interpretation of the opening part of para 3(1) which requires one to assume that such a tenant does not wish to acquire any further interest in his flat. That point is reinforced by the fact that sub-para (b) is intended to be an “assumption” - see the end of the opening part of para 3(1) and the start of sub-para (b) - not an exception to the opening part of para 3(1).  </p>
<p class="para">107.&nbsp;&nbsp;     There are two reasons why, in my opinion, the bracketed words in para 3(1)(b) are significant for present purposes. First, all that the service of a section 42 notice does is to give the tenant a right to acquire a new lease: he can pull out at any time - see section 52. Accordingly, para 3(1) permits some hope value attributable to non-participating tenants’ flats to be included on any view. Secondly, the bracketed words in para 3(1)(b) require one to take into account the “notice", not the rights and obligations which accrue pursuant to it. That suggests to me that the purpose of sub-para (b) is to entitle the landlord to argue that the section 42 notice is evidence that the tenant concerned is interested in acquiring a new lease of his flat. Where a non-participating tenant has served such a notice, the hope value attributable to his flat may well be increased because he has made it clear that he is interested in acquiring a new lease of his flat. In other words, by serving a section 42 notice, a non-participating tenant has, in my view, assisted any contention that he would be in the market, because he has evinced a desire to acquire a new lease of his flat at market value, which is what Schedule 13 effectively means that he would have to pay.</p>
<p class="para">108.&nbsp;&nbsp;     Accordingly, para 3(1)(b) appears to me to indicate that, while the bracketed words in the opening part of para 3(1) are to be construed widely, they do not prohibit taking into account the possibility of non-participating tenants seeking to negotiate new leases of their respective flats. This view is reinforced by the contents of para 4, under which marriage value must be taken into account in relation to the participating tenants’ ability to take new leases of their respective flats. On this basis, there would be a symmetry between para 4, which requires marriage value to be taken into account in relation to participating tenants, limited to their obtaining new leases of their respective flats, and para 3, which entitles the landlord to seek hope value in relation to the non-participating tenants, again limited to the prospect of their seeking new leases of their respective flats. Para 4 also explains why, under para 3, hope value can only be taken into account as against non-participating tenants: if the landlord is entitled to marriage value as against participating tenants, then he is not entitled to hope value as well: see the discussion in relation to section 9(1A). </p>
<p class="para">109.&nbsp;&nbsp;     Further, I have already referred to the unfairness and arbitrariness of excluding hope value arising from the possibility of non-participating tenants seeking new leases of their flats in the para 3 valuation, when marriage value arising from the rights of participating tenants to obtain new leases of their flats can, indeed must, be taken into account under the para 4 valuation. While it is right to give the bracketed words in the opening part of para 3(1) an extended meaning so that they have commercial efficacy, it does not follow that one cannot limit that extension, particularly where the limitation is supported by other provisions elsewhere in paragraphs 3 and 4, and by commercial fairness, and where the limitation in question is clear and logical.  </p>
<p class="para">110.&nbsp;&nbsp;     Some further support for the notion that hope value can be sought in respect of non-participating tenants’ flats is to be found in section 18 of the 1993 Act, which requires disclosure to the landlord of any agreements made between participating tenants and non-participating tenants. This seems to me to represent an acknowledgment that such agreements could affect the assessment of the price payable for the freehold of the building. While such agreements could provide comparable evidence of general value, it appears to me that, if such agreements were not envisaged as assisting in the assessment of hope value in respect of non-participating tenants’ flats, then it is “difficult to explain fully the legislative intentions in respect of the disclosure of agreements under section 18", as Carnwath LJ accepted at [2008] 1 WLR 2142, para 56.</p>
<p class="para">111.&nbsp;&nbsp;     The interpretation of Schedule 6 is difficult, and this is attributable to its original complexity, the subsequent amendments which have been made to it, and the fact, pointed out by my noble and learned friend Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe in his opinion, which I have had the privilege of reading in draft, that it is perhaps unfortunate that its drafting was based on Schedule 13, which is concerned with a far simpler construct. In reaching the conclusion that hope value in respect of non-participating tenants’ flats is excluded, Lord Hoffmann relies in part on the drafting history of the present paras 2 to 4 of Schedule 6. The original drafting of at least parts of chapter I of part I of the 1993 Act left much to be desired, and subsequent amendments have in some cases made things worse. The poorness of the drafting means that, in my opinion, it is safer to construe the paragraphs as they now stand, rather than seeking to identify what purpose or errors may be revealed at earlier stages. I should add that the inept drafting of the 1993 Act is unfair on landlords, who are being deprived of their property, and on residential tenants, the very people who are intended to benefit from the legislation.</p>
