<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120.	Upon the expiry of a custody time limit an accused is normally entitled to be released on bail, unless some other custody time limit for some other offence is still unexpired (see section 4(8A), Bail Act 1976).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121.	Section 22(3) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985, as originally enacted, conferred power on a magistrates' court to extend a custody time limit if satisfied "(a) that there is good and sufficient cause for doing so, and (b) that the prosecution has acted with all due expedition".  In <i> R v Manchester Crown Court, Ex p McDonald</i> [1999]  1 WLR 841 it was held that the court could extend a custody time limit only if both those criteria were satisfied.  Lord Bingham of Cornhill CJ giving the judgment of the court, said, at p 847: "What the court must require is such diligence and expedition as would be shown by a competent prosecutor conscious of his duty to bring the case to trial as quickly as reasonably and fairly possible".  Under an amendment made to section 22(3) by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, the criteria that had to be satisfied for an extension to be granted were modified.  A particular change was that, in place of the original (b), the court, in order to extend a custody time limit, had to be satisfied "that the prosecution [had] acted with all due diligence and expedition".  This amendment did not come in to effect until 1 June 1999.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122.	When the appellant was brought before the Leeds Magistrates' Court on 19 March 1999, the prosecution preferred a charge of manslaughter against him, in substitution for the original charge of murder.  The defence had been notified on 10 March that this would be done.  The prosecution gave as their reason for making this change that additional medical evidence had been received from their pathologist, Dr Milroy, on 4 March and had shown that the case against the appellant should be pursued as one of manslaughter rather than murder.  There was, however, no material difference between Dr Milroy's report of 4 March and the reports he had earlier made in October and November 1998.  He had consistently attributed Mr Nutter's death to heart failure brought about by the manhandling suffered in the course of the burglary and the stress thereby caused.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123.	The prosecution contended that the charge of manslaughter, being a charge of a new offence, attracted a fresh 70 day custody time limit commencing on 19 March 1999, the date on which the appellant first appeared before the magistrates' court on that offence.  No doubt in well-founded anticipation that the defence would contest that that was so, the prosecution applied for an extension of the original custody time limit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;124.	The magistrate granted the extension but also expressed himself as satisfied that in any event a new 70 day period had been attracted by the manslaughter charge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125.	The appellant appealed to the Crown Court.  The appeal was heard by Judge Hoffman on 22 March 1999.  He disagreed with the magistrate on the extension.  He said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In the circumstances, I have no hesitation in finding that the prosecution in relation to Wardle did not act with all due expedition."<p></p></ul>
<p>But, on the question whether the substitution of manslaughter for murder had caused a new 70 day custody time limit to run, he agreed with the magistrate.  He held that manslaughter was a new and distinct offence which attracted its own custody time limit.  He considered, also, whether the substitution had been made in bad faith for an improper motive, namely for the purpose of preventing the release of the appellant from custody on the expiry of the original custody time limit.  As to that, there seems to have been no evidence before the court from anyone on the prosecution side explaining the reasons why the manslaughter charge had been substituted and what, if any, part the imminent expiry of the original 70 day period had played.  It was counsel appearing for the prosecution who attributed the change to the contents of the medical report of 4 March.  But that seems an insubstantial reason since it appears to have been common ground that there was nothing significant in that report that had not been in the earlier reports.  Be that as it may, and notwithstanding the absence of any evidence from the prosecution as to its reasons, the judge expressed himself as satisfied that there was nothing from which bad faith on the prosecution's part could be implied.  What the consequence would have been if bad faith had been found is not clear and is something to which I shall have to return.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;126.	The appellant sought to challenge, by way of judicial review, Judge Hoffman's decision.  The Divisional Court, on 26 April 1999, gave leave but dismissed the substantive application.  The judgment was given by Mitchell J with whose judgment Kennedy LJ agreed.  Mitchell J reviewed a number of authorities and concluded, as had Judge Hoffman, that the preferring of the manslaughter charge had attracted a new custody time limit.  As to the prosecution's reasons for introducing the manslaughter charge, Mitchell J said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Abuse of process is not alleged.  It is difficult to see how such an allegation could succeed because, as I have said, it is desirable that, where the evidence only warrants an allegation of manslaughter, then manslaughter should be charged and murder withdrawn."<p></p></ul>
<p>and</p>
<p></p><ul>"For the claim 'abuse of process' to succeed, bad faith must be established.  That is a heavy burden to discharge.  It is not altogether clear on the authorities whether the  charging of an offence justified on the evidence, but solely for the purpose of creating a new custody time limit, itself amounts without more to bad faith.  If it does not, then it is difficult to see how there could be any effective challenge to these practices.  This considerable measure of latitude which has been extended to prosecutors seems to me to be wholly inconsistent with the purpose of regulation 4, because, in effect, it enables the prosecution to bypass the requirement in section 22(3)(b) that any extension of the time limit has to be justified by showing, under the amendment to section 22(3)(b) introduced by [section] 43 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 (which appears not yet to be in force), not only all due expedition but also due diligence."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;127.	Kennedy LJ expressly associated himself with the sentiments expressed by Mitchell J in the passages I have cited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;128.	I share the concern expressed by Mitchell J and Kennedy LJ.  The legislative intention which led to section 22 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 and the Regulations made thereunder seems to me quite clear.  It is to provide a maximum period during which an accused can be held in custody awaiting trial.  Extensions of that period are strictly controlled and can be allowed only if the prosecution can show that it has acted with all due diligence and expedition (see section 22(3)(b) as originally enacted and as amended).  If, in the period following an accused's first appearance before the magistrates, new facts emerge which the prosecution need to consider and which may lead to the formulation of a new charge against the accused, I find no difficulty in accepting that an extension of the original 70 day custody time limit may be necessary.  And a statutory scheme which allows a further 70 days from the accused's first appearance before the magistrates on a new charge based at least to more than a trivial extent on new facts is not necessarily inconsistent with the legislative intention to which I have referred.  But where the new charge is based not on any new facts but on the facts on which the original charge was based, and is simply a lesser charge than that originally preferred, the proposition that the preferment of the new charge attracts a new 70 day custody time limit seems to me to be one that defeats the legislative intention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;129.	In the present case the prosecution did not act with all due diligence and expedition.  Judge Hoffman so found and refused the application for an extension.  It has not been suggested that he was in error.  And yet, by introducing the manslaughter charge on the day of expiry of the original custody time limit, the prosecution procured a further 70 days during which the appellant could be kept in custody.  It is, of course, true that it was open to the appellant on 19 March to make an application for bail, and indeed he did so.  But the new custody time limit defeated his absolute right to the grant of bail under section 4(8A) of the Bail Act 1976 and his bail application was, in the event, refused.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;130.	If the committal hearing had taken place on 19 March, as it would have done if the prosecution had not failed to act with all due diligence and expedition, the prosecution could at the same time have substituted the manslaughter charge for the murder charge and the appellant would have been committed to the Crown Court for trial on the manslaughter charge.  If the proceedings had taken that course, the period during which he would have been in custody before the committal would not have exceeded the original 70 days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;131.	On this appeal, the critical question for your Lordships, in my opinion, is whether there is a permissible application of section 22 and regulation 4 of the 1987 Regulations that would prevent, in a case such as this, the substituted charge from attracting a fresh 70 day custody time limit.  There is no doubt, I believe, that if that result can be reached it ought to be reached.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;132.	This conclusion is fortified by the impact in a case such as the present of the Convention rights to be found in article 5 of the European Convention and of section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998.  Section 3(1) requires primary and subordinate legislation "so far as it is possible to do so …. [to] be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights".  The words "and given effect" are of significance.  Section 3(1) is directed to the effect of legislation as well as to its construction.  One of the Convention rights to be found in article 5 is "the right to liberty and security of person" (article 5.1).  The article goes on to provide for exceptions:</p>
<p></p><ul>"No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;133.	One of the "cases" relates to the detention pending trial of a person suspected of having committed an offence (para (c)).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;134.	In <i>Bozano v France</i> [1986]  9 EHRR 297 the Strasbourg Court said that "any measure depriving the individual of his liberty must be compatible with the purpose of article 5, namely to protect the individual from arbitrariness" (p 313).  The same point was made in <i>Brogan v United Kingdom</i> [1988]  11 EHRR 117 at p 134: "[article 5] enshrines a fundamental human right, namely the protection of the individual against arbitrary interferences by the State with his right to liberty," and in <i>Amuur v France</i> [1996]  22 EHRR 533, at p 559:  "any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of article 5, namely to protect the individual from arbitrariness."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;135.	A construction and application of section 22(1) of the 1985 Act and regulation 4(4) of the 1987 Regulations that enable the prosecution, by preferring a new charge, to withhold from the accused the release from custody to which he would otherwise have been entitled, in a case where there were no new facts and the new charge was and always had been comprehended within the original charge, would subject the accused to arbitrariness.  Section 3(1) of the 1998 Act requires your Lordships, if it is possible to do so, to avoid allowing section 22(1) and regulation 4 to produce that result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 22(1) empowers the Secretary of State:</p>
<p></p><ul>"by regulations [to] make provision, with respect to any specified preliminary stage of proceedings for an offence, as to the maximum period —<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)	to be allowed to the prosecution to complete that stage;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)	during which the accused may, while awaiting completion of that stage, be -<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>	(i)	in the custody of a magistrates' court<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>or	<p></p></ul>
(iii) <p></p><ul>in the custody of the Crown Court; <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>in relation to that offence."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;136.	The "provision" referred to by section 22(1) is made by the 1987 Regulations.  Regulation 4 makes the "provision" regarding custody time limits in magistrates' courts.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph (1) provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"…the maximum period during which a person accused of an indictable offence other than treason may be in the custody of a magistrates' court in relation to that offence while awaiting completion of any preliminary stage of the proceedings specified in the following provisions of this Regulation shall be as stated in those provisions."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;137.	Paragraph (4) of regulation 4 deals specifically with offences triable on indictment exclusively.  This, therefore, is the particular provision that applied in the present case.  It provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"(4)	In the case of an offence triable on indictment exclusively the maximum period of custody between the accused's first appearance and the time when the court decides whether or not to commit the accused to the Crown Court for trial, shall be 70 days."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression "first appearance" is defined in regulation 2(2):</p>
<p></p><ul>"In these Regulations, a reference to a person's first appearance in relation to proceedings in a magistrates' court for an offence is—<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a) …<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b) …<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(c)	in any other case, a reference to the time when first he appears or is brought before the court on an information charging him with that offence."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;138.	Regulations 2(2)(c) and 4(4), literally construed, and subject to abuse of process if it be shown to have been present, make it impossible, in my opinion, to resist the conclusion that a new 70 day custody time began on 19 March when the appellant first appeared in court on the manslaughter charge.  Manslaughter may be comprehended within a murder charge but it is, nonetheless, a separate offence.  If murder by striking the victim with an axe or a bludgeon is charged, it must follow that the alleged acts that constitute the offence would include the facts necessary to constitute also, apart from manslaughter, the offence of unlawful wounding.  But no one would describe unlawful wounding as the same offence as murder, or, for that matter, as manslaughter.  Each is a separate offence albeit that the facts alleged to constitute the most serious of them, i.e. murder, would include the facts necessary to constitute each of the others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;139.	If, for the purposes of regulation 2(2)(c), the relevant offence is the offence of manslaughter, the reference in the opening sentence to "an offence" is a reference to the offence of manslaughter and the words "that offence" at the end of paragraph (c) must also be read as a reference to manslaughter.  On that footing, for the purposes of regulation 4(4), the appellant's "first appearance" in relation to the offence of manslaughter was 19 March 1999 and a 70 day custody time limit began on that date.  There is, in my opinion, no literal construction that can avoid this result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;140.	So could a purposive construction and purposive application of section 22 and regulation 4(4) do so?  In the debate before your Lordships various suggestions were made as to words that might be added to, or substituted for, words in regulation 2(2) and in regulation 4(4) in order to produce a result that accorded with the legislative intention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;141.	Mr. MacDonald QC, counsel for the appellant, suggested that the words "that offence" in regulation 4(1) and in regulation 2(2)(c) could be expanded so as to read "that offence or any other offence arising out of the same facts".  An alternative formulation might be "that offence or any other offence arising out of the allegations in the information or charge".  A number of difficulties arise out of these suggested formulations.  The expression "the same facts" prompts the question "The same facts as what facts?".  The facts as known on the date of the original charge?  Or the facts as known by some subsequent, and if so, what, date?  Or the facts comprised in the information or charge?  As to the information or charge, the contents may be of the sketchiest character at the time the accused makes his first appearance.  A third suggested formulation, namely, "that offence or any offence for which the magistrates could commit the accused for trial" seems to me now, although I believe I suggested it, equally unsatisfactory.  Under section 6(1) of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980, magistrates can commit an accused for trial in the Crown Court on any indictable offence disclosed by the evidence before them.  The offence does not have to be that with which the accused was originally charged and may depend on new facts which have emerged since the accused's first appearance before the magistrates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;142.	The difficulties which these alternative formulations would be likely to give rise to have led me to conclude that the problem posed by the present case cannot be satisfactorily solved by a purposive reformulation of the statutory language to be found in regulation 4.  I believe, however, that it could be solved by a judicial limitation on the effect to be given to regulation 4 in the case of a new charge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;143.	In my opinion, it is open to your Lordships to rule that if an accused, having appeared or been brought before a magistrates' court on an information charging him with an offence, is then charged with a new offence of which he might, if tried on the original offence, have been convicted (see section 6 (2), (3) and (4), Criminal Law Act 1967), a new custody time limit will not be attracted by the new offence and the accused's "first appearance" in relation to the new offence will be the date on which he first appeared or was brought before the magistrates' court on the information or charge relating to the original offence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;144.	If the addition, or substitution, of the new offence has the consequence that the prosecution is not ready to proceed with the committal hearing within the original 70 day custody time limit, it is always open to the prosecution to apply for an extension.  Whether the prosecution would obtain an extension would depend on their showing they had acted "with all due diligence and expedition".  The end result would thus be in accordance with the legislative intention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;145.	This result can be produced by giving a purposive effect to the statutory provisions notwithstanding that a satisfactory grammatical reformulation of the provisions may not be possible.  There is authority from your Lordships' House that this is a permissible technique of statutory interpretation.</p>
<i>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;146.<i>	R v Schildkamp</i> [1971]  AC 1 raised a point about section 332(3) of the Companies Act 1948.  Schildkamp had been charged with a number of offences in connection with the conduct of the business of a company.  One of the offences charged was "carrying on the business of a company with intent to defraud creditors contrary to section 332(3) of the Companies Act 1948".  Schildkamp was convicted on this charge.  He appealed on the ground, among others, that the company in question, Fiesta Tours Ltd, had never been wound up and that before a prosecution could be initiated for fraudulent trading under section 332(3) the company had to be in liquidation.  The Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) agreed and allowed the appeal but certified that a point of law of general public importance was involved, namely, "what, if any, words of limitation must be imported in subsection (3) of section 332 of the Companies Act 1948?"  The appeal to your Lordships' House was dismissed.  Lord Guest and Viscount Dilhorne, dissenting, took the view that since the words of subsection (3) were clear and unambiguous they should be given effect to without speculating about Parliament's intentions.  Lord Upjohn, however, while accepting that "The subsection plainly applies as a matter of language to the case where there has been no subsequent winding up" (p 22), emphasised:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The task of the court is to ascertain the intention of Parliament; you cannot look at a section, still less a sub-section, in isolation, to ascertain that intention: you must look at all the admissible surrounding circumstances before starting to construe the Act" (p 23)<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;147.	So Lord Upjohn examined the whole of the 1948 Act and took into account its legislative history and concluded that it was not Parliament's intention that subsection (3) should be of general application while the company was a going concern.  He then said, at p 25:</p>
<p></p><ul>"If the appellant's [i.e. the Crown's] argument to the effect that to limit the effect of subsection (3) to prosecutions after the commencement of the winding up you must virtually rewrite the subsection was correct, I should see much force in his argument, for it would be very difficult to rewrite the subsection so that in grammatical terms you confined it to prosecutions after winding up, but I do not think this is necessary for reasons which I will give later."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;148.	The reasons to which Lord Upjohn referred were, in short, that since it was clear that Parliament had not intended subsection (3) to apply to cases where the company had not gone into liquidation, the court could, and should, simply limit the application of the subsection accordingly.  The following passage is in point:</p>
<p></p><ul>"But, in my opinion, no alteration to the phraseology of subsection (3) is required; it stands as it is, plain and unambiguous, but the context in which it is found requires a limitation in its application to cases where the company has subsequently gone into liquidation." (p 26A-B)<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;149.	Lord Upjohn found support for his approach in a Scottish case, <i>Robertson and Baxter v Inglis</i> (1897)  24 R 758, in which the scope of section 3 of the Factors Act 1889 had had to be considered.  The question was whether section 3, which stated that a pledge of documents of title to goods should be deemed to be a pledge of the goods, was of general application or was limited to dealings by mercantile agents.  The Inner House held that it was so limited.  Lord Upjohn commented on the case:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Perhaps the opinion of Lord Trayner, at p 816, is most in point.  The Inner House did not reach this conclusion by construing section 3 as a matter of language as so limited but by limiting its scope and ambit to cases where the pledge was by a mercantile agent." (p 26) <p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;150.	Lord Reid expressed his agreement with Lord Upjohn.  Lord Hodson came to the same conclusion.  He, too, found support from <i>Inglis v Robertson and Baxter.  </i>He said, at p 12:</p>
<p></p><ul>"I am not impressed by the argument that some rewriting of subsection (3) is necessary to make it correspond in terms with subsection (i) mutatis mutandis<i>.</i>"<p></p></ul>
<i>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;151.<i>	R v Schildkamp</i> shows that where in order to give effect to Parliament's intention it is necessary to restrict the effect of a statutory provision, it is not a necessary pre-condition that a suitable reformulation of the provision be devised, nor is it necessarily fatal that the statutory provision is clear and unambiguous.  It is, of course, essential that Parliament's intention should be clear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;152.	The facts of the present case have, in my opinion, demonstrated that Parliament's intention that there should be a maximum period during which an accused can be kept in custody pending a committal hearing will be frustrated if it is open to the prosecution, by charging a lesser offence, of which the accused was already at risk under the originally charged offence, to produce a fresh custody time limit.  A purposive application of regulation 4(4), and regulation 2(2)(c), to cases where new offences of that character are charged would enable Parliament's intention to be achieved. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, therefore, allow the appeal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;153.	In concluding, I wish to say a word or two about abuse of process.  Your Lordships have been referred to a number of cases in which consideration has been given to the consequences for custody time limits if a new charge is preferred against an accused for an improper purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;154. In </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;155. In<i> R v Wirral District Magistrates' Court, Ex p Meikle</i> (1990)  154 JP 1035 new offences had been charged but mala fides on the part of the prosecution in preferring the new charges had not been alleged.  Nonetheless it was argued for the accused that the new charges were a procedural device designed to circumvent the custody time limit Regulations and an abuse of process.  Watkins LJ would have none of it.  He said, at p 1041:</p>
<p></p><ul>"As to abuse of process, in the absence as here of mala fides<i>,</i> the effect of which it is unnecessary for present purposes to consider, there is no authority for the proposition that the doctrine can apply to decisions made on ancillary matters such as bail on the charge facing the accused".<p></p></ul>
<p>In <i>R v Great Yarmouth Magistrates, Ex p Thomas, Davis and Darlington,</i> [1992] Crim LR 116; 29 July 1991, Watkins LJ reiterated his view that dishonesty or mala fides in preferring the new charges would have to be shown if abuse of process were to be made out.  He said, however, that if abuse of process were made out the court would have "no alternative but to admit these people to bail" (p 5 of the transcript). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;155.	In my opinion, the requirement of dishonesty or mala fides distracts attention from the true requirements if an allegation of abuse of process is to be made out.  The concept of abuse of process is no different in criminal cases from the like concept in civil cases.  It involves a use of court process for a purpose other than that for which the purpose in question was intended.  It is in that sense that one may speak of some procedural step being taken for an improper purpose and, therefore, constituting an abuse of process.  The procedural step will often be accompanied by bad faith or dishonesty — in that a legitimate purpose, not being the true purpose, may be put forward as the true purpose.  But bad faith or dishonesty are not essential.  What is essential is that court process has been used for some ulterior purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;156.	There will be difficulty where the purpose is mixed.  The present case may well be an example.  There was every reason, it being clear that the known facts did not support a murder charge but only manslaughter, for the withdrawal of the former and the substitution of the latter as soon as practicable.  But the timing of the substitution suggests very strongly, to my mind, that it was done in order to forestall the automatic release of the appellant from custody.  There was no evidence at all from the prosecution as to its reasons for formally substituting manslaughter for murder on 19 March.  The prosecution could simply have informed the defence that the murder charge would not be proceeded with and that they would be seeking a committal on manslaughter.  In my opinion, however, if a step in litigation is taken for a legitimate reason, whether or not it is also taken for an illegitimate one, the step cannot be categorised as an abuse of process.  The legitimate reason must, of course, be more than merely makeweight or trivial.  If abuse of process can be shown, the procedural step taken should, strictly, be regarded as a nullity.  This was a point made more than once in the course of the hearing of the appeal by my noble and learned friend, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead.  It is, in my respectful opinion, unanswerable and obviously right.  If a new charge is preferred, not with any genuine intention that the accused should be tried on that charge, but simply in order to attract a new custody time limit, the preferring of the new charge is an abuse of process and the new charge should be struck out as soon as that has become apparent.  </p>
