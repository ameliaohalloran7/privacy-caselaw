<p class="para">79.&nbsp;&nbsp;The definitions that I have already mentioned, and others, such as Costs and Incentives (“C&amp;I”), that I have yet to come to, can be quite confusing. It is important, I think, to discern and keep in mind the general structure of schedule 6 of the agreement. The components of the price referable to the commercial development (TCLV) and the residential parking (TRCPLV) were to be calculated under the simple formulae already mentioned (together they eventually amounted to about £1.727m).   By contrast, the price for the residential development was to consist of two elements, the TRLV and the ARP.   The TRLV is agreed to be approximately £4.684m, reflecting the approved residential internal area of rather over 61,000 square feet at £76.34 per square foot.   The question is how much this sum has to be increased by the ARP to make up the owner’s total consideration for the residential development.</p>
<p class="para">80.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ARP is defined as follows:</p>
<p class="qt">“23.4% of the price achieved for each Residential Unit in excess of the Minimum Guaranteed Residential Unit Value ['MGRUV'] less the [C&amp;I]”</p>
<p class="para">The amount of the C&amp;I is agreed to have been relatively trivial - a little less than £250,000 for all 100 flats - and I put it aside for the moment,  while recognising that it plays an important part in the technicalities of the argument on construction. If this item is disregarded for the moment the disputed text can be set out in a simplified form, using “RP” (for residential price) where the judge and the Court of Appeal referred to Unit Price:</p>
<p class="qt">“23.4% of the RP in excess of the MGRUV".</p>
<p class="para">81.&nbsp;&nbsp;The MGRUV was defined as meaning:</p>
<p class="qt">“for each Residential Unit [ie each flat] the [TRLV] divided by the number of Residential Units for which Planning Permission is granted".</p>
<p class="para">Under the planning permission eventually granted on 23 August 2002 there were to be exactly 100 flats, which simplifies the arithmetic.   Nevertheless it may be unfortunate that the draftsman chose to define the ARP by a formula referring to the MGRUV rather than by referring directly to the TRLV (to which the MGRUV is directly linked, being, as events turned out, one per cent of it).   The use of the two linked formulae rather than one, and the fact that the formulae are not set out in mathematical notation, make it harder to keep clearly in mind the structure of the arrangements contained in schedule 6.</p>
<p class="para">82.&nbsp;&nbsp;Briggs J expressed the issue in paras 20 and 21 of his judgment:</p>
<p class="qt">“Leaving aside for the moment the point at which the C&amp;I are deducted, the broad commercial effect of each of the parties’ rival submissions may be summarised as follows.  Chartbrook’s case was that it was entitled to a 23.4% share of the net proceeds of sale of each Residential Unit in excess of a minimum guaranteed amount (being the unitised Total Residential Land Value of £76.34 per square foot of Residential Net Internal Area).  Put another way, its stake in the residential part of the development was to be the whole of the first £76.34 per square foot of net sales value, and 23.4% of the surplus.  </p>
<p class="qt">By contrast, Persimmon’s case was that Chartbrook was to receive an additional payment only if 23.4%  of the net sales price amounted to more than the Minimum Guaranteed Residential Unit Value.  Put more broadly, Chartbrook’s stake in the residential part of the development was whichever was the greater of :</p>
<p class="qt">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;23.4% of the net residential sales price; and,</p>
<p class="qt">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;the guaranteed minimum of £76.34 per square foot of Residential Net Internal Area.”</p>
<p class="para">83.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is, with great respect to the judge, a confusing way of putting it, because it fails to distinguish between the two elements of the price for the residential development and to make clear whether it is addressing both elements, or only the ARP.   The owner was to get the TRLV in any event, as the most important component of the TLV (a point that may be reflected in the expression “in excess of” in the definition of the ARP).   Indeed paras 20 and 21 of the judgment are to my mind two ways of describing the same result, unless the judge intended para 20 to state the owner’s view of the ARP alone, and para 21 to state the developer’s view of the TRLV and the ARP operating in conjunction.</p>
<p class="para">84.&nbsp;&nbsp;In his brief judgment Rimer LJ quoted the definition of the ARP and observed in para 183:</p>
<p class="qt">“There is nothing unclear, uncertain or ambiguous about that.   It is clear, certain and unambiguous and its arithmetic is straightforward".</p>
<p class="para">Tuckey LJ agreed. With profound respect to both of them, I totally disagree.   The definition is obviously defective as a piece of drafting.   To start with defects that can be spotted and remedied fairly easily, the draftsman could not decide whether he was dealing with the flats (“each Residential Unit”) collectively or individually.   The MGRUV was one-hundredth of the TRLV, but the C&amp;I was plainly defined as a single aggregate figure.</p>
<p class="para">85.&nbsp;&nbsp;Much more significantly and problematically, the draftsman has failed to notice the ambiguity of the formula “<i>x </i>per cent of the RP in excess of the MGRUV less the C&amp;I".   The ambiguity could be resolved by the use of mathematical notation, as the judge observed in paras 18 and 19 of his judgment (though he did not mention that there was also a choice to be made as to putting another set of brackets round MGRUV - C&amp;I, so producing four possibilities rather than two).</p>
<p class="para">86.&nbsp;&nbsp;Treated acontextually, the formula “<i>x</i> per cent of A in excess of B” is undoubtedly ambiguous.    It can mean (<i>x</i>/100 x A)-B or  <i>x</i>/100(A-B).   If required to guess I would opt for the latter meaning, because the expression “in excess of” has been used rather than “less", and to my mind “in excess of” suggests a focus on B as an integer and distances it from the percentage.   But I readily accept that this would be little more than guesswork.</p>
<p class="para">87.&nbsp;&nbsp;In a contract negotiated between businessmen there always is a commercial context.  If a contracting party agrees to pay the whole of some budgeted cost (B, say £100,000) and also agrees to pay 25% of the eventual actual cost (A, say £140,000) in excess of the budgeted costs, he would expect to pay a total of £110,000. Both elements of the obligation are, as it were, in the same currency, that is, cost, and the wording of the second element naturally translates into the formula </p>
<p class="para">¼ (A-B), as (¼A)-B would be commercial nonsense.   The owner can therefore give plausible examples in which ¼(A-B) would obviously be the right answer.   But the present appeal is not such a case.</p>
<p class="para">88.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case the very significant difference between the results produced by the competing formulae is demonstrated in the figures set out in para 14 of the judgment of Lawrence Collins LJ in the Court of Appeal.  The difference between the two bottom lines (£5,580,616 and £9,168,427) is £3,587,811.  That difference figure is 76.6% of the TRLV (£4,683,565).  On the owner’s case it gets one hundred times the MGRUV as the TRLV, but in effect has to give credit for only 23.4% of it in the calculation of the ARP.  That seems to be a fairly surprising bargain for commercial men to make.  It becomes not merely surprising but totally incredible if one takes account of the fact that although schedule 6 does not in terms state that the ARP is to have no value unless the actual receipts from sales of flats exceed the TRLV, that is implicit in its structure. On the owner’s construction any such limitation is contradicted, and the ARP has a substantial value even if the sales do not reach the “trigger point” of £20.015m (23.4% of which is £4.684m).</p>
<p class="para">89.&nbsp;&nbsp;This can be illustrated by considering the effect of the competing formulae (set out in paras 18 and 19 of the judge’s judgment, but continuing to exclude C&amp;I for the present) for assumed residential sale price totals (RP) of £18m, £20m, £20.015m (the trigger point),  £22m and £23.849m (the actual result):</p>

<p class="para">RP = Total actual receipts from residential sales</p>
<p class="para">MG = Total Residential Land Value (100 x MGRUV)</p>
<p class="para">All amounts in £m</p>
  
<p class="para">The figures are, on the owner’s construction, commercial nonsense.   They would bring the owner a total of £7.8m for the residential development (£4.684m + £3.116m) even if sales of flats were disastrously low at £18m.  The idea of the TRLV (linked as it is to the MGRUV) as a guaranteed minimum would be totally subverted.</p>
<p class="para">90.&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge accepted that there was some force in the developer’s reliance on the words “if any” which occur in para 3.3 of schedule 6 with reference to the Balancing Payment (alias the ARP).    He saw less force in the submission that he should give weight to the natural meaning of the expressions “minimum", “guaranteed” and “additional” in the definitions of the MGRUV and the ARP, on the ground that by the use of a special definition “[t]he word or phrase is stripped of its natural meaning"(para 61). In preferring the owner’s submissions the judge attached particular weight to the difficulty (for the developer) of explaining the words “less the C&amp;I".   The judge observed (paras 55-57):</p>
<p class="qt">“An equally serious problem with Persimmon’s construction is what to do with the subtraction of the C&amp;I.  It is common ground that the Costs and Incentives have a linear relationship with the amount of the price achieved for each Residential Unit.  For example, Persimmon may agree the sale of a flat for £250,000 after incurring Costs and Incentives of say £50,000 or, with the same commercial consequence, sell the same flat for £200,000 but incur no Costs and Incentives.  Typical Incentives would include payment of the purchaser’s legal fees or stamp duty, or the installation of special features such as wooden floors, over and above the standard fit-out specification.</p>
<p class="qt">One would expect Chartbrook’s profit share to be unaffected, one way or the other, by the decision of Persimmon to sell a particular flat by one or other of those methods (high price plus Incentives or low price without Incentives).  Chartbrook’s construction, under which the Costs and Incentives are deducted from the price achieved for each Residential Unit before the application of the 23.4% share, fulfils precisely that expectation.</p>
<p class="qt">By contrast, Persimmon’s construction deducts the C&amp;I  from the 23.4% of the price achieved for the Residential Unit before the net amount is compared with the MGRUV, to ascertain whether there is any excess.  By comparison with Chartbrook’s construction, that calculation magnifies the negative effect of C&amp;I by a factor of more than 3 in comparison with the positive effect of the increase in the Residential Unit Price attributable to the C&amp;I.”</p>
<p class="para">91.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawrence Collins LJ took a different view, and I unhesitatingly prefer his view.   His reasons are set out clearly in paras 90 to 94 of his judgment, and I cannot usefully add much to them.   But I would make a few further comments.</p>
<p class="para">92.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is as to the perceived problem about C&amp;I.   It is true that from the developer’s point of view it made little or no difference (except perhaps for timing and tax) whether or not, in relation to a particular flat, it spent an extra £2,000 on parquet flooring or granite worktops and managed to sell the flat for £2,000 more as a result.   But it did make a marginal difference to the owner, as its ARP was calculated (in some way or other, on any view) by reference to the total achieved by residential sales: that is, by reference to the developer’s turnover and not by reference to the developer’s profit (the judge’s reference to “Chartbrook’s profit share” was not therefore entirely apposite).   So (to adopt the expression used in the courts below) C&amp;I had a linear relationship for the developer, but not for the owner.   It would therefore have made sense for the parties to have agreed that C&amp;I expenditure and allowances should be deducted from the total obtained for residential sales for the purposes of these computations (rather as the section 106 money and the rights of light money were to be disregarded in computing the TRLV).   But it would not make sense to deduct the whole of the C&amp;I from 23.4 per cent of the total obtained for residential sales.   </p>
<p class="para">93.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rimer LJ gave an example (para 185) to reinforce his view about the C&amp;I.  His example produces very odd results but that is partly because the figures taken are unrealistic.   If one takes more realistic figures (such as a normal average sale price of £200,000 with C&amp;I of £2,500 and an MGRUV of £47,500) the result is much less surprising.   But it is still anomalous and makes no commercial sense, as Lawrence Collins LJ observed. An ARP of (23.4% of [RP less C&amp;I]) less MGRUV does make commercial sense, and in my opinion it is well within the principles in <i>Antaios Cia Naviera v Salen Rederiana AB </i>[1985] AC 191, 201 and <i>Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd v West Bromwich Building Society </i>[1998] 1 WLR 896, 912-913, to read the agreement in that way.  </p>
<p class="para">94.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that Lawrence Collins LJ was right to give a lot of weight to the terms “minimum", “guaranteed” and “additional” in the relevant definitions.   There is a good deal of authority, if authority is needed, to give weight to the natural meaning of words in a definition.   In relation to statutory definitions there are the observations of my noble and learned friend, Lord Hoffmann, in <i>Macdonald v Dextra Accessories Ltd</i> [2005] 4 All ER 107, para 18 and <i>Birmingham City Council v Walker </i>[2007] 2AC 262, para 11 and Lord Scott of Foscote in <i>Oxfordshire County Council v Oxford City Council </i>[2006] 2 AC 674, paras 82-83.   I would apply the same principle to a definition in a commercial contract.</p>
<p class="para">95.&nbsp;&nbsp;That brings me back to what I said earlier about the need, in the midst of a thicket of rather confusing definitions, to keep in mind the general structure of the bargain.   As part of the TLV the owner was to receive the TRLV,  the total residential land value, representing the estimated value attributable to land which would (on the agreement becoming unconditional) have the benefit of a favourable planning permission for residential development (but on which development had not yet taken place). The developer was to bear all the costs of the development.  The owner was also to have the prospect of an additional payment, the ARP.  As regards the residential development the bargain could have been expressed between businessmen as “a guaranteed minimum of the first £76.34 per square foot of residential internal area from the total proceeds of the flats, and 23.4% of the excess” (indeed the judge, in para 20 of his judgment, summarised the owner’s case in very similar terms, except that he used “surplus” rather than “excess”).  If one approaches it in that way, the developer’s case as to the meaning of the definition is not merely linguistically possible, but is linguistically (as well as commercially) compelling.  The owner’s case becomes plausible only if one concentrates on the ARP, forgetting the TRLV (to which the MGRUV is directly linked).  Lawrence Collins LJ dealt with this point quite briefly, in paras 81 and 93 of his judgment.   He must have thought it unnecessary to spell it out more fully.   But as he ended in the minority I have dealt with the point more fully.</p>
<p class="para">96.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since preparing this opinion I have had the privilege of reading in draft the opinion of my noble and learned friend, Lord Hoffmann.  In paras 1 to 22 of his opinion Lord Hoffmann reaches precisely the same conclusion as I have reached in regard to the correct construction, by traditional methods, of the agreement.  I agree with all his reasoning, which is essentially the same as my own, but more trenchantly expressed.  I have however thought it worthwhile setting out my own more pedestrian route to the conclusion that this House should, without having to depart from established principles of construction, allow the appeal and dismiss Chartbrook’s claim.</p>
<p class="para">97.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also read with interest and admiration Lord Hoffmann’s observations, in the remaining part of his opinion, on the important questions that we do not have to decide.  I would not differ from any of these views.  In particular, I agree that <i>Karen Oltmann</i> is a questionable application of the “private dictionary” principle, since the meaning of the English word “after” can hardly be equated to the use of a technical or trade term. </p>
<p class="lawlord">BARONESS HALE OF RICHMOND</p>
<p class="mylords">My Lords,</p>
<p class="para">98.&nbsp;&nbsp;I too have had the privilege of reading in draft the opinions of my noble and learned friends, Lord Hoffmann and Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe. For the reasons they give, together with those of Lawrence Collins LJ in the Court of Appeal, I agree that Persimmon’s construction of this contract is correct and that this appeal should be allowed.</p>
<p class="para">99.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I have to confess that I would not have found it quite so easy to reach this conclusion had we not been made aware of the agreement which the parties had reached on this aspect of their bargain during the negotiations which led up to the formal contract. On any objective view, that made the matter crystal clear. This, to me, increased the attractions of accepting counsel’s eloquent invitation to reconsider the rule in <i>Prenn v Simmonds</i> [1971] 1 WLR 1381, the pot so gently but effectively stirred by Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead in his Chancery Bar Association lecture of 2005 ([2005] 121 LQR 577). My experience at the Law Commission has shown me how difficult it is to achieve flexible and nuanced reform to a rule of the common law by way of legislation. In the end abolition may be the only workable legislative solution, as eventually happened with the hearsay rule (Law Com No 216 (1993), <i>The Hearsay Rule in Civil Proceedings</i>). Even that can prove difficult if, on analysis, the view is taken that the rule has no real content, as with the parol evidence rule (Law Com No 154 (1986), <i>The Parol Evidence Rule</i>). The courts, on the other hand, are able to achieve step-by-step changes which can distinguish cases in which such evidence is “helpful” from cases in which it is not.</p>
<p class="para">100.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the approach to rectification adopted by Lord Hoffmann would go a long way towards providing a solution. If the test of the parties’ continuing common intentions is an objective one, then the court is looking to see whether there was such a prior consensus and if so what it was. Negotiations where there was no such consensus are indeed “unhelpful". But negotiations where consensus was reached are very helpful indeed. If the language in the eventual contract does not reflect that consensus, then unless there has been a later variation of it, the formal contract should be rectified to reflect it. It makes little sense if the test for construing their prior consensus is different from the objective test for construing their eventual contract. This situation is, and should be, quite different from the situation where one party is mistaken as to its meaning and the other party knows this - the latter should not be permitted to take advantage of the former.</p>
