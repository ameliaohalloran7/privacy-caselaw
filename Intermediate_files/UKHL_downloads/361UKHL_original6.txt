<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;142. The other issue, which is fundamental, raises two questions that must be kept separate:  one relates to the possible violation of article 6(1) of the Convention and the other to the remedy which the domestic law of England and Wales provides for such a violation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;143. First, if the responsible authorities delay for so long after charging a defendant that they cannot try him within a reasonable time, do they infringe his rights under article 6(1) of the Convention by bringing him to trial after the expiry of that reasonable time?  This question raises the same point on the construction of the reasonable time guarantee in article 6(1) as the Privy Council decided in <i>HM Advocate</i> <i>v R </i>[2003] 2 WLR 317.  The submissions of counsel were to much the same effect in both cases.  I have carefully reconsidered the arguments and even more carefully studied the speeches of the majority of your Lordships.  While appreciating the arguments to the contrary, I remain of the view that bringing a defendant to trial after the expiry of a reasonable time does indeed infringe his article 6(1) rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;144. Secondly, if holding a trial would infringe the defendant's article 6(1) rights, what is the appropriate remedy?  In answering this question, your Lordships have first to consider what remedy or remedies the Convention requires states to provide for a violation of the guarantee.  But your Lordships must then go further and consider what remedy or remedies the domestic law of England and Wales provides for such a violation.  This raises an issue about the interpretation of our domestic legislation that has not arisen before.  In <i>HM Advocate v R </i>the Privy Council had to interpret and apply section 57(2) of the Scotland Act 1998.  Here the House has to interpret and apply sections 6(1) and 8 of the Human Rights Act 1998 ("the 1998 Act").  I would answer this question in the same way as your Lordships but, unfortunately, on an entirely different basis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;145. I have had the privilege of reading the speech of my noble and learned friend, Lord Hope of Craighead, in draft.  I agree with his analysis.  Since the matter is of such importance, however, I consider it proper to set out my reasons in my own words.  In doing so, I shall refer to the "the defendant" even though, of course, in these proceedings the former defendant is now an acquitted person.</p>
<p><i>Right to a hearing within a reasonable time under article 6(1)</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;146. Where a defendant is in custody awaiting trial, delay in bringing him to trial affects his liberty.  For that reason civilised legal systems have long been vigilant to minimise such delays.  The Convention deals with them in article 5(3), which provides that a defendant in custody awaiting trial has a right to "trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial".  Where the defendant is not in custody, delay in bringing him to trial does not affect his liberty but may have other potentially pernicious effects which were identified by Lord Steyn in <i>Mills v HM Advocate </i>[2002] 3 WLR 1597, 1604, para 14.  In particular, whether or not he committed the offence, the defendant will be in suspense as to his fate, with possible ill effects on his health and general well-being.  Legal systems have been slower to recognise and combat this potential abuse.  For instance, in Scotland more than 275 years separated the Criminal Procedure Act 1701 (c 6), requiring those kept in custody to be tried within 110 days, and section 14 of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980, requiring the trial of those charged with serious offences and released on bail to begin within twelve months.  Even under the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995, which regulates such matters today, there is still no specific timetable for minor cases where the accused is at liberty.  This time-lag in regulating the position can seem surprising to those working in a jurisdiction where custody time-limits are taken seriously:  <i>HM Advocate v H </i>2000 JC 552, 553F-I per Lord Bonomy.  The explanation is probably historical.  In the past there was less call for a specific timetable for the trial of defendants who were at liberty:  with relatively few offences and prosecutions, in practice legal systems were able to deal with such cases fairly promptly.  Nowadays, with new offences and crowded court calendars, there is more need to recognise explicitly that, if the state charges someone with an offence, the charge should not be left hanging over him:  he is entitled to have it determined by a hearing within a reasonable time.  That is the important right which article 6(1) of the Convention gives him.  States must organise their legal systems so as to give effect to it.  Similarly, they must ensure a hearing within a reasonable time for the parties to civil proceedings.  I return to that point in paragraph 166 below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;147. The defendant's entitlement under article 6(1) is not confined to the reasonable time guarantee.  He is entitled to a hearing with three characteristics:  it must be fair and public;  it must be by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law;  and it must take place within a reasonable time.  These are three separate guarantees:  <i>Porter v Magill </i>[2002] 2 AC 357, 488-489, para 87 per Lord Hope of Craighead;  <i>Mills v HM Advocate </i>[2002] 3 WLR 1597, 1603-1604, paras 12 and 13 per Lord Steyn.  In the present case the prosecution delayed so long that, it is conceded, any hearing would not have taken place within a reasonable time.  Therefore, if the relevant authorities had gone ahead with the hearing, it would have lacked one of the three characteristics guaranteed by article 6(1).  So, by continuing with the prosecution and holding a hearing that lacked this characteristic, the relevant authorities would have violated the defendant's rights under article 6(1) just as surely as they would have violated his rights by holding a hearing that lacked one of the other two characteristics - which was not fair and public or which was not by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.  In my view the matter is as simple as that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;148. My noble and learned friend, Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough, criticises this reasoning for failing to pay proper attention to the language of article 6(1).  He contrasts the adjectives "fair" and "reasonable", which describe the "hearing", with the phrase "within a reasonable" time, which is adverbial in character:  one cannot, he says, sensibly talk about a <i>within a reasonable time</i> hearing or determination.  This phrase only makes sense when it is used in relation to the delivery of the hearing or determination - the performance by the person under the obligation.  That grammatical argument for distinguishing the reasonable time guarantee from the others cannot withstand reference to the French text of article 6(1), which is equally authentic (article 59).  Article 6(1) begins:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Toute personne a droit à ce que sa cause soit entendue équitablement, publiquement et dans un délai raisonnable…."</ul><p></p>
<p>Everyone has the right to have his case heard "fairly", "publicly" and "in a reasonable time".  If his case is not heard fairly, there is a breach;  if his case is not heard publicly, there is a breach;  and if his case is not heard within a reasonable time, there is a breach.  The three rights and the three breaches are parallel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;149. The majority seek to interpret and apply article 6(1) in what I consider to be an unduly subtle and restrictive manner.  I shall have to examine their reasoning further a little later.  For the moment, I recall that the Privy Council has held that a broad purposive approach to the interpretation of article 6(1) is necessary:  <i>Mills v HM Advocate </i>[2002] 3 WLR 1597, 1602 - 1603, para 10.  In his speech my noble and learned friend, Lord Steyn emphasised that article 6(1) is "a classic case" calling for what Lord Wilberforce described in <i>Minister of Home Affairs v Fisher </i>[1980] AC 319, 328 as "a generous interpretation … suitable to give to individuals the full measure of the fundamental rights and freedoms referred to."  Lord Wilberforce's guidance is designed for home consumption just as much as for export.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;150. As I suggested in <i>HM Advocate v R</i> [2003] 2 WLR 317, 362, para 135, the attitude of the typical defendant who properly invokes this fundamental right in article 6(1) may be characterised in this way.  He says to the prosecuting and judicial authorities:  "Of course, I do not actually wish you to go on with the proceedings so as to have the charge against me determined at a hearing but, if you do, I insist that the hearing be held within a reasonable time in accordance with article 6(1) of the Convention."  The reply of the prosecuting and judicial authorities in a case such as the present is:  "We insist on going on with the proceedings so as to have the charge determined at a hearing even though, admittedly, due to a failure on our part, that hearing cannot be held within a reasonable time in accordance with article 6(1)."  There can be no clearer indication of the authorities' intention to take steps that necessarily involve violating the defendant's article 6(1) right.  The only question is what his remedy for that violation should be.  In the context of a prosecution the respective rights and duties of the authorities and the defendant are not based on agreement.  That being so, I do not find the analogy that Lord Hobhouse draws with the law of obligations helpful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;151. There is, of course, a difference, as Lord Bingham points out, between the right to a hearing within a reasonable time and the other rights guaranteed by article 6(1).  If the hearing, whether past or future, is not fair and public or is not by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law, then it will usually be possible for the authorities to hold another hearing that has the missing characteristic and so complies with the Convention guarantee.  In that way the defendant is given his entitlement under article 6(1).  Where any hearing is not held within a reasonable time, however, the violation is irretrievable.  By definition, the undue delay with its harmful effects occurs by the time the hearing comes to an end.  The relevant authorities cannot remedy the situation and give the defendant his due by holding a fresh hearing - this could only involve still greater delay, prolonging the disruption to the defendant's life and so exacerbating the violation of his Convention right.  But the fact that this particular breach of article 6(1) cannot be cured by holding a fresh hearing is not just some quirk of the Convention that happens to put the relevant authorities in a particularly awkward position.  On the contrary, it stems from the very nature of the wrong which the guarantee is designed to counteract.  If the responsible authorities cannot go back and start again, neither can the defendant.  For both sides time marches on.  When the authorities delay unreasonably, months or years of the defendant's life are blighted.  He cannot have them over again;  they are gone forever.  By signing up to article 6(1) states undertake to avoid inflicting this kind of harm.  Since the harm is irretrievable, the European Court of Human Rights ("the European Court") is correct to regard this right as being of "extreme importance" for the proper administration of justice (<i>Guincho v Portugal </i>(1984) 7 EHRR 223, 233, para 38).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;152. Obviously, the right is open to abuse by those defendants who would in reality prefer to do almost anything rather than face trial.  That is well recognised.  I need not refer again to the passages from the Canadian and other cases that I discussed in <i>Dyer v Watson </i>[2002] 3 WLR 1488, 1537 - 1538, paras 156 - 160.  The fact that a right is open to abuse is not, however, a reason for watering it down beyond all recognition.  Rather, a court should apply the right in full measure but with due regard to the underlying realities of the case.  If a violation is established, the court should then select the appropriate remedy in the circumstances.  The decision of the European Court in <i>Corigliano v Italy </i>(1982) 5 EHRR 334, 346, para 53 is an example of that approach in action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;153. Despite the difference to which Lord Bingham draws attention, the three guarantees in article 6(1) are all essentially similar.  In effect they impose positive duties that the state authorities must fulfil.  If in any given case they do not do so, the authorities violate the relevant aspect of the defendant's article 6(1) right.  So, for instance, if the state provides a tribunal that is not impartial, it fails to respect the defendant's right to be tried by an impartial tribunal.  That is the breach.  We do not rewrite the Convention and say that the state infringes a negative right of the defendant not to be tried by a partial tribunal.  The same goes here.  If the relevant authorities can only arrange a hearing to determine the charge after the expiry of a reasonable time and intend to proceed to such a hearing, the state is failing to respect the defendant's positive article 6(1) right to have the charge against him determined by a hearing within a reasonable time - his right "à ce que sa cause soit entendue ... dans un délai raisonnable…".  That is a clear violation of his article 6(1) right - and no less clear just because the Convention does not contain another, quite different, negative right not to be subjected to a hearing after the lapse of a reasonable time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;154. In <i>Dyer v Watson </i>[2002] 3 WLR 1488, 1526 - 1527, paras 126 - 130, however, Lord Millett suggested that, if there were no Convention right not to be tried at all after unreasonable delay, holding a trial after an unreasonable time would entail no breach of article 6(1).  In his submissions on behalf of the Attorney General in this case Mr Perry adopted Lord Millett's reasoning, even though the majority of the Privy Council had rejected it in <i>HM Advocate v R </i>[2003] 2 WLR 317.  I adopt, without repeating, what I said on that occasion by way of respectful criticism of Lord Millett's suggested approach:  [2003] 2 WLR 317, 362 - 364, paras 136 - 138.  I do, however, wish to develop one particular point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;155. Although he did not mention it, Lord Millett had in mind a passage that counsel had cited to the Board from the opinion of Hardie Boys J in <i>Martin v Tauranga District Court </i>[1995] 2 NZLR 419, 432.  In that passage Hardie Boys J was dealing with section 25(b) of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 which affords defendants "the right to be tried without undue delay".  He said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The right is to trial without undue delay;  it is not a right not to be tried after undue delay."</ul><p></p>
<p>Lord Millett was seeking to build on this aphorism.  When properly understood, however, it does not support his reasoning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;156. This becomes clear the moment it is realised that, before making this comment, Hardie Boys J had already finished discussing the scope of the right to a trial without undue delay in New Zealand law.  He had also decided that, since the prosecutor had acted unjustifiably in having the original trial fixture vacated, the delay of 15 months between depositions and the proposed trial date in May 1994 constituted a breach of section 25(b):  [1995] 2 NZLR 419, 431, lines 52 - 54.  Hardie Boys J then turned to consider what the remedy for such a breach should be.  Commenting that counsel for the Crown had not contended for any remedy other than a stay, he went on to say that he was far from persuaded that a stay should be the usual remedy for undue delay:  [1995] 2 NZLR 419, 432, line 4.  The defendant's argument that the usual remedy should indeed be a stay had been based in large measure on the reasoning of the majority of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i> Rahey v The Queen </i>(1987) 39 DLR (4th) 481, 498-499 to the effect that a stay should be the <i>minimum</i> remedy.  Lamer J said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"If an accused has the constitutional right to be tried within a reasonable time, he has the right not to be tried beyond that point in time, and no court has jurisdiction to try him or order that he be tried in violation of that right."</ul><p></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;157. Hardie Boys J noted that Lamer J and those who concurred with him had gone so far as to put the proposition in terms of jurisdiction.  In an obiter passage at paragraph 126 of his speech Lord Hobhouse adopts a somewhat similar position.  Hardie Boys J's comment, which is designed to refute that argument, is a comment on remedy:  he is saying that a breach of the right to trial without undue delay does not carry with it a right on the defendant's part to the specific remedy of not being tried at all after undue delay.  That is indeed one possible remedy for a breach, but it is to be reserved for cases where the vindication of the personal right can be achieved in no other satisfactory way.  An alternative remedy is damages:  [1995] 2 NZLR 419, 432, lines 16 - 18.  Pursuing a line of reasoning that has been rejected by the European Court, Hardie Boys J goes on to suggest that the court should not vindicate the right of a defendant who allows the process to run its course and only asserts his right at its culmination.  If the court is alerted to the problem in time, realistic anticipatory remedies can be provided but if, despite them, "the delay continues and becomes undue, a stay of the proceedings may be acceptable as an appropriate ultimate remedy;  but not otherwise":  [1995] 2 NZLR 419, 432, lines 36 - 38.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;158. Clearly, Hardie Boys J considered that a stay was one possible competent remedy for a breach of a defendant's right to trial without undue delay.  His concern was to counter any argument, based on the Canadian decisions, that the Bill of Rights Act gave a defendant a <i>right</i> to that remedy in all cases where such a breach occurred.  In his view there was no such right and the remedy of a stay should be reserved for exceptional cases.  What matters for present purposes, however, is that in this passage Hardie Boys J was dealing with the remedy for a breach of section 25(b);  he was not considering how section 25(b) might be breached in the first place.  The passage therefore provides no support for Lord Millett's analysis of the reasonable time guarantee in article 6(1).  More particularly, it does not support the view that the state authorities can mount a trial after the expiry of an unreasonable time without violating that guarantee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;159. Lord Bingham accepts that, if through the action or inaction of a public authority, a criminal charge is not determined at a hearing within a reasonable time, there is necessarily a breach of the defendant's article 6(1) right:  paragraph 24.  He goes on to hold, however, that the prosecutor and the court do not act incompatibly with the defendant's Convention right in continuing to prosecute or entertain proceedings "after a breach is established … since the breach consists in the delay which has accrued and not in the prospective hearing".  But, as the Privy Council held in <i>Dyer v Watson </i>[2002] 3 WLR 1488, the violation of the Convention does not lie in the failure of the responsible authorities which occurs at some particular point in the course of the proceedings and produces delay.  The violation occurs when, because of that failure, the total length of the proceedings, from the charge to the conclusion of the hearing, is so great that the charge against the defendant cannot be determined within a reasonable time.  Contrary to what the majority say, therefore, prosecutors or court authorities who take steps to hold such a hearing after the expiry of a reasonable time are taking steps that involve violating the Convention - just as they would be taking such steps if they were arranging for a hearing before a partial tribunal.  Indeed, all the time the authorities are taking those steps to hold a hearing, they are - however unwillingly - keeping the defendant longer and longer in suspense.  Where, as here, the trial should already have taken place, they are, inevitably, exacerbating the violation of the Convention.  I refer to what I said in <i>HM Advocate v R </i>[2003] 2 WLR 317, 368 - 369, para 150.  In other words the authorities are insisting on holding a trial at some future date, even though, in order to do so, they must act unlawfully by continuing to keep the defendant in suspense in breach of his article 6(1) right.  It is difficult to see how holding a trial can be regarded as being compatible with the Convention, and hence lawful under our domestic legislation, if, in order to hold it, the authorities must act incompatibly with the Convention and hence unlawfully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;160. The view of the majority that, in a case such as the present, the prosecutor and court do not act incompatibly with the defendant's article 6(1) right by continuing with the prosecution or entertaining the proceedings is also impossible to square with their view that, even if only in exceptional cases of unfairness, the appropriate remedy for a prospective violation of the reasonable time guarantee may be a stay of the proceedings: Lord Bingham, in paragraph 24.  If, as the majority hold, going on with the prosecution or entertaining the proceedings is not incompatible with the Convention, then there could never be any question of staying the proceedings on the basis of the Convention.  The stay would have to be based on some other principle of law unconnected with the Convention.  Yet in the recent decision of the Privy Council in <i>Mills v HM Advocate </i>[2002] 3 WLR 1597, 1604, para 15, after a careful review of the previous authorities, Lord Steyn, with whom the other members of the Board agreed, referred to the "question of the remedies available in respect of a breach" of this guarantee and continued, at p 1604, para 16:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The remedies available could include an order for discontinuance of a prosecution, quashing of the conviction, reduction of the sentence, monetary compensation or a declaration."</ul><p></p>
<p>The only possible basis upon which the Board can have envisaged that an order for discontinuance of the prosecution could be an appropriate remedy for a breach is that continuing with the prosecution would indeed involve a breach of the reasonable time guarantee in article 6(1).  Rightly, the majority do not question what Lord Steyn said.  It is plainly correct.  But, equally, it is fatal to the reasoning they have chosen to adopt in the present case.</p>
<i>
<p>Violations of the Convention and remedies under the Convention</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;161. In <i>Mills v HM Advocate </i>the Privy Council were careful to keep the issues of breach and remedy separate.  The European Court does the same.  Rightly so.  A court can no more determine whether a right has been violated by contemplating the remedy for such a violation than a physician can determine whether a patient is suffering from an illness by contemplating what cures, if any, are available for that illness or what the patient's prospects of survival might be.  Lord Millett's analysis in <i>Dyer v Watson</i> [2002] 3 WLR 1488, 1526-1527 blurs this distinction.  If the Convention had conferred a right on defendants not to be tried after the state had delayed for more than a reasonable time, this would have been a right to a specific - and, from one perspective, very effective - remedy for this particular breach of article 6(1).  But that right would have come into play only where there was an established violation of article 6(1).  The existence of that remedial right could not have been a basis for deciding the, logically prior, question of whether the article had been violated.  The non-existence of such a remedial right is equally irrelevant to that question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;162. Unfortunately, part of Lord Bingham's reasoning in the present case is open to a similar but more profound objection.  He uses the effects of a stay - which he sees, I would say wrongly, as the inevitable but unacceptable consequence in English domestic law of deciding that holding a trial after a reasonable time violates article 6(1) - as a basis for concluding that there can be no violation in a case like the present.  Whether or not there is a violation depends, however, on how article 6(1) should be interpreted and applied to the particular situation.  The meaning of an article of the Convention is autonomous.  It cannot vary, depending on the nature of the remedies that any individual legal system, such as English law, has chosen to provide for a violation.  Parliament's purpose in enacting the 1998 Act so as to "bring rights home" was to provide remedies in the British courts for the violations of people's Convention rights which could have been dealt with previously only by the Strasbourg authorities.  The Convention rights themselves were not to be altered as they passed through customs at Dover and entered our domestic law with its particular system of remedies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;163. As the contrast with article 5(3) and (5) emphasises, the Convention provides no specific remedy for violations of article 6(1).  In this respect they are like violations of other articles of the Convention.  The Convention requires states to comply with the duties that give effect to the rights which it guarantees.  Where they fail to do so and someone's rights are violated, as a rule the Convention does not prescribe the nature of the remedy that the states must provide.  Article 13 simply says that "[e]veryone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority".  It is primarily up to the national authorities, including the courts, to see that victims obtain an effective remedy.  The European Court only gets involved if the national authorities fail to provide such a remedy.  Article 6(1) fits into that scheme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;164. Of course, Parliament did not incorporate article 13 into our domestic law:  it assumed that under the 1998 Act courts would have at their disposal all the necessary remedies for dealing with violations of the Convention.  Experience suggests that this is indeed so.  If, for example, a defendant's case is heard by a tribunal that is not impartial, in violation of article 6(1), the courts have decided that the appropriate remedy is to quash the conviction and hold a new hearing.  Similarly, if a prospective hearing is not going to be fair, the courts will stop it and try, if possible, to arrange a hearing that will be fair.  If, unusually, that is not possible, the proceedings will be stayed.  In fashioning these remedies, the courts are not enforcing a right of the defendant under the Convention not to undergo an unfair hearing by a partial tribunal.  They are simply giving what they consider to be the appropriate, effective, remedies in the circumstances for violations of the defendant's positive Convention right to a fair and impartial hearing.  Similarly, if a hearing to determine the charge is not held, or is not going to be held, within a reasonable time, under the Convention the courts must select what they consider to be the appropriate, effective, remedy to deal with that violation of the defendant's positive right to such a hearing within a reasonable time under article 6(1).  When doing so, they need waste no time pondering a non-existent negative right of the defendant not to be tried after an unreasonable time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;165. Not surprisingly therefore, the jurisprudence of the European Court confirms that under the Convention a violation of the reasonable time guarantee in article 6(1) does not carry with it a right for the defendant not to be tried.  Lord Bingham has referred to the relevant judgments.  In its most explicit statement in <i>Bunkate v The Netherlands </i>(1993) 19 EHRR 477, 484, para 25 the court observed:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The applicant's claims are based on the assumption that a finding by the Court that a criminal charge was not decided within a reasonable time <i>automatically</i> results in the extinction of the right to execute the sentence and that consequently, if the sentence has already been executed when the Court gives judgment, such execution becomes unlawful with retroactive effect.</ul><p></p>
<p></p><ul>That assumption is, however, incorrect." (emphasis added)</ul><p></p>
<p>Just like Hardie Boys J in <i>Martin v Tauranga District Court</i> [1995] 2 NZLR 419, the court is concerned to reject any argument that a breach of the reasonable time guarantee <i>automatically</i> means that the trial proceedings have to be set aside if they have already taken place.  There is no right under the Convention to have them set aside in all such cases.  Article 13 of the Convention would give a right to have the proceedings set aside only in those (rare) cases where, in the circumstances, it would be an essential element of "an effective remedy" for the violation.  In other cases a less drastic remedy, for example, by way of declaration, reduction in sentence or damages, will do;  a defendant cannot demand more.  The same must apply to a similar, but prospective, violation of the guarantee.  Consistently with saying that past trial proceedings need not be set aside, the European Court has never held that, to comply with the Convention, prospective trial proceedings must automatically be stopped.  It accepts that other remedies for the violation, whether by declaration, reduction in sentence or damages, may be effective and so fulfil the requirements of article 13.</p>
