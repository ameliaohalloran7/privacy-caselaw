<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;145. Lord Bridge, with whom the other members of the House agreed, said ([1988] AC 1074, 1088A - B) that in <i>McGhee</i></p>
<p></p><ul>"the consecutive periods when 'innocent' and 'guilty" brick dust was present on the pursuer's body may both have contributed to the cause of the disease or, theoretically at least, one or other may have been the sole cause.  But where the layman is told by the doctors that the longer the brick dust remains on the body, the greater the risk of dermatitis, although the doctors cannot identify the process of causation scientifically, there seems to me to be nothing irrational in drawing the inference, as a matter of common sense, that the consecutive periods when brick dust remained on the body probably contributed cumulatively to the causation of the dermatitis.  I believe that a process of inferential reasoning on these general lines underlies the decision of the majority in <i>McGhee</i>'s case."<p></p></ul>
<p>Lord Bridge then quoted the relevant passages from the speeches of their Lordships, apart from Lord Wilberforce, in <i>McGhee</i> and went on ([1988] AC 1074, 1090):</p>
<p></p><ul>"The conclusion I draw from these passages is that <i>McGhee v National Coal Board</i> [1973] 1 WLR 1 laid down no new principle of law whatever.  On the contrary, it affirmed the principle that the onus of proving causation lies on the pursuer or plaintiff.  Adopting a robust and pragmatic approach to the undisputed primary facts of the case, the majority concluded that it was a legitimate inference of fact that the defenders' negligence had materially contributed to the pursuer's injury.  The decision, in my opinion, is of no greater significance than that and to attempt to extract from it some esoteric principle which in some way modifies, as a matter of law, the nature of the burden of proof of causation which a plaintiff or pursuer must discharge once he has established a relevant breach of duty is a fruitless one."<p></p></ul>
<p>In the present case the Court of Appeal naturally had regard to what Lord Bridge said in this passage:  [2002] 1 WLR 1052, 1080F - G, para 103.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;146. Although Lord Bridge took the opportunity of the appeal in <i>Wilsher</i> to comment on <i>McGhee</i>, the two cases were very different.  In <i>Wilsher </i>the plaintiff had been born prematurely and placed in a special unit in a hospital managed by the defendants.  It was necessary for him to be given extra oxygen but, unfortunately, due to mistakes on their part the staff administered too much oxygen.  The plaintiff developed retrolental fibroplasia, which resulted in blindness.  He claimed damages from the defendants on the basis that his condition had been caused by the unduly high level of oxygen.  The evidence in the case showed that exposure to such a high level of oxygen increased the risk that the plaintiff would suffer retrolental fibroplasia.  The evidence also showed, however, that the condition could occur in premature babies without any artificial administration of oxygen.  More particularly, there was evidence to indicate a correlation between the occurrence of retrolental fibroplasia and four other conditions from which the plaintiff, like many other premature babies, suffered.  Medical science had not, however, positively identified any causal mechanism linking those conditions and the development of retrolental fibroplasia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;147. In the Court of Appeal Mustill LJ, with whom Glidewell LJ agreed, found in favour of the plaintiff.  He acknowledged that the facts of <i>Wilsher </i>differed from those of <i>McGhee</i> in an important respect ([1987] QB 730, 771D - 772C):</p>
<p></p><ul>"In the <i>McGhee</i> case there was only one risk operating, namely that contact of a sweaty skin with brick dust would lead to dermatitis.  The fact that such contact did cause the injury was not in dispute.  Just as in <i>Bonnington Castings Ltd v Wardlaw </i>[1956] AC 613 the defenders' fault lay in not taking proper steps to reduce that single risk.  The uncertainty was whether the fault had tipped the scale.  In the present case there is a greater uncertainty.  Instead of a single risk factor known to have caused the injury there is a list of factors, which cannot be fully enumerated in the current state of medical science, any one of which might have caused the injury.  What the defendants did was not to enhance the risk that the known factor would lead to injury, but to add to the list of factors which might do so.  I acknowledge that this is much further from the facts of <i>Bonnington Castings Ltd v Wardlaw</i>, which was the springboard for the <i>McGhee</i> case than were the facts of the <i>McGhee</i> case itself.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>The question is whether this makes a crucial difference.  The root of the problem lies in the fact that, for reasons of policy, their Lordships'House mitigated the rigour of the rule that the plaintiff must prove that the breach caused the loss, in the interests of achieving a result which was considered to be just.  Given that this was a decision based on policy, rather than a chain of direct reasoning, the difficulty is to know whether a similar approach can properly be adopted in the different circumstances of the present case.  After much hesitation I have come to the conclusion that it can.  Reading all the speeches together, the principle applied by the House seems to me to amount to this.  If it is an established fact that conduct of a particular kind creates a risk that injury will be caused to another or increases an existing risk that injury will ensue;  and if the two parties stand in such a relationship that the one party owes a duty not to conduct himself in that way;  and if the first party does conduct himself in that way, and if the other party does suffer injury of the kind to which the risk related;  then the first party is taken to have caused the injury by his breach of duty, even though the existence and extent of the contribution made by the breach cannot be ascertained.  If this is the right analysis, it seems to me that the shape taken by the enhancement of the risk ought not to be of crucial significance.  In the <i>McGhee</i> case [1973] 1 WLR 1, the conduct of the employers made it more likely that the pursuer would contract dermatitis, and he did contract dermatitis.  Here, the conduct of those for whom the defendants are liable made it more likely that Martin would contract RLF, and he did contract RLF.  If considerations of justice demanded that the pursuer succeed in the one case, I can see no reason why the plaintiff should not succeed in the other."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;148. Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson V-C dissented.  In a passage with which Lord Bridge was quite unable to find any fault ([1988] AC 1074, 1090E) he pointed out that to apply the "principle" in <i>McGhee</i> to the facts of <i>Wilsher</i> would constitute an extension of that principle.  He then summarised the facts of <i>McGhee</i> in this way ([1987] QB 730, 779B - C):</p>
<p></p><ul>"In the <i>McGhee </i>case there was no doubt that the pursuer's dermatitis was physically caused by brick dust:  the only question was whether the continued presence of such brick dust on the pursuer's skin after the time when he should have been provided with a shower caused or materially contributed to the dermatitis which he contracted.  There was only one possible agent which could have caused the dermatitis, viz, brick dust, and there was no doubt that the dermatitis from which he suffered was caused by that brick dust."<p></p></ul>
<p>Having stated the issues in <i>Wilsher</i>, the Vice-Chancellor continued:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The position, to my mind, is wholly different from that in the <i>McGhee</i> case [1973] 1 WLR 1, where there was only one candidate (brick dust) which could have caused the dermatitis, and the failure to take a precaution against brick dust causing dermatitis was followed by dermatitis caused by brick dust.  In such a case, I can see the common sense, if not the logic, of holding that, in the absence of any other evidence, the failure to take the precaution caused or contributed to the dermatitis.  To the extent that certain members of the House of Lords decided the question on inferences from evidence or presumptions, I do not consider that the present case falls within their reasoning.  A failure to take preventative measures against one out of five possible causes is no evidence as to which of those five caused the injury."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;149. Adopting the reasoning of the Vice-Chancellor, the House reversed the decision of the Court of Appeal - and rightly so.  Mustill LJ's extension of the approach in <i>McGhee</i> to a situation where there were all kinds of other possible causes of the plaintiff's condition, resulted in obvious injustice to the defendants.  In particular, there was nothing to show that the risk which the defendants' staff had created - that the plaintiff would develop retrolental fibroplasia because of an unduly highly level of oxygen - had eventuated.  That being so, there was no proper basis for applying the principle in <i>McGhee</i>.  As Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson decisively observed, a failure to take preventive measures against one of five possible causes was no evidence as to which of those five had caused the injury.  The reasoning of the Vice-Chancellor, which the House adopted, provided a sound and satisfactory basis for distinguishing <i>McGhee</i> and for allowing the appeal.  The year before indeed, the House had distinguished <i>McGhee</i> on the basis that a pursuer had not proved that the junior house officer's mistake had materially increased the risk of the particular kind of neurological damage suffered by his son:  <i>Kay's Tutor v Ayrshire and Arran Health Board</i> 1987 SC(HL) 145;  [1987] 2 All ER 417.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;150. Instead of distinguishing the decision in <i>McGhee</i>, however, Lord Bridge chose to gloss it in a way that does not do justice to the reasoning in the speeches, with the possible exception of Lord Kilbrandon's.  Contrary to Lord Bridge's view that nothing more was involved than an issue of fact, Lord Reid had expressly stated that the pursuer's case raised "a difficult question of law" ([1973] 1 WLR 1, 3D).  Even with the benefit of the further analysis of my noble and learned friend, Lord Hutton, I am satisfied that it was this question of law that Lord Reid and the other judges proceeded to elucidate and to determine, having regard to the various policy issues that arose.  Taking account of such matters in formulating a legal test is usual and legitimate.  By contrast, using them as a basis for modifying the way in which a court assesses evidence and finds facts, as Lord Bridge appears to suggest, is at best questionable.  A judge applying "a robust and pragmatic approach to the undisputed primary facts" may all too readily stray beyond the realm of inference into the wilderness of "mere speculation or conjecture":  <i>Caswell v Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries Ltd</i> [1940] AC 152, 169 - 170 per Lord Wright.  In particular, even though it is always for the judge rather than for the expert witness to determine matters of fact, the judge must do so on the basis of the evidence, including the expert evidence.  The mere application of "common sense" cannot conjure up a proper basis for inferring that an injury must have been caused in one way rather than another when the only relevant evidence is undisputed scientific evidence which says that either way is equally possible.  In my respectful opinion, therefore, despite the criticism of Sopinka J in <i>Snell v Farrell </i>[1990] 2 SCR 311, 331f - g, Lord Wilberforce was right to say that using inference to bridge the evidential gap in <i>McGhee</i> would have been something of a fiction since it was precisely that inference which the medical expert had declined to make ([1973] 1 WLR 1, 7E).  In any event, the gloss added by the House in <i>Wilsher</i>, highly influential though it has subsequently proved to be, cannot in itself supplant the reasoning of the judges in <i>McGhee</i>.<i>  </i>In the circumstances I too take the view that these observations in <i>Wilsher</i> should no longer be regarded as authoritative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;151. Although counsel for the respondents accepted that, if reinstated, the principle in <i>McGhee</i> would govern the present appeals and would mean that the appeals would have to be allowed, it is worth noticing why that should be so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;152. The parallels between the cases are striking.  In <i>McGhee</i> the defenders had negligently failed to provide showers to remove sweat and dust;  in these cases the defendants had negligently failed to provide protection from asbestos dust.  In <i>McGhee,</i> by removing the sweat and dust, the showers would have been intended to guard the workmen against suffering skin diseases such as dermatitis;  here the protection against inhaling asbestos dust would have been intended to guard the workmen against suffering asbestos-related illnesses such as mesothelioma.  In <i>McGhee</i> the failure to provide the showers materially increased the risk of the pursuer developing dermatitis;  in these cases the failure to protect against inhaling asbestos dust materially increased the risk of the claimants developing mesothelioma.  In <i>McGhee</i> the pursuer developed dermatitis due to the presence of dust and sweat on his skin, while in these cases the claimants developed mesothelioma due to inhaling asbestos dust.  In <i>McGhee </i>it was not possible in the state of medical knowledge for the pursuer to prove in the usual way whether the dermatitis started because of a single abrasion or because of multiple abrasions.  Here in the state of medical knowledge it is not possible for the claimants to prove whether the mesothelioma started from the effect of a single fibre or from the effect of multiple fibres.  In <i>McGhee</i> it was simply not possible for the pursuer to prove that his dermatitis was caused by an accumulation of abrasions;  similarly, here it is simply not possible for the claimants to prove that their mesothelioma was caused by an accumulation of asbestos fibres.  In <i>McGhee</i> it was not possible for the pursuer to prove that the hypothetical single abrasion had been caused at a time after he should have had a shower and was cycling home.  Here it is not possible for the claimants to prove that the hypothetical single fibre had been inhaled while they were working with any particular employer and especially while they were working with any of the defendants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;153. In one respect, of course, the cases diverge.  In <i>McGhee</i> the only possible source of the dust and sweat was the National Coal Board's kiln and the only possible wrongdoers were the Coal Board.  Here, by contrast, the defendants are simply some among a number of employers who negligently exposed the claimants to asbestos dust.  The Court of Appeal attached some importance to this distinction:  [2002] 1 WLR 1052, 1080H - 1081A.  On closer inspection, however, the distinction does not appear to be material for present purposes.  The important point is that in both cases the state of scientific knowledge makes it impossible for the victim to prove on the balance of probabilities that his injury was caused by the defenders' or defendants' wrongdoing rather than by events of a similar nature which would not constitute wrongdoing on their part.  Therefore, if the principle applies to permit the pursuer to recover in <i>McGhee</i>, it should similarly apply to allow the claimants to recover in these cases.  Indeed, on one view the principle is easier to apply in the present cases than in <i>McGhee</i> since it is not disputed that the men developed mesothelioma as a result of a tort by one of their employers.  The claimants thus have all the necessary elements for a successful claim except, it is argued, proof of causation.  In <i>McGhee</i>, on the other hand, it was possible that the pursuer's dermatitis had been prompted purely by his exposure to dust in the kiln and by his exertions there, for which the employers would not have been liable in delict.  So, application of the principle was crucial to connect the pursuer's illness not just with the defenders' legal wrong but with any legal wrong at all.  In that sense these cases are a fortiori <i>McGhee</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;154. The decision in <i>McGhee</i> undoubtedly involved a development of the law relating to causation.  The context within which that development falls to be evaluated is described in the observations on principle in the speeches of my noble and learned friends, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead and Lord Hoffmann, to which I respectfully refer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;155. As counsel for the defendants submitted, the principle in <i>McGhee</i>  involves an element of rough justice, since it is possible that a defendant may be found liable when, if science permitted the matter to be clarified completely, it would turn out that the defendant's wrongdoing did not in fact lead to the men's illness.  That consideration weighed with the Court of Appeal ([2002] 1 WLR 1052, 1080E - H, para 103).  It must be faced squarely.  The opposing potential injustice to claimants should also be addressed squarely.  If defendants are not held liable in such circumstances, then claimants have no claim, even though, similarly, if the matter could be clarified completely, it might turn out that the defendants were indeed the authors of the men's illness.  Other considerations colour the picture.  The men did nothing wrong, whereas all the defendants wrongly exposed them to the risk of developing a fatal cancer, a risk that has eventuated in these cases.  At best, it was only good luck if any particular defendant's negligence did not trigger the victim's mesothelioma.  The defendants, in effect, say that it is because they are all wrongdoers that the claimants have no case.  In other words:  the greater the risk that the men have run at the hands of successive negligent employers, the smaller the claimants' chances of obtaining damages.  In these circumstances, one might think, in<i> </i>dubio the law should favour the claimants.  Moreover, in <i>McGhee</i> the House did nothing more than set the requirement of proof at the highest that the pursuer could possibly attain - hardly a relaxation in any real sense.  He had proved all that he could and had established that the defenders' wrongdoing had put him at risk of the very kind of injury which befell him.  To require more would have been to say that he could never recover for his injury - unless he achieved the impossible.  Finally, as was recognised in <i>McGhee</i> ([1973] 1 WLR 1, 9B - C per Lord Simon, 12G per Lord Salmon), if the law did indeed impose a standard of proof that no pursuer could ever satisfy, then, so far as the civil law is concerned, employers could with impunity negligently expose their workmen to the risk of dermatitis - or, far worse, of mesothelioma.  The substantive duty of care would be emptied of all practical content so far as victims are concerned.  In my view considerations of these kinds justified the House in developing the approach of Viscount Simonds and Lord Cohen in <i>Nicholson</i> to fashion and apply the principle in <i>McGhee</i>.  A fortiori they justify the application of that principle in the present case where the risk to the men was so much worse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;156. I derive support for that conclusion from what has been done in other legal systems.  In the course of the hearing counsel for both sides referred to authorities from a number of different jurisdictions.  It would be impossible to do justice to all of them in this opinion.  Broadly speaking, they appear to me to demonstrate two things:  first, that other systems have identified the need to adopt special rules or principles to cope with situations where the claimant cannot establish which of a number of wrongdoers actually caused his injury;  secondly, that there are considerable divergences of view and indeed uncertainty as to the proper area within which any such special rules or principles should apply.  I have simply selected a few among the many authorities cited by counsel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;157. Perhaps the most telling illustration of the universality of the problem with which the House is faced comes from two passages in the Digest cited by Sir Sydney.  The issues in the texts have been helpfully analysed in a recent study by Mr Jeroen Kortmann, "<i>Ab alio ictu(s)</i>:  Misconceptions about Julian's View of Causation" (1999) 20 Journal of Legal History 95.<i>  </i>The texts show that, in a certain form, problems with unidentifiable wrongdoers had begun to exercise the minds of Roman jurists not later than the first century BC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;158. D 9 2 51 Julian 86 digesta contains a substantial extract from one of the most important works on Roman law, written in the second century AD, the high classical period of Roman law.  In the principium Julian is discussing chapter 1 of the Lex Aquilia, which gives the owner of a slave the right to claim damages if someone wrongfully "kills" the slave.  Julian considers whether someone "kills" a slave for these purposes if he mortally wounds him and later someone else attacks the slave who dies more quickly as a result.  Julian takes the view, which was probably not shared by all the jurists, that both persons who attacked the slave should be liable for "killing" him.  In support of that view, he says in D 9 2 51 1 that it follows from the authoritative rulings of the old, Republican, jurists who held that, where a slave was wounded by a number of people in such a way that it was impossible to say whose blow had caused his death, then all of them were liable under the lex Aquilia:</p>
<p></p><ul>"idque est consequens auctoritati veterum qui, cum a pluribus idem servus ita vulneratus esset ut non appareret cuius ictu perisset, omnes lege Aquilia teneri iudicaverunt."<p></p></ul>
<p>The old translation in C H Monro, <i>The Digest of Justinian</i> vol 2 (1909), pp 140-141 is reliable, with the addition of the words in square brackets:</p>
<p></p><ul>"This is in keeping with the view handed down from the old lawyers, who, where the same slave was wounded by several persons under such circumstances that it did not appear by whose hand it was that he died, came to the conclusion that they were all liable [under the lex Aquilia]."<p></p></ul>
<p>The text does not state expressly whether the case involved a concerted attack or simply a series of blows inflicted by different people, perhaps at different times.  But the context of this particular passage, at least as preserved by Justinian's compilers, would suggest that, even if the case involves a concerted attack, Julian is thinking in terms of the liability of the participants as individuals, striking their own separate blows.  Otherwise, Julian would not quote it as support for his view on a case which plainly involved blows delivered by different people in the course of quite separate attacks.  In any event, the underlying doctrine must be that, in the kind of attack in question, in principle only the actual person who kills the slave is liable for killing.  Were that not so, the old jurists would not have needed to make this special ruling that all the participants are liable under the lex Aquilia for killing the slave when it is unclear whose blow actually killed him.  The reason for the ruling was, obviously, to make the statutory remedy of damages under chapter 1 available to the owner of the slave in these circumstances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;159. This passage in Julian's digesta is referred to by the later writer Ulpian in D 9 2 11 2 Ulpian 18 ad edictum:</p>
<p></p><ul>"sed si plures servum percusserint, utrum omnes quasi occiderint teneantur, videamus.  et si quidem apparet, cuius ictu perierit, ille quasi occiderit tenetur:  quod si non apparet, omnes quasi occiderint teneri Iulianus ait, et si cum uno agatur, ceteri non liberantur:  nam ex lege Aquilia quod alius praestitit, alium non relevat, cum sit poena."<p></p></ul>
<p>Again the translation by Monro, <i>The Digest of Justinian</i> vol 2, pp 121 - 122 is satisfactory for present purposes, with the omission of the word in square brackets:</p>
<p></p><ul>"But if a number of persons struck him, it is a point to consider whether all are not liable, as having [all] killed him.  As to this, if it is known who struck the fatal blow, that one is liable, as having killed him;  but, if it is not known, then, according to Julianus, all are liable, as having slain, and if an action is brought against one, this does not release the others, because, under the <i>lex Aquilia</i>, payment by one man is no discharge to another, as it is a case of penal damages."<p></p></ul>
<p>Ulpian considers whether, if several people strike a slave, all of them are liable for killing him.  He says that, if it is clear who struck the blow from which the slave died, that person is liable for killing him.  But he reports Julian's view that, if this is not clear, then all of them are liable for killing him.  Again the precise factual situation is not spelled out, but it looks as if Ulpian is considering the case of an attack on the slave by several people at once.  Since only the actual person whose blow killed the slave is liable if his identity is known, Ulpian must, however, be thinking primarily in terms of the individual liability of the person who does the killing:  it is only if you cannot tell whose blow proved fatal that Julian holds that all are liable for killing the slave.  A separate rule is adopted for that situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;160. I would take from these passages the clear implication that classical Roman jurists of the greatest distinction saw the need for the law to deal specially with the situation where it was impossible to ascertain the identity of the actual killer among a number of wrongdoers.  If strict proof of causation were required, the plaintiff would be deprived of his remedy in damages for the death of his slave.  In that situation, some jurists at least were prepared, exceptionally, to hold all of the wrongdoers liable and so afford a remedy to the owner whose slave had been killed.  The exact scope of these decisions can, of course, no longer be ascertained and it is likely that different jurists held differing views:  the sixth-century compilers of the Digest may well have altered the texts to some extent, if only by abbreviation, cutting out the cut and thrust of debate.  Nor could the decisions, as recorded, furnish any guidance on the formulation of any equivalent rule today.  The point remains, however, that all these centuries ago considerations of policy plainly led to a departure from what the law would usually require by way of proof of causation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;161. Among slightly more recent authorities the decision of the Supreme Court of California in <i>Rutherford v Owens-Illinois Inc</i> 67 Cal Rptr 2d 16 (1997) stands out both as being directly in point and as providing powerful support for applying the principle in <i>McGhee</i> to the circumstances of the present cases.  Mr Rutherford had worked with asbestos products on board ships at Mare Island Naval Shipyard.  He developed, and died from, lung cancer caused by inhaling asbestos fibres.  Proceedings were raised against some 19 manufacturers and distributors of asbestos products, including Owens-Illinois.  Before the issues of liability and damages fell to be determined, all of the defendants except Owens-Illinois settled.  In the trial the judge gave the jury an instruction that the burden was on Owens-Illinois to prove that their products were not a legal cause of the deceased's injuries.  The Supreme Court held that this direction should not have been given, but further held that the plaintiffs need do no more than prove that exposure to the company's asbestos products was, in reasonable medical probability, a substantial factor in causing or contributing to his risk of developing cancer (67 Cal Rptr 2d 16, 19).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;162. The Supreme Court were satisfied that the plaintiffs bore the burden of proving which exposures to asbestos were substantial factors increasing the risk (67 Cal Rptr 2d 16, 32 - 33).  For their part Owens-Illinois conceded that plaintiffs in asbestos cases were not required to identify the manufacturer of specific fibres that caused the cancer.  Giving the judgment of the Supreme Court, Baxter J agreed (67 Cal Rptr 2d 16, 31 - 32):</p>
<p></p><ul>"Plaintiffs cannot be expected to prove the scientifically unknown details of carcinogenesis, or trace the unknowable path of a given asbestos fiber.  But the impossibility of such proof does not dictate use of a burden shift.  Instead, we can bridge this gap in the humanly knowable by holding that plaintiffs may prove causation in asbestos-related cancer cases by demonstrating that the plaintiff's exposure to defendant's asbestos-containing product in reasonable medical probability was a substantial factor in contributing to the aggregate <i>dose</i> of asbestos the plaintiff or decedent inhaled or ingested, and hence to the <i>risk </i>of developing asbestos-related cancer, without the need to demonstrate that fibers from the defendant's particular product were the ones, or among the ones, that <i>actually</i> produced the malignant growth."<p></p></ul>
<p>The judge considered the standard jury instructions but commented (67 Cal Rptr 2d 16, 32):</p>
<p></p><ul>"They say nothing, however, to inform the jury that, in asbestos-related cancer cases, a particular asbestos-containing product is deemed to be a substantial factor in bringing about the injury if its contribution to the plaintiff or decedent's <i>risk </i>or<i> probability</i> of developing cancer was substantial.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Without such guidance, a juror might well conclude that the plaintiff needed to prove that fibers from the defendant's product were a substantial factor <i>actually contributing</i> to the development of the plaintiff's or decedent's cancer.  In many cases, such a burden will be medically impossible to sustain, even with the greatest possible effort by the plaintiff, because of irreducible uncertainty regarding the cellular formation of an asbestos-related cancer.  We therefore hold that, in the trial of an asbestos-related cancer case, although no instruction 'shifting the burden of proof as to causation' to defendant is warranted, the jury should be told that the plaintiff's or decedent's exposure to a particular product was a substantial factor in causing or bringing about the disease if in reasonable medical probability it was a substantial factor contributing to plaintiff's or decedent's <i>risk</i> of developing cancer."<p></p></ul>
