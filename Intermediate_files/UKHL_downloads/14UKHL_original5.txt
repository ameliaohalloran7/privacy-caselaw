<p class="para">84.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pennsylvania is among those States which apply the decision in <i>Keene. </i>In <i>JH France Refractories Co v Allstate Insurance Co</i>, 626 A 2d 502 (1993), which was also an asbestos-related claim, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania rejected the insurers’ contention that they should share the obligation to indemnify on a pro rata basis apportioned on the amount of time each policy was in effect.  That was inconsistent with the terms of the policies which were similar to (but not identical with) the terms in the policies in the <i>Keene </i>decision. Each insurer obliged itself to pay on behalf of the insured “all sums” which the insured would become legally obliged to pay as damages, and the definition of “occurrence” (which had no specific reference to the policy period) was inconsistent with a pro rata allocation.  In addition, there was no medical evidence to substantiate the assumption that the progression of asbestos related disease was linear.</p>
<p class="para">85.&nbsp;&nbsp;The States in which there were Alcoa sites which were the subject of the clean-up requirements do not adopt a uniform approach to the coverage question. There were relevant Alcoa sites in the Washington litigation in States which, according to the textbooks referred to above and the decision of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in <i>Boston Gas Co v Century Indemnity Co</i>, 529 F 3d 8 (1st Cir 2008), have adopted pro rata allocation and rejected the joint and several allocation method:  they include New York, California and Illinois: <i>Stonewall Insurance Co v City of Palos Verdes Estates</i>, 54 Cal Rptr 2d 176 (Cal 1996); <i>Outboard Marine Corp v Liberty Mutual Insurance Co</i>, 670 NE 2d 740 (Ill 1996); <i>Consolidated Edison Co of New York Inc v Allstate Insurance  Co.,</i> 774 NE 2d 687 (NY 2002). Those States in which the Alcoa sites in the litigation were situated and which had followed <i>Keene</i>, apart from Pennsylvania and Washington, included Indiana and Ohio: <i>Allstate Ins Co v Dana Corp,</i> 759 NE 2d 1049 (Ind 2001); <i>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co v Aetna Casualty &amp; Sur Co,</i> 769 NE 2d 835 (Ohio 2002). </p>
<i><p class="para">The decision of the Supreme Court of Washington</p></i>
<p class="para">86.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that the effect of the decision of the Supreme Court of Washington was to make Lexington liable for loss and damage which occurred both before and after inception (and indeed after expiry). I cannot accept Lexington’s argument (Respondent’s case in both appeals, para 4) that the Supreme Court did not hold Lexington liable for losses arising from damage occurring outside the period of the original insurance, and that the Supreme Court was simply addressing the question of what insured damage had occurred during the period. Lexington rightly accepted in the statement of facts and issues on these appeals (paras 8, 10-11) that (a) it had been determined at the trial before Judge Learned that the pollution and contamination damage in respect of the clean-up costs of which Alcoa sought indemnity had occurred in the period between 1942 and 1986; (b) the Supreme Court had decided that the policy language covered any physical loss or damage manifesting itself during the time the policy was in force, including pollution damage starting before the policy inception; and (c) Lexington had settled with Alcoa on the basis that it was not possible to limit Lexington’s liability to the cost of remedying that part of the damage which could be said to have occurred within the 3 year period of cover.</p>
<p class="para">87.&nbsp;&nbsp;Judge Learned had decided that there was a basis in law for allocating to each separate policy year the costs relating to the property damage which occurred during that policy year. Although environmental contamination was not a purely linear process, the use of an average was reasonable. The reasoning of the Supreme Court of Washington reversing the decision of Judge Learned on the allocation issue was as follows: (a) there had been pollution damage to all three test sites occurred during the entire time the policies were in effect; (b) pollution damage had occurred to portions of the sites prior to the inception of insurance coverage; (c) because the pollution damage occurred both before and during the policy periods the question arose as to how to attribute the remediation costs of the pollution damage; (d) in allocating the pollution damage on a pro rata yearly basis, Judge Learned had not made a close examination of the applicable policy language.</p>
<p class="para">88.&nbsp;&nbsp;The insuring clause in the Alcoa policy was: “PERILS INSURED: This policy insures against all physical loss of, or damage to, the insured property as well as the interruption of business, except as hereinafter excluded or amended.” The Supreme Court held that the language was very broad and contained no limitation as to time of the physical loss or damage to property, and there was no exclusion in the policy for physical loss or damage that might have begun spreading before the policy inception. The policy definition of “occurrence” compelled a broad reading of the policy. The Supreme Court concluded: “It seems clear from the policy language that any physical loss or damage manifesting itself during the time a … policy was in effect was covered by the policy, including pollution damage starting before the policy inception.”</p>
<p class="para">89.&nbsp;&nbsp;This was not a decision that losses occurring during the policy period encompassed liability or losses flowing from damage which occurred during that period. It was a decision that, provided that there was some damage in the policy period, the insured had a right to an indemnity for liability flowing from damage whenever it occurred.</p>
<i><p class="paraleft">The relevance of the governing law</p></i>
<p class="para">90.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is accepted that the contract of reinsurance is impliedly governed by English law. It is in English form and was broked and issued in the English market. The insurance contract was concluded in 1977, and determination of its proper law depended on common law principles, as it still does: see Rome Convention on the law applicable to contractual obligations, Art. 17, providing that the Convention applies only to contracts entered into after it becomes in force with regard to a Contracting State, which was April 1, 1991 for the United Kingdom. The general rule was that, in the absence of an express choice, an intention with regard to the law to govern the contract could be inferred from the terms and nature of the contract and from the general circumstances of the case. When the intention was not expressed and could not be inferred from the circumstances, the contract was governed by the system of law with which the contract had its closest and most real connection: <i>Whitworth Street Estates (Manchester) Ltd v James Miller and Partners Ltd </i>[1970] AC 583; <i>Compagnie Tunisienne de Navigation SA v Compagnie d'Armement Maritime SA </i>[1971] AC 572; <i>Amin Rasheed Shipping Corp v Kuwait Insurance Co </i>[1984] AC 50. The law so identified would have governed questions of construction.</p>
<p class="para">91.&nbsp;&nbsp;Longmore LJ thought that, if in 1977 the question of what law governed the insurance contract had been asked, the answer would have been that Pennsylvania law had the closest and most real connection with the insurance contract: at [28]. For reasons on which I shall elaborate I do not consider that the question what law, by English conflict of laws rules, governed the insurance contract is a relevant question, but in any event there is reason to doubt Longmore LJ’s conclusion on this point. So far as insurance contracts in particular are concerned, in England the prevailing view in 1977 was reflected in Dicey and Morris, Conflict of Laws, 9th ed. 1973, Rule 159, which had first been formulated in the 8th edition (1967), in succession to a similar rule in previous editions limited to contracts of marine insurance.  By Rule 159(2):</p>
<p class="qt">“If an intention to choose the proper law has not been expressed in the insurance policy and cannot be inferred from circumstances, and if there is nothing to show that the contract is more closely connected with another system of law, the contract is governed by the law of the country in which the insurer carries on his business, and if he carries on his business in two or more countries, by the law of the country in which his head office is situated.”</p>
<p class="para">92.&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently if an English lawyer had been asked in 1977 to advise on what law governed the underlying insurance contract according to the rules of the English conflict of laws, it is likely that the following questions would have been addressed. The first question would have been whether the provision in the Service of Suit clause that “all matters arising hereunder shall be determined in accordance with the law and practice” of the court in the United States chosen by the insured for suit was an express choice of law. The answer to that would have been in the negative, because the proper law had to be capable of determination when the contract was entered into: <i>The Iran Vojdan </i>[1984] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 380.</p>
<p class="para">93.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question would have been whether a choice of law could be inferred from the circumstances. It is not easy in the present case to find a basis for any such inference. The third question would have been with what system of law the policy had the closest and most real connection.  It is likely that this would have been the law of Massachusetts where the policy was broked and issued under cover of Lexington’s standard policy form, and where Lexington had its head office. As I have said, it appears from <i>Boston Gas Co v Century Indemnity Co</i>, 529 F 3d 8 (1st Cir 2008) that the approach in Massachusetts law to the joint and several approach to insurers’ liability for damage occurring both within and without the period of cover is not finally settled. There might have been a case for Pennsylvania law on the basis that the bulk of the policy terms originated from Alcoa’s head office and were being broked across the United States. But I doubt whether the mere fact that Alcoa was incorporated and had its centre of business in Pennsylvania would have been a basis for concluding (as Longmore LJ did (at [28]) that Pennsylvania law had the closest and most real connection with the insurance contract.</p>
<p class="para">94.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the question of what law governed the insurance contract by the English rules of the conflict of laws is not the relevant question. The issue is one of construction of the reinsurance contract. In order to apply the underlying principle that the effect of terms in a reinsurance contract governed by English law should where possible be interpreted to be in accordance with the effect of the terms of the insurance contract governed by foreign law, the relevant foreign law is not the law which by English conflict of laws rules would have governed the contract, but the law which the parties would have had in reasonable contemplation when the contracts were entered into. In the normal case such as <i>Vesta v Butcher </i>there would be no difference between the approaches, but in this case the effect of the Service of Suit clause was that litigation could take place anywhere in the United States.</p>
<p class="para">95.&nbsp;&nbsp;On a narrower view of the case (similar to that in <i>Vesta v Butcher</i>)<i> </i>the relevant question would have been: what law would the parties have expected would be applied by a court in the United States had Alcoa taken advantage of the Service of Suit clause, and in particular would the parties to the reinsurance contract have reasonably had in mind that what losses were recoverable under the insurance contract would be determined ultimately by the law of Pennsylvania? That would be a question for a United States lawyer. I would regard the possibility that a coverage dispute might have arisen in one of the countries outside the United States for which coverage was obtained as purely theoretical. Consequently I leave out of account the possibility, canvassed by the appellants, that since the Service of Suit clause was not an exclusive jurisdiction clause, the action by Alcoa against Lexington might have been brought outside the United States, where some of the sites were situated, and where wholly different principles of the conflict of laws may have applied.</p>
<p class="para">96.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the fact that I accept that this is a relevant question does not mean that I accept Lexington’s answer. In effect Lexington says that if Lexington and the reinsurers had asked for advice in 1977 as to what law would be applied by a United States court to the construction of the Alcoa insurance policy the answer would likely to have been the law of Pennsylvania. There was no expert evidence on this point before Simon J, but to test whether it is realistic it is necessary to look closely at the reasoning of Judge Learned in her decision that Pennsylvania law applied to the coverage issues.</p>
<p class="para">97.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that Judge Learned was applying in its entirety the approach of the American Law Institute, Restatement Second, Conflict of Laws (“the Restatement Second”) to choice of law in contracts (and not simply the provision relating to insurance). Although she did not mention it expressly, it is plain from her reasoning that the starting point for Judge Learned was section 188(1) of the Restatement Second, which is the basic rule about choice of law in contracts.  It provides:</p>
<p class="qt">“The rights and duties of the parties with respect to an issue in contract are determined by the local law of the state which, with respect to that issue, has the most significant relationship to the transaction and the parties under the principles stated in section 6".</p>
<p class="para">98.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 188(2) goes on to state that, in the absence of  an effective choice of law by the parties, the contacts to be taken into account in applying the principles of section 6 to determine the law applicable to an issue include: (a) the place of contracting, (b) the place of negotiation of the contract, (c) the place of performance, (d) the location of the subject-matter of the contract, and (e) the domicile, residence, nationality, place of incorporation and place of business of the parties. Those contacts are to be evaluated according to their relative importance with respect to the particular issue. Section 6(2) indicates the factors relevant to the choice of the applicable rule of law, which include the relevant policies of the forum, the relevant policies of other interested States and the relative interests of those States in the determination of the particular issue, the protection of justified expectations, the basic policies underlying the particular field of law, certainty, predictability and uniformity of result and ease in the determination and application of the law to be applied.</p>
<p class="para">99.&nbsp;&nbsp;The reference in section 6(2)(c) to the “determination of the particular issue” is a fundamental part of the approach of the Restatement Second. The appellants argued that this necessarily means that the governing law can only be determined at the date of litigation rather than the date of contract, and drew the conclusion that it would have been impossible in 1977 to predict what law would have applied to the insurance contract. This submission was erroneous. What the approach of the Restatement Second entails is that, by contrast with the English approach at common law, different laws may be applied to different issues. It could plainly have been predicted in 1977 that a coverage issue might arise, and that it might have been necessary to determine what law applied to it. </p>
<p class="para">100.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Service of Suit clause provided:</p>
<p class="qt">“In the event of the failure of this Company to pay any amount claimed to be due hereunder, this Company, at the request of the Insured, will submit to the &nbsp;&nbsp;jurisdiction of </p>
<p class="qt">any Court of Competent jurisdiction within the United States and will comply with all requirements necessary to give such Court jurisdiction and all maters arising hereunder shall be determined in accordance with the law and practice of such Court “</p>
<p class="para">101.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first question was whether there was an express choice of law. Judge Learned rejected the argument that the reference to matters being “determined in accordance with the law and practice of such Court” was a choice of law. The context addressed the venue of litigation and reflected the willingness of the defendants to submit to the jurisdiction and binding judgments of courts in the United States; and the reference to the law of the court did not distinguish between substantive law or the whole of its law including its choice of law rules. To construe the clause as a choice of law clause would allow a plaintiff to forum shop within the United States for substantive law favourable to it. The judge then went on to consider which system of law had the “most significant relationship” between the parties and the involved States. She rejected the choice of Washington law as the law of the forum: (a)  Washington did not have the most significant contacts;  (b)  the fact that a plurality of the sites included in the litigation was in Washington was not particularly significant, since Washington did not have a plurality of the sites covered by the policies, nor of sites potentially subject to the type of claims involved, and even as to the sites included in the litigation the Washington sites had significantly less money at stake than sites in other States; (c)  Washington had no public interest at stake in the law suit which was greater than any other State, since each State presumably had a similar interest in and concern about the clean-up of toxic materials within its borders.</p>
<p class="para">102.&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not apply section 193 of the Restatement Second, which points the court in insurance contracts to the law of the location of the insured risk, because a special problem was presented by multiple risk policies which insured against risks located in several States. In particular, the same wording in the policies might be subject to many potentially different meanings from State to State. Her conclusion was that the law of Pennsylvania governed.  Although it was not the place of contracting it had more contacts regarding the contract formation than any other State.  It was the one State with a common connection between all the sites and all the defendants.  It was the headquarters of Alcoa, and the insurance placement originated at the headquarters level rather than at the site level.  In most cases insurance was coordinated through the Pennsylvania broker or other brokers and not between Alcoa and an insurer in another State. The coverage scheme was comprehensive, and multi-layered. The place of signature of the contract, or domicile or headquarters of the various defendants, were of less significance than those associated with Pennsylvania.  The meaningful centre of gravity for contract formation was Pennsylvania for most, if not all, of the contracts.</p>
<p class="para">103.&nbsp;&nbsp;The approach by Judge Learned to the choice of law issue is, if I may so with respect, very clear and wholly understandable in the context of the litigation which she had to manage. It is, of course, quite different from the English approach, but it is entirely consistent with the approach in those States which apply the Restatement Second: see, e.g. <i>Certain Underwriters at Lloyd’s, London v Foster Wheeler Corp</i>, 822 NYS 2d  30 (NY Ct App 2007).</p>
<p class="para">104.&nbsp;&nbsp;Judge Learned was considering what law to apply for the purposes of contract interpretation to all claims involving coverage, with some 70 insurers, hundreds of policies and 58 sites, of which 43 were in the United States and 15 were outside the United States. The judge regarded herself as determining that Pennsylvania law applied as a general rule, but she said that if specific or unique issues arose regarding one or more defendants or one or more sites, which raised significant considerations which overrode the general rule, they could be brought to the court’s attention.</p>
<p class="para">105.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there was no expert evidence on United States law, it is doubtful whether Lexington was right to say (Case, para 17(3)) that there is no reason to believe that the choice of law would have been any different depending on the State in which Alcoa had chosen to sue. According to a leading authority in the United States, of the States in which the sites were situated, in 1977 the following States continued to apply the lex loci contractus: Florida, Tennessee, and Pennsylvania: Symeonides, <i>The American Choice-of-Law Revolution in the Courts: Past, Present and Future </i>(2006), pp 45-47. Pennsylvania courts have applied the contracts sections of the Restatement Second since 1983 (<i>Guy v Liederbach</i>, 459 A 2d 744 (Pa 1983): a case involving third party beneficiaries under a will, but applied in many other contract cases).</p>
<i><p class="para">No identifiable system of law</p></i>
<p class="para">106.&nbsp;&nbsp;Longmore LJ in the Court of Appeal (at [21]) identified the question being “whether [the] same period of cover should receive the same interpretation in both the original insurance and the reinsurance” or whether “the same or equivalent wording in each of the contracts should … be given the same construction” (at [24], and also [25], [33]).</p>
<p class="para">107.&nbsp;&nbsp;I consider that it is fanciful to suppose that in 1977 the hypothetical American lawyer asked to advise on what law governed the contract of insurance, and what law would govern questions of coverage, would have concluded that Pennsylvania law would have applied. To have reached that conclusion the lawyer would have had to advise or assume that (a) there would be claims based on damage to several sites being litigated together; (b) plaintiffs in the environmental litigation would be most likely to sue in a State which applied the principles in the Restatement Second; and (c) the courts of that State would apply those principles to conclude that the law which applied to the issues would be the law of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p class="para">108.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my judgment, in complete contrast to <i>Vesta v Butcher </i>and <i>Groupama v Catatumbo</i>, in the present case there was in 1977, when the insurance contract and the reinsurance contract were concluded, no identifiable system of law applicable to the insurance contract which could have provided a basis for construing the contract of reinsurance in a manner different from its ordinary meaning in the London insurance market. In each of those cases, the substance of the foreign law as to the consequences of a non-causative breach of warranty could be ascertained at the outset, if necessary by recourse to a relevant Norwegian (or Venezuelan) legal source: <i>Vesta v Butcher</i>, at 911, per Lord Lowry.</p>
<p class="para">109.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a case involving the scope of liability. Nor is it a case about the interpretation of the policy period. I entirely accept Longmore LJ’s example (at [20]) of the case in which a loss occurred within the policy period in United States time, but outside the policy period in GMT. That would be a case of interpreting the reference to the date and time in the reinsurance policy to conform with the insurance. But this is a case in which the Washington court held in substance (in common with the courts in those States which impose joint and several liability) that the original insurance contained no relevant time limitation. In 1977 the United States courts had not developed the theory of joint and several liability for all damage, even that occurring outside the policy period. </p>
<p class="para">110.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is elementary that an insurer under the original insurance takes the risk of changes in the law. The insurer cannot escape liability by saying that the liability of the insured has been increased by judicial decisions extending the scope of the insured’s duty. Nor, correspondingly, can the reinsurer be heard to say that it rated the risk by reference to the then current scope of the original insured’s duty, or by the scope of the insurer’s duty to indemnify the original insured, provided that the risk is within the reinsurance.</p>
<p class="para">111.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, however, there is no principled basis for treating the scope of the 3 year reinsurance as the same as the insurance, which has been interpreted under the law of Pennsylvania not to contain any “limitation as to time of the physical loss or damage to property” (998 P 2d 856, at 883). If Lexington were right, some very uncommercial consequences would flow if the reinsurers had agreed to accept only two years of the risk, rather than the three years of the underlying risk accepted by Lexington, leaving Lexington to reinsure the third year of cover elsewhere; or if the London market had elected to reinsure Lexington by way of three separate one year policies (as in <i>Municipal Mutual Insurance Ltd v Sea Insurance Co Ltd</i> [1998] Lloyd’s Rep IR 421). The periods of cover under the insurance and reinsurances would not be back-to-back. But Lexington would still be maintaining that, in the light of the decision of the Washington Supreme Court, if any damage occurred within any relevant policy period, of any duration, the relevant reinsurer would be liable for all of the damage, including damage occurring before inception or after expiry.  That seems to me to be wholly uncommercial and outside any reasonable commercial expectation of either party.</p>
<p class="para">112.&nbsp;&nbsp;That applies also to the wider way in which Lexington would support the decision of the Court of Appeal, namely that any loss within the coverage of the insurance is also within the loss of the reinsurance, and a loss is within the loss of the insurance if so held by a court of competent jurisdiction, or if it is the subject of a settlement which cannot be impugned.<i> </i>The case for Lexington is not assisted by those authorities which decide that the reinsurer cannot go behind a determination of the reinsured’s liability under the contract of insurance to the original insured, whether it is by way of settlement under a follow settlements clause or by the decision of a court of competent jurisdiction:<i> Insurance Company of Africa v. SCOR (UK) Reinsurance Co Ltd</i> [1985] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 312, 330, per Robert Goff LJ; <i>Commercial Union Assurance Co. Plc v. NRG Victory Reinsurance Ltd.</i> [1998] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 600, 610-11, per Potter LJ. The reason is that a reinsurer will only be bound to follow its reinsured’s settlement and indemnify the reinsured provided that the claim recognised by them falls within the risks covered by the policy of reinsurance as a matter of law: <i>Insurance Company of Africa v. SCOR (UK) Reinsurance Co Ltd</i> at 330, per Robert Goff LJ. This is because the reinsurer cannot be held liable unless the loss falls within the cover created by the reinsurance: <i>Hill v Mercantile and General Reinsurance Co plc </i>[1996] 1 WLR 1239, at 1251, per Lord Mustill. Consequently the question remains the same: what is the effect of the policy period in the reinsurance?</p>
