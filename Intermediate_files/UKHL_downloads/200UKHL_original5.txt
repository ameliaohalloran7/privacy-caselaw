<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the background to the publication by the Wall Street Journal Europe of the article by Mr James Dorsey, its special correspondent in Riyadh, which has led to this litigation.  The article is set out and the circumstances of its publication are described in paras 40 and 41 of Lord Hoffmann's opinion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117.&nbsp;&nbsp;The trial before Eady J and a jury of the libel action brought by Mr Mohammed Abdul Latif Jameel and the company he controls, Abdul Latif Jameel Co. Ltd, led to a verdict in their favour and awards of £30,000 to Mr Jameel and £10,000 to the company.  The defence of qualified privilege failed.  The Wall Street Journal Europe's appeal to the Court of Appeal also failed but a further appeal has been brought before your Lordships.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Robertson QC, for the appellant, has taken two points.  First, he contends that the rule, well established in the law of defamation, that where a libel has been published damage is presumed to have been caused to the object of the libel, ought to be held to have no application to complaints of libel by corporations.  In order for a corporation to succeed in a libel claim it ought, Mr Robertson submits, to be necessary for the corporation to plead and prove that some actual damage has been caused to it by the libel.  This is a free-standing point of law to which the particular circumstances of and background to the publication of Mr Dorsey's article have no relevance whatever.  Mr Robertson's second point is the qualified privilege point.  If an investigative journalist, or anyone else for that matter, uncovers, or fortuitously comes across, a story of genuine public interest and importance, in what circumstances can the publisher of the story claim the protection of qualified privilege?  The question assumes that the story contains a defamatory statement or innuendo and that the publisher cannot, or does not, prove that the sting of the libel is true.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The presumption of damage</p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119.&nbsp;&nbsp;Defamation constitutes an injury to reputation.  Reputation is valued by individuals for it affects their self-esteem and their standing in the community.  Where reputation is traduced by a libel "the law presumes that <i>some </i>damage will flow in the ordinary course of things from the mere invasion of the plaintiff's rights" (Bowen LJ in <i>Ratcliffe v Evans</i> [1892]  2 QB 524 at 528).  It is accepted that the rule applies and should continue to apply to individuals.  But it is argued that it should no longer be applied to corporations.  Corporations, it is said, have no feelings to be hurt and cannot feel shame.  If they are to sue for libel they should be required to show that the libel has caused them actual damage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120.&nbsp;&nbsp;These arguments, in my opinion, miss the point.  The reputation of a corporate body is capable of being, and will usually be, not simply something in which its directors and shareholders may take pride, but an asset of positive value to it.  Why else do trading companies pay very substantial sums of money in advertising their names in TV commercials which usually say next to nothing of value about the services or products on offer from the company in question but endeavour to present an image of the company that is attractive and likely to cement the name of the corporation in the public memory?  Why do commercial companies sponsor sporting competitions, so that one has the XLtd Grand National or the YLtd Open Golf Championship or the ZLtd Premiership?  It is surely because reputation matters to trading companies and because these sponsorship activities, associating the name of the company with popular sporting events, are believed to enhance the sponsor's reputation to its commercial advantage.  The organisers of a variety of activities some sporting, some cultural, some charitable, are constantly on the look-out for sponsorship of the activity in question by some commercial company.  The choice of sponsor and the reputation of the sponsor matter to these organisers.  Who would these days choose a cigarette manufacturing company to sponsor an athletic event or a concert in aid of charity?  If reputation suffers, sponsorship invitations may be reduced, advertising opportunities may become difficult, customers may take their custom elsewhere.  If trade suffers, profits suffer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121.&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me plain beyond argument that reputation is of importance to corporations.  Proof of actual damage caused by the publication of defamatory material would, in most cases, need to await the next month's financial figures, but the figures would likely to be inconclusive.  Causation problems would usually be insuperable.  Who is to say why receipts are down or why advertising has become more difficult or less effective?  Everyone knows that fluctuations happen.  Who is to say, if the figures are not down, whether they would have been higher if the libel had not been published?  How can a company about which some libel, damaging to its reputation, has been published ever obtain an interlocutory injunction if proof of actual damage is to become the gist of the action?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that, as the case law now stands, a libel is actionable <i>per se </i>at the suit of a corporation as it is at the suit of an individual, without the need to prove that any actual damage has been caused.  In the <i>South Hetton Coal Co Ltd </i>case [1894] 1 QB 133 the plaintiff, a colliery company, complained of a libel that had attacked the company in respect of its management of company houses in which some of its colliery workers lived.  The Court of Appeal held that the libel was actionable <i>per se </i>and, at p 140, that "… the plaintiffs would be entitled to damages at large, without giving any evidence of particular damage."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>English and Scottish Co-operative Properties Mortgage and Investment Society Ltd v Odhams Press Ltd</i> [1940]  1 KB 440 was a case in which a society registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1893 complained of an article in the Daily Herald commenting on the way in which the society had kept its accounts and insinuating that the figures had been deliberately falsified and that the society had carried on business "by dishonest methods" (p 450).   Slessor LJ commented that "A more terrible indictment of a society of this kind it is difficult to imagine" (pp 450 - 451).  The jury found these insinuations to be false.  But the society had neither alleged nor proved any special damage and the jury, inadequately directed by the trial judge, had awarded damages of one farthing.  The society successfully appealed and the case was remitted for a retrial limited to the issue of quantum of damages.  Slessor LJ said, at 455 that</p>
<p></p><ul>"I cannot help feeling that …… the jury must have come to the conclusion that in so far as they were not satisfied that the company had lost any business, they must treat the damages as quite nominal or trivial.  If they did go into their deliberations with that view they were entirely in error.  A libel by the invasion of a legal right gives a right to damages.  It is the duty of a jury to assess those damages, which may be punitive or contemptuous, or, in an ordinary case, may be such as would recompense the plaintiff for the wrong done to his reputation."<p></p></ul>
<p>Goddard LJ said, at 461, that</p>
<p></p><ul>"There is no obligation on the plaintiffs to show that they have suffered actual damage.  A plaintiff may, if he can, by way of aggravating damages, prove that he has suffered actual damage.  But in every case he is perfectly entitled to say that there has been a serious libel upon him; that the law assumes that he must have suffered damage; and that he is entitled to substantial damages."<p></p></ul>
<p>All of this was said of a corporate industrial and provident society whose reputation had been besmirched by the libel.  And it is to be borne in mind that the primary purpose of an award of damages in a libel action, where no actual damage caused by the libel has been pleaded or proved, is not compensation but vindication of reputation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;124.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Derbyshire County Council v Times Newspapers Ltd</i> [1993]  AC 534 established the important principle that institutions of central or local government have no right at common law to maintain actions for damages for defamation.  But no doubt was cast on the right of corporations to do so.  The leading speech was given by Lord Keith of Kinkel who (at 544 - 545) cited the <i>South Hetton Coal Co</i> case with approval.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords I can see no good reason why your Lordships should now disqualify corporations from bringing libel actions unless able to allege and prove actual damage caused by the libel.  Every corporation is incorporated for some purpose.  In the constitution of every corporation its principal objects will be set out.  A trading company's principal object will be to carry on trade.  A charitable corporation's principal object will be the promotion or pursuit of some charitable object.  Some companies are incorporated as holding companies, holding subsidiary companies or other assets for the benefit of the group of which they form part.  Whether publications containing disparaging or derogatory remarks about a company can be complained of by the company as being defamatory will depend upon the nature of the remarks and the nature of the corporation's objects and reputation.  It might be quite difficult to defame a holding company.  But a holding company's reputation might be indistinguishable from that of the corporate group to which it belonged.  If, however, the conclusion can be reached that the remarks in question were indeed defamatory, damaging to the reputation of the company and apt to damage its ability to pursue its trading or charitable or other objects, I can see no reason of principle why the long-standing rule of law enabling the company to pursue a remedy in a defamation action without the need to allege or prove actual damage should be changed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;126.&nbsp;&nbsp;And, in particular, I can see nothing in article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights that requires a different conclusion.  The right to freedom of expression was never intended, in my opinion, to allow defamatory statements, whether of individuals or companies, to be published with impunity.  If a defamer can neither justify the statement nor claim the protection afforded by the law to fair comment on matters of public interest or to statements that qualify for privilege, he must, in my opinion, be prepared to answer for the libel.  On this issue I am in full agreement with the opinions that have been expressed by my noble and learned friends Lord Bingham of Cornhill and Lord Hope of Craighead.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qualified Privilege</p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;127.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have found it instructive to remind myself of the reason why qualified privilege emerged from the case law of the 19th Century as a defence in defamation actions.  The reason was given by Parke B in <i>Toogood v Spyring</i> 1 CM &amp; R 181,149 ER1045.  Parke B was explaining why there were "cases where the occasion of the publication affords a defence in the absence of express malice."  He said this (at 193):</p>
<p></p><ul>"In general, an action lies for the malicious publication of statements which are false in fact, and injurious to the character of another (within the well-known limits as to verbal slander), and the law considers such publication as malicious, unless it is fairly made by a person in the discharge of some public or private duty, whether legal or moral, or in the conduct of his own affairs, in matters where his interest is concerned.  In such cases, the occasion prevents the inference of malice, which the law draws from unauthorised communications, and affords a qualified defence depending upon the absence of actual malice.  If fairly warranted by any reasonable occasion or exigency, and honestly made, such communications are protected for the common convenience and welfare of society; and the law has not restricted the right to make them within any narrow limits."<p></p></ul>
<p>Parke B's references to "malice" were explained by Lindley LJ in <i>Stuart v Bell</i> [1891]  2 QB 341 at 345:</p>
<p></p><ul>"A privileged occasion is one which is held in point of law to rebut the legal implication of malice which would otherwise be made from the utterance of untrue defamatory language"<p></p></ul>
<p>and, at 347, citing Erle CJ in <i>Whiteley v Adams </i>(1863) 15 CB (NS) 392, 414:</p>
<p></p><ul>"I take it to be clear that the foundation of an action for defamation is malice.  But defamation pure and simple affords presumptive evidence of malice.  The presumption may be rebutted by showing that the circumstances under which the libel was written or the words uttered were such as to render it justifiable"<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;128.&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be convenient to be able to extract from these dicta the principle that any circumstances attending the publication that render the publication "justifiable" would rebut the "presumptive evidence of malice" and attract the protection of qualified privilege.  But to do so would be to overlook subsequent authority that appears to place fairly rigid limits on the occasions that can attract qualified privilege.  In <i>Adam v Ward</i> [1917]  AC 309 Lord Atkinson said, at 334, that</p>
<p></p><ul>"A privileged occasion is …. an occasion where the person who makes a communication has an interest or a duty, legal, social, or moral, to make it to the person to whom it is made, and the person to whom it is so made has a corresponding interest or duty to receive it.  This reciprocity is essential."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;129.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, however accurate Lord Atkinson's statement of law may be where the defamatory communication has been made to a relatively limited number of people, it does not, as it seems to me, cater for the role of the press, at the end of the 20th Century and the beginning of the 21st, in reporting on matters of public importance.  Newspapers address their contents to the public at large.  Some, like the Wall Street Journal Europe, have an international readership, but the relationship between a newspaper and the members of the public who choose to read it is essentially the same, whether the readership be international or local.  The publication is to the public at large.  To insist on a reciprocity of duty and interest between the publisher of a newspaper and the reader of the newspaper, who may be in New York, London, Rome, or anywhere, either makes the requirement of reciprocity meaningless or deprives any defamatory statement in the paper, no matter how important as a matter of public interest the content of the statement may be, of the possibility of the protection of qualified privilege.  It was this undesirable rigidity of the law of qualified privilege that, to my mind, the seminal judgment of Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead in the <i>Reynolds </i>case [2001] 2 AC 127 was designed to meet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;130.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Nicholls did not turn his back on the reciprocal duty/interest test for qualified privilege.  Instead he moulded the test so as to cater for the publication of information that the public as a whole, as opposed to a specific individual or individuals, was entitled to know.  He said, at 197, that the court should take into account the nature, status and source of the material published and the circumstances of the publication and continued:</p>
<p></p><ul>"These factors are to be taken into account in determining whether the duty-interest test is satisfied or, as I would prefer to say in a simpler and more direct way, whether the public was entitled to know the particular information.  The duty-interest test, or the right to know test, cannot be carried out in isolation from these factors and without regard to them.  A claim to privilege stands or falls according to whether the claim passes or fails this test.  There is no further requirement."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;131.&nbsp;&nbsp;At 204, under the heading "Conclusion", Lord Nicholls rejected the notion that a new category of qualified privilege needed to be developed.  He emphasised that</p>
<p></p><ul>"The elasticity of the common law principle enables interference with freedom of speech to be confined to what is necessary in the circumstances of the case.  This elasticity enables the court to give appropriate weight, in today's conditions, to the importance of freedom of expression by the media on all matters of public concern."<p></p></ul>
<p>He then (at 205) gave some illustrative examples of matters that should be taken into account by the court when judging whether a particular publication attracted qualified privilege, but warned that:</p>
<p></p><ul>"This list is not exhaustive.  The weight to be given to these and any other relevant factors will vary from case to case"<p></p></ul>
<p>and that</p>
<p></p><ul>"The court should be slow to conclude that a publication was not in the public interest and, therefore, the public had no right to know ….  Any lingering doubts should be resolved in favour of publication."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;132.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Steyn, in his speech, in <i>Reynolds</i> said, at 214, that a publication should be entitled to the protection of qualified privilege if </p>
<p></p><ul>"… it can fairly be said to be in the public interest that the information about political matters should be published"<p></p></ul>
<p>and, at 215, that he </p>
<p></p><ul>"… would uphold qualified privilege of political speech, based on a weighing of the particular circumstances of the case."<p></p></ul>
<p>And Lord Cooke of Thorndon, in an important passage at 225, said that</p>
<p></p><ul>"Hitherto the only publications to the world at large to which English courts have been willing to extend qualified privilege at common law have been fair and accurate reports of certain proceedings or findings of legitimate interest to the general public.  In <i>Blackshaw v Lord </i>[1984] QB1,<i>  Templeton v Jones </i>[1984] 1 NZLR 448, and now the present case, the law is being developed to meet the reasonable demands of freedom of speech in a modern democracy, by recognising that there may be a wider privilege dependent on the particular circumstances …"<p></p></ul>
<p>Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough expressed his full agreement with what Lord Nicholls had said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;133.&nbsp;&nbsp;In effect, in my opinion, the House was, in the context of journalistic reporting, re-investing qualified privilege with the flexibility that Baron Parke in <i>Toogood v Spyring </i>and Lindley LJ in <i>Stuart v Bell </i>would appear to have accorded it:  As Erle CJ said in <i>Whiteley v Adams </i></p>
<p></p><ul>"That presumption [of malice] may be rebutted by showing the circumstances under which the libel was written …. were such as to render it justifiable".<p></p></ul>
<p>This view of the effect of <i>Reynolds </i>accords with remarks by Lord Cooke of Thorndon in <i>McCartan Turkington Breen v Times Newspapers Ltd </i>[2001] 2 AC 277 at 301:</p>
<p></p><ul>"… until <i>Reynolds </i>it would seem that the legal profession in England may not have been fully alive to the possibility of a particular rather than a generic qualified privilege for newspaper reports where <i>the circumstances warranted a</i> <i>finding of sufficient general public interest</i>" (Emphasis added).<p></p></ul>
<p>and</p>
<p></p><ul>"It seems to me that the <i>Reynolds </i>case was less a breakthrough than a reminder of the width of the basic common law principles as to privilege".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;134.&nbsp;&nbsp;A somewhat different, though no less welcoming, view of <i>Reynolds</i>, was expressed by the Court of Appeal in <i>Loutchansky v Times Newspapers Ltd (Nos 2-5)</i> [2002]  QB 783.  The judgment of the court said, in para 33 that </p>
<p></p><ul>"Whereas previously it could truly be said of qualified privilege that it attaches to the occasion of the publication rather than the publication, <i>Reynolds </i>privilege attaches, if at all, to the publication itself: it is impossible to conceive of circumstances in which the occasion of publication could be privileged but the article itself not so.  Similarly, once <i>Reynolds </i>privilege attaches, little scope remains for any subsequent finding of malice."<p></p></ul>
<p>And, in paras 35 and 36, that</p>
<p></p><ul>"35.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once <i>Reynolds </i>privilege is recognised, as it should be, as a different jurisprudential creature from the traditional form of privilege from which it sprang, the particular nature of the 'interest' and 'duty' which underlie it can more easily be understood.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>36.&nbsp;&nbsp;The interest is that of the public in a modern democracy in free expression and, more particularly, in the promotion of a free and vigorous press to keep the public informed ….  The corresponding duty on the journalist (and equally his editor) is to play his proper role in discharging that function.  His task is to behave as a responsible journalist.  He can have no duty to publish unless he is acting responsibly any more than the public has an interest in reading what may be published irresponsibly.  That is why in this class of case the question whether the publisher has behaved responsibly is necessarily and intimately bound up with the question whether the defence of qualified privilege arises.  Unless the publisher is acting responsibly privilege cannot arise."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;135.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords I am in respectful and complete agreement with the explanation of <i>Reynolds </i>privilege given by the Court of Appeal in paragraph 36 cited above.  But I would not myself accept the conclusion that <i>Reynolds </i>privilege is "a different jurisprudential creature" from traditional qualified privilege.  The "interest" and "duty" referred to in para 36 and the criteria for establishing their existence do no more, in my opinion, than give expression in a particular journalistic context to the principle expressed by Erle CJ that qualified privilege arises where "the circumstances under which the libel was written … were such as to render it justifiable."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;136.&nbsp;&nbsp;The advice of the Privy Council, written by Lord Nicholls, in <i>Bonnick v Morris</i> [2003]  1 AC 300, represented, again in a journalistic context, a further move away from rigidity.  There were two issues before the Board.  One was as to the meaning to be attributed to the statement complained of.  A defamatory meaning was one possibility but was not the only meaning that might be conveyed to a reasonable reader.  The Board took the view the natural and ordinary meaning of the words used in the statement carried with them a defamatory implication.  The other issue was whether a defence of qualified privilege was available.  Lord Nicholls explained, in para 22, the dilemma produced by the ambiguity of the words used in the statement in question.</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is one matter to apply this [single meaning] principle when deciding whether an article should be regarded as defamatory.  Then the question being considered is one of meaning.  It would be an altogether different matter to apply the principle when deciding whether a journalist or newspaper acted responsibly.  Then the question being considered is one of conduct."<p></p></ul>
<p>He continued, in paras 23 and 24:</p>
<p></p><ul>"23.&nbsp;&nbsp;Stated shortly, the <i>Reynolds </i>privilege is concerned to provide a proper degree of protection for responsible journalism when reporting matters of public concern.  Responsible journalism is the point at which a fair balance is held between freedom of expression on matters of public concern and the reputations of individuals…. If they are to have the benefit of the privilege journalists must exercise due professional skill and care.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>24.&nbsp;&nbsp;To be meaningful this standard of conduct must be applied in a practical and flexible manner … A journalist should not be penalised for making a wrong decision on a question of meaning  on which different people might reasonably take different views … If the words are ambiguous to such an extent that they may readily convey a different meaning to an ordinary reasonable reader, a court may properly take this other meaning into account when considering whether <i>Reynolds </i>privilege is available as a defence.  In doing so the court will attribute to this feature of the case whatever weight it considers appropriate in all the circumstances."<p></p></ul>
<p>In the event the Board held that the "article was a piece of responsible journalism to which the defence of qualified privilege is available"(para 28).  In my opinion, this appeal presents an opportunity which your Lordships should take to confirm that the approach taken in <i>Bonnick v Morris </i>was an approach which accords with the principles expressed by the House in <i>Reynolds.</i></p><i>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;137.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, in my opinion the judgments in the courts below which have led to this appeal have not correctly applied the principles for which the <i>Reynolds </i>case stands as authority.  In para 23 of his judgment Eady J said that it was not possible to construe what Lord Nicholls had said in <i>Reynolds </i>at 202 "as supplanting the common law touchstone of 'social or moral duty' by a different test such as 'responsible journalism' or  the exercise of  'due professional skill and care'."  However the touchstone of a reciprocal interest and duty between the receiver and the giver of the defamatory statement was a judicial construct of the 20th Century designed to produce certainty as to the circumstances in which a defamatory statement made by A to B could be accorded the protection of qualified privilege.  It is a touchstone that makes little sense in relation to statements, typically those contained in the pages of newspapers, made to the world at large.  <i>Reynolds</i> was not supplanting the duty/interest touchstone for situations to which that touchstone was intended to apply and could sensibly be applied.  It was supplementing that touchstone in order to provide the protection of qualified privilege, where the circumstances warranted that protection, to statements published to the world at large.  The expression "responsible journalism" has been usefully coined as a succinct summary - but only a summary - of the circumstances in which a defamatory article in a newspaper can claim that protection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;138.&nbsp;&nbsp;Journalists, and the editors and publishers of the newspapers in which journalists' articles appear, may or may not regard themselves as under a "social and moral duty" to publish the information contained in their articles.  If the impulsion to publish is to be expressed in "duty" terms, it would be nearer the mark to describe the duty as a "professional duty".  Newspapers exist to supply information to the public.  The information may be interesting but trivial; it may be lacking in much interest but nonetheless important.  Newspapers may decide to publish information that would be interesting to the public but that is essentially unimportant or, as it might be put, of very little public interest.  It would be a misuse of the word "duty" to describe a newspaper as having a "duty" to publish information of that character.  But there is other information the public interest of which is real and unmistakable.  In relation to information of that character it makes sense to speak of newspapers having a "duty" to publish.  They, and their reporters, should, of course, take such steps as are practicable to verify the truth of what is reported.  Fairness to those whose names appear in newspapers may require, if it is practicable, an opportunity to comment being given to them and/or an opportunity to have a response published by the newspaper.  These are all circumstances the weight of which in assessing whether a report should be protected by qualified privilege will vary from case to case.  Lord Nicholls made all of this clear in <i>Reynolds.  </i></p>
