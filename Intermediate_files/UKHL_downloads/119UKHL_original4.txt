<p class="para">50.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although <i>Dillwyn v Llewelyn</i> is aptly described as a case of imperfect gift, it also had a slight flavour of “common expectation", because the father wanted to have his son living near him (the Lord Chancellor referred almost in the same breath to an agreement and a donation).  It also had an element of mistake, but not of unilateral mistake.  Both father and son must be taken to have made the common mistake of supposing the signed memorandum to be an effective way of making a gift of land.  Had the mistake been discovered during the father’s lifetime, it would no doubt have been put right without the need for legal proceedings.</p>
<p class="para">51.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cases of unilateral mistake occurred quite frequently in the 19th century, when the construction of canals and railways, coupled with the complexity of unregistered conveyancing in those days, made it not uncommon for building works to be carried out on land whose owner (or part-owner) had not agreed to the works.  An example is <i>Rochdale Canal Company v King</i> (1853)  16 Beav 630, 633-637, in which Sir John Romilly MR said</p>
<p class="qt">“The principle on which the Defendants rely is one often recognised by this Court, namely, that if one man stand by and encourage another, though but passively, to lay out money, under an erroneous opinion of title, or under the obvious expectation that no obstacle will afterwards be interposed in the way of his enjoyment, the Court will not permit any subsequent interference with it, by him who formally promoted and encouraged those acts of which he now either complains or seeks to take advantage.  This is the rule laid down in <i>Dann v Spurrier</i> (7 Ves 231),<i> Powell v Thomas </i>(6 Hare 300), and many other cases, to which it is unnecessary to refer, because the principle is clear.”</p>
<i></i><p class="para"><i>Dann v Spurrier</i> (1802)  7 Ves Jun 231 was a decision of Lord Eldon in a case concerned with improvements to a leasehold property carried out by the tenant’s assignee in circumstances where it was uncertain whether the length of the term (7, 14 or 21 years) was at the option of the lessee alone (and ultimately the case was decided on that point of construction).  Lord Eldon made clear (at pp.235-236) that the fact of the defendant’s knowledge (of the plaintiff’s mistake) must be proved by strong and cogent evidence.  He gave some weight to the fact that the plaintiff was a professional man who had acted incautiously.</p>
<p class="para">52.&nbsp;&nbsp;The great case of <i>Ramsden v Dyson</i> (1866) LR 1 HL 129 has, rightly, been closely examined in the course of the appeal.  The Vice-Chancellor had held that two tenants of Sir John Ramsden, the owner of a large estate near Huddersfield, were entitled to long leases of plots on the estate.  They ostensibly held the plots as tenants at will only, but they had spent their own money in building on the strength of assurances, said to have been given to them by the landowner’s agent, that they would never be disturbed.  This House reversed that decision by a majority (Lord Cranworth LC, Lord Wensleydale and Lord Westbury, Lord Kingsdown dissenting).  The difference of opinion was over an issue of fact, that is the substance of what was said on the occasion when some tenants agreed to be tenants at lower rents than were being paid by other tenants of Sir John Ramsden.  Lord Kingsdown’s statement of the law (at p.170, emphasising the element of encouragement) has often been preferred to Lord Cranworth’s (at pp.140-141, emphasising the importance of mistake on one side and knowledge of the mistake on the other side).  Lord Kingsdown was seeing the case as one of common expectation (of the tenant’s right to be granted a long lease on demand), whereas Lord Cranworth was seeing it as one of unilateral mistake.  <i>Ramsden v Dyson</i> is a good example of a case which does not fit neatly into one category to the exclusion of another.</p>
<p class="para">53.&nbsp;&nbsp;The passages in <i>Ramsden v Dyson</i> that I have just mentioned are too well-known to need repetition.  But Mr Dowding QC (for the appellant) drew attention to another, less frequently quoted, passage in Lord Cranworth’s speech.  After mentioning one competing version of the substance of what had been said (that is, that the tenants could “safely allow the matter to rest in the honour of the Ramsden family”) Lord Cranworth said (at p.145-146),</p>
<p class="qt">“If any one makes an assurance to another, with or without consideration, that he will do or will abstain from doing a particular act, but he refuses to bind himself, and says that for the performance of what he has promised the person to whom the promise has been made must rely on the honour of the person who has made it, this excludes the jurisdiction of Courts of equity no less than of Courts of law.”</p>
<p class="para">Lord Wensleydale made similar comments at the end of his speech (p.170). These may be the first references to the notion that an arrangement which is expressly and deliberately acknowledged to be a “gentleman’s agreement” may not be capable of giving rise to an estoppel.  It is of some relevance to this appeal, the facts of which are stated in the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Scott of Foscote, whose account I gratefully adopt.</p>
<p class="para">54.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Plimmer v Mayor, Councillors and Citizens of the City of Wellington</i> (1884) 9 App Cas 699 was a common expectation case.  Mr Plimmer seems to have been a businessman of some substance, and he was dealing with the provincial government, but their arrangements seem to have been attended by a high degree of informality.  In that respect it is in striking contrast to <i>Attorney General of Hong Kong v Humphreys Estate (Queen’s Gardens)</i> [1987] AC 114, discussed below.  In <i>Plimmer</i> the nub of the Privy Council’s decision appears at p.712:</p>
<p class="qt">“In the present case, the equity is not claimed because the landowner has stood by in silence while his tenant has spent money on his land.  This is a case in which the landowner has, for his own purposes, requested the tenant to make the improvements.  The Government were engaged in the important work of introducing immigrants into the colony.  For some reason, not now apparent, they were not prepared to make landing-places of their own, and in fact they did not do so until the year 1863.  So they applied to John Plimmer to make his landing-place more commodious by substantial extension of his jetty and the erection of a warehouse for baggage.  Is it to be said that, when had had incurred the expense of doing the work asked for, the Government could turn round and revoke his licence at their will?  Could they in July, 1856, have deprived him summarily of the use of the jetty?  It would be in a high degree unjust that they should do so, and that the parties should have intended such a result is, in the absence of evidence, incredible.”</p>
<p class="para">55.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Plimmer</i> the opinion of the Privy Council, delivered by Sir Arthur Hobhouse, is of interest because it discusses (at pp.710-712) the case of <i>Ramsden v Dyson </i>at some length, and rejects the argument (based on Lord Cranworth’s speech) that some sort of unilateral mistake is necessary in every case.  <i>Plimmer</i> is also important for the discussion (at pp.713-714) of the Court’s discretion as to the remedy to be granted in any case where an equitable estoppel is established.</p>
<p class="para">56.&nbsp;&nbsp;Four years before <i>Plimmer </i>Fry J decided <i>Willmott v Barber</i> (1880) 15 Ch D 96.  It calls for mention because Fry J’s five <i>probanda</i> have over the years proved something of a stumbling-block in the development of equitable estoppel, until the position was clarified by Oliver J in <i>Taylors Fashions Ltd v Liverpool Victoria Trustees Co Ltd</i> (1979) [1982] QB 133.  Gray and Gray comment (para 10.204, footnote 1) that courts often tried to force factual situations into the <i>probanda </i>even when they were “ludicrously irrelevant or inapplicable” to the case. </p>
<p class="para">57.&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts of <i>Willmott v Barber</i> were that Barber was in 1869 granted a 99-year lease of three acres of land in east London, subject to a covenant against assignment or sub-letting without consent.  In 1874, in breach of covenant, he sub-let one acre on an annual tenancy to Willmott (who owned a sawmill on adjoining land) and gave him an option to acquire the whole of the three acres.  Willmott spent money in levelling the land and laying it out as a timber-yard.  In 1877 Barber purported to surrender his term to his landlord, Bowyer, and take an immediate re-grant (it is not clear whether Barber was dishonest or simply disorganised).  Then Willmott exercised his option and sued Barber for specific performance, joining Bowyer as a party and seeking a declaration that he had unreasonably refused consent.  The real issue was whether Bowyer had disabled himself, by acquiescence, from objecting to the breach of covenant.  That was the context in which Fry J formulated his five detailed <i>probanda.</i>  He was not trying to state principles applicable to equitable estoppel as a whole.  Indeed he began his judgment (at p.104),</p>
<p class="qt">“I think it is very questionable whether, after what Bowyer has done, he could interfere with the Plaintiff’s possession of the one acre.  But that point is not raised in this action, and my decision will in no way affect it.”</p>
<p class="para">58.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Taylor’s Fashions</i> Oliver J analysed the authorities in a masterly way (with the assistance of two chancery silks who were later to become Law Lords) and put this part of the law back on the right track.  He pointed out that the five <i>probanda</i> (including the defendant’s knowledge of his own title, and of the claimant’s mistake as to title) are relevant only to cases of unilateral mistake, where the defendant’s only encouragement to the claimant has been passive non-intervention: see at p. 147.  Oliver J discussed <i>Ramsden v Dyson</i> at some length and followed the preference shown by the Privy Council in <i>Plimmer</i> for Lord Kingsdown’s analysis rather than Lord Cranworth’s: see at pp. 148-151.</p>
<p class="para">59.&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards the end of his judgment Oliver J made some important general observations (at pp.151-152):</p>
<p class="qt">“Furthermore the more recent cases indicate, in my judgment, that the application of the <i>Ramsden v Dyson </i>LR 1 HL 129 principle—whether you call it proprietary estoppel, estoppel by acquiescence or estoppel by encouragement is really immaterial—requires a very much broader approach which is directed rather at ascertaining whether, in particular individual circumstances, it would be unconscionable for a party to be permitted to deny that which, knowingly, or unknowingly, he has allowed or encouraged another to assume to his detriment than to enquiring whether the circumstances can be fitted within the confines of some preconceived formula serving as a universal yardstick for every form of unconscionable behaviour.”</p>
<p class="para">This passage certainly favours a broad or unified approach to equitable estoppel.  But it is emphatically not a licence for abandoning careful analysis for unprincipled and subjective judicial opinion.  It is worth noting that on this part of the case Oliver J analysed over twenty authorities spanning more than two centuries.   </p>
<p class="para">60.&nbsp;&nbsp;The last authority that calls for close examination is <i>Attorney General of Hong Kong v Humphreys Estate (Queen’s Gardens) Ltd</i> [1987] AC 114.  It was concerned with protracted (and ultimately abortive) negotiations for an exchange of valuable property between the Government of Hong Kong (which was to acquire a block of flats to house senior civil servants) and a large property developer (which was to take a Crown lease of Queen’s Gardens in order to develop it, together with other land already owned by the developer).  An agreement in principle had been reached in discussions recorded in lengthy written correspondence, which unsurprisingly referred to the agreement in principle as being “subject to contract".  Experienced lawyers were acting on both sides, and they and their clients were well aware that an enforceable contract would come into existence only on exchange of contracts as finally agreed between the lawyers.</p>
<p class="para">61.&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite that both sides incurred expenditure in the expectation that a contract would eventually be entered into.  The Government took possession of the flats and spent money on them; the developer entered Queen’s Gardens and carried out work at its expense.  But each side was acting at its own risk, because each knew perfectly well that it had no enforceable rights against the other. The Government’s main witness, Mr Ward, was a surveyor who accepted that he was not a party to the negotiations under which the Government moved into the flats and that he had no authority to take decisions. The parties’ knowledge that neither had any enforceable rights was fatal to the Government’s claim to rely on equitable estoppel.  Lord Templeman, delivering the opinion of the Board, summarised the position at p.124:</p>
<p class="qt">“Their Lordships accept that the Government acted to their detriment and to the knowledge of HKL in the hope that HKL would not withdraw from the agreement in principle.  But in order to found an estoppel the Government must go further.  First the Government must show that HKL created or encouraged a belief or expectation on the part of the Government that HKL would not withdraw from the agreement in principle.  Secondly the Government must show that the Government relied on that belief or expectation.  Their Lordships agree with the courts of Hong Kong that the Government fail on both counts.”</p>
<p class="para">62.&nbsp;&nbsp;In reaching that conclusion the Privy Council naturally referred to, and placed some reliance on, the use of the phrase “subject to contract” in the correspondence between the parties.  But in my opinion that was simply a routine acknowledgement of what both parties knew very well in any event: that they were involved in a complex process of negotiation which might come to nothing (as occurred when the Hong Kong property market fell sharply in 1984).  The Government of Hong Kong was at pains, as appears from the documents quoted by the Privy Council (and still more from the fuller quotations from the documents in the judgments in the Hong Kong Court of Appeal, [1986] HKLR 669), to emphasise on every occasion that it was not committing itself in any way.  By the same token, it could not expect the developer to be committing itself, either in law or in equity.  It could not be unconscionable for the developer to follow a course which the Government repeatedly insisted was open to itself.</p>
<p class="para">63.&nbsp;&nbsp;The present appeal is not a case of imperfect gift, like <i>Dillwyn v Llewelyn.</i>  Nor is it a case of unilateral mistake to which the <i>Willmott v Barber probanda</i> would be appropriate—that is, a case of the defendant taking advantage of a mistake as to title of which he is well aware.  This case is, in the terminology used by Gray and Gray, a case of “common expectation” if it is anything.  The critical issue, to my mind, is whether there was, on the judge’s findings, a common expectation of the type capable of raising an equitable estoppel.  Although they are not based on common mistake (as in the “imperfect gift” cases) or unilateral mistake (as in the “standing by” cases) “common expectation” cases often have at least a flavour of mistake, or at any rate what restitution lawyers call misprediction (Mr Cobbe predicted, wrongly, that Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring would not withdraw from the non-binding arrangement).  Was it also necessary for Mr Cobbe to believe, wrongly, that Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring had no legal right to withdraw from it?</p>
<p class="para">64.&nbsp;&nbsp;On this point the language of Lord Kingsdown’s much-quoted statement in <i>Ramsden v Dyson</i> at p.170 is not without ambiguity:</p>
<p class="qt">“. . . under a verbal agreement with a landlord for a certain interest in land, or, what amounts to the same thing, under an expectation, created or encouraged by the landlord, that he shall have a certain interest . . .”</p>
<p class="para">But an expectation of an interest is the same thing as a contracted interest only if it can be relied on.  The rest of the speech indicates (at p.172) that Lord Kingsdown’s reading of the facts was that the tenants believed (wrongly) that they had a legal right to a long lease, and that that was of critical importance.  So he seems not to have differed, as to the law on this point, from Lord Cranworth (at pp. 145-146, a passage I have already quoted) and the rest of the majority.  Reliance on the Ramsden family’s honour was not enough.</p>
<p class="para">65.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Plimmer</i> the Privy Council (at p.712, the passage I have already quoted) regarded it as an irresistible inference that Mr Plimmer thought that his compliance with the Government’s request gave him a right to security of tenure, even if the duration of that security was uncertain.  It is not enough to hope, or even to have a confident expectation, that the person who has given assurances will eventually do the proper thing.</p>
<p class="para">66.&nbsp;&nbsp;The point that hopes by themselves are not enough is made most clearly in cases with a commercial context, of which <i>Attorney General of Hong Kong</i> is the most striking example. It does not appear so often in cases with more of a domestic or family flavour, from <i>Inwards v Baker</i> [1965] 2 QB 29 and <i>Pascoe v Turner</i> [1979] 1 WLR 431 to <i>Windeler v Whitehall</i> [1990] 2 FLR 505, <i>Gillett v Holt</i> [2001] Ch 210, <i>Grundy v Ottey</i> [2003] WTLR 1253, <i>Jennings v Rice</i> [2003] 1 P &amp; CR 8 and <i>Lissimore v Downing</i> [2003] 2 FLR 308. The son who built the bungalow in <i>Inwards v Baker</i>, the<i> </i>young farm manager in <i>Gillett v Holt</i>, the elderly country neighbour in <i>Jennings v Rice</i> and the female companions in the other three cases almost certainly did not take any legal advice until after the events relied on as creating the estoppel. They may not have had a clear idea of the quantum of what they expected to get (in <i>Grundy v Ottey</i>, unusually, the expected quantum was precisely defined). But in those cases in which an estoppel was established, the claimant believed that the assurance on which he or she relied was binding and irrevocable.</p>
<p class="para">67.&nbsp;&nbsp;It may possibly be that some of the domestic cases might have been decided differently if the nature of the claimant’s belief had been an issue vigorously investigated in cross-examination. In <i>Gillett v Holt</i> there was such cross-examination ([2001] Ch 210, 229),</p>
<p class="qt">“Mr Gillett was cross-examined at length about some increasingly improbable eventualities: that Mr Holt would marry his housekeeper, that he would have children, that his elderly sister would suddenly lose all her investments and turn to him for help. Mr Gillett naturally enough conceded that in those circumstances Mr Holt could or would have made some provision for these moral obligations. But, in giving evidence, he stuck resolutely to the promises made to him. . . Mr Gillett was not in the witness box to take part in a seminar on the elements of proprietary estoppel (although parts of his cross- examination suggest otherwise). He was there to give evidence, which was largely unchallenged and which the judge accepted, about the assurances made to him and his detrimental reliance on them.”</p>
<p class="para">In most of these cases the controversial issues tend to be whether any sufficient assurance was made, and whether it was causally relevant (often cross-examination is directed towards establishing that the claimant would have done the same in any case, out of friendship or family feeling).</p>
<p class="para">68.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unprofitable to trawl through the authorities on domestic arrangements in order to compare the forms of words used by judges to describe the claimants’ expectations in cases where this issue (hope or something more?) was not squarely raised. But the fact that the issue is seldom raised is not, I think, coincidental. In the commercial context, the claimant is typically a business person with access to legal advice and what he or she is expecting to get is a <i>contract</i>. In the domestic or family context, the typical claimant is not a business person and is not receiving legal advice. What he or she wants and expects to get is an <i>interest</i> in immovable property, often for long-term occupation as a home. The focus is not on intangible legal rights but on the tangible property which he or she expects to get.  The typical domestic claimant does not stop to reflect (until disappointed expectations lead to litigation) whether some further legal transaction (such as a grant by deed, or the making of a will or codicil) is necessary to complete the promised title.</p>
<p class="para">69.&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge’s findings of fact, which are not challenged in any significant respect, need to be examined with these points in mind. His findings are clearly identified and set out in paras 62 to 84 of his judgment. To say that they are dispassionate is not to suggest that they are in any way unfocused; quite the reverse.</p>
<p class="para">70.&nbsp;&nbsp;The crucial findings, to my mind, are in paras 68 to 70:</p>
<p class="qt">“68. On the other hand, I find that, from the end of 2002 until the grant of the Planning Permission on 17 March 2004, Mr Cobbe believed the following: that the Second Agreement comprised all the critical commercial terms, that any outstanding terms were of secondary importance and in the nature of legal mechanics, which would inevitably be agreed one way or another, and that Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring was, and regarded herself as, bound in honour to enter into a formal written contract embodying the terms of the Second Agreement if Mr Cobbe obtained planning permission for the development of the Property by its demolition and its replacement by six houses.</p>
<p class="qt">69. I also accept Mr Cobbe’s evidence that he himself felt the Second Agreement was binding on him in honour. I reject the submission of Mr Seitler to the contrary based on the oral evidence of Mr McMahon, as to what Mr McMahon had been told by, and the general impression that was given to him by, Mr Cobbe, and on a note made by Mr Cobbe in 2004 concerning the First Agreement and its termination.</p>
<p class="qt">70. Mr Cobbe envisaged that, if Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring decided not to proceed with the development of the Property, prior to planning permission being granted, he would be reimbursed his reasonable expenditure. If she did not withdraw, and such planning permission was refused, he would not be reimbursed.”</p>
<p class="para">71.&nbsp;&nbsp;So the judge found that Mr Cobbe believed that Mrs Lisle- Mainwaring was, and regarded herself as, bound in honour to enter into a formal written contract if planning permission was granted; and that Mr Cobbe regarded himself as similarly bound. It is implicit—in my view necessarily and deliberately implicit—in the judge’s carefully chosen language that neither Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring nor Mr Cobbe regarded herself or himself as legally bound. They were both very experienced in property matters and they knew perfectly well that that was not the position.</p>
<p class="para">72.&nbsp;&nbsp;Another unusual feature of this case is the judge’s finding that Mr Cobbe believed that he would be reimbursed his reasonable expenditure if Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring decided to withdraw from the arrangement before planning permission was granted. This emphasis on the actual grant of planning permission as the crucial condition produces a strange result: would it be conscionable for Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring to withdraw (subject only to reimbursement) at a stage when 99% of the work necessary to obtain planning permission had been done, and success was virtually certain, but unconscionable to do so once success had actually been achieved? This feature of the arrangement emphasises the risk which Mr Cobbe was undertaking, in deciding to rely on Mrs Lisle Mainwaring’s sense of honour.</p>
<p class="para">73.&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge then proceeded to analyse the position (paras 85-129 of his judgment), stating at the outset his conclusion that the facts did give rise to a proprietary estoppel in favour of Mr Cobbe. The judge’s analysis is lengthy and closely-reasoned but there are, as I see it, three main themes.</p>
<p class="para">74.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the importance (para 86) of Mr Cobbe’s</p>
<p class="qt">“belief that, even though the Second Agreement was not a legally binding and enforceable contract, Mrs Lisle Mainwaring regarded it as binding.”</p>
<p class="para">The judge did not add “in honour only” but that was necessarily implicit. Mr Cobbe knew enough about the law of property, and about Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring’s astuteness, to know that there was no legally binding contract between them, and that Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring would not regard an obligation arising in honour only as legally binding. This point then re-emerged in para 123, near the end of the judge’s analysis, with a reference to Mr Cobbe’s belief that the arrangement “would be honoured, even though it was not legally binding.” “Honour” is used, as a verb, to describe compliance with both contractual and non- contractual promises, and so its use rather elides the difference between them.</p>
<p class="para">75.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second theme of the judge’s analysis is the weight which he placed, in discussing the authorities, on the use of the expression “subject to contract” in <i>Attorney-General of Hong Kong </i>and<i> London and Regional Investments v TBI plc</i> [2000] EWCA Civ 355 (in which the words “SUBJECT TO CONTRACT” appeared prominently at the head of the written “Principles for Joint Venture”). In each of those cases there were written terms which, in the absence of any “subject to contract” formula, might arguably have amounted to binding contracts, and the formula emphasised that matters were still at the stage of negotiation. But I can see no good reason for according a higher degree of revocability or negotiability to written terms “subject to contract” than to terms which have never been written down at all (so that the use of the “subject to contract” formula has not been called for), especially where the negotiations have been carried on between experienced parties well versed in property law. As Ralph Gibson LJ said in <i>J T Developments Ltd v Quinn</i> (1990) 62 P &amp; CR 33, 47, referring to <i>Attorney General of Hong Kong,</i></p>
<p class="qt">“In that case, there was express use of the phrase ‘subject to contract’ and its effect was fully understood by both sides. In this case there were no such words. The right, however, not to proceed with negotiations for the contract exists independently of the use of that phrase, which is required, normally, in circumstances where an express agreement in writing is apparently reached which would constitute an enforceable agreement but for the use of that phrase.”</p>
