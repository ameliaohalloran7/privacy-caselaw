<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went on to refer in paragraph 63 to the extent to which the restrictions enabled the persons affected to "lead a 'normal' life".  Again, he stated at paragraph 77:</p>
<p></p><ul>"77 In accordance with the principles established in <i>Guzzardi</i>, I have considered the cumulative impact of the obligations and therefore the extent to which they restrict the respondents' liberty in the six hours when they are allowed out of their residences, as well as the effect of the 18-hour curfew and the obligations imposed on the respondents whilst they have to remain within their residences during that period.  If I had to assess the impact of the obligations individually, I would consider that house arrest for 18 hours each day, even if it was the only obligation (apart from obligations such as reporting and tagging to ensure that it was strictly observed) would be more realistically described as a deprivation of liberty, and not as a restriction on liberty, if it prevented the individual from pursuing a normal "in at home/out at work" life cycle: cf <i>Trijonis</i>."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73.&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me abundantly clear that Sullivan J's view of the case was governed by his comparison of the life led by the respondents in the case before him with a normal life.  In this I consider that he was wrong.  I think that the Court of Appeal also failed to consider the correct factors in upholding Sullivan J's judgment, as appears from paragraph 14 of its judgment, where it refers with apparent approval to his consideration of "the extent to which restrictions would prevent an individual from pursuing the life of his choice, whatever that choice might be."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although many decisions of the European Court of Human Rights and the Commission were cited to your Lordships, the only one which contained any sustained discussion of the governing principle was <i>Guzzardi v Italy </i>(1980) 3 EHRR 333.  It was analysed repeatedly in counsel's written submission and oral arguments, and your Lordships have all commented on it in greater or lesser detail.  The principles discussed in it have been repeated and applied in subsequent Strasbourg cases, and the decision itself has been distinguished in several, but without critical analysis, and I think it of assistance now to make a further examination of the terms of the judgments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Guzzardi, as your Lordships have rehearsed, who was suspected (and later convicted) of serious Mafia-linked crimes, was, instead of being remanded in custody, sent to live under "special supervision" on a portion of the small island of Asinara off Sardinia, most of which was occupied by a prison complex to which entry by persons under special supervision was forbidden.  They had to live in the small hamlet of Cala Reale in somewhat primitive accommodation.  They could not go to the neighbouring village of Cala d'Oliva and were effectively cut off from much human contact apart from persons in compulsory residence and those supervising them.  He was subject to a curfew between 10 pm and 7 am, and a number of restrictions were placed on his activities and association with other people.  The portion of the island to which he was confined, some 2.5 square kilometres in area, was described by Guzzardi himself as a <i>pezzo </i>or <i>pezzetto di terra </i>("a scrap of land") and he also described the island as a "veritable concentration camp".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court considered the issue whether the case fell within article 5 in paragraphs 92-95 of its judgment, much of which bears repetition in order to follow its reasoning:</p>
<p></p><ul>"92.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court recalls that in proclaiming the 'right to liberty', paragraph 1 of Article 5 is contemplating the physical liberty of the person; its aim is to ensure that no one should be dispossessed of this liberty in an arbitrary fashion.  As was pointed out by those appearing before the Court, the paragraph is not concerned with mere restrictions on liberty of movement; such restrictions are governed by Article 2 of Protocol No 4 which has not been ratified by Italy.  In order to determine whether someone has been 'deprived of his liberty' within the meaning of Article 5, the starting point must be his concrete situation and account must be taken of a whole range of criteria such as the type, duration, effects and manner of implementation of the measure in question.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>93. The difference between deprivation of and restriction upon liberty is nonetheless merely one of degree or intensity, and not one of nature or substance.  Although the process of classification into one or other of these categories sometimes proves to be no easy task in that some borderline cases are a matter of pure opinion, the Court cannot avoid making the selection upon which the applicability or inapplicability of Article 5 depends.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>94. As provided for under the 1956 Act (see paras 48-49 above), special supervision accompanied by an order for compulsory residence in a specified district does not of itself come within the scope of Article 5.  The Commission acknowledged this: it focused its attention on Mr Guzzardi's 'actual position' at Cala Reale (see paras 5, 94, 99, etc, of the report) and pointed out that on 5 October 1977 it had declared inadmissible application No 7960/77 lodged by the same individual with regard to his living conditions at Force.  It does not follow that 'deprivation of liberty' may never result from the manner of implementation of such a measure, and in the present case the manner of implementation is the sole issue that falls to be considered (see para 88 above).<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>95. The Government's reasoning (see para 91 above) is not without weight.  It demonstrates very clearly the extent of the difference between the applicant's treatment on Asinara and classic detention in prison or strict arrest imposed on a serviceman.  Deprivation of liberty may, however, take numerous other forms.  Their variety is being increased by developments in legal standards and in attitudes; and the Convention is to be interpreted in the light of the notions currently prevailing in democratic States.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Whilst the area around which the applicant could move far exceeded the dimensions of a cell and was not bounded by any physical barrier, it covered no more than a tiny fraction of an island to which access was difficult and about nine-tenths of which was occupied by a prison.  Mr Guzzardi was housed in part of the hamlet of Cala Reale which consisted mainly of the buildings of a former medical establishment which were in a state of disrepair or even dilapidation, a <i>carabinieri </i>station, a school and a chapel.  He lived there principally in the company of other persons subjected to the same measure and of policemen.  The permanent population of Asinara resided almost entirely at Cala d'Oliva, which Mr Guzzardi could not visit, and would appear to have made hardly any use of its right to go to Cala Reale.  Consequently, there were few opportunities for social contacts available to the applicant other than with his near family, his fellow 'residents' and the supervisory staff. Supervision was carried out strictly and on an almost constant basis.  Thus, Mr Guzzardi was not able to leave his dwelling between 10 pm and 7 am without giving prior notification to the authorities in due time.  He had to report to the authorities twice a day and inform them of the name and number of his correspondent whenever he wished to use the telephone.  He needed the consent of the authorities for each of his trips to Sardinia or the mainland, trips which were rare and, understandably, made under the strict supervision of the <i>carabinieri</i>.  He was liable to punishment by 'arrest' if he failed to comply with any of his obligations.  Finally, more than 16 months elapsed before his arrival at Cala Reale and his departure for Force (see paras 11, 12, 21, 23—42 and 51 above).<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>It is admittedly not possible to speak of 'deprivation of liberty' on the strength of any one of these factors taken individually, but cumulatively and in combination they certainly raise an issue of categorisation from the viewpoint of Article 5.  In certain respects the treatment complained of resembles detention in an 'open prison' or committal to a disciplinary unit …<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>The Court considers on balance that the present case is to be regarded as one involving deprivation of liberty."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reference to Force is to the fact that Guzzardi was transferred from Asinara to Force, which was a remote country district but did not have the unusual characteristics of Cala Reale on Asinara.  He again challenged the order requiring him to live there, but the Commission held in 1977 the application inadmissible.  The concluding phrase of paragraph 92, which is the sheet anchor of the appellant's contention that article 5 applies, comes directly from paragraph 59 of <i>Engel v The Netherlands (No 1) </i>(1976) 1 EHRR 647.  It is argued that it entitles the court to look at the conditions of life of the person the subject of the control order, and if the restrictions give rise to a sufficiently fundamental alteration of his lifestyle the case may come within article 5.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77.&nbsp;&nbsp;That this is a questionable assumption may be seen by comparing the dissenting opinion in <i>Guzzardi </i>of Judge Sir Gerald Fitzmaurice.  Judge Fitzmaurice came to the conclusion that article 5 did not apply, but it is apparent he regarded the question as one of degree, and in his judgment the restrictions did not amount to deprivation of Guzzardi's liberty.  In posing the issue whether Guzzardi's situation amounted to deprivation of liberty or was essentially in the nature of a restriction on freedom of movement and choice of residence, he stated in paragraph 5 of his judgment that this </p>
<p></p><ul>"must in the long run remain a matter of appreciation and opinion, namely whether the conditions of the applicant's existence on Asinara were sufficiently stringent to amount to a sort of imprisonment, even though a mild one as imprisonments go, or whether on the other hand, there was no more than a banishment accompanied by measures of confinement to house and grounds but, subject to that, without any restriction on movement within an area of at least a half-mile radius, or more according to some accounts.  This could be argued about endlessly and either view is reasonably maintainable - for the issue is essentially one of degree."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78.&nbsp;&nbsp;Judge Fitzmaurice went on to contrast article 5 with article 2(1) of Protocol No 4.  In paragraph 6 he drew certain deductions: </p>
<p></p><ul>"(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The existence of this provision [article 2 of Protocol No 4] shows either that those who originally framed the Convention on Human Rights did not contemplate that its Article 5 should go beyond preventing actual deprivation of liberty, or to extend to mere restrictions on freedom of movement or choice of residence; or else that the Governments of the Council of Europe did not see Article 5 as covering measures of 'deprivation of liberty' where the basic character of those measures consisted primarily of restrictions on movement and place of residence, or they would not have considered it necessary to draw up a separate Protocol about that.  The resulting picture is that Article 5 of the Convention guaranteed the individual against illegitimate imprisonment, or confinement so close as to amount to the same thing—in sum against deprivation of liberty <i>stricto sensu</i>—but it afforded no guarantee against restrictions (on movement or place of residence) falling short of that.  The latter was effected only by the Protocol, so that in those countries (of which Italy is one) that have not ratified it, such restrictions are not prohibited.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows that if Article 5 of the Convention is not to impinge on ground intended to be covered by Article 2 of the Protocol, and is not to do double duty with the latter, it (Art. 5) must be interpreted strictly and regarded as limited to cases of actual imprisonment or to detention close and strict enough to approximate to a virtually complete deprivation of liberty.  This was certainly not the situation in regard to the applicant in the present case.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;If Article 5 of the Convention were to be interpreted so widely as to include instances of what was basically restriction on freedom of movement or choice of residence, then not only would Article 2 of the Protocol be rendered otiose, but an indirect means would be afforded of making Governments subject to the obligations of the latter, despite the fact that they had not ratified the Protocol.  This could not have been intended, but it is a possibility that can only be avoided by a strict interpretation of Article 5 that confines it to its proper sphere."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so defining deprivation of liberty for the purposes of article 5 I do not understand Judge Fitzmaurice to have been taking issue with the majority of the court on the principles to be applied; rather he differed from them on the application to the instant case of those principles.  What he stated seems to me to be consistent with a proper interpretation of the majority judgment and to furnish a clear analysis of the ambit of the article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79.&nbsp;&nbsp;The key in both judgments to the meaning of deprivation of liberty is, I think, to be found in the majority's comparison of Guzzardi's situation with detention in an open prison or committal to a disciplinary unit and in Judge Fitzmaurice's phrase "illegitimate imprisonment, or confinement so close as to amount to the same thing".  It was in this context that the court referred to taking account of "a whole range of criteria such as the type, duration, effects and manner of implementation of the measure in question."  In saying this the court was in my view doing no more than recognising that the situations in which a person may be confined or restricted may vary in many ways from the archetypical case of imprisonment in a cell, but still amount to deprivation of liberty.  To take the phrase out its context and use it to reach the conclusion that a variety of restrictions which prevent the person from enjoying a normal life is not in my opinion legitimate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Guzzardi </i>has been applied or distinguished in a number of later cases before the ECtHR or the Commission, but, as I have said, in none of them is there any analysis which would give real assistance in determining the proper ambit of deprivation of liberty.  In one line of house arrest cases, represented by <i>NC v Italy </i>(11 January 2001), <i>Mancini v Italy </i>(12 December 2001), <i>Vachev v Bulgaria </i>(8 October 2004), <i>Nikolova (No 2) v Bulgaria </i>(30 December 2004) and <i>Pekov v Bulgaria </i>(30 June 2006), it was held that confinement to the subject's house constituted a deprivation of liberty.  It did not matter that the supervision of the confinement may have been so lax, as was claimed in <i>Pekov v Bulgaria, </i>that the applicant could in fact leave his house with impunity.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side of the line were a series of cases of compulsory residence imposed by orders made by the Italian Government, in each of which the Commission or the Court rejected the complaints: <i>Ciancimino v Italy </i>(1991) 70 D &amp; R 103, <i>Raimondo v Italy </i>(1994) 18 EHRR 237 and <i>Labita v Italy </i>(6 April 2000).  In these cases the Strasbourg organs looked at the restrictions, contrasted them with those in <i>Guzzardi, </i>and concluded that they did not amount to deprivation of liberty.  In <i>Labita's </i>case the applicant did not allege a breach of article 5(1), and the Grand Chamber concentrated on article 2 of Protocol No 4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82.&nbsp;&nbsp;A case on which counsel for the Secretary of State placed some reliance was <i>Trijonis v Lithuania </i>(17 March 2005).  The applicant was permitted to attend his place of work during the week, but was subject on those days to a curfew between 7 pm and 7 am, while he was obliged to remain in his house during the whole of each week-end.  The Court briefly contrasted the case with that of <i>Guzzardi </i>and held that there was not a deprivation of liberty, going on to consider article 2 of Protocol No 4. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to my mind notable that the assiduity of counsel has not brought before the House any case in which the ECtHR has held on facts at all comparable with those of the present appeals that there was a deprivation of liberty.  If nothing more, this should make your Lordships feel the need to exercise some caution lest they depart from the current of the Strasbourg case-law: see <i>R (Ullah) v Special Adjudicator </i>[2004] 2 AC 323, 350, para 20, per Lord Bingham of Cornhill.  Similar caution is required in recourse to the facts of individual Strasbourg cases and their use as factual precedents (<i>R (Gillan) v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis </i>[2006] 2 AC 307, 342, para 23, per Lord Bingham of Cornhill), a tendency which does appear in the judgments of the courts below in these appeals.  In the absence of any subsequent exposition of principle in the case-law, <i>Guzzardi's </i>case remains the fount<i>, </i>and for the reasons I have given I do not think that it supports the conclusions which have been drawn from it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84.&nbsp;&nbsp;I accordingly consider that Sullivan J and the Court of Appeal in <i>JJ and others </i>did not approach the meaning of deprivation of liberty in the proper fashion, and I would allow the appeal of the Secretary of State in these cases.  I am conscious of the concern which some of your Lordships have felt about the effect of a curfew as long as 18 hours per day, and I would not dismiss that concern lightly.  I conclude, however, that on balance even that very long curfew does not take the cases of JJ and others over the line of deprivation of liberty.  I am not disposed to enter into discussion of the length of time which would take a case over that line.  A great deal depends on the overall factual matrix of any given case.  Moreover, I feel that the House ought to focus more on the principles to be followed than in giving detailed directions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85.&nbsp;&nbsp;These conclusions make it unnecessary to decide on the question of remedy, but since the issue was fully argued before the House I should perhaps express a very brief view on it.  The court is empowered by section 3(12) of the 2005 Act to quash one or more of the obligations imposed by the Secretary of State's order.  The detailed nature of the obligations in a typical control order may be seen from the summary of the order made in respect of LL contained in paragraph 33 of Lord Hoffmann's opinion.  I incline to the view that the power to quash obligations is intended to cover a case where the court takes the view that the control order is justified but one of the fairly peripheral obligations is not, eg if one of the 5 individuals named in the non-association obligation numbered (7) in LL's case was wrongly included.  If, however, the court applying the proper test concludes that the control order constitutes a deprivation of liberty because it is in essence comparable to imprisonment, then I would agree with the conclusion reached by Lord Bingham that it can and should quash the order, leaving the Secretary of State to reconsider the case. </p>
<p><b>LORD BROWN OF EATON-UNDER-HEYWOOD</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86.&nbsp;&nbsp;Control orders are highly contentious.  Many think them essential as a means of providing some protection at least against suspected terrorists, the very minimum which government should do in fulfilment of its undoubted obligation to safeguard public security.  Others abhor the whole notion of preventive action against people not even to be charged with a criminal offence and question whether the control order regime, like internment in the past, does not create more terrorists than it disables.  That, however, is a debate for the House in its legislative capacity, not for your Lordships in the Appellate Committee.   Rather your Lordships have to decide certain very different questions as to the legality of the control order regime, and in particular its compatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87.&nbsp;&nbsp;Between them the four appeals now before the House raise a number of different issues: see <i>Secretary of State for the Home Department v JJ and others </i>[2007] UKHL 45, <i>Secretary of State for the Home Department v MB; Secretaryof State for the Home Department v AF </i>[2007] UKHL 46 and <i>Secretary of State for the Home Department v E and another </i>[2007] UKHL 47. Paramount amongst them, however, and lying at the very heart of this (the <i>JJ</i>) appeal, is the contention that control orders which impose, as these six control orders did, eighteen hour curfews necessarily involve a deprivation of liberty contrary to article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights (the Convention).  That contention succeeded before the Court of Appeal (Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers CJ, Sir Anthony Clarke MR and Sir Igor Judge P) [2007] QB 446.  The Secretary of State now appeals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88.&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts of the appeal I gratefully take from the judgment below.  Each of the respondents is a single man.  Five are Iraqi nationals who have claimed asylum.  They were arrested under the Terrorism Act 2000, released without charge, and then re-detained under immigration powers on notice of intention to deport on national security grounds.  There is a dispute as to whether the sixth, LL, (who has since absconded and is now believed to be overseas) is an Iranian or an Iraqi national.  He too was detained pending deportation on national security grounds.  All deportation proceedings were discontinued on the making of the control orders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89.&nbsp;&nbsp;The obligations imposed by the control orders are essentially identical in all six cases.  Each respondent is required to remain within his "residence" at all times, save for a period of six hours between 10 am and 4 pm.  In the case of GG the specified residence is a one-bedroom flat provided by the local authority in which he lived before his detention.  In the case of the other five respondents the specified residences are 1-bedroom flats provided by the National Asylum Support Service.  During the curfew period the respondents are confined in their small flats and are not even allowed into the common parts of the buildings in which these flats are situated.  Visitors must be authorised by the Home Office, to which name, address, date of birth and photographic identity must be supplied.  The residences are subject to spot searches by the police.  During the six hours when they are permitted to leave their residences, the respondents are confined to restricted urban areas, the largest of which is 72 square kilometres.  These deliberately do not extend, save in the case of GG, to any area in which they lived before.  Each area contains a mosque, a hospital, primary healthcare facilities, shops and entertainment and sporting facilities.  The respondents are prohibited from meeting anyone by pre-arrangement who has not been given the same Home Office clearance as a visitor to the residence. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Strasbourg jurisprudence makes plain that the article 5 concept of deprivation of liberty is autonomous and that the court's task in cases like this is to decide whether the restrictions in question amount to a deprivation of liberty within article 5 or merely to a restriction upon liberty of movement within article 2 of Protocol No 4 (a Protocol not in fact ratified by the UK).  Deprivation of liberty can only ever be justified if brought within one of paragraphs (a)-(f) of article 5(1)—none of which are available in the present type of case notwithstanding that the judge may well conclude both that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting the person concerned to be or have been involved in terrorist-related activity and that it is necessary to make this restrictive a control order to protect the public from a risk of terrorism.  Restriction of movement, on the other hand, can be justified in the public interest under article 2(4) of Protocol No 4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91.&nbsp;&nbsp;That, then, is the Court's task: to decide into which category the case falls and, as was made plain by the ECtHR in <i>Guzzardi v Italy</i> (1980)  3 EHRR 333—still the leading Strasbourg authority on the point—the distinction between the two categories is one of degree or intensity, not of kind:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The difference between deprivation of and restriction upon liberty is nonetheless merely one of degree or intensity, and not one of nature or substance.  Although the process of classification into one or other of these categories sometimes proves to be no easy task in that some borderline cases are a matter of pure opinion, the Court cannot avoid making the selection upon which the applicability or inapplicability of article 5 depends." (Para 93).<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal (agreeing with Sullivan J at first instance) concluded that "the facts of this case fall clearly on the wrong side of the dividing line".  Was the Court of Appeal right in that conclusion?  That is the critical question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before seeking further assistance from <i>Guzzardi, </i>it is worth noting one earlier Strasbourg authority, <i>Engel v The Netherlands (No 1)</i> (1976)  1 EHRR 647.   <i>Engel</i> was concerned with disciplinary measures against members of the armed forces and considered four measures in particular: in ascending order of severity, (a) light arrest involving confinement to military buildings or premises or the serviceman's dwelling during off-duty hours, (b) aggravated arrest involving the serviceman spending his off-duty hours in a specially designated place and being unable to visit the canteen, cinema or recreation rooms, (c) strict arrest during which the serviceman was locked in a cell both by day and by night for up to 14 days and so unable to perform his normal duties, and (d) committal to a disciplinary unit unable to leave for upwards of a month.  Only (c) and (d) were held to involve the deprivation of liberty.  The Court said that article 5 "is contemplating individual liberty in its classic sense, that is to say the physical liberty of the person.  Its aim is to ensure that no one should be dispossessed of this liberty in an arbitrary fashion."  Because, however, of "the specific demands of military service", the Court held that:</p>
<p></p><ul>"the bounds that article 5 requires the state not to exceed are not identical for servicemen and civilians.  A disciplinary penalty or measure which on analysis would unquestionably be deemed a deprivation of liberty were it to be applied to a civilian may not possess this characteristic when imposed upon a serviceman."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears to follow that the Court contemplated that the imposition of measures akin to (a) or (b) upon a civilian might well constitute a deprivation of liberty although account would always have to be taken of "a whole range of factors such as the nature, duration, effects and manner of execution of the penalty or measure in question."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Guzzardi</i> concerned the confinement of a Mafia suspect for over 16 months within a 2.5 square kilometre area (a corner of Asinara island) reserved for persons in compulsory residence, subject to a nine hour (10 pm to 7 am) curfew and almost permanent supervision and with only limited opportunities for social contact.  Concluding "on balance" by a majority of eleven to seven that Mr Guzzardi was deprived of his liberty, the Court said (para 95):</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is admittedly not possible to speak of 'deprivation of liberty' on the strength of any one of these factors [the constricting circumstances of his confinement] taken individually, but cumulatively and in combination they certainly raise an issue of categorisation from the viewpoint of article 5.  In certain respects the treatment complained of resembles detention in an 'open prison' or committal to a disciplinary unit."<p></p></ul>
