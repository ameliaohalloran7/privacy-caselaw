<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81. Notice of the devolution issues was given before the trial in those cases because this is what the rules of procedure that are in force in that jurisdiction require.  It will be recalled that in <i>Martin v Tauranga District Court</i> [1995]  2 NZLR 419,432 Hardie Boys J said that a person should not be entitled to plead undue delay unless he has taken such earlier opportunity as there may have been to protest at the delay up to that point.  That is the approach which the procedure in Scotland has adopted.  It enables the prosecutor's proposed act in taking the case to trial to be scrutinised at that stage.  Rule 40.2 of the Act of Adjournal (Criminal Procedure) Rules 1996 (SI 1996/513), which was inserted by the Act of Adjournal (Devolution Issues Rules) (SI 1999/1346), provides that where a party to proceedings on indictment proposes to raise a devolution issue, he shall give written notice of his intention to the clerk of court within seven days of service of the indictment.  Rule 40.5(1) provides that no party to proceedings shall raise a devolution issue except in accordance with rule 40.2 unless the court, on cause shown, so determines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82. It was suggested in the course of the argument, on the view that a reduction in sentence would be the ordinary remedy, that the question of an unreasonable delay need not be considered until after conviction and before sentence.  That does not seem to me, with respect, to be a satisfactory solution.  The prosecutor ought to be given notice of this complaint so that he can reply to it.  There is no foregone conclusion in these cases.  The public interest requires that an appropriate sentence ought not to be reduced unless a good reason for this has been demonstrated.  It may become clear, when the reason for the passage of time is explained, that the delay was not after all unreasonable.  Adjournment of the proceedings between conviction and sentence so that this matter, of which the prosecutor had no previous notice, can be investigated and then debated is not an attractive prospect.  It would be a matter for regret if it were to be assumed from the result of this case that the complaint of an unreasonable delay in the determination of the charge, however obvious it was before the trial that there were good grounds for saying that the delay between the charge and its determination was unreasonable, need not be made until the trial is over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83. The calculations that were done in <i>Dyer v Watson</i> [2002]  3 WLR 1488 show that where the point is taken in advance of the trial, as the rules which are in force in Scotland require, attention is likely to concentrate in most, if not all cases, on the period between the date when the defendant was charged and the date when he can expect to be brought to trial: see also <i>H M Advocate v Shell UK Ltd</i> 2003  SLT 1296, 1298K.  The date of the charge lies in the past.  The date of the trial, when the charge will be determined, lies in the future.  The act of bringing the defendant to trial where there is undue delay is clearly a proposed act.  The Human Rights Act enables one to say that the proposed act of bringing the defendant to trial after an unreasonable time has elapsed is "unlawful", and then to provide a just and appropriate remedy.</p>
<p>Does the Convention right have to be emasculated?</p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84. In paragraph 22 of his judgment Lord Bingham observes that a rule of automatic termination on proof of a breach of the reasonable time requirement has been shown to have the effect in practice of emasculating the right which the guarantee is designed to protect.  I am not persuaded that this is a point of real concern, given that the right of individual application to the European Court under article 34 has not been taken away by the Human Rights Act.  If the domestic courts are tempted to set the threshold unacceptably high, the victim will have his remedy in Strasbourg.  The aim of bringing rights home will have fallen short of fulfilment, but that is all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85. Nor am I convinced that the concerns expressed by Professor Amsterdam in "Speedy Criminal Trial: Rights and Remedies" (1975) 27 Stan L Rev 525 about the American experience are an accurate reflection of the result which would be likely to follow if a stay were to be regarded in this country as, if not the rule, the normal or standard remedy.  One ought not to overlook the benefits of taking a firm line on the elimination of delays in the criminal justice system.  Of course, the prospect of releasing dangerous criminals on the public is unattractive.  But so too is the prospect of long delays in bringing those who are accused of crimes to trial, bearing in mind the presumption of innocence which is guaranteed by article 6(2) of the Convention.  The decision of the Court of Appeal in New Zealand in <i>Martin v Tauranga District Court</i> [1995]  2 NZLR 419 that a stay of proceedings was the appropriate remedy in the event of undue delay is thought to have had a salutary effect on the criminal justice system in that country.  The benefits of a strict approach to the prevention of delay in bringing accused persons to trial have for a long time been recognised in Scotland.  For an example of how strict this approach is in cases where the accused has been detained in custody reference may be made to <i>Beattie (WJ) v H M Advocate</i> 1995  JC 186 where the court refused to extend the 110 day period.  As already noted, some changes to the present system are now being considered by the Scottish Parliament in the Criminal Procedure (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill following a report by Lord Bonomy: <i>The 2002 Review of the Practices and Procedures of the High Court of Justiciary </i>(2002) (see recommendations 11(a) - (g), pp 119-120).  But the fundamental principles are to remain unchanged, and there is to be no change at all to the 12 months rule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86. That all having been said, the problem to which this part of the majority's opinion is directed disappears once it is recognised that section 8(1) of the Human Rights Act gives the court a discretion to choose the remedy for an unlawful act by the prosecutor which it considers just and appropriate.  So long as the court recognises that there has been, or will be, an act which is incompatible with a Convention right and is performing its function of providing a remedy for the incompatibility it will, for its own part, be complying with or giving effect to the Convention.  The court itself will therefore be acting lawfully.  This problem does not provide a sound reason for rejecting the proposition that any further prosecution of the charge must be held to be unlawful within the meaning of section 6(1) of the Act.</p>
<p>The remedy in civil proceedings</p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87. As Lord Bingham has pointed out in paragraph 21 of his judgment, a rule of automatic termination of proceedings in the event of a breach of the reasonable time requirement cannot sensibly be applied in civil proceedings.  He gives this as another reason for rejecting the proposition that any further prosecution or trial of a criminal charge must be unlawful within the meaning of section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act: see paragraph 20.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88. Of course, the prospect of an automatic termination for breach of the reasonable time requirement cannot sensibly be applied in civil proceedings.  <i>Newman Shopfitters Ltd v M J Gleeson Group</i> <i>Plc</i> 2003  SLT (Sh Ct) 83, provides an example of a case where a termination of the proceedings was thought to be appropriate.  That was a case where the pursuer had delayed unreasonably in the conduct of proceedings for the giving of effect to an arbitration clause. But it has never been part of the argument in favour of the approach which I would adopt to the analysis of this Convention right that this must happen.  In <i>H M Advocate v R </i>[2003]  2 WLR 317, 337, para 57 I said that it was important to start with domestic law when one is considering the question of remedy.  I suggested that the proper approach would be first to identify the remedy which would ordinarily be thought to be appropriate in domestic law for a breach of the kind that has taken place, and then to consider whether the remedy which has thus been selected would achieve just satisfaction for the breach as indicated by the jurisprudence of the European Court.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89. If that approach is adopted, the problem that has been suggested disappears.  It would hardly ever be thought appropriate for civil proceedings to be terminated under our domestic system because of an unreasonable delay on the part of a public authority in the determination of the parties' civil rights and obligations.  In practice an attempt by one party to have the proceedings terminated on this ground would almost always be rejected.  The appropriate time to seek a remedy for the delay would be at the end, when the proceedings were all over: see, for example, <i>Porter v Magill</i> [2002]  2 AC 357.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90. But there is no reason why the issue of delay should not be raised prior to the determination of the issue between the parties in a civil case.  If that were to be done, the appropriate remedy under section 8(1) would be to take steps to accelerate its determination.  Sound practice suggests that this point should be taken as soon as it was apparent that the determination was being delayed unreasonably.  But if a remedy by way of acceleration is to be given under section 8(1) it would be necessary first to find that the proposed act of the public authority in continuing to delay the proceedings was "unlawful" within the meaning of section 6(1) of the Act.  It is not obvious how a finding to that effect could be made on the approach favoured by the majority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91. It is worth bearing in mind too that in the context of civil proceedings acts which are incompatible with the reasonable time guarantee may be committed by a public authority other than the court or tribunal which is to try the case.  In <i>H v France</i> (1989)  12 EHRR 74 at least part of the delay in the resolution of the applicant's civil action of damages was due to a failure in the provision of a medical report by the state authorities.  It is not beyond the stretch of imagination that a case could arise where delay had not yet occurred but the complaint was that a public authority, other than the court, was proposing to act in a way that was incompatible with the reasonable time guarantee.  It ought not to be assumed that the cases in which this issue is raised before the determination in a civil case will always be cases where a breach has already taken place.  The great advantage of making the Convention rights part of domestic law is that these matters can now be dealt with prospectively within the domestic legal system.  The approach taken by the majority, which seems to assume that breaches of the reasonable time guarantee can only be dealt with retrospectively, risks impeding the flexibility that the court needs to deal with breaches of this guarantee which may lie in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92. Here again the problem to which this part of the majority's opinion is directed disappears once it is recognised that section 8(1) of the Human Rights Act gives the court a discretion to choose the remedy for the unlawful act which it considers just and appropriate.  This too is not a sound reason for rejecting the proposition that any further prosecution or trial of a criminal charge must be unlawful within the meaning of section 6(1) of the Act.</p>
<p>The reasonable time requirement: can there be a continuing violation?</p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93. Lord Bingham states in paragraph 20 of his judgment that the right of a criminal defendant is to a hearing, and that article 6(1) requires that hearing to have certain characteristics.  It would, I think, be more accurate to say that the right of a criminal defendant is to a <i>determination</i> of the charge against him at a hearing <i>which</i> has all the characteristics which are set out in the article.  One of these characteristics is that the hearing is within a reasonable time.  The article does not say that the defendant has a right to a hearing which can be asserted against him, come what may and however long it takes.  The whole point of the argument in <i>Montgomery v H M Advocate</i> [2003]  1 AC 641, was that the risk that there could not ever be a fair trial, due to the adverse publicity, was so serious that the trial should not go ahead.  There is nothing in article 6(1) that drives one to the conclusion that it would be anomalous for the right to a hearing within a reasonable time to be vindicated by ordering that there be no trial at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94. The jurisprudence of the European Court tells us that this part of the article seeks to ensure that the fate of those who are accused of crime is determined within a reasonable time.  They should not be held too long in a state of uncertainty, with all the consequences for themselves and their families that this involves.  They should certainly not be held in that state indefinitely.  It would be entirely consistent with this rationale to hold that the stage may indeed ultimately be reached where the defendant, who is entitled under article 6(2) to be presumed innocent until proved guilty, should be released from the charge altogether.  Indeed one of the great evils which the framers of the Convention may be thought to have had in mind is the holding of the threat of criminal proceedings over the head of the victim indefinitely to his severe prejudice without ever bringing him to trial.  Let us hope that this evil, familiar in totalitarian regimes, never raises its ugly head in our country.  But its absence from our culture should not blind us to the effect of the decision of the majority.  It is to deprive the victim of the protection of being able to establish that the time has come for him to be released from the charge, irrespective of whether or not he can show that he cannot have a fair trial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95. It is true that the various characteristics which the hearing must have are separate and distinct, and that the reasonable time guarantee differs from other rights which are guaranteed by this part of article 6(1), in that once it is clear that there will be an undue delay in the determination of the criminal charge this is something that cannot be cured.  As I said in <i>Porter v Magill</i> [2002]  2 AC 357, 489, 496, paras 87 and 108, the fact that these rights are separate and distinct means that a complaint that one of these rights has been breached cannot be cured by showing that the other rights have not been breached.  So it is no answer to a complaint that the tribunal is not independent and impartial that the hearing took place in public and within a reasonable time.  So too it is no answer to a complaint that the hearing took place after an undue delay that it was in public and before an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96. What then is one to make of the proposition that, unlike other rights guaranteed by this part of the article, a breach which is identified before the hearing takes place cannot be cured?  I do not think that it would be right to say that a cure will always be possible if there is a breach of the other rights.  The facts in <i>Montgomery v H M </i>Advocate [2003]  1 AC 641 suggest that it would be unwise to lay down an absolute rule on this point.  But it is true, as Lord Bingham has said in paragraph 20 of his judgment, that time once spent cannot be recovered.  In the case of the other rights, a breach which is identified before the hearing takes place may be capable of being cured by ordering that the hearing must be in public, that the composition of the tribunal must be changed or that the perceived unfairness in the hearing must be eliminated in the way the trial is conducted or before it takes place.  In each of these cases, it is the proposed act in proceeding to a hearing which has the prohibited characteristics that is in issue.  In terms of section 7(1) of the Human Rights Act, the claim made in the proceedings against the authority is that it is proposing to act in a way which is made unlawful by section 6(1) and that the person making the claim would be a victim of that proposed act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97. The position where the complaint is that there will be a breach of the reasonable time guarantee is different only in the respect that the proposed breach cannot be cured.  Here too the breach can be identified before the hearing takes place, and it is the proposed act in proceeding to a hearing after an unreasonable time has elapsed that is in issue.  In <i>H M Advocate v R </i>[2003]  2 WLR 317, 359, para 125 as Lord Rodger of Earlsferry pointed out what the appellant was attacking was the Lord Advocate's positive act in<i> </i>continuing with the prosecution of the charges in a situation where it was clear that they could not be determined within a reasonable time.  That, in practice, is how under the devolution rules the argument in these cases is always formulated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98. As for the position under the Human Rights Act, Lord Bingham says in paragraph 24, and I agree, that if a criminal charge is not determined at a hearing within a reasonable time there is necessarily a breach of article 6(1).  As there is necessarily an incompatibility, this means that the act of the prosecutor in proceeding with the trial after the lapse of a reasonable time was "unlawful" within the meaning of section 6(1) of the Act.  It is that conclusion that, in the domestic system, opens the door under section 8(1) of the Act to a just and appropriate remedy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99. But I do not follow his assertion that the prosecutor does not act incompatibly with the Convention right in continuing to prosecute if, as he puts it, "a breach is established" before the hearing.  His point is that the breach consists in the delay which has occurred and not in the prospective hearing.  That seems to me, with respect, to ignore the fact that article 6(1) attaches the reasonable time guarantee, along with all the other guarantees that are set out in that part of the article, to the hearing at which the criminal charge is to be determined.  A breach of this guarantee cannot be detached from the hearing in the way that is being suggested.  The period of time that has to be considered in terms of the article is the period between the charge and its determination.  Incidental delays are not relevant unless they will result in the determination of the charge after a reasonable time.  The question is whether the overall lapse of time has crossed the threshold of showing that the guarantee has been breached: see <i>Haston v H M Advocate</i>, 2003 GWD-959, 15 October 2003, para 17.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100. In paragraph 25 of his judgment Lord Bingham accepts, as I do too, that there may be exceptional cases where it can be asserted before the trial takes place that it would be unfair for the proceedings to continue.  That is not, it must be emphasised, because there cannot be a fair trial.  It is because the guarantee of a trial within a reasonable time will be breached in a way that is seen to be unfair.  But in that event the court will only be able to proceed to give a remedy under section 8(1) of the Act by making a finding that the prosecutor's proposed act in proceeding to the trial is "unlawful" within the meaning of section 6(1).  I consider that it would be open to the court to make such a finding, because the <i>determination</i> of the charge must have <i>all</i> the article 6(1) characteristics if it is to be compatible with that article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101. The approach which I would take is illustrated by a decision of the Divisional Court, in which judgment was given after the hearing of this appeal.  In <i>R (Lloyd) v Bow Street Magistrates Court</i> [2003]  EWHC 2294 (Admin), 8 October 2003, the Divisional Court addressed the question whether the reasonable time guarantee was capable of being violated where delay occurs in the initiation or prosecution of proceedings to commit a defendant to prison in default of payment of a sum due under a compensation order.  Having answered that question in the affirmative, the court then turned to the question of remedy.  Taking what I would respectfully regard as the correct approach to this issue, Dyson LJ said that the only proper remedy in that case was to order that the proceedings to commit the defendant to prison be stayed: paragraph 34.  It was not suggested that a fair hearing was no longer possible or that the basic fairness of the hearing itself was tainted in any way.  The critical factor was the length of delay and its consequences for the defendant, as five years had elapsed since he was released from custody.  He had resumed work and his family life.  It would have been inhuman to subject him to a further term of imprisonment for the original offence.</p>
<p>The effect of the decision on H M Advocate v R</p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102. As I said as the outset, and Lord Bingham has noted in his speech, the House is not in a position to overrule <i>H M Advocate v R</i> [2003]  2 WLR 317: see section 103 of the Scotland Act 1998.  A provision in the same terms is set out in section 82 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 and Schedule 8, para 32(b) of the Government of Wales Act 1998.  These provisions are an essential part of the system of devolved government.  Among the wide range of questions which may come before the Judicial Committee are questions as to whether legislative measures are within the competence of the devolved legislatures and as to whether acts or proposed acts of ministers, including the Lord Advocate, are within their devolved competence.  The final decision on all these questions has been entrusted to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103. It would, of course, be open to the Judicial Committee, appropriately constituted, to overrule its own decision.  But there are reasons for thinking that it ought to be cautious before doing so.  Lord Bonomy has drawn attention to this problem in his Report: see <i>The 2002 Review of the Practices and Procedures of the High Court of Justiciary</i>, pp 107-109, paras 17.3-17.9.  In paragraph 17.9 he states:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is ironic that pre-devolution the High Court was the final arbiter in all matters of criminal procedure and evidence, and was entrusted with the responsibility of ensuring that our criminal practice was in keeping with our obligations in international law, but in post-devolution Scotland the High Court has had to cede that role to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council when, but only when, an act of the Lord Advocate is involved.  Should a similar point arise in relation to the conduct of the court itself or any other public authority, the final say reverts to the High Court."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104. The fact that finality in all matters other than acts or failures to act of the prosecutor rests with the High Court of Justiciary indicates that, where the conduct of the court itself is in issue, it is in a position to make up its own mind as to how the reasonable time guarantee should be interpreted and given effect in the criminal courts in Scotland.  It will be for the judges of that court to decide whether they can accept the decision of the majority in this case or whether they would prefer to follow the views of the majority in <i>H M Advocate v R</i> [2003]  2 WLR 317, as amplified by the views which I and my noble and learned friend Lord Rodger of Earlsferry have expressed in this case.  They are, of course, bound by decisions of the Judicial Committee as to how devolution issues are to be disposed of.  But the definition of the expression "devolution issue" in paragraph 1 of Schedule 6 to the Scotland Act 1998 does not extend to acts of the court itself or those of other public authorities other than members of the Scottish Executive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105. A declaration by your Lordships that <i>H M Advocate v R</i> should not be followed in this jurisdiction may be thought to be inevitable in view of the conclusion reached by the majority.  But a declaration that that case was wrongly decided, as Lord Nicholls would have it, is undesirable.  Section 103 of the Scotland Act 1998 provides that any decision of the Judicial Committee shall be binding in all legal proceedings (other than proceedings before the Committee).  And there is no appeal to this House from decisions of the High Court of Justiciary in cases decided by that court under the Human Rights Act 1998.  So it is open to the Scottish courts to go their own way on this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106. The rule that the jurisdiction of the Scottish courts is separate from that in England and Wales has always been regarded in Scotland as an important part of the constitution of the United Kingdom.  The provisions of the Scotland Act 1998 were designed to protect this rule.  The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council forms part of the Scottish legal system when it is exercising its jurisdiction in a Scottish case under Schedule 6 to the Scotland Act: <i>Montgomery v H M Advocate</i> [2003]  1 AC 641,654G.  The jurisdiction which it was exercising in <i>R</i>'s case was as much part of the Scottish system as it would have been had the case<i> </i>been a Scottish appeal brought to this House under section 40 of the Court of Session Act 1988.  In <i>Glasgow Corpn v Central Land Board</i>, 1956  SC (HL) 1, which was heard before the <i>Practice Statement (Judicial Precedent)</i> [1966]  1 WLR 1234 made it possible for it to depart from its previous decisions, the House was faced with the question whether it was obliged to follow its own decision in <i>Duncan v Cammell, Laird &amp; Co Ltd </i> [1942]  AC 624 when it was considering the question whether the Scottish courts had power to override a public interest objection by the Secretary of State where documents in the possession of a government department were sought to be recovered by a litigant.  Viscount Simonds said at pp 9-10:</p>
<p></p><ul>"At once it must be said that that decision was given upon an English appeal, in which the law of Scotland was not directly under review, that the common law of Scotland differs from that of England in regard to the liability of the Crown to be sued and has developed independently in regard to the right of discovery or recovery of documents in possession of the Crown, and that, desirable though it may be that in matters of constitutional importance the law of the two countries should not differ, yet it would be clearly improper for this House to treat the law of Scotland as finally determined by a decision upon an English appeal unless the case arose upon the interpretation of a statute common to both countries."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107. The law of Scotland is not directly under review in this case.  Moreover, questions arose in <i>H M Advocate</i> <i>v R  </i>[2003]  2 WLR 317 about the interpretation of the Scotland Act and aspects of Scottish criminal practice which are not common to the two countries.  I would have much preferred it if your Lordships had felt able to arrive at a decision in this English appeal which could be reconciled with that of the Judicial Committee in <i>R</i>'s case.  But it does not follow from the fact that this has not been possible that <i>R </i>should not be followed in Scotland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108. A divergence of view between the two jurisdictions about the meaning of the reasonable time guarantee, as there is at present, is unfortunate but it may have to be accepted as inevitable.  The last word as to its meaning must, of course, lie with Strasbourg.  The doors of that court remain open to those who believe that, as a result of the decision in this case, they have not been provided in this jurisdiction with an effective domestic remedy.</p>
<p><i>Conclusion</i></p>
