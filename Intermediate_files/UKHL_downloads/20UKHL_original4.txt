<p class="para">82.&nbsp;&nbsp;These comments were made in relation to duty of care in tort. In <i>Banque Bruxelles Lambert SA v Eagle Star Insurance Co Ltd </i>(sub nom<i> South Australia Asset Management Corpn v York Montague Ltd</i>)<i> </i>[1997] AC 191 Lord Hoffmann held that precisely the same reasoning applied to a duty of care in contract. He said at p. 211:</p>
<p class="qt">“A duty of care such as the valuer owes does not however exist in the abstract. A plaintiff who sues for breach of a duty imposed by the law (whether in contract or tort or under statute) must do more than prove that the defendant has failed to comply. He must show that the duty was owed to him and that it was a duty in respect of the kind of loss which he has suffered. Both of these requirements are illustrated by <i>Caparo Industries plc. v. Dickman</i> [1990] 2 A.C. 605. The auditors’ failure to use reasonable care in auditing the company’s statutory accounts was a breach of their duty of care. But they were not liable to an outside take-over bidder because the duty was not owed to him. Nor were they liable to shareholders who had bought more shares in reliance on the accounts because, although they were owed a duty of care, it was in their capacity as members of the company and not in the capacity (which they shared with everyone else) of potential buyers of its shares. Accordingly, the duty which they were owed was not in respect of loss which they might suffer by buying its shares.”  </p>
<p class="para">83.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mummery LJ held that Moore Stephens owed no duty of care to S&amp;R, “a fraudster in the total grip of another fraudster". Although Mr Sumption has renounced any reliance on this holding, it is one with which I have sympathy. Moore Stephens were retained by Mr Stojevic by deception and with the object of enhancing the apparent respectability of S&amp;R for the purposes of his proposed fraud. The details of the business that he retained Moore Stephens to audit were wholly fictitious. If these motives and this dishonesty are to be attributed to S&amp;R, as it seems to me they must be, then it is at least arguable that the illegal purpose of the contract under which Moore Stephens were retained rendered it unenforceable at the suit of Moore Stephens by reason of the application of the principle in <i>Alexander v Rayson </i>[1936] 1 KB 169<i>. </i>More fundamentally, if party A, by deceit, induces party B to agree to play a part in a venture that is wholly fictitious, I find it hard to see how this can give rise to any duty on the part of party B. </p>
<p class="para">84.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I put those reservations on one side and assume that Moore Stephens undertook a contractual duty to S&amp;R to exercise due care in relation to the auditing of S&amp;R’s accounts, the question arises of whether that duty extended further than the exercise of reasonable care in the provision of information to the directors and those who had a proprietary interest in the company. The authorities relied upon by Mr Sumption lead to the conclusion that it did not.</p>
<p class="para">85.&nbsp;&nbsp;The exercise of an auditor’s duties to a company will, in some situations, have the effect of preserving the assets of the company. Such preservation will, whenever there is a risk that the company’s assets may prove inadequate to meet its liabilities, protect not merely the interests of the shareholders but those of the creditors. It is arguable that the scope of the duty undertaken by the auditors of a company should extend to protecting the interest that the creditors have in the preservation of the assets of the company. So to hold would involve departing from, or at least extending, the reasoning of this House in <i>Caparo. </i> Such an extension would not, however, assist S&amp;R in this case. To recover damages in this case S&amp;R would have to establish that the scope of the duty undertaken by Moore Stephens extended to taking reasonable care to ensure that the company was not used as a vehicle for fraud and that this duty was owed for the benefit of those that the company might defraud. I see no prospect that such a duty could be established. </p>
<p class="para">86.&nbsp;&nbsp;The scope of Moore Stephens’ duty is not directly in issue on this appeal. What is in issue is whether <i>ex turpi causa </i>provides a defence to S&amp;R’s claim that Moore Stephens was in breach of duty. That is not, however, a question that I have been able to consider in isolation from the question of the scope of Moore Stephens’s duty. I have reached the conclusion that all whose interests formed the subject of any duty of care owed by Moore Stephens to S&amp;R, namely the company’s sole will and mind and beneficial owner Mr Stojevic, were party to the illegal conduct that forms the basis of the company’s claim. In these circumstances I join with Lord Walker and Lord Brown in concluding that <i>ex turpi causa </i>provides a defence.</p>
<p class="para">87.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons I would dismiss this appeal.</p>


<p class="lawlord">LORD SCOTT OF FOSCOTE</p>
<p class="mylords">My Lords,</p>
<i><p class="mylords">Introduction</p></i>
<p class="para">88.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have found this a very difficult case.  Three of my noble and learned friends, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe and Lord Mance have prepared and circulated lengthy opinions, totalling very nearly 200 paragraphs but reaching differing conclusions.  Lord Phillips and Lord Walker have concluded that the <i>ex turpi causa </i> principle provides a complete defence to this action and that the appeal by Stone &amp; Rolls Ltd (in liquidation) (“S &amp; R”) against the striking out of its action should therefore be dismissed.  Both take the view that the fraud and dishonesty of Mr Stojevic is properly to be attributed to S &amp; R.  Lord Mance, however, has concluded that this action, brought by S &amp; R against its auditors, Moore Stephens, for contractual and tortious negligence, cannot be defeated, at least at the present strike-out stage, by that attribution.  My Lords I have come to the same conclusion as Lord Mance and without, as I hope, adding unnecessarily to the length of the opinions of your Lordships, I must explain why.</p>
<p class="para">89.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is of critical importance, in my opinion, to notice that the case comes before your Lordships as a final appeal on a strike-out application.  The application was made by Moore Stephens, defendants in the action but respondents before the House, on the ground that the claim by S&amp;R had no real prospect of success.  Many of the facts pleaded by S&amp;R in their Amended Particulars of Claim are admitted by Moore Stephens in their Defence.  It is not contended that any of the pleaded facts that are not admitted in the Defence can at this stage be regarded as incapable of proof.  It follows that for present striking-out purposes those facts must be assumed to be true.</p>
<i><p class="para">The facts</p></i>
<p class="para">90.&nbsp;&nbsp;S&amp;R is a company incorporated in England and Wales.  At all material times until its provisional liquidation in November 2002, S&amp;R was controlled by Mr Stojevic.  The shares in S&amp;R are, or were, held by an Isle of Man company, Law Investments Ltd, the shares in which are, or were, held by trustees of what has been described as Mr Stojevic’s family trust.  S&amp;R had directors but they took no part in the running of S&amp;R’s business and, it appears, exercised no control over its finances.  Mr Stojevic, via a power of attorney granted to him by S&amp;R’s faceless directors, was in complete managerial control of every aspect of S&amp;R.</p>
<p class="para">91.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore Stephens were, for the years 1996, 1997 and 1998, the auditors of S&amp;R and signed unqualified audit reports for those three financial years.  During this period, therefore, Moore Stephens were officers of S&amp;R for the purposes, for example, of section 212 of the Insolvency Act 1986 and had a contractual relationship with S&amp;R for the purpose, at least, of the preparation of the annual audit reports.</p>
<p class="para">92.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Stojevic, throughout the period that Moore Stephens were S&amp;R’s auditors but unknown to Moore Stephens, used S&amp;R as a vehicle of fraud.  He used S&amp;R as a vehicle through which funds, fraudulently extracted from banks which believed they were financing <i>bona fide </i>commodity trades, were then paid away to third parties under the influence or control of (or in league with) Mr Stojevic.  The moneys paid by the defrauded banks to S&amp;R and paid away by S&amp;R to the third parties were the proceeds of the frauds.  The most substantial of the frauds was committed against a Czech bank, Komercni Banka AS (“KB”) which eventually, and inevitably, brought proceedings against S&amp;R and Mr Stojevic for fraud.  The proceedings led to Toulson J on 15 November 2002, giving judgment against both defendants for over US$94 million.  The result of the judgment was that S&amp;R went into provisional liquidation on 15 November 2002 and on 15 January 2003 the provisional liquidatiors were appointed liquidators of S&amp;R.  There were other defrauded banks and companies as well as KB and S&amp;R was hopelessly insolvent.  Mr Stojevic has, apparently, no assets worth pursuing or at any rate none that the liquidators have been able to discover.</p>
<p class="para">93.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appointment of the provisional liquidators brought to an end Mr Stojevic’s control over S&amp;R and on 22 December 2006 S&amp;R, under the control of the liquidators, commenced the action against Moore Stephens that is the target of the striking-out application that has now reached your Lordships’ House.</p>

<i><p class="paraleft">The issue</p></i>
<p class="para">94.&nbsp;&nbsp;S&amp;R’s action against Moore Stephens seeks damages for negligence.  The pleaded case is, in very brief summary, that Moore Stephens, when carrying out their audit and preparing their audit report in each of the three audit years, were negligent in not detecting “(a) Mr Stojevic’s dishonesty; and (b) a pattern of fraud involving numerous fraudulent and/or irregular payments out by S&amp;R to entities controlled by Mr Stojevic and his associates” (see para.12 of the Amended Particulars of Claim).  It is pleaded that if this alleged negligence had not occurred Mr Stojevic would have been unable to procure the continuance of the fraudulent and irregular payments made out of S&amp;R.  In short, the fraudulent scheme would have come to an end.</p>
<p class="para">95.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore Stephens, in their Defence, deny any negligence or other breach of duty owed to S&amp;R but plead that, in any event, “the claim advanced is inextricably linked with [S&amp;R’s] own dishonest acts” (para.3(1)) and that the claim is barred by the <i>ex turpi causa </i>rule.</p>
<p class="para">96.&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue - an easy one to state but, at any rate for me, a difficult one to decide - is whether S&amp;R’s claim as pleaded must inevitably founder on the <i>ex turpi causa </i>rule. </p>
<i><p class="paraleft">The ex turpi causa rule</p></i>
<p class="para">97.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Langley J at first instance and Rimer LJ in the Court of Appeal commenced their consideration of the <i>ex turpi causa </i>rule by citing the well known statement made by Lord Mansfield in <i>Holman v Johnson</i> 1(1775) Cowp.341 at 343:</p>
<p class="qt">“No court will lend its aid to a man who founds his cause of action upon an immoral or an illegal act.  If, from the plaintiff’s own stating or otherwise, the cause of action appears to arise ex turpi causa …. there the court says he has no right to be assisted.”</p>
<p class="paraleft">The <i>ex turpi causa </i>rule was the subject of careful consideration in <i>Tinsley v Milligan</i> [1994]  1 AC 340 where this House unanimously rejected the proposition that the application of the rule depended “on such an imponderable factor as the extent to which the public conscience would be affronted by recognising rights created by illegal transactions” (per Lord Browne-Wilkinson at 369).  It is necessary, therefore, to put firmly to one side any question of whether, or to what extent, public conscience would be affronted by the spectacle of Moore Stephens being held liable to pay negligence damages to S&amp;R, thus enabling the liquidators to pay dividends to the defrauded creditors of S&amp;R, and to concentrate on whether S&amp;R is founding its action on its “own dishonest acts” (para.3(1) of the Defence).</p>
<p class="para">98.&nbsp;&nbsp;For that purpose it is desirable to be clear about what cause of action one is talking about.  S&amp;R has pleaded its case as one based both on contractual negligence and on tortious negligence.  I doubt whether at the end of the day the point makes any difference but, for my part, I regard a case based on contractual negligence as the more apt approach.  The complaint is a complaint of negligent auditing and Moore Stephens’ duty to conduct the audit with due professional skill and care was a duty owed to S&amp;R pursuant to the contract between them.  There was no relationship between them other than the contractual one.  It was that relationship that imposed the duty of care and, although it is now common to regard such a duty not only as contractual but also as  tortious, it seems to me more logical to speak of it as a contractual duty.  It is to be noted, moreover, that the Amended Particulars of Claim, in describing the scope of the duty of care relied on (paras.51 and 52), relies on “an implied term of Moore Stephens’ retainer” and that para.53 simply says that “Moore Stephens owed the claimants tortious duties co-extensive with the contractual duties set out above.”  I propose, therefore, to address myself to the question whether S&amp;R’s contractual cause of action is founded upon its  “own dishonest acts.”</p>
<i><p class="paraleft">S&amp;R’s contractual cause of action</p></i>
<p class="para">99.&nbsp;&nbsp;A cause of action for breach of contract requires no more than a valid contract and a breach of that contract.  If the complaint is one of professional negligence made against a professional, such as an auditor who has been retained by the complaining client, no more need be pleaded and proved than that in the performance of his contractual duties the professional failed to exercise the standard of professional care that was owing to the client under their contract.  For an action in tort, on the other hand, recoverable damage must be alleged and proved, for without such damage the tortious cause of action is not complete.  Not so for an action based on breach of contract.  If the breach is proved the complainant is entitled to judgment and to nominal damages at least.</p>
<p class="para">100.&nbsp;&nbsp;The retainer of Moore Stephens by S&amp;R to act as S&amp;R’s auditors for the years 1996, 1997 and 1998 is admitted in Moore Stephens’ Defence (see paras.15 and 16).  The implied term alleged in para.51 of the Amended Particulars of Claim is admitted, and so, too, is the bulk of the alleged requirements of a duty of “reasonable skill and care” (para.17).  What is, of course, denied is that Moore Stephens failed to meet the requisite standard of reasonable skill and care (para.18).  But their contractual duty to exercise that care is not in issue.  And their failure to meet that standard is, for present striking-out purposes, to be assumed.</p>
<p class="para">101.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, as it appears to me, S&amp;R can found a cause of action against Moore Stephens without reliance on the fraudulent nature of Mr Stojevic’s scheme.</p>
<p class="para">102.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, of course, this action is not being brought in order to recover merely nominal damages.  It is being brought in order to recover substantial damages, namely, damages representing the losses incurred by S&amp;R in having paid out large sums to the third parties and thereby having denuded itself of funds which could have been set against the liabilities it has incurred to those who were defrauded.  Prominent among them, of course, is KB with its $94 million odd judgment debt.</p>
<p class="para">103.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether, even if the <i>ex turpi causa </i>rule did not stand in the way, S &amp; R could recover as damages anything like the full amount of its losses, or indeed anything at all, will, I do not doubt, raise all sorts of issues of causation.  These causation issues are for later, to be addressed at trial if S&amp;R can surmount the <i>ex turpi causa </i>hurdle.  For present purposes, however, it must be assumed that some amount of substantial loss could be shown to have been caused by Morre Stephens’ breaches of duty and would, subject to the <i>ex turpi causa </i>rule, be recoverable as damages.  But it has to be accepted that in order to succeed in recovering more than nominal damages S&amp;R has had to plead the dishonest scheme under which the money extracted from the banks went via S&amp;R to the third parties.  So although, in my opinion, S&amp;R does not have to found its cause of action on the dishonesty of the scheme, it cannot recover substantial damages without pleading the details that show the scheme to have been dishonest.  Does this involve S&amp;R in relying “on its own dishonest acts"?  The answer depends on whether the dishonesty of Mr Stojevic should be attributed to S&amp;R for the purposes of S&amp;R’s claim against Moore Stephens.  This is, in my opinion, the short but determinative issue in the case.</p>
<i><p class="paraleft">Attribution</p></i>
<p class="para">104.&nbsp;&nbsp;An incorporated company is a statutory legal person.  It has corporate personality but can act only by agents and, as Lord Haldane LC memorably said in <i>Lennard’s Carrying Co.Ltd v Asiastic Petroleum Co.Ltd</i> [1915]  AC 705 at 713, </p>
<p class="qt">“It has no mind of its own any more than it has a body of its own; its active and directing will must consequently be sought in the person of somebody who for some purposes may be called an agent, but who is really the directing mind and will of the corporation, the very ego and centre of the personality of the corporation.”</p>
<p class="paraleft">Lord Haldane’s remarks were examined by Lord Hoffmann in giving the judgment of the Board in <i>Meridian Global Funds Management Asia Ltd v Securities Commission</i> [1995]  2 AC 500, on an appeal from the Court of Appeal of New Zealand.  Lord Hoffmann, at 506, noted that any proposition about a company’s directing mind and will necessarily involved a reference to a set of rules of attribution.  The company’s primary rules would, he said, generally be found in the company’s constitution, typically its articles of association, but would include also rules implied by company law, such as, for example, the rule that the unanimous decision of all the shareholders in a solvent company to do something that the company had power to do under its memorandum of association would be the decision of the company.  He went on to say this :</p>
<p class="qt">“These primary rules of attribution are obviously not enough to enable a company to go out into the world and do business.  Not every act on behalf of the company could be expected to be the subject of a resolution of the  board or a unanimous decision of the shareholders.  The company therefore builds upon the primary rules of attribution by using general rules of attribution which are equally available to natural persons, namely, the principles of agency.  It will appoint servants and agents whose acts, by a combination of the general principles of agency and the company’s primary rules of attribution, count as the acts of the company.”</p>
<p class="para">105.&nbsp;&nbsp;These remarks of Lord Hoffmann have, as it seems to me, a particular resonance in the present case.  Your Lordships have not been shown the Memorandum of Association or the articles of association of S&amp;R nor the power of attorney granted to Mr Stojevic.  It may reasonably be assumed, I think, that the articles gave the directors power to grant a power of attorney to Mr Stojevic to enable Mr Stojevic to take management decisions on behalf of S&amp;R.  But it may confidently be asserted also that the directors’ power could not have extended so as lawfully to authorise Mr Stojevic to treat the company as a vehicle for defrauding the banks and others in the way that he did or, indeed, in any other way to cause S&amp;R to engage in fraudulent trading.  Either the power of attorney would have been on its face unlawful and devoid of effect or, much more likely, Mr Stojevic’s actions in using S&amp;R as a vehicle for implementing the fraudulent scheme he had devised would have been outside the powers conferred on him by the power of attorney.  This feature of the relationship between Mr Stojevic and S&amp;R has no relevance whatever so far as dealings between S&amp;R and those defrauded by the scheme are concerned.  They were entitled to hold S&amp;R liable for the frauds in which S&amp;R had participated.  But it does have relevance, in my opinion, to the question whether S&amp;R was itself a victim of Mr Stojevic’s fraudulent scheme and, thus, to the critical question whether, for the purposes of S&amp;R’s action against Moore Stephens, Mr Stojevic’s dishonesty should be attributed to S&amp;R.</p>
<p class="para">106.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>In re Hampshire Land Company</i> [1896]  2 Ch.743 established the rule that the knowledge of an officer of a company of his own fraud or breach of trust directed at third parties will not necessarily be imputed to that company (see the statement of the rule by Rimer LJ in paragraph 39 of his judgment in the Court of Appeal).  Where the knowledge in question was the officer’s knowledge of his own fraud or breach of duty, Vaughan Williams J declined in <i>In re Hampshire Land Company </i>to hold that the knowledge was to be attributed to the company (see pp 749-750).  In particular, if the director in breach of duty has an adverse interest to that of the company, the knowledge of the breach of duty will not be imputed to the company :  see <i>J.C.Houghton and Co. v Nothard, Lowe and Wills</i> <i>Ltd </i>[1928]  AC 1 where Lord Sumner said that it would be </p>
<p class="qt">“… contrary to justice and common sense to treat the knowledge of such persons as that of their company, as if one were to assume that they would make a clean breast of their delinquency” (p.19)</p>
<p class="para">107.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, cases, sometimes referred to as “sole actor” cases, where the company has no human embodiment other than the fraudster and where, therefore, there is no one in the company for the fraudster to deceive, no one in the company to whom “a clean breast of … delinquency” could be made.  In these “one actor” cases, it is said, the <i>Hampshire Land Company </i>rule can have no sensible application.  The knowledge of the fraudster simply <i>is </i>the knowledge of the company.  An example of this proposition in action is <i>Royal Brunei Airlines Sdn Bhd  v Tan</i> [1995] 2 AC 328.  This was a case in which the issue was whether the company, BLT, had been guilty of fraud or dishonesty in relation to money it held in trust for the plaintiff airline.  The company had become insolvent and the airline sued its controlling director, Mr Tan, on the ground that he had knowingly assisted in the dissipation by BLT of the money.  Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, at 393, said this:</p>
<p class="qt">“The defendant accepted that he knowingly assisted in that breach of trust.  In other words, he caused or permitted his company to apply the money in a way he knew was not authorised by the trust of which the company was trustee.  Set out in these bald terms, the defendant’s conduct was dishonest.  By the same token, and for good measure, BLT also acted dishonestly.  The defendant was the company, and his state of mind is to be imputed to the company.”</p>
<p class="para">108.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the attribution to BLT of Mr Tan’s dishonesty for the purposes of the airline’s claim against, in effect, BLT and Mr Tan, could not be taken to bar misfeasance proceedings by the liquidator of BLT against Mr Tan or against any other officer of BLT who, in relation to the trust money, “has… been guilty of any misfeasance or breach of any … other duty in relation to …”  BLT (s.212(1), Insolvency Act 1986 - assuming, of course, that s.212 or some similar statutory provision were applicable to BLT’s insolvent liquidation.</p>
<p class="para">109.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is noteworthy that there appears to be no case in which the “sole actor” exception to the <i>Hampshire Land Company </i>rule has been applied so as to bar an action brought by a company against an officer for breaches of duty that have caused, or contributed to, loss to the company as a result of the company engaging in illegal activities.  I can easily accept that, for the purposes of an action against the company by an innocent third party, with no notice of any illegality or impropriety by the company in the conduct of its affairs, the state of mind of a “sole actor” could and should be attributed to the company if it were relevant to the cause of action asserted against the company to do so.  But it does not follow that that attribution should take place where the action is being brought by the company against an officer or manager who has been in breach of duty to the company.</p>
<p class="para">110.&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that the liquidators of S&amp;R know of no assets of Mr Stojevic that could become the fruits of successful proceedings against him for breach of duty.  But suppose that were not so.  There can surely be no doubt that the liquidators could issue a misfeasance summons against him under section 212(1)(c) of the Insolvency Act 1986.  Could Mr Stojevic, on such a summons, contend that his dishonesty should be attributed to the company that, in breach of his fiduciary duties under the power of attorney, he had turned into his vehicle for fraud?  It is long established that section 212, like its statutory predecessors, is procedural and does not create a cause of action where none previously existed - although it is to be noted that section 212(3)(b) confers on the court a judgmental discretion as to the quantum of compensation that would not in an ordinary damages action be applicable.  But Mr Stojevic could not, in  my opinion, reduce his liability for breach of duty to S&amp;R by attributing to S&amp;R his own dishonesty, praying in aid the “sole actor” exception and the application of the <i>ex turpi causa </i>rule.</p>
<i><p class="paraleft">The liability of Moore Stephens</p></i>
<p class="para">111.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not clear to me why Moore Stephens, or any other officer of S&amp;R whose breach of duty had contributed to the liabilities to which S&amp;R is now subject, should be in any different position, so far as attribution to S&amp;R of Mr Stojevic’s dishonesty is concerned, to that of Mr Stojevic himself.  Moore Stephens were not, as Lord Walker in para. 190 of his opinion has pointed out, directors or managers of the company’s business.  But they, too, as officers of the company (see s. 212(1)(a)) could have been, and could still be, the recipients of a section 212 misfeasance summons.  The damages claimed in this action could have been claimed as compensation under section 212(3).  Indeed this action is, to my mind, indistinguishable in substance from a section 212 misfeasance application and, if necessary, a simple amendment to the pleadings could make that clear.  The same causation problems as lie beneath the surface in the present action would apply equally to a section 212 misfeasance application.  No doubt the same <i>ex turpi causa </i>objection would have been taken but the nature of the claim, as one being brought for the benefit of S&amp;R’s creditors, would have been more openly apparent and not in the least a matter of objection.</p>
