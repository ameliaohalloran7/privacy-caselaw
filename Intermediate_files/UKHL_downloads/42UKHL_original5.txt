<p class="para">117.&nbsp;&nbsp;The acquired land was valued on the basis that, in the absence of the road scheme, a road would have been built on a different alignment, and that in those circumstances the land would have been suitable for residential development. The land fell to be valued as at a time before section 14(5)-(7), added by the Planning and Compensation Act 1991, came into effect.  Those provisions exclude a claim on that basis by imposing the assumption that no road would be built to meet the same need as the scheme road.</p>
<p class="para">118.&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision is consistent with the view which I take of the approach to the prospect of planning permission where there is no statutory assumption. But this was a case on that part of section 7 of the 1965 Act which deals with damage caused by diminution in value of the retained land. I do not consider that it is helpful in the valuation exercise under Rule (2) of section 5 to approach the question of compensation through the loss of chance approach in cases of damages for negligence such as <i>Davies v Taylor</i> [1974] AC 207 and <i>Allied Maples Group Ltd v Simmons &amp; Simmons </i> [1995] 1 WLR 1602.  </p>
<i><p class="para">The Court of Appeal and the Pointe Gourde principle</p></i>
<p class="para">119.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, what the Court of Appeal did in this case was to use the <i>Pointe Gourde </i>principle to remedy what it perceived to be an anomaly. The anomaly was said to be that section 22 fixed the time by which the section 17 criterion was to be applied, and that bore no necessary relation to the planning position at the valuation date (the date of entry); and it was said to have the surprising effect that the planning determination had to be made by reference to circumstances in the autumn of 1993, eight years before the date of entry. Spirerose was therefore unable to take advantage of the statutory assumptions because of that anomaly in fixing the date of consideration: [28], [65], [71].</p>
<p class="para">120.&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the reasoning of the Court of Appeal be justified? The answer to that question depends on (a) the juridical basis of the principle; and (b) whether its application in <i>Waters v Welsh Development Authority</i> [2004] UKHL 19, [2004] 1 WLR 1304 can support the conclusion of the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p class="para">121.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Pointe Gourde Quarrying and Transport Co Ltd v Sub-Intendent of Crown Lands</i> [1947] AC 656 (PC) land in Trinidad was compulsorily acquired by the Crown so that it could be leased as a naval base to the United States. The land had a limestone quarry. The owner claimed that the value of the land should reflect the special need of the United States of the stone for the building of the naval base. The Privy Council accepted that the claim could not be rejected because of the then equivalent in Trinidad of what is now Rule (3) of section 5 of the Land Compensation Act 1961 (“The special suitability or adaptability of the land for any purpose shall not be taken into account …”). That was because it referred to a purpose to which the land itself could be applied, and not to the use of the products of the land elsewhere. But the claim to take account of the special value of the quarry was rejected because (at 572): “It is well settled that compensation for the compulsory acquisition of land cannot include an increase in value which is entirely due to the scheme underlying the acquisition.”  Consequently the land had to be valued without taking account of the special needs of the United States.</p>
<p class="para">122.&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal authority relied on was <i>South Eastern Railway Co v London County Council </i>[1915] 2 Ch 252.  This involved a valuation by an arbitrator under the Land Clauses Consolidation Act 1845.  Eve J, whose judgment was upheld by the Court of Appeal, said that the matter resolved itself into an enquiry as to the mode in which the amount to be paid as purchase money was to be ascertained.  In answering that enquiry, increase in value consequent on the execution of the undertaking for or in connection with which the purchase was made must be disregarded: at 258.</p>
<p class="para">123.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first case in this House to refer to <i>Pointe Gourde </i>was <i>Davy v Leeds Corporation</i> [1965] 1 WLR 445, where Viscount Dilhorne (at 453) said that what is now section 6(1) of the 1961 Act had given statutory expression to the principle. Section 9 also gives effect to the principle. The position would be the same without such an express provision. Just as an increase in the value of the land due to the scheme must be left out of account, so also must any decrease: <i>Melwood Units Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Main Roads</i> [1979] AC 426, at 435 (PC); and <i>Director of Buildings and Lands v Shun Fung Ironworks Limited </i>[1995] 2 AC 111, at 136 (PC).</p>
<p class="para">124.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Rugby Joint Water Board v Shaw-Fox</i> [1973] AC 202 this House, by a majority, refused to extend the principle so as to apply it not only to the ascertainment of the value of land or an interest in land, but also to the ascertainment of the nature and extent of the interest to be valued in a case where the scheme had brought about an alteration of the interest itself (in that case by giving freeholders the right to terminate agricultural tenancies). On one reading of the speeches there was a significant extension of the principle in <i>Waters v Welsh Development Authority</i> [2004] UKHL 19, [2004] 1 WLR 1304, in which Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead said: “The courts … found themselves driven to conclude that the statutory code is not exhaustive and that the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> principle still applies. This conclusion is open to the criticism that in many instances this makes the statutory provisions otiose. This is so, but this is less repugnant as an interpretation of the Act than the alternative” ([54]).  </p>
<p class="para">125.&nbsp;&nbsp;A proposal to build a barrage across the mouth of Cardiff Bay was opposed by the Countryside Council for Wales and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds because the proposals would involve an unacceptable loss of nationally important bird habitats. The European Commission claimed that the new barrage would be incompatible with the United Kingdom’s obligations under EC Council Directives regarding the conservation of wild birds and their habitats. Therefore in order that the scheme could go ahead it was proposed to provide a bird reserve on the Gwent Levels to compensate for the loss of the Cardiff Bay habitat. In 1997 the Land Authority for Wales used its statutory powers to acquire the site compulsorily as part of this bird reserve. The owners claimed that they were entitled to compensation based on the increased value their land was said to have possessed because of its important role as part of the compensatory wetlands provision required by the Cardiff Bay barrage project. </p>
<p class="para">126.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was held that the proposed acquisition of the reserve was an integral part of the barrage project and that the enhanced value attributable solely to the use to which the land would be put under the scheme was to be disregarded. The <i>Pointe Gourde </i>principle could be applied by analogy as a supplement to the statutory code in section 6: [63(4)]. Lord Scott of Foscote agreed with the result, but thought (at [115]) that it could be achieved either (a) by applying Rule (3) of section 5 to disregard “special suitability or adaptability of the land for any purpose … if that purpose is a purpose to which it could be applied only in pursuance of statutory powers” etc; or (b) by applying the traditional “value to the owner” principle. But I doubt whether there is a very significant difference between Lord Scott’s view on the second point and the ratio of the majority. </p>
<p class="para">127.&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the juridical basis of the <i>Pointe Gourde </i>principle? Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead said in <i>Waters v</i> <i>Welsh Development Agency</i> [2004] UKHL 19, [2004] 1 WLR 1304, at [42] that the principle is no more than the name given to one aspect of the long established “value to the owner” principle. </p>
<p class="para">128.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion it is a principle of statutory interpretation, mainly designed and used to explain and amplify the expression “value.”  It is in this sense that it has sometimes been referred to as a common law principle: see e.g. <i>Fletcher Estates (Harlescott) Ltd v Secretary of State for the Environment</i> [2000] 2 AC 307, 315, per Lord Hope of Craighead; <i>Waters v</i> <i>Welsh Development Agency </i>at [142] per Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood.  In <i>Rugby Joint Water Board v Shaw-Fox</i> [1973] AC 202 at 213 to 215 Lord Pearson reviewed the authorities and concluded that although the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> principle had been described as a “common law principle", it could not be such a principle “because compulsory acquisition and compensation for it are entirely creations of statute” (at 214). He went on: “The <i>Pointe Gourde</i> principle in my opinion involves an interpretation of the word ‘value’ in those statutory provisions which require the compensation for compulsory acquisition to include the value of the lands taken” (at 214-215). I am satisfied that this the right approach and that there is nothing in Lord Nicholls’ speech in <i>Waters </i>which is inconsistent with this view.</p>
<p class="para">129.&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows that there is no basis in authority or in principle for the conclusion that it is open to the court in effect to establish an assumption that planning permission would be obtained, by analogy with the specific statutory rules which create the assumption. I have already endeavoured to show that the authorities relied on by the Tribunal do not provide such a basis. <i>Waters v</i> <i>Welsh Development Agency</i> is an example of an extended interpretation of the concept of value in the context of determining the extent of a scheme in order to give effect to a Parliamentary intention to provide dispossessed owners with a fair financial equivalent: see at [61]. The underlying basis of the decision in <i>Waters </i>is that the extent of the scheme to be ignored for the purposes of valuation is not limited by the express provisions of section 6 and schedule 1.  It does not go further, and does not support the conclusion of the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p class="para">130.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor do I understand how the Court of Appeal could have concluded, given its decision on the approach to the consequences of a finding on the balance of probabilities, that where there would have been a possibility, but less than a probability, of planning permission, the land owner should have the benefit of hope value.  That conclusion seems to me to undermine the principal conclusion that a finding of probability leads not to hope value but to valuation on an assumption that planning permission would certainly have been obtained.</p>
<p class="para">131.&nbsp;&nbsp;I accept TfL’s fundamental point that it is not the role of the court to re-write legislation by adding additional assumptions of planning permission. As Lord Denning MR said in <i>Jelson v Minister of Housing and Local Government </i>[1970] 1 QB 243, 250, whichever date was taken there would be anomalies: “So much so that I think we must go simply by the construction of the statute.” There is a difference between legitimate purposive construction and impermissible judicial legislation. The 1961 Act has dealt with the present case by providing not only for the section 17 procedure, but also by providing in section 14(3) that, even if the statutory assumptions do not apply, nothing in those provisions shall be construed as requiring it to be assumed that planning permission would necessarily be refused. That enables development value to be taken into account. In my opinion for the court to depart from the normal method of valuation of land which has potential development value by adding an assumption that planning permission will be obtained by analogy with those provisions which do provide for assumptions is not a permissible exercise of statutory construction.</p>
<p class="para">132.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not persuaded in any event that there is any real anomaly. It is true that the fact that the section 17 determination date was a date in 1993 would have made a proper determination under that section valueless to Spirerose, because in 1993 there would have been little prospect of obtaining planning permission for a mixed use development. It is also true that if the section 17 determination date had been in 2001, then planning permission would have been assumed, and Spirerose would have had the advantage of the full development value. But the anomaly, if that is what it can be called, arises only on the facts of this case. Developments in planning policy may make the earlier date as at which the section 17 determination is to be made more favourable than the valuation date. In addition, there is much to be said for the submission on behalf of TfL that the date of publication of the notice of the making of the compulsory order is a rational choice by the legislature, because that is the date on which the prospect of obtaining valuable development rights is taken from the owner.</p>
