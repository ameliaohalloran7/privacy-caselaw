<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several old cases where a customary right to conduct a recreational activity was established over, or discussed in respect of, land to which these Victorian statutes could not possibly have been intended to apply.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Millechamp v Jordan</i> (1740) Willes 202, was a case in which the court accepted the possibility in law of a customary right to use a particular field for recreation but limited to "legal and reasonable times of year" so as not to allow the user to deprive the landowner of all profits of the land (nb the adjective "reasonable" appears in the note to <i>Bell v Wardell</i> (1740) Willes 202 but in a reference to the case by Kelly CB in <i>Hall v Nottingham</i> (1875) 1 Ex D 1, 3 the adjective "seasonable" is substituted").</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Mounsey v Ismay</i> (1865) 4 H &amp; C 486 was a trespass case. One of the defences was that the free men of the city of Carlisle had acquired by 20 years prescriptive user the right on Ascension Day each year to hold horse races on the land in question. The defence failed, Martin B holding that the right to have a race meeting could not be claimed under the Prescription Act 1832 (2 &amp; 3 Wm 4 c71). But he said, <i>obiter</i> at 495, that it was "perfectly clear that such a right as is here set up can only exist by custom" and, at pp 498-499, that a customary right to run horse races would be "a lawful one at common law". The right to have a race meeting once a year on someone else's land could not possibly justify describing the land as a town or village green.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Hoffmann has referred in paragraph 6 of his opinion to <i>Virgo v Harford </i>(unreported) 11 August 1892 in which a customary recreational right to play various games on 65 acres of open land on a hill in Somerset was apparently upheld. The notion that this land would have been understood to be a town or village green seems to me absurd.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lancashire v Hunt</i> (1894) 10 TLR 310 provides an equally (or more) extreme example of the point. The owner of Stockbridge Common Down in Hampshire applied for an injunction to prevent a local trainer from exercising and training his race horses over the 160 acres-odd of the common. The trainer claimed that he had a customary right to train his horses over the common.  Wright J held that this customary right had not been established by the evidence but that the inhabitants of the borough did have the right to ride their horses for recreation over any part of the 160 acres. In a second action heard at the same time the owner of Stockbridge Common Down sought to restrain the inhabitants of Stockbridge from using the common for meetings, fêtes and cricket matches. Here, too, the defence was based on custom. It was said that the inhabitants had a customary right to use the downs for those purposes. This defence prevailed. The reporter of the case made the following comment at p 312:</p>

<p></p><ul>"It will therefore be seen from Mr Justice Wright's decision in the two actions respectively that - (a) so long as that judgment stands the lord of the manor of Stockbridge will have in future a definite right to prevent racehorses from being trained on Stockbridge Common Down; but (b) that he will not, any more than formerly, be able to stop the inhabitants of Stockbridge using the common down as a recreation ground in the same way and for the same purposes as village greens are usually enjoyed by the villagers".<p></p></ul>

<p>It is to be noticed that the reporter did not comment on the absurdity of referring to the 160 acres of downs as a village green. No one, in my respectful opinion, could have supposed that the references in the Victorian statutes to village greens were applicable to the 160 acre Stockbridge Common Down.</p>

<p>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Mercer v Denne </i>[1904] 2 Ch 534 a customary right for fishermen in the parish of Walmer to spread their nets to dry on the land of a private owner at all times seasonable for fishing was held by Farwell J to be a good and valid custom. The customary right claimed was not a right for recreational purposes but for the purposes of the fishermen's trade as fishermen. However, the principles applied by Farwell J to the question whether the custom claimed was a good one were the same principles as those which had been established in the customary recreational rights cases, many of which he cited. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74.&nbsp;&nbsp;These cases demonstrate, in my opinion, that a customary right for local inhabitants to use someone else's land, of whatever description, for a recreational purpose could be acquired, pre the 1965 Act, by evidence of user from time immemorial provided that the custom were sufficiently certain and were reasonable in itself. The custom would become, in effect, a local common law for the place to which the custom extended (see Tindal CJ in <i>Lockwood v Wood</i> (1844) 6 QB 50, 64 cited by Farwell J in <i>Mercer v Denne</i> [1904] 2 Ch 534, 551). The customary rights thus acquired might be limited by the nature of the user that had given rise to them. Thus, for example, the riding of horses over Stockbridge Common Down since time immemorial could not have given rise to a customary right to hold fêtes and play cricket matches on the common, and vice versa. A customary right for local inhabitants to course hares over the stubble fields of the lord of the manor could, I imagine, have been acquired by an exercise of that right since time immemorial. But the right to course hares over the fields after they had been ploughed and planted or to enjoy other recreative activities over the fields could not have been thereby acquired.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75.&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way of making the same point is to observe that the residual rights of the landowner to make profitable use of the land subject to the customary rights must surely depend on the nature of the user that has created the rights. In some cases the landowner's residual rights might be negligible. In other cases the landowner's ability to use the land might be restricted only for a limited period of the year. All would depend on the nature of the customary right that had been established.  And there would be many types of land over which customary rights of one sort or another might be established which no one could suppose would be subject to the various prohibitions imposed by the Victorian statutes on town and village greens.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76.&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows, in my opinion, that, pre the 1965 Act, the fact that a piece of land was subject to a customary right of recreation would not, by itself, have sufficed to allow the land to be described for legal purposes as a town or village green, eg for the purposes of the Victorian statutes. Something more would have been needed. There is, as Lord Hoffmann has said (para 7 of his opinion), no authority on the point but I am unable to accept that a purposive construction of the expression "town or village green" in the Victorian statutes would have led to the 160 acre Stockbridge Common Down, or a mountainside down which people skied in winter snow, or a dense wood in which people wandered to pick bluebells or search for mushrooms or for other dalliance, being so categorised.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, the "something more" would have been a quality in the land in question that would have accorded with the normal understanding of the nature of a town or village green, namely, an area of land, consisting mainly of grass, either in or in reasonable proximity to a town or village and suitable for use by the local inhabitants for normal recreational activities.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report of the Royal Commission on Common Land 1955-1958 (1958) (Cmnd 462) makes some, not very many, references to town and village greens. Three of these are mentioned by Lord Hoffmann in paragraph 13 of his opinion. For my part I can see no reason to suppose that the Commissioners had in mind anything other than greens as normally understood. Lord Hoffmann notes, in sub-paragraph (c), the Commissioners' comment that there were "probably very few villagers who will not know what they mean by 'their green'". I respectfully agree with this comment which, to my mind, goes to confirm that the Commissioners had in mind normal traditional town or village greens.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 22(1) of the 1965 Act defined "town or village green" as meaning:</p>

<p></p><ul>"land which has been allotted by or under any Act for the exercise or recreation of the inhabitants of any locality or on which the inhabitants of any locality have a customary right to indulge in lawful sports and pastimes or on which the inhabitants of any locality have indulged in such sports and pastimes as of right for not less than 20 years".<p></p></ul>

<p>As Lord Hoffmann has observed, this definition brought together the two categories of land that, pre the Act, constituted land over which local inhabitants might be entitled to rights of exercise or recreation and then added a third, the so-called class (c), namely, land on which the inhabitants "have indulged in such sports and pastimes as of right for not less than 20 years". The important question for present purposes is whether this definition justifies classifying as a town or village green any land on which any form of lawful recreation is either the subject of a customary right or has been indulged in by the local inhabitants for at least 20 years. My instinctive reaction is to say that the definition was not intended to turn into a village green land subject to the exercise of customary rights that would not, pre the Act, have been regarded as a village green. The 160 acre Stockbridge Common Down was not, in my opinion, a town or village green before the enactment of the 1965 Act and did not become one afterwards. The landowner who owned arable land that, before the 1965 Act, had been subject to a customary right to course hares in the autumn would not after the enactment have found that he was the owner of a town or village green. And the addition of class (c) could not, in my opinion, have been intended to alter the status of land that had not previously been a town or village green or to turn into a town or village green land that had never previously been so regarded. The addition of class (c) was intended, in my opinion, in complete agreement on this point with Lord Hoffmann, to enable general recreational rights over town and village greens, as popularly understood, to be established without the necessity of proving user since time immemorial. Proof of 20 years user as of right, a formula borrowed from the Prescription Acts, would do.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, unfortunately, at least in my view, cases since 1965 have led to the registration as town or village greens of land that did not remotely correspond to a town or village green in the normally understood sense. Some of these cases have been referred to by Lord Hoffmann (para 39 of his opinion). There was a case in 1977 in which some rocks at Llanbadrig, Ynys Mon, which had for upwards of 20 years been used by the local inhabitants to moor their boats was registered as a town or village green. In a case in 1976 a piece of land in Barnet on which for at least the past 20 years a Guy Fawkes bonfire had been held as of right was registered.  No other evidence of use of the land for sports and pastimes is mentioned in the short report of the Chief Commons Commissioner.  But the land was known as "Bittacy Green" which certainly suggests such use and suggests that the nature of the land was consistent with it being a town or village green. If, however, all that had happened was that for the previous 20 years plus the local inhabitants had once a year as of right enjoyed a Guy Fawkes bonfire on the land, it does not seem to me that the statutory criteria were satisfied. And, in the course of counsels' submissions in the present appeal, reference was made to a quarry which, having been used for 20 years plus by the local inhabitants for recreational activities, was registered, in reliance on class (c), as a town or village green.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, in my opinion, an error in construction of section 22(1) to suppose that any land, whatever the degree of divergence between the character of the land and a town or village green as normally understood, can be registered as a town or village green either in reliance on class (b) or in reliance on class (c) of the statutory definition. I do not think the problem would ever arise in relation to class (a) for I imagine that any land allocated by an inclosure award for general exercise and recreational purposes, would have been already or would soon have become a predominantly grassy area.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82.&nbsp;&nbsp;In Bennion's <i>Statutory Interpretation</i>, 4th ed (2002), p 480, under the side-heading "Potency of the term defined", the author says this:</p>

<p></p><ul>"Whatever meaning may be expressly attached to a term, it is important to realise that its dictionary meaning is likely to exercise some influence over the way the definition will be understood by the court. It is impossible to cancel the ingrained emotion of a word merely by an announcement."<p></p></ul>

<p>The author gives a number of examples from decided cases which illustrate, convincingly in my opinion, his point. The two cases which seem to me particularly pertinent are <i>British Amusement Catering Trades Association v Westminster City Council</i> [1989] AC 147, where Lord Griffiths, at p 157, construed the term "cinematograph exhibition" as excluding video games because the use of the term immediately brought to mind a film show, and <i>Delaney v. Staples</i> [1992] 1 AC 687, in which Lord Browne-Wilkinson in construing the definition of "wages" in the Wages Act 1986 said, at p 692, that "it is important to approach such definition bearing in mind the normal meaning of that word".</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, I would apply the same approach to construction of the definition of "town or village green" in section 22(1) of the 1965 Act, or, for that matter, to construction of "town or village green" in the Victorian statutes to which I have referred.  I do not believe it can be correct to insist on a literal application of the section 22(1) definition so as to apply it to land that no one would recognise as a town or village green.</p>

<i></i><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rights of user over town and village greens</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84.&nbsp;&nbsp;The dispute between the parties as to whether there are any, and if so what, rights of user over class (c) town and village greens would fall away if the literal construction of section 22(1) were set aside and, as I would regard it, a more sensible construction, based upon the normally understood characteristics of a town or village green, were adopted instead. It is relevant to notice that the class (c) addition to the previous means by which land may have become a town or village green was based upon the language of prescription. Prescriptive user for the requisite period entitles the prescriber, or the general public if public rights of way are being obtained, to a right commensurate with the prescriptive user.  Prescriptive user of a path on foot may give a right of way on foot, prescriptive user of the path with a horse may lead to a bridleway, or with vehicles to a right of way with vehicles. It is a basic principle of prescriptive use that the user "as of right" that has continued for the requisite period becomes a user "of right". There seems to me every reason to suppose that the 20 years user contemplated by section 22(1) was intended to lead to the same consequence as prescriptive user, namely, the acquisition of rights commensurate with the nature of the user. This would match up class (c) with class (b), where the user that had created the customary right would become the permitted user pursuant to that customary right.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only if the literal construction of section 22(1) preferred by a majority of your Lordships is adopted that the "rights" issue becomes difficult. If it is correct that any 20 year "as of right" recreational use of any type of land justifies categorising the land as a town or village green, then it becomes necessary to ask what rights are thereby created over the town or village green? Why should a landowner's tolerance of a yearly Guy Fawkes bonfire on his land lead to the local public acquiring much broader, and more intrusive, rights over the land, rights that the landowner might well not have tolerated? But if there has been general recreational use of a parcel of mainly open grassy land that has continued as of right for 20 years plus, no problem arises. Mr Edwards, counsel for Miss Robinson, said that one single type of activity would not suffice to qualify land as a town or village green. But I would go further. The reference in section 22(1) to "lawful sports and pastimes" is, in my opinion, a reference of generality. If, throughout the 20 year period the land were used for whatever lawful sports and pastimes the users chose, the requisite generality would be present. A management problem might arise if a new sport began to be played posing problems for other users of the land.  User for the new sport might be unlawful if it presented unacceptable dangers to other users of the green but it would not necessarily be unlawful vis-à-vis the landowner. He could complain only if his residual rights in respect of the green were interfered with but, if the green were the typical town or village green, those rights would be likely to be negligible.</p>

<i></i><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human rights</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86.&nbsp;&nbsp;The implications of article 1 of the First Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights and the Human Rights Act 1988 to the acquisition by land of town and village green status under class (c) of section 22(1) were raised by Mr George QC on behalf of the City Council. He referred your Lordships to the recent decision of the Strasbourg court in <i>J A Pye (Oxford) Ltd v. United Kingdom</i> [2005] 3 EGLR I. A loss by a landowner of rights over his land brought about by the operation of a statutory prescription provision and the expiry of the relevant prescriptive period would, I feel bound to accept, prima facie engage his article 1 of the First Protocol right "to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions". But, in my opinion, notwithstanding the Strasbourg court's decision in <i>Pye</i>, and having taken account of that decision (see section 2(1)(a) of the 1998 Act), the operation of the statutory prescriptive provision in section 22(1) brings about a deprivation of the landowner's rights that is, in the judgment of Parliament, in the public interest. The purpose of the statutory prescriptive provisions in our domestic law is, as Lord Hoffmann put it in the <i>Sunningwell</i> case [2000] 1 AC 335, 349, to "prevent the disturbance of long-established de facto enjoyment". Who could doubt that that is in the public interest?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87.&nbsp;&nbsp;If, however, as I understand to be your Lordships' view, land can become a town or village green under class (c), or for that matter under class (b), on account of some long standing but limited recreational use (eg yearly Guy Fawkes bonfires) and then, after registration as a town or village green under the 1965 Act, the local public thereby become entitled to use the land for any "lawful sports and pastimes", it is easy to see that the fact of registration may seriously limit the ability of the landowner to continue to enjoy the land in the manner in which he had enjoyed it during the prescriptive period. The public interest in thus increasing the rights of the local public over and above their "long established de facto enjoyment" and correspondingly reducing the residual rights of the landowner is hard to discern. So if it is right that a limited recreational use can qualify the land, upon registration, for use for any and all "lawful sports and pastimes" (see section 22(1)), a potentially serious problem regarding the landowner's article 1 of the First Protocol rights could, in my opinion, arise.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a further point about human rights where, as in the present case, the landowner is a local authority, to which I should draw attention. The City Council acquired the land from St John's College and, I imagine, sections 122 and 123 of the Local Government Act 1972 apply to the land. Section 122(2A) (added by amendment under the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980) allows a local authority owner of "open space" land, which includes land "used for the purposes of public recreation", to appropriate the land to other uses. And section 123(2A) gives a local authority power to dispose of the open space land provided certain specified statutory procedures are followed (see the general discussion on these provisions in paragraphs 27 and 28 of the opinion I gave in <i>R (Beresford) v Sunderland City Council</i> [2004] 1 AC 889, 900).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89.&nbsp;&nbsp;The question whether these statutory powers allow a local authority such as the City Council to appropriate open space land for housing use and then to dispose of the land free from any recreational rights of the local inhabitants whether or not the land has been registered as a town or village green remains for judicial decision. The purpose of the statutory powers I have referred to would, in relation to open space land that had been registered under the 1965 Act, be pointless if the local authority could not do so.  It seems to me arguable that these statutory powers do enable local authorities to use town and village greens for housing purposes and to remove the land from the clutch of the 1857 and 1876 Victorian statutes as well as from the 1965 Act. The relevance of all this for present purposes is that if the City Council does have power under the 1972 Act to dispose of the Trap Grounds for housing purposes whether or not the land in question is a town or village green, the City Council would suffer no obvious detriment if the Trap Grounds were to be registered as a town or village green and any potential human rights point based upon that registration would evaporate.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the matters I have been discussing it is interesting to look again at the facts of the <i>Bittacy Green</i> case. It appears from the Decision of the Chief Commons Commissioner, Mr George Squibb QC, that the piece of land on which the annual Guy Fawkes bonfire had been held was a relatively small part of a larger parcel of land that had been acquired in 1952 by Hendon Borough Council, the predecessor of the London Borough of Barnet. Mr Squibb records, in the second page of his decision, that:</p>

<p></p><ul>"In 1970 the Council was minded to cease to use the land for the purposes of public walks and pleasure ground and to appropriate it for housing purposes. Since the land was an 'open space', as defined in section 22(1) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1962, because it was used for the purposes of public recreation, it was necessary to make an appropriation order, confirmed by the Secretary of State for the Environment, under section 73 of that Act. This order, the London Borough of Barnet (Sanders Lane Housing Area) Appropriation Order 1970, provided that other land should be provided in exchange and that the appropriated land should be discharged from the rights, trusts and incidents to which it was previously subject.<p></p></ul>

<p></p><ul>The 1970 Order did not, however, apply to all the land comprised in the register unit. There was excluded from it a triangle of land, which still remains open and outside the curtileges of the houses which have been built on the remainder. In my view, the effect of this Order was to discharge the part of the land used for housing from the right to indulge in lawful sports and pastimes on it …"<p></p></ul>

<i></i><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The function of the court</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one final problem, a procedural problem, that I want to mention before turning to the ten specific issues on which the County Council seek rulings and guidance. The problem arises out of the nature of some of the relief sought. The background to the commencement of the proceedings can be shortly stated. Miss Robinson, a resident in North Oxford, applied to register the Trap Grounds as a town or village green on the ground that "local residents had used it for lawful pastimes as of right (without obstruction, permission, stealth or force) for an unbroken period of 20 years …" and continued to do so. The City Council, the landowner, objected to the application. They want to use the Trap Grounds, or some part, for housing development. The County Council appointed Mr Vivian Chapman to enquire into the facts relevant to Miss Robinson's application and to advise them. Mr Chapman duly conducted a non-statutory inquiry and having done so presented the County Council with a detailed report advising that a part of the Trap Grounds qualified for registration and should be registered as a town or village green. But the County Council then received advice from another expert in this field, Mr George Laurence QC, their counsel on this appeal, which in some important respects conflicted with the advice given by Mr Chapman in his report. The County Council then commenced these proceedings in order to obtain rulings on the several points regarding the effect of the 1965 Act, as amended, and the 1969 Regulations made thereunder, that Miss Robinson's application and the conflicting advice they had received appeared to them to raise.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92.&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraphs (i) to (viii), inclusive, of the relief sought under the County Council's re-amended CPR Part 8 claim form sought rulings on legal issues. Paragraphs (ix) and (x) sought guidance on certain factual matters relevant to Miss Robinson's application. The paragraphs are set out in paragraph 35 of Lord Hoffmann's opinion. It will be apparent that what was sought from the High Court was a fairly comprehensive essay on the legal effect of the 1965 Act, as amended, and the 1969 Regulations. The proceedings did not constitute a judicial review application attacking any part of Mr Chapman's report, although it would, in my opinion, have been open to the City Council to have sought leave to make such an application. The County Council could have formed its own view about the conflicting advice it had received from Mr Chapman and Mr Laurence, have dealt with Miss Robinson's application accordingly and have left it to the contestants, Miss Robinson and the City Council, to attack, if so advised, the manner in which the application had been dealt with or the decision that had been reached, or both. If that course had been taken by the County Council the issues for decision by the High Court, and on appeal by the Court of Appeal and this House, would have been formulated by the attack or attacks in question. The High Court would not have been presented, nor would the Court of Appeal or your Lordships, with the examination paper that these proceedings have set. I do not wish to be over-critical of the County Council's disinclination to come to a decision on Miss Robinson's application until all the legal issues which seemed to them to arise had been judicially resolved, but I do wonder whether all the 10 paragraphs of declaratory relief sought in this case can be brought within the legitimate boundaries of the courts' jurisdiction to grant such relief.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Diplock said in <i>Gouriet v Union of Post Office Workers</i> [1978] AC 435, 501 that:</p>

<p></p><ul>"the jurisdiction of the court is not to declare the law generally or to give advisory opinions; it is confined to declaring contested legal rights, subsisting or future, of the parties represented in the litigation before it and not those of anyone else."<p></p></ul>

<p>In Zamir and Woolf's <i>The Declaratory Judgment</i>, 2nd ed, at para 3.007, the author, Lord Woolf, refers to the <i>Royal College of Nursing</i> case [1981] AC 800 and the <i>Gillick</i> case [1986] AC 112 as providing "good examples of courts being prepared to grant declarations at the extreme end of their supervisory jurisdiction". In the former case the issue was whether a circular issued by the Department of Health and Social Security had mis-stated the law regarding termination of pregnancy by medical induction. The well-known <i>Gillick</i> case involved an allegation that a departmental circular about the legality of prescribing contraceptives for girls under the age of 16 was erroneous in law. In both these cases the issue for decision was clearly defined.</p>
