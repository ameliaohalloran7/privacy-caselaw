<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Sharp v Thomson</i> 1997 SC (HL) 66, 74G - H Lord Jauncey distinguished <i>Mitchells v Ferguson</i> on the ground that the disposition had been delivered to Donald's man of business and not to Carson.  But, although it does indeed appear from the pleadings that the disposition was delivered to Donald's man of business pending payment of the price and was never physically delivered to Carson, there is nothing to suggest that this was regarded as important once the price had actually been paid.  Lord Jauncey suggested that, to judge from his language, in <i>Heritable Reversionary Company v Millar </i>(1892) 19 R (HL) 43, 48 Lord Watson must have understood <i>Mitchells v Ferguson</i> as a case where the seller had not delivered the disposition.  But the report of the argument in the Appeal Cases, [1892] AC 578, 601, 603, suggests that counsel for both parties proceeded - rightly - on the basis that in <i>Mitchells </i>the disposition was to be treated as having been delivered.  Moreover, as will appear below, Lord Watson did not question the line of cases founded on <i>Mitchells</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122.&nbsp;&nbsp;At a general level, in <i>Mitchells v Ferguson </i>the court rejected the submission that the distinction between the position of a purchaser and the position of an adjudger had been overlooked in <i>Bell v Gartshore</i>.  Lord Braxfield said, 3 Ross's LC 120, 125, that "there never was a cause judged with more solemnity, nor by abler judges and lawyers, than the cause of Bell of Blackethouse";  if the distinction between a purchaser and adjudger was not "stirred" there, this was not because it was not thought of, but because counsel must have been of the opinion that it was not tenable.  The Lord President, the second Lord President Dundas of Arniston, listed, at p 126, a number of distinguished judges, including his father, who had all regarded <i>Bell v Gartshore</i> as fixed law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first argument for Ferguson has a bearing on one of the arguments for the appellants in this case.  Mr Gale submitted that, since Mrs Burnett could not have sold and disponed the flat without being guilty of fraud, the bare title should not be regarded as vesting in the trustee in her sequestration.  In <i>Mitchells v Ferguson </i>counsel for Ferguson argued that, since a person who grants a second disposition <i>in fraudem</i> of the first is guilty of a crime, the law will not compel any man to do this.  It would be equally repugnant to common sense and to law for the court, in an action of adjudication, to put itself in the position of the debtor and in effect to grant the adjudger the title that it would not have forced the debtor to grant.  In other words, if it would have been fraud on the part of Donald to dispone the house to the Mitchells, the court should not grant decree of adjudication of the house from him to the Mitchells.  In rejecting this argument Lord Braxfield observed, at p 125, that a bankrupt cannot grant a disposition to any particular creditor, but "will it thence follow that his creditors cannot adjudge because it would have been fraudulent in his debtor to give him a voluntary right?"  Similarly, in the present case, the mere fact that Mrs Burnett could not have disponed the house to a third party without committing a crime is no reason to hold that an individual creditor cannot adjudge or that under section 31(1) of the 1985 Act the act and warrant does not have the effect of an adjudication of her right in the flat to the trustee in her sequestration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;124.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second argument for Ferguson - which is also of importance for the present case - was that a <i>bona fide</i> second purchaser, who obtained information about the subjects from the register, would be deceived if he were cut out from his purchase by a personal and latent deed of the seller.  An adjudging creditor, however, who did not contract in reliance on the register but trusted solely to the personal security, could no more exclude an anterior disponee without infeftment than he could exclude an anterior disponee whose infeftment appeared in the register.  The adjudger had no <i>bona fides</i> to plead in relation either to his debtor or to the law.  An adjudger must be content to take that which he had adjudged, <i>tantum et tale</i>, as it stood in the person of his debtor.  Counsel for the Mitchells argued that the principle to be applied had been established in <i>Bell v Gartshore</i>:  personal deeds cannot affect feudal rights.  And it was this principle, and not any application of <i>bona fides</i>, that explained why a second disponee once infeft excludes a prior disponee remaining uninfeft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the later case of <i>Russell v Ross's Creditors </i>31 January 1792 FC;  M 10300;  sub nom <i>Pierse v Ross </i>3 Ross's LC 177, 180 Lord Braxfield was to declare that not one portion in his memorial in <i>Douglas v Adjudging Creditors of Kelhead </i>"but in my opinion is founded on the feudal law of Scotland."  It is clear that in <i>Mitchells v Ferguson </i>he applied that approach - while, in much the same way, Lord Monboddo dissented on the basis of his argument as opposing counsel in that case.  In Lord Monboddo's view, 3 Ross's LC 120, 126, the result reached by the majority was unjust:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Here the price was honestly paid;  possession was held for seven years;  and the purchaser was in the course of completing his titles:  a personal creditor steps in, adjudges, is infeft, and now seeks to carry off the subject.  This is unjust."<p></p></ul>
<p>In Lord Braxfield's view, on the other hand, all creditors, irrespective of whether or not they had relied on the register when transacting with the debtor, were to be regarded as having available for payment of their debts the debtor's heritable estate unqualified by any unrecorded personal rights.  Lord Braxfield considered that Ferguson's argument to the contrary was potentially dangerous because it would lead to fraud.  For instance, a debtor might grant a heritable bond to a creditor with a warrant to infeft and the creditor might not take an infeftment.  Other creditors, seeing the debtor in right of the estate and with no burden on the records, might lend large sums of money.  The heritable creditor would only have to turn up, produce his heritable right and tell the creditors that there was nothing for them since they could only take the estate with the burdens that were competent against the debtor.  The same would apply to marriage contract trustees who chose to leave the husband in possession and not to take an infeftment.  Lord Braxfield added, at p 125:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The principle of the feudal law is clear, that no feudal right can be burdened with a personal right;  and if the feudal right remains in the debtor, the adjudger takes it out of him by the adjudication.  The statute of 1661 affords a strong argument in favour of the respondents.  The reason that dispositions are not ordered to be recorded is, that they are mere personal deeds."<p></p></ul>
<p>As the report of counsel's argument, at p 123, shows, in this passage "1661" is a misprint for "1617".  Lord Hailes reports the beginning of the passage in this form, Hailes 879, 880:</p>
<p></p><ul>"A second disponee, with first infeftment, is preferred to the first disponee.  This is admitted:  but it is said that the case is different as to adjudications, which take the estate, <i>tantum et tale</i>, as it was in the author.  It is answered that feudal rights are not affected by personal.  As to <i>bona fides</i>, although <i>mala fides</i> may cut down a right, <i>bona fides</i> cannot establish a right.  The act 1617 says nothing to the contrary.  Reversion qualifies an infeftment, however latent it may be.  To prevent that inconvenience, the clause was thrown in in favour of purchasers.  Dispositions are not mentioned in the statute, for they do not affect the feudal right."<p></p></ul>
<p>The decision therefore seems to have proceeded on the basis of the fundamental point underlying the decision in <i>Bell v Gartshore</i>, that feudal rights were not affected by personal rights<i>.  </i>And personal creditors who had not actually consulted the register when initially deciding to contract with the debtor were entitled to found on this principle, just as surely as purchasers or heritable creditors who had.  The personal creditors could therefore adjudge the debtor's heritable estate free of any personal obligations.</p>
<i><p>The rule in favour of adjudgers eventually prevails</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;126.&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the solemn and, apparently, clear decision of the court about the position of adjudgers, in subsequent cases counsel continued to advance the argument that they should be treated differently from purchasers and heritable creditors.  For instance, the point was touched on in <i>Thomson v Douglas, Heron &amp; Co </i>15 November 1786 FC;  M 10229.  Thomson had disponed land to a man of business to sell and apply the proceeds for the behoof of Thomson.  The disponee omitted to insert this qualification in the procuratory of sasine and it did not appear on the register.  He then proceeded to borrow money and granted a heritable security in favour of Douglas, Heron &amp; Co.  Other creditors adjudged the property.  The court held that the allegations of fraud on the part of the disponee were irrelevant against the defenders' heritable securities but that they were relevant as to the creditors who had adjudged the property.  According to the Faculty Collection report, the court held, at p 454, that it had been found in decisions, which for the stability of the law ought not to be departed from, that adjudgers must take the right of their debtor <i>tantum et tale </i>as it was in his person.  But the Folio Dictionary report records, M 10299, that the point "was little discussed … and the court did not mean to lay down the rule in general, that adjudgers must take <i>tantum et tale</i>."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;127.&nbsp;&nbsp;However that may be, the decision raised sufficient doubts for Lord President Ilay Campbell to order a hearing in presence in <i>Russell v Ross's Creditors </i>31 January 1792 FC;  M 10300;  sub nom <i>Pierse v Ross </i>3 Ross's LC 177;  Campbell Collection of Session Papers Vol 64 (1792) No 40 (Advocates Library).  The argument proceeded on the basis of the memorials written by Lord Braxfield and Lord Monboddo as counsel in <i>Douglas v Adjudging Creditors of Kelhead</i>:  (1792) 3 Ross's LC 177, 180 and 185.  In the light of the hearing the court declared that the opinion in <i>Thomson v Douglas Heron &amp; Co</i> to the effect that adjudgers, unlike purchasers, must take the right of their debtor <i>tantum et tale</i>, had been erroneous.  The Lord President held, 3 Ross's LC 177, 182, that the issue of principle as to the position of adjudging creditors had already been settled in <i>Mitchells v Ferguson.  </i>See in addition his manuscript comments, obviously written at a later date, 3 Ross's Leading Cases 177, 184 - 185 and also Baron Hume's <i>Lectures</i> Vol 4, p 474.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;128.&nbsp;&nbsp;The argument continued to cause trouble, however, as is clear from <i>Smith v Taylor</i> 18 December 1795, Bell, <i>Treatise on the Law of Bankruptcy</i> Vol 1 (1800), p 52 note;  <i>Commentaries on the Law of Scotland </i>(7th edition (1870) by J M'Laren) Vol 1, p 308 note 3.  A debtor, who was not infeft, borrowed money on a heritable bond.  The creditor immediately took infeftment but this could not give him a real right since the debtor himself had not been infeft.  The debtor was sequestrated and the trustee was careful to make up his title without infefting the debtor, by dropping him out of the feudal progress.  The trustee thus had a real right, while the heritable creditor's right remained personal.  The heritable creditor argued, however, that the trustee, as representing the general creditors, could not take any better right than stood in their debtor.  The Lord Ordinary rejected this argument but the heritable creditor reclaimed and his argument was upheld.  Again, steps were taken to correct the position - this time, in <i>Buchan v Farquharson </i>24 May 1797 FC;  M 2905;  3 Ross's LC 137.  On 28 June 1788 Robert Gordon assigned a personal bond for 3000 merks to the Reverend Robert Farquharson.  Gordon was sequestrated on 19 July and the assignation was intimated on 4 August, but Gordon's estate did not vest in the trustee in bankruptcy until after that.  The trustee brought an action against Farquharson to reduce the assignation, inter alia because it had not been intimated until after the sequestration.  The court assoilzied Farquharson on the ground that the assignation had been completed by intimation before Gordon's estate had vested in the trustee.  A sequestration did not prevent a creditor from completing his right by any act independent of the consent of the debtor, such as intimating a previous assignation.  But the court also observed, FC at p 67:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The trustee on a bankrupt estate will be preferred to a creditor claiming on a voluntary disposition, granted before the sequestration, if the right of the trustee be first completed.  And therefore, the propriety of the decision, 8 December 1795, Taylor and Smith against Marshall, in so far as it went upon the supposition that the trustee in such case is bound to make good the previous voluntary disposition, may be doubted."<p></p></ul>
<p>Bell records, <i>Treatise on the Law of Bankruptcy</i> Vol 1, pp 52 - 53 note;  <i>Commentaries on the Law of Scotland </i>(7th edition) Vol 1, p 308 note 3, at pp 308 - 309:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It was observed from the bench, upon the above case of Smith and Taylor being quoted as a precedent, that the court ought entirely to disapprove of the decision, and of the principles on which it proceeded;  and in this opinion the whole court concurred.  The notion, it was observed, of the estate of a bankrupt going tantum et tale, as it existed in his person, into the hands of the trustee is erroneous, when it is pleaded to exclude a competition between the trustee and creditors who have obtained a disposition only from the bankrupt, without having as yet completed it by sasine.  While the deliverance upon the petition of sequestration is no bar, on the one hand, to such a creditor from going on to complete his right, yet if, on the other, he neglects so to do till after the trustee has vested the property in himself by a complete feudal title, the subject must unquestionably be carried to the creditors at large;  and the imperfect right of the earlier claimant superseded."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;129.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Wylie v Duncan </i>(1803) M 10269;  3 Ross's LC 134 Wylie sold certain tenements to Archibald who took infeftment on the disposition.  On the same day as he received the disposition Archibald granted a letter to Wylie binding himself to resell the tenements to Wylie on six months' notice.  The following year Archibald was sequestrated and the trustee, who was infeft, sold the tenements.  Wylie then produced the letter and insisted that the original transaction had been intended as a security for a loan.  He therefore claimed to be entitled to redeem the tenements on payment of the sum borrowed.  He brought proceedings against the trustee before the Glasgow magistrates who assoilzied the trustee.  Archibald appealed to the Court of Session, arguing that the trustee must take the debtor's property <i>tantum et tale</i>, subject to the right of redemption.  The Lord Ordinary found in favour of Archibald but the court allowed the trustee's reclaiming motion.  Lord President Campbell observed inter alia, 3 Ross's LC 134, 136 - 137:</p>
<p></p><ul>"<i>Tantum et tale </i>has often been pleaded against adjudgers;  and if good against them, would be so against trustees.  But the law for some time has held otherwise….  <i>Tantum et tale </i>is good as to objections, which go to the extinction of the subject adjudged;  eg if heritable bond adjudged, extinction is a good answer.  If right qualified <i>gremio</i>, that is also a good answer.  But if not, as here, and not going to extinction, it is a mere personal matter, which touches not the adjudger more than a lender on heritable bond….  As to an adjudger, <i>if there is </i> any doubt, let us solemnly hear the case.  But I hold that there is none.  He takes on the faith of the record, not <i>tantum et tale</i>."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;130.&nbsp;&nbsp;Precisely for the kinds of reasons that Lord Hoffmann has highlighted, the status of trusts which did not appear on the register continued to be debated.  That question was not settled until the decision of the House in <i>Heritable Reversionary Co Ltd v Millar </i>(1892) 19 R (HL) 43, 48.  For the rest, however, the tract of decisions just discussed appears to have gone a long way to settling that adjudgers and, hence, trustees in bankruptcy - just like <i>bona fide </i>purchasers - took the subjects free of any personal obligation on the part of the debtor.  Certainly, even by 1800, in his <i>Treatise on Bankruptcy</i> Vol 1, p 52 Bell felt able to state what he regarded as the settled doctrine in this way:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Thus, where a person sells a subject, and, before the purchaser's right is completed, sells it a second time, he is guilty of a crime known in Scotland by the name of Stellionate;  but although the vendor be liable to punishment, the right of the second purchaser, if first completed, is not affected by the vendor's fraudulent disappointment of the first.  And if the general creditors of the seller be substituted in the room of such second purchaser, and they be supposed to have completed their diligence before the real right of the first purchaser is completed, they will be liable to no exception on account of the debtor's fraud more than the individual purchaser would have been."<p></p></ul>
<p>The passage appears in very much the same form in Bell's <i>Commentaries on the Law of Scotland </i>(7th edition) Vol 1, p 308.  In a later passage of the <i>Treatise</i>, at p 82, Bell repeats the point:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is a corollary from this general rule, that the right first completed by sasine, whether it be voluntary or judicial, carries the property.  The purchaser of a feudal subject may have paid the price, and yet a creditor of the seller, or the trustee for the whole body of creditors, adjudging, or receiving a voluntary conveyance from the bankrupt (provided it is not objectionable on the bankrupt statutes) and taking the first infeftment, acquires a preference, leaving the purchaser to claim as a personal creditor merely."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;131.&nbsp;&nbsp;The decisions in <i>Buchan v Farquharson </i>and <i>Wylie v Duncan</i>, in particular, and these observations by Bell show that, for the last 200 years, in terms of the bankruptcy legislation, heritable property which the debtor has sold and disponed but on which the purchaser is not infeft has been regarded as forming part of the debtor's estate that vests in the trustee in sequestration by adjudication or, originally, by voluntary conveyance from the debtor.  Indeed, so far from there ever being any doubt about the bankruptcy statutes applying so as to vest such rights in the trustee, the actual live issue in the early days was whether the deliverance on the sequestration constituted a mid-impediment preventing a purchaser or a creditor under a heritable bond from taking sasine after the date of sequestration.  The point was settled in favour of the creditor and purchaser in <i>Cormack v Anderson </i>(1829) 7 S 868.  This meant that purchasers and heritable creditors could acquire a preference over the trustee by taking sasine and duly recording the instrument of sasine before the trustee completed his feudal title.  They were therefore to be regarded as rivals and opponents of the trustee and of the general creditors for whom he acted.  The trustee's right and the right of the purchaser, heritable creditor or assignee were "simply two independent rights running a race against each other":  <i>Tod's Trs v Wilson </i>(1869 ) 7 M 1100, 1103 per Lord Kinloch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;132.&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, once this general point had been established, competitions between uninfeft heritable creditors and purchasers and uninfeft trustees in sequestration were inevitable.  A rather special competition of this kind occurred in <i>Inglis v Mansfield </i>(1835) 1 S &amp; Macl 203 (HL);  sub nom <i>Mansfield v Walker's Trs </i>(1833) 11 S 813 (Court of Session).  In 1823 Josiah Walker, the admirer of Robert Burns and dilettante professor of Humanity at Glasgow University, agreed to lend £6,000 to James Stuart of Dunearn WS.  Stuart gave Walker a heritable bond which both parties apparently believed covered 95 acres of valuable land.  Walker took infeftment and the instrument of sasine was recorded in 1824.  In 1828 Stuart suddenly went abroad in bankrupt circumstances.  He was sequestrated on 1 September of that year and on 6 October Mansfield was confirmed as trustee in the sequestration.  In accordance with the procedure at the time, a decree of adjudication was pronounced in favour of the trustee.  It was recorded on 18 October.  On looking at the titles the trustee discovered that the security granted by Stuart in 1823 covered only five acres and he therefore proposed to claim the remainder of the land for the benefit of the general creditors.  At the request of agents for Walker and other parties to whom bonds had been granted, however, on 29 May 1829, from the safety of New York, Stuart granted what was described as "a bond of corroboration", in effect extending the security to cover the whole of the 95 acres, which were fully described.  Stuart also granted a precept on which sasine was taken on behalf of Walker and recorded on 13 July 1829.  Meanwhile, on 19 June, as required under the bankruptcy legislation at the time, Stuart had executed a special disposition in favour of the trustee so as to allow him to complete title to the heritable estate.  The trustee was infeft on 12 August 1829.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;133.&nbsp;&nbsp;The trustee then raised proceedings to reduce the bond of corroboration.  One ground, which is of no importance for present purposes, related to the Bankruptcy Act 1696.  The other ground was that the bond of corroboration and precept of sasine, which was the only possible basis for Walker being infeft in the 95 acres, had been granted subsequent to the period when Stuart's estates were specially adjudged and declared to belong to the trustee, "whereby the said James Stuart was divested thereof, and, consequently, the said disposition and infeftment thereon are null, as being granted <i>a non habente potestatem</i>."  Walker's defence was that the bond of corroboration had been executed in implement of an agreement that did not fall under the 1696 Act, "nor did the decreet of adjudication prevent Mr Stuart from granting such a deed, nor Mr Walker from taking infeftment in the lands, seeing that at the time when he did so the trustee had not obtained infeftment."  Walker died in 1831 and the defence of the action was taken over by his trustees, headed up by the Reverend Dr John Inglis, father of the future Lord President.  The Lord Ordinary reported the question to the Inner House and the Second Division consulted the other judges.  There was a division of opinion among the judges of the Court of Session, with both the Lord President and the Lord Justice Clerk favouring Walker's trustees.  But, in accordance with the views of the majority, decree of reduction of the bond of corroboration was pronounced.  Walker's trustees appealed to your Lordships' House, but the House dismissed the appeal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;134.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to notice that it was Walker who was first infeft on the additional lands in July 1829, by virtue of the bond of corroboration - the trustee in sequestration being infeft in the estate only in August.  Walker's trustees therefore argued that, at the time when Stuart granted the bond of corroboration, the real right in the lands remained vested in him - and so, when the real right subsequently vested in the trustee, it was subject to the security made real by Walker's infeftment on the bond.  The argument for the trustee was, in effect, that, irrespective of the strict feudal position, the deed impetrated from Stuart during the bankruptcy proceedings was void.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;135.&nbsp;&nbsp;The argument for Walker's trustees clearly caused Lord Brougham some anxiety when giving his initial views at the end of the hearing on 8 April 1835.  He indicated, 1 S &amp; Macl 203, 324, that his opinion was that section 29 of the bankruptcy statute "divests the bankrupt, although it does not invest the trustee until his feudal title shall be made up."  So neither the bankrupt nor the trustee could deal with the property - the bankrupt because the estate was vested in the trustee and the trustee because he could not give a feudal title until his investiture was completed.  Lord Brougham considered that nothing could be "more consistent with the principles of statute law, or less consistent with the principles of the common law, than that any fee should remain <i>in pendente</i>, or, as it is sometimes phrased, <i>in nubibus</i>."  When he came to give his considered reasons, four days later, Lord Brougham did not advert to the arguments on this point in detail, but simply affirmed, at pp 336 - 337, that, by reason of section 29 and other provisions of the bankruptcy statute, the adjudication in favour of the trustee "divests the bankrupt:  although, until the trustee makes up his title, he cannot convey by sale or encumbrance upon plain feudal principles, still it is enough to take the property out of the bankrupt…."  On this basis Lord Brougham held that Stuart had had no power to grant the bond of corroboration once the decree of adjudication in favour of the trustee had been pronounced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;136.&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal argument for Walker's trustees on this aspect of the case was, however, to the effect that, when Stuart's heritable estate was adjudged to the trustee for the general creditors under the bankruptcy statute, he took the estate <i>tantum et tale</i> as it stood in Stuart.  Either fraudulently or by <i>culpa lata</i>, Stuart had failed to dispone the 95 acres.  Had he done so, the lands would have been subject to a heritable security.  Therefore the trustee could not reduce the bond of corroboration which was simply designed to do what Stuart should have done in 1823.  This argument traversed many familiar features of the landscape, <i>Mitchells v Ferguson</i>, <i>Smith v Taylor</i>, <i>Buchan v Farquharson</i>, <i>Russell v Ross's Creditors </i>and <i>Wylie v Duncan</i>:  1 S &amp; M'L 203, 316.  In particular, the appellants reverted to the theme that adjudgers were people who had relied on the personal credit of the debtor rather than on the state of his heritable title in the register.  So there was no reason why they should be entitled to ignore personal obligations of the debtor simply because they had not entered the register:  1 S &amp; M'L 203, 297 - 300, 314 - 316.  The respondent argued that the <i>tantum et tale </i>doctrine went no further than to affect creditors and adjudgers where the debtor had originally acquired the property in question by fraud.  It did not apply where, as in that case, the debtor had acquired an unqualified title but, in the enjoyment of that unqualified right, he had come under an obligation, express or implied, to convey the right to another:  1 S &amp; M'L 203, 313 - 316, referring to the same tract of authority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;137.&nbsp;&nbsp;In his initial decision, at pp 326 - 327, Lord Brougham acquitted Stuart of any blame, far less of any fraud or <i>culpa lata</i>, in the original transaction in 1823 - thereby cutting away the basis of the appellants' argument.  Accordingly, in his final decision Lord Brougham did not deal with it in any detail.  He simply distinguished the English law relating to equitable interests and said, at pp 338 - 339:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Upon feudal principles, the party who first perfects his title by sasine (and since the act 1617, by registration also of his sasine) is preferred to him, who, at a prior time, may have paid his money on an agreement or obligation.  Land is only affected by the Scotch and the feudal law in a certain way.  Any other mode of conveying it, or burthening it, is as inept and as inefficient as a sale or mortgage by parole would be with us.  If, here, a man gave his money on a parole conveyance or mortgage, he would of course be cut out by one who the next month got a mortgage or conveyance, or even an equitable title, by a written agreement, from the same proprietor to the same lands.  This might be a hardship, and it is exactly the same kind of hardship which may happen in Scotland and which has happened here, with this only difference, that in Scotland writing may be as inefficient to affect the land as parole is here.  This consideration, too, is an answer to the argument, that the trustee takes the estate of the bankrupt <i>tantum et tale</i>.  He does so;  and the estate was not affected in the bankrupt's hands by the personal obligations, which were sufficiently valid and binding against the bankrupt.  Between the bankrupt and the trustee there can be no privity such as to affect the latter with any personal obligation incurred by the former;  and the land not being affected by such obligations, the trustee taking it <i>tantum et tale</i> takes it discharged of any real burthen."<p></p></ul>
