<p align="right"><a href="jamee-5.htm">(back to preceding text)</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;139.&nbsp;&nbsp;Eady J, having (in para 36), posed for himself the question whether  Mr Dorsey or the Wall Street Journal Europe had a "social or moral duty" to write and publish the article and, in it, to name the Jameel group, said, in para 41, that "more is required for privilege than that the subject of the defamatory allegations should be of public interest".  But that must depend on the nature of the public interest, the degree of its importance.  The 11 September 2001 background to the story and the importance, as a matter of public interest, of whether the Saudi authorities were, at the request of the United States authorities, monitoring the bank accounts of Saudi companies or individuals, entitled Mr Dorsey's report to be ranked as of very high public interest indeed.  Mr Dorsey had, as the jury accepted, been given the names of some of those whose accounts were said to be being monitored.  Mr Dorsey's ability to give the names added verisimilitude to his report.  He endeavoured to check, both by inquiries in Saudi Arabia and by inquiries in Washington DC, the accuracy of the information he had been given.  He received that confirmation in Washington, and I agree entirely with Lord Hoffmann's criticism (para 65 to para 78 of his opinion) of the judge's and the Court of Appeal's treatment of Mr Dorsey's and Mr Simpson's evidence about that confirmation.  Mr Dorsey said that he had received that confirmation also from four different sources in Saudi Arabia.  But, the judge having directed the jury that they must assume that the story that the Jameel group was on the list of those whose accounts were being monitored was false, the jury not surprisingly said that they did not accept that Mr Dorsey had had that story confirmed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;140.&nbsp;&nbsp;The direction was a misdirection.  It perpetrated much the same sort of error that was exposed by Lord Nicholls in <i>Bonnick v Morris.  </i>In deciding whether or not the criterion of responsible journalism had been met, the court should apply the standard of conduct expected of the journalist "in a <i>practical </i>and flexible manner" (emphasis added).  The question the jury should have been asked was whether Mr Dorsey had received the confirmation he claimed to have had that the name of the Jameel Group was on a list of those whose accounts were to be monitored that had been provided to the Saudis by the US authorities.  To preface the question by requiring the jury to assume the list to be non-existent deprived the jury's answers of any value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;141.&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter the judge took into account was that a response to the story had not been obtained from Mr Jameel.  He had been unavailable and a comment that Mr Dorsey had obtained from one of Mr Jameel's subordinates could not be used.  The judge concluded, and the Court of Appeal confirmed the conclusion, that the criterion of "responsible journalism" required that publication of the article be postponed until Mr Jameel could be contacted.  I disagree.  Mr Jameel did not know that his group's accounts were being monitored.  He was not in a position to deny that they were being monitored.  He could say no more than his subordinate had already told Mr Dorsey, namely, that his companies had no connection of any sort with terrorism and there was no reason for their accounts to be monitored.  He could have requested, or demanded, publication in the next edition of the Wall Street Journal Europe, of a response on those lines, but he never did so.  In the circumstances the newspaper's refusal to postpone publication of the story was not, in my opinion, a circumstance of any real weight in the scale for measuring the presence or absence of "responsible journalism".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;142.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally the judge appears to have regarded it as reprehensible or, at least, inconsistent with "responsible journalism" for the Wall Street Journal Europe to have published a story disclosing the names on a list that the US authorities had undertaken to keep confidential.  Coupled with this is the denial by SAMA and the Saudi banks that the list existed (see para 54 of the judgment).  In para 58 the judge said that</p>
<p></p><ul>"where there was an inter-governmental agreement not to reveal the names of those being investigated in the fight against terror, cogent grounds are required to show why the public interest called for that agreement to be breached."<p></p></ul>
<p>I would, for my part, answer that point in two ways.  First the importance of the story was not the identity of the names on the list but that there <i>was </i>such a list, evidencing the highly important and significant co-operation between the US and the Saudi authorities in the fight against terror.  The names gave credibility to the story.  Second, I know of no government that discloses information to which sensitivity may attach otherwise than with great reluctance.  Subject to D notices and the like, it is no part of the duty of the press to co-operate with any government, let alone foreign governments, whether friendly or not, in order to keep from the public information of public interest the disclosure of which cannot be said to be damaging to national interests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;143.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a case in which, as it seems to me, the information disclosed in Mr Dorsey's article was information of high importance and public interest not only, or even particularly, in this country but worldwide.  The public had a right to the disclosure of the information and the newspaper had a professional duty to disclose it.  The circumstances attending the writing of the story by Mr Dorsey and its publication by the Wall Street Journal Europe satisfied, in my opinion, the criterion of responsible journalism.  If the truth be that Mr Dorsey had failed to obtain confirmation of the story by Saudi sources, other than the Saudi source from whom he had obtained the story in the first place, nonetheless, in my opinion, the confirmation that Mr Simpson had obtained in Washington justified the publication of the story.  The criterion of responsible journalism, given the importance of the story, would have been satisfied.  I see no reason for the case to be referred back for a re-trial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;144.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would for these reasons uphold the privilege defence, allow the appeal, set aside the damages award and dismiss the action.  Having had the advantage of reading the respective opinions of my noble and learned friends on the qualified privilege point I am unable to discern any real differences of principle.  If, however, there are any, I want to express my full agreement with the reasons given by my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann.</p>
<i>
</i>
<p><b>BARONESS HALE OF RICHMOND</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;145.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two issues before us and on both of them I agree with the opinions expressed by my noble and learned friend, Lord Hoffmann. There is only a little I wish to add on the issue of "<i>Reynolds</i> privilege" but rather more on the issue of damage.</p>
<i></i><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Reynolds defence</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;146.&nbsp;&nbsp;It should by now be entirely clear that the <i>Reynolds</i> defence is a "different jurisprudential creature" from the law of privilege, although it is a natural development of that law. It springs from the general obligation of the press, media and other publishers to communicate important information upon matters of general public interest and the general right of the public to receive such information. It is not helpful to analyse the particular case in terms of a specific duty and a specific right to know. That can, as experience since <i>Reynolds</i> has shown, very easily lead to a narrow and rigid approach which defeats its object. In truth, it is a defence of publication in the public interest. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;147.&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not mean a free-for-all to publish without being damned. The public only have a right to be told if two conditions are fulfilled. First, there must be a real public interest in communicating and receiving the information. This is, as we all know, very different from saying that it is information which interests the public - the most vapid tittle-tattle about the activities of footballers' wives and girlfriends interests large sections of the public but no-one could claim any real public interest in our being told all about it. It is also different from the test suggested by Mr Robertson QC, on behalf of the Wall Street Journal Europe, of whether the information is "newsworthy". That is too subjective a test, based on the target audience, inclinations and interests of the particular publication. There must be some real public interest in having this information in the public domain. But this is less than a test that the public "need to know", which would be far too limited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;148.&nbsp;&nbsp;If ever there was a story which met the test, it must be this one. In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, it was in the interests of the whole world that the sources of funds for such atrocities be identified and if possible stopped. There was and should have been a lively public debate about this. Given the nationalities of the hi-jackers, this focussed particularly upon the efforts of the Saudi Arabian authorities. Anti-Saudi feeling was running high in some places. Information that the Saudis were actively co-operating, not only with the United Nations, but also with the United States was of great importance to that debate. This was, in effect, a pro-Saudi story, but one which, for internal reasons, the Saudi authorities were bound to deny. Without names, its impact would be much reduced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;149.&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the publisher must have taken the care that a responsible publisher would take to verify the information published. The actual steps taken will vary with the nature and sources of the information. But one would normally expect that the source or sources were ones which the publisher had good reason to think reliable, that the publisher himself believed the information to be true, and that he had done what he could to check it. We are frequently told that "fact checking" has gone out of fashion with the media. But a publisher who is to avoid the risk of liability if the information cannot later be proved to be true would be well-advised to do it. Part of this is, of course, taking reasonable steps to contact the people named for their comments. The requirements in "reportage" cases, where the publisher is simply reporting what others have said, may be rather different, but if the publisher does not himself believe the information to be true, he would be well-advised to make this clear. In any case, the tone in which the information is conveyed will be relevant to whether or not the publisher has behaved responsibly in passing it on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;150.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, as my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann has demonstrated, the publication of this story passed this test. We have to judge the steps which are known to have been taken against the background of the style and tone of the publication in general and the article in particular. This is not a newspaper with an interest in publishing any sensational information however inaccurate (or even in some cases invented). It is, as the journalist quoted by my noble and learned friend said, "gravely serious" (indeed some might find it seriously dull). We need more such serious journalism in this country and our defamation law should encourage rather than discourage it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;151.&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, My Lords, if the public interest defence does not succeed on the known facts of this case, it is hard to see it ever succeeding.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damage</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;152.&nbsp;&nbsp;The tort of defamation exists to protect, not the person or the pocket, but the reputation of the person defamed. Indeed, as Tony Weir points out in <i>A Casebook on Tort</i> (10th edition, 2004, at p 519), it is so tender to a person's reputation that it allows him to claim substantial damages without having to show that the statement was false, or that it did him any harm, or that the defendant was at fault in making it. In the case of an individual, all this is so well established that we have ceased to think it odd (if we ever did) and it would certainly take the intervention of Parliament to change it.  But the authority for the proposition that a company is in the same position as an individual is the Court of Appeal decision in <i>South Hetton Coal Company Limited v North-Eastern News Association Limited</i> [1894] 1 QB 133. This House is therefore free to overrule it, although of course it would only disturb an authority of such long-standing if there were good reason, in modern circumstances, to do so. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;153.&nbsp;&nbsp;Among those modern circumstances is the importance now attached in all developed democracies to freedom of expression, especially on matters of political interest. <i>South Hetton</i> was decided before there was universal suffrage in this country, so before we were a proper democracy. Since then, we have acceded to several international instruments which guarantee freedom of speech. The most important is article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, because we have not only an international but also a domestic obligation to comply with it. Article 10(2) acknowledges that the protection of a person's reputation is a legitimate aim which may justify the restriction of freedom of speech. This includes the reputation of a commercial company. The competing interests in "open debate about business practices" and "protecting the commercial success and viability of companies" mean that the state enjoys "a margin of appreciation as to the means it provides under domestic law to enable a company to challenge the truth, and limit the damage, of allegations which risk harming its reputation": see <i>Steel and Morris v United Kingdom</i> (2005) 41 EHRR 403, para 94 (the "McLibel Case"). Nevertheless, those means must be "necessary in a democratic society": ie they must meet a pressing social need and be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. One of the reasons why the European Court of Human Rights found that the award of damages against the defendants in the "McLibel" case was disproportionate was that "in accordance with the principles of English law, they were not required to, and did not, establish that they had in fact suffered any financial loss as a result of the publication": <i>ibid</i>, para 96.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;154.&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems, therefore, that while the retention of the rule that a company does not have to show that it has in fact been harmed in any way may be within our margin of appreciation, we should scrutinise its impact with some care to see whether it may have a disproportionately chilling effect upon freedom of speech. The earliest critical comment upon the rule in the United Kingdom to which we have been referred came again from Tony Weir, in a case-note on <i>Bognor Regis Urban District Council v Campion</i> [1972] 2 QB 169: see "Local Authority v Critical Ratepayer - A Suit in Defamation" [1972A] CLJ 238 (but see also "Libel and the Corporate Plaintiff" (1969) 69 Columbia Law Review 1496):</p>
<p></p><ul>"There is still some justification, however, for the rule that the human plaintiff need not prove any harm. If the statement is defamatory, he will feel bad and others will think badly of him; the first need not be proved and the second cannot be. Indeed, this duality of harm can be presumed precisely because it is required: you get damages only if someone has been rude <i>about</i> you <i>to</i> someone else."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it was absurd to give substantial damages to a trading company:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It was absurd because [the company] had no feelings which might have been hurt and no social relations which might have been impaired. The two kinds of presumptive harm could not be presumed because they could not have occurred. . . . the reasons for which we absolve the human plaintiff from the usual requirement of proving loss cannot and do not apply to the inhuman plaintiff …  To prefer the interest in maintaining the corporate image to the right of the citizen to say what he reasonably believes to be true is a grim perversion of values."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;155.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest it be thought that these are maverick academic views, it should be noted that amongst the recommendations of the <i>Report of the [Faulks] Committee on Defamation</i> (1975, Cmnd 5909, para 342) was the proposal that:</p>
<p></p><ul>"(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;No action in defamation should lie at the suit of any trading corporation unless such corporation can establish either - (i) that it has suffered special damage, or (ii) that the words were likely to cause it pecuniary damage.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Actions in defamation by non-trading corporations (including government bodies and local authorities) and trade unions should be subject to similar limitations."  <p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Faulks Committee were influenced by Mr Weir's views, and also by the well-known words, albeit uttered in a different context, of Lord Reid in <i>Lewis v Daily Telegraph</i> [1964] AC 234, at p 262:</p>
<p></p><ul>"A company cannot be injured in its feelings, it can only be injured in its pocket. Its reputation can be injured by a libel but that injury must sound in money. The injury need not necessarily be confined to loss of income. Its goodwill may be injured."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee included the likelihood of future financial damage because of the difficulty of proving "actual financial damage specifically flowing from a defamation": para 336. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;156.&nbsp;&nbsp;This recommendation was not enacted, although others were. Nevertheless, this House felt able to go further than the Committee had gone in relation to local authorities, when in <i>Derbyshire County Council v Times Newspapers Ltd</i> [1993] AC 534, it overruled the <i>Bognor Regis UDC</i> case and held that central and local government authorities could not sue in defamation at all. At p 547, Lord Keith of Kinkel, giving the only reasoned opinion, accepted that the cases cited "clearly establish that a trading corporation is entitled to sue in respect of defamatory matters which can be seen as having a tendency to damage it in the way of its business". He gave examples including deterring banks from lending, or the best qualified workers from joining, or a trade union's ability to keep its members, or a charity's ability to raise money. He then went on to distinguish governmental organisations on the grounds of democratic accountability. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;157.&nbsp;&nbsp;As none of the authorities cited by Lord Keith was binding upon this House, and the question of non-governmental corporate bodies was not before the House, it is open to us to take the matter further. It would require very little amendment to Lord Keith's formulation for us to reflect the recommendations of the Faulks Committee. Thus for the words "which can be seen as having a tendency to damage it in the way of its business" we could substitute "which can be shown to be likely to cause it financial loss". Indeed, Mr James Price QC, on behalf of the claimants, was keen to stress that Lord Keith's formulation was already something of a barrier to companies which could not show such a tendency. We cannot know whether Lord Keith, had the matter been in issue, would have accepted the invitation to require that corporations produce at least some evidence to support the likelihood that their pockets would indeed be injured in some way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;158.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, in my view such a requirement would achieve a proper balance between the right of a company to protect its reputation and the right of the press and public to be critical of it. These days, the dividing line between governmental and non-governmental organisations is increasingly difficult to draw. The power wielded by the major multi-national corporations is enormous and growing. The freedom to criticise them may be at least as important in a democratic society as the freedom to criticise the government. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;159.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these short reasons, I would have allowed the appeal against the award to the Company in any event. But as a majority of your Lordships take a different view, and the appeals against each claimant are in any event to be allowed on the <i>Reynolds</i> point, there is no need to say more.</p>
