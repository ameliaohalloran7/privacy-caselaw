<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;176. On 1 June 1999 a plane crashed on the runway at Little Rock Arkansas.  One of the passengers, Mrs Lloyd was wounded in the crash suffering multiple though not, in themselves, life-threatening injuries.  She was trapped for a while in the burning plane and claimed that she also had suffered debilitating emotional and psychological injuries which led to chronic post traumatic stress disorder and major depression.  The judge found that a sufficient causal connection had been established between her physical injuries and her 'mental injuries' (<i>sic</i>). (p.433)  This sufficed for her to succeed in full on her claim.  However he went on to consider briefly what would have been the case if that causal connection had not been established: could she prove that her post traumatic stress disorder was a physical manifestation of injury?  He followed <i>Weaver</i>, considered the expert evidence and found sufficient cause to find that her chronic post traumatic stress disorder caused biological, physical changes in brain function. (p.435)  Evidence is necessary to underpin the finding that post traumatic stress disorder is "a biological as well as an emotional and psychological illness". (p.436)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;177. District Judge Knapp reached similar conclusions <i>Turturro v Continental Airlines</i> (2001)  27 Avi 18,414.  In a careful review of the earlier decisions, he concluded that the Supreme Court's line drawing in <i>Floyd</i> had worked well. (p.419)  He also referred (p.420) to <i>Weaver</i> and <i>Little Rock</i> as cases where plaintiffs had successfully tendered evidence that extreme stress such as that experienced in near death situations or being taken hostage may actually change brain cell structure and cause a specific area of the brain to atrophy.  He recognised that it will not be in every case of post traumatic stress disorder that such biological abnormalities will have been caused and it will be necessary to prove by objective evidence that in the given case brain damage has ensued.  He therefore endorsed the course which the US cases were following.  He decided the case before him in favour of the carrier because the plaintiff had neither pleaded nor shown she could prove a case of <i>bodily injury</i>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;178. To summarise, there is clear support in the overseas authorities for the view I have expressed.  I believe that these authorities show an international acceptability for giving a natural meaning to the words <i>bodily injury</i> without imposing any artificial or restrictive gloss upon them.  This is the direction in which the jurisdiction which has to deal with the greatest volume of air passenger litigation, the United States, has moved.  It is supported by the decisions of the Courts of New South Wales.  If your Lordships adopt the same view as I have of the effect of Article 17, you will be promoting international uniformity rather than creating a risk that the law of the United Kingdom will be at odds with that elsewhere.  The decision in <i>Weaver</i> was, given the evidence there before the court, wholly unexceptionable.  It is in line with the US law and the natural meaning of the words <i>bodily injury</i>.  I accept that the judgment of the Court of Appeal in <i>Morris</i> is inconsistent with it.  I prefer the reasoning in <i>Weaver</i>.</p>
<i></i><p><i>The Arguments</i>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;179. What I have already said has covered most of the points raised in the argument of the appeals before us.  The extreme arguments in favour of the passengers cannot be accepted.  (Nos.7 and 8)  There is insufficient reason for reading the words of the first sentence of Article 17 as embracing everything which might be described as "personal injury" as opposed to damage to property or mere financial loss.  The actual language of Article 17 must be given effect to.  <i>Floyd</i> is to be preferred to <i>Daddon</i>.  I disagree with the majority of the First Division on this point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;180. Similarly, the various forms of the causation argument relied on by the carriers are likewise not acceptable.  (Nos.1, 2 and 3)  Argument No.6 which was also relied upon by the carriers conforms most closely to what I consider to be the correct understanding of the use of the words <i>bodily injury</i> but because it represents a paraphrase of them can give rise to error and the adoption of argument No.4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;181. An argument advanced by the carriers in support of their submissions was that if the Court of Appeal view was not accepted, there would be a flood of claims of non-specific injury which it would be expensive for carriers and their insurers to investigate and would be difficult for them to rebut.  This argument would have some force if the <i>Daddon</i> approach was to be adopted and mere emotional stress and upset were to be recoverable.  But the argument has no force if the passenger has to prove by the appropriate expert evidence some actual <i>bodily injury</i> in the sense which I have identified and is illustrated by <i>Weaver</i>.  The passenger will have to be able to make a specific claim of injury consequent upon the accident and support it by convincing expert evidence.  Any forensic difficulties for the carriers should be no greater than with, say, an alleged painful spinal injury.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;182. But there is a further version of the carriers' argument to which I should refer: it accepts that the criterion <i>bodily injury</i> provides a threshold which the passenger must cross (by the adducing the necessary evidence) but then argues that, even though the passenger has crossed the threshold, he is to be precluded from recovering for any 'mental injury'.  This argument seeks to use as an excluding criterion an unscientific expression ('mental injury') which lacks definition and fails to provide the requisite certainty.  An injury to the brain (or, indeed, some other part of the body) may cause a mental disorder, say some form of dementia or amnesia.  Suppose that the injury to the brain is accompanied by a fractured skull or merely was the result of some concussion or a minor stress-induced stroke.  In a proportion of such cases the sole external evidence of the injury may be the mental disorder.  The reasoning that seeks to exclude such a consequence from the scope of Article 17 encounters problems and it is these which the argument fails adequately to address.  What is the distinction between the fractured skull case and the concussion or minor stroke case unless it is to be some causal distinction (the causation argument) which is rightly rejected as unsound?  On the other hand, if all mental disorder cases are to be excluded, contrary to the US cases, what is the distinction between a brain injury which causes paralysis of a limb and one which causes amnesia?  The reality is that the use of the term  'mental injury' serves no useful defining purpose and is inconsistent with the US cases.  It has to be analysed down into some form of the causation argument or it has to become a restriction on the <i>damages</i> that can be recovered even though the threshold has been crossed.  Given an injury to the brain which was caused by the accident and which in its turn causes a mental disorder, the only way in which compensation for the mental disorder can be excluded is by introducing an arbitrary limit upon the consequences of the physical injury - the brain injury - which can be taken into account.  If of course there has been no injury to the brain, there will have been on these hypotheses no <i>bodily injury</i> and therefore no right to claim.  The <i>bodily injury</i> criterion as I have defined it provides a criterion whereas 'mental injury' does not.</p>
<i><p>The King Case:</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;183. On this appeal to the Inner House, the majority adopted the <i>Daddon</i> view with which I have said I disagree.  The pursuer specifically disclaimed any reliance upon the <i>Weaver</i> decision and, by necessary implication, declined to make any allegation of having suffered a <i>bodily injury</i> involving his brain.  Therefore I agree that the appeal to the Inner House should have failed and the order of the Lord Ordinary allowed to stand. </p>
