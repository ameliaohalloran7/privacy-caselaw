<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76.	I recognise that it is possible for something to be done in the litigation which may amount to a contractual act; the delivery of pleadings and similar documents are a form of communication.  Such communication can have a contractual significance which can and will still be given effect to.  Thus it is possible by a pleading to repudiate a contract or accept a repudiation as terminating the contract.  Similarly, a claim or defence may affect the substantive rights of a landlord and tenant <i>inter se</i>.  But the acts and omissions of the assured relied upon by the defendants in the present case are not of that character.  They are solely relevant as alleged failures to observe good faith under s.17.  The s.17 principle is a principle of law and if its rationale no longer applies and if its operation, the conferment of a right of avoidance, ceases to make commercial or legal sense then it should be treated as having been exhausted or at the least superceded by the rules of litigation.  It will also very often be the case that by the time the litigation has started the cover has expired or its subject matter has ceased to exist so as to make the continuing relationship of insurer and insured no longer current and the observation of good faith only significant to the litigation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77.	I am therefore strongly of the view that once the parties are in litigation it is the procedural rules which govern the extent of the disclosure which should be given in the litigation, not s.17 as such, though s.17 may influence the court in the exercise of its discretion.  The cases upon ship's papers, far from supporting the continuing application of the duty of good faith in truth support the opposite conclusion.  As previously discussed, the fact that orders for ship's papers were only made in marine insurance despite the fact that the principle of good faith applies to all insurance and the fact that the order was a matter of discretion not of right shows that it is a procedural remedy not a matter of contract although the principle of good faith clearly influenced the attitude of the court to making such an order.  But, most conclusively, the fact that the remedy was to obtain an order from the court and not to avoid the contract shows both the limits of the principle and the change of relationship which comes about when the parties are in hostile litigation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78.	Therefore this point must be decided against the defendants as well.</p>

<i><p>Conclusion:</p>

</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79.	I have in the course of this speech referred to some cases from other jurisdictions.  It is a striking feature of this branch of the law that other legal systems are increasingly discarding the more extreme features of the English law which allow an insurer to avoid liability on grounds which do not relate to the occurrence of the loss.  The most outspoken criticism of the English law of non-disclosure is to be found in the judgment in the South African case to which I have already referred, the <i>Mutual and Federal Insurance</i> case.  There is also evidence that it does not always command complete confidence even in this country: <i>CTI v Oceanus</i> [1984] 1 Lloyd's Rep 476, <i>Pan Atlantic v Pine Top</i> (<i>sup</i>).<i> </i> Such authorities show that suitable caution should be exercised in making any extensions to the existing law of non-disclosure and that the courts should be on their guard against the use of the principle of good faith to achieve results which are only questionably capable of being reconciled with the mutual character of the obligation to observe good faith.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80.	My Lords, the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be affirmed and the appeal should be dismissed with costs.  Your Lordships were invited by the Appellants to make a special order for costs relating to the adjournment of the hearing of this appeal from its previously scheduled date.  Having considered the submissions of the parties I do not consider that it would be appropriate to make the special order asked for.  In so far as the Respondents may seek to recover any additional costs as a result of the adjournment, that will be a matter to be scrutinised on taxation in the usual way. </p>

<p><b>LORD SCOTT OF FOSCOTE</b></p>

<p>My Lords,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81.	There are two issues of some general importance that arise in this appeal.  The first point arises under section 17 of the Marine Insurance Act 1906:</p>

<p></p><ul>"17.	A contract of marine insurance is a contract based upon the utmost good faith, and, if the utmost good faith be not observed by either party, the contract may be avoided by the other party."<p></p></ul>

<p>Sections 18, 19 and 20 of the Act spell out in some detail the content of the duty of disclosure owed by the assured to the insurer before the contract is concluded and the yardstick for assessing whether a representation made by the assured to the insurer is material and is true.  It might have been possible at one time to treat section 17 as merely an introduction to sections 18, 19 and 20.  But if that were ever possible it is so no longer.  The duty of utmost good faith has been held to apply where an assured is obliged under an existing policy to give notice of entry into a war risk zone <i>(The Litsion Pride</i> [1985] 1 Lloyd's Rep 437) and to the obligation of an assured to give notice when seeking to take advantage of a "held covered" clause in an existing policy <i>(Overseas Commodities Ltd v Style</i> [1958]  1 Lloyd's Rep 546;  <i>Liberian Insurance Agency Inc v Mosse</i> [1977]  2 Lloyd's Rep 560).  It has been held, also, to give rights of inspection under re-insurance treaties (<i>Phoenix General Insurance Co of Greece SA  v Halvanon Insurance Co Ltd</i> [1985]  2 Lloyd's Rep 599).  And the section 17 duty has repeatedly been held to be owing in the context of claims.  A dishonest claim constitutes a breach by the assured of section 17 and entitles the insurers to avoid the insurance contract.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82.	The present case involves a claim.  The respondent on this appeal, Manifest Shipping Company Ltd (Manifest), made a claim under policies of marine insurance in respect of which the appellant insurers have been sued as representative underwriters.  The vessel insured was the <i>Star Sea</i>.  It was insured against marine perils, including fire, for US $ 3.2 million.  As a result of a fire in the engine room workshop on 29 May 1990, the <i>Star Sea</i> became a constructive total loss.  A claim was made and on 3 August 1990 a writ was issued.  The writ was served on 4 September 1990.  It has not been suggested that the claim was not honestly made nor that the continued prosecution of the claim was or is dishonest.  What is complained of is, first, that two accident reports into the causes of a fire on a vessel, the <i>Kastora</i>, which, like the <i>Star Sea</i>, was part of a fleet of over 30 vessels beneficially owned by the Kollakis family, had not been disclosed to the insurers.  Both reports had been made by Dr Atherton, the shipowner's expert.  As to the first report, privilege was claimed for it.  Privilege would have been claimed for the second report as well, but the second report had been accidentally mislaid and overlooked and was not re-discovered until the second day of the trial.  Privilege was eventually, during the trial, waived in respect of both reports.  The insurers' complaint, however, is that the claim was formally made and persisted in for a considerable period without disclosure of these reports.  The failure to disclose them is categorised as a breach of the section 17 duty of utmost good faith and the insurers claim to be entitled, as a consequence, to avoid the insurance contract.  The insurers complain, also, that a Mr Nicholaidis, a director of Kappa Maritime Ltd, an English company that managed the Kollakis fleet, gave certain evidence which the trial judge, Tuckey J disbelieved.  Mr Nicholaidis had particular responsibility for technical matters and his giving of the disbelieved evidence is represented as constituting a breach by the assured of its continuing section 17 duty of utmost good faith.  The trial judge, Tuckey J, concluded that the section 17 duty owed by the assured came to an end once court proceedings had been commenced.  At that point, in his view, court procedures and court sanctions, embodied in Rules of Court and practice directions, would supersede and replace any statutory obligations under section 17.  He said, [1995] 1  Lloyd's Rep 651, 667 (rt. col):</p>

<p></p><ul>"I think, as a matter of principle, that the English courts should hold that once insurers have rejected a claim, the duty of utmost good faith in relation to that claim comes to an end.  There is a logic to this which was well summarised by the court in Connecticut."<p></p></ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83.	The judge's reference to the Connecticut court is a reference to the judgment of the Supreme Court of Connecticut in <i>Rego v. Connecticut Insurance Placement Facility</i> ((1991) 593 A2d 491).  Callahan AJ, in whose opinion the other Justices concurred, said this:</p>

<p></p><ul>"If the insurer denies liability and compels the insured to bring suit, the rights of the parties are fixed as of that time for it is assumed that the insurer, in good faith, then has sound reasons based upon the terms of the policy for denying the claim of the insured.  To permit the insurer to await the testimony at trial to create a further ground for escape from its contractual obligation is inconsistent with the function the trial normally serves."  (p 497)<p></p></ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84.	The Court of Appeal, in the present case [1997] 1 Lloyd'd Rep 360, did not endorse Tuckey J's conclusion that the section 17 duty came to an end where court proceedings began, but arrived at the same result via a different route.  The Court of Appeal held that at the claim stage, and after the claim had been made, the section 17 duty required no more than that the claim should not be made, or persisted in, fraudulently: </p>

<p></p><ul>"When the assured makes his claim, the duty of utmost good faith requires that it should not be made fraudulently; and we are prepared to contemplate that the duty not to present a fraudulent claim subsumes a duty not to prosecute a claim fraudulently in litigation.  There is no need to demand more of the assured than that, if the Draconian remedy is to apply."  (p 371).<p></p></ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85.	So, on this first point, the issues for your Lordships are, first, the duration of the section 17 duty - does it continue beyond the making of the claim and the issue of court proceedings prosecuting the claim? - and, second, the content of the duty at the claim stage and thereafter - was the Court of Appeal right in confining the duty to a duty to refrain from the fraudulent presentation or prosecution of a claim and, more particularly, can the matters on which the insurers rely suffice to constitute a breach of the assured's section 17 duty?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86.	The second important point for decision arises under section 39(5) of the 1906 Act:</p>

<p></p><ul>"39 (5)	In a time policy there is no implied warranty that the ship shall be seaworthy at any stage of the adventure, but where, with the privity of the assured, the ship is sent to sea in an unseaworthy state, the insurer is not liable for any loss attributable to unseaworthiness."<p></p></ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87.	The policies under which the <i>Star Sea</i> was insured were time policies.  Tuckey J., at trial, found that the <i>Star Sea</i> was unseaworthy in two relevant respects.  First, he found that the master was incompetent in not knowing the manner in which the vessel's CO<sub>2</sub> fire extinguishing system should properly be used.  Secondly, he found that the condition of the port and starboard engine room dampers was such that when operated they did not provide an effective seal, thereby reducing the efficacy of the CO<sub>2</sub>  system.  He found that both these matters were causative in enabling the fire to spread and to render the vessel a constructive total loss.  But for the combined effect of these failures, the indemnity to which the assured would have been entitled would have been limited to US $1.7 million - as opposed to US $3.2 million, the insured value of the vessel.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88.	The critical issue was whether the assured knew of the two matters in respect of which unseaworthiness was found.  This issue required an examination of the concept of "privity".  It was not alleged that any of the individuals whose state of mind might be taken to be that of the assured for section 39(5) purposes had actual knowledge that the <i>Star Sea</i> was unseaworthy in either of the two respects found.  What was said, however, was that there was "blind-eye" knowledge.  It was common ground that each of the two Kollakis brothers, Mr Pantelis (Lou) Kollakis and Mr George Kollakis, could be treated as the assured for section 39(5) purposes.  Tuckey J concluded that, in addition, a  Mr Faraklas should be so treated.  Mr Faraklas was one of the two directors of Charterwell Maritime SA, a Greek company based in Piraeus and the registered managers of the <i>Star Sea</i>.  He was also the sole director of the assured.  Tuckey J considered the position of Mr Nicholaidis but concluded he did not qualify for inclusion.  On this point, the Court of Appeal disagreed.  So there are, in the end, four individuals, namely, the Kollakis brothers, Mr Faraklas and Mr Nicholaidis, whose state of mind has to be considered.  Tuckey J, addressing himself to the states of mind of the Kollakis brothers and Mr Faraklas, made a finding of "blind-eye" knowledge on the part of the assured in respect both of the incompetence of the master regarding the CO<sub>2</sub> fire-fighting equipment and of the defective state of the <i>Star Sea's</i> dampers.  He reached this conclusion by the following route.  There had, within the period of 15 months or so before the <i>Star Sea</i> embarked upon its disastrous voyage also, been a fire leading to a constructive total loss on two other vessels in the Kollakis fleet, namely the <i>Centaurus</i> and the <i>Kastora</i>.  The accident reports that followed these fires had revealed a degree of ignorance on the part of the master of each vessel of the proper use to be made of CO<sub>2</sub> firefighting equipment and of the possibility (in the case of the <i>Centaurus</i>) and the near certainty (in the case of the <i>Kastora</i>) that the faulty state of the vessel's dampers had prevented, or would have prevented if the CO<sub>2</sub> equipment had been properly used, the effective sealing of the site of the fire.  Tuckey J found on the evidence that the accident report relating to the <i>Centaurus</i> had come to the attention of the assured.  Two reports on the fire on the <i>Kastora</i> had been made, both by Dr Atherton.  Tuckey J found that the assured, via one or other of the Kollakis brothers or Mr Faraklas, had become aware of the master's excessive delay in ordering the CO<sub>2</sub> firefighting equipment to be used and of the defective state of the vessel's dampers.</p>

<p>89.	He then posed the question, at p 663:  "So much for what the assured learned from the two earlier fires.  What did they do about it?" and answered the question by saying "I am in no doubt that the assured's response to the earlier fires was completely inadequate."  In the following passage, at p 664, the judge expressed his conclusion on the critical issue of privity:</p>

<p></p><ul>"I do find that there was blind eye knowledge on the part of the assured.  The inadequate response to the earlier fires and the state of the <i>Star Sea</i> on 27 May [1990], demonstrate in my judgment that the assured did not want to know about her unseaworthiness in the relevant respects."<p></p></ul>

<p>Tuckey J reduced the assured's recovery from the US $3.2 million to US $1.7 million.  He did so on the footing that the <i>Star Sea</i> was, "with the privity of the assured", sent to sea in May 1990 with a master incompetent in the use of CO<sub>2</sub> firefighting equipment and with faulty dampers incapable of sealing off the engine room.  The Court of Appeal disagreed that the requisite privity had been demonstrated.  The court concluded that the judge's findings relevant to this issue "[come] down simply to a finding of negligence, albeit negligence in a high degree"   (p 377).  The court, therefore, allowed the assured to recover the full US $3.2 million.  Accordingly, the question of principle for your Lordships is what, short of actual knowledge, has to be shown for a section 39(5) finding of "privity" to be made.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90.	Before your Lordships the allegations on the back of which a breach of the section 17 duty is sought to be constructed are levelled against Mr Nicholaidis and against the assured's solicitors, Hill Taylor Dickinson, whose partner, Mr Mallin, had charge of the case.  As against Mr Nicholaidis, the allegation is that he dishonestly included in his witness statement a passage which to his knowledge was untrue.  As against the solicitors, the allegation is that Mr Mallin resorted to underhand and unconscionable, albeit not dishonest, tactics in suppressing the Atherton reports for as long as possible.  Mr Jonathan Sumption QC, for the assured, has taken us through the relevant facts in order to submit that they simply do not sustain the weight that the insurers need them to bear.  The importance of the section 17 issue in your Lordships' House relates to law and principle.  But charges against Mr Mallin of underhand or unconscionable conduct and against Mr Nicholaidis of dishonesty are, I am sure, of more importance to them than the state of marine insurance law.  It would not, in my opinion, be right to decide the section 17 issue in favour of the assured on grounds simply of legal principle.  The solicitors and Mr Nicholaidis are entitled, in my opinion, to have your Lordships' view as to whether, on the evidence the serious allegations made against them are sustainable. </p>

<p>91.	In my opinion, the allegations are not sustainable.  Let me take first the allegations against Mr Mallin.  He was, I will assume, responsible for the decision not to disclose to the insurers the existence of privileged documents, namely, the two Atherton reports until such time as the privilege had been waived.  This is not surprising.  It was common ground before your Lordships that the reports were privileged.  Solicitors do not disclose in litigation documents which are entitled to privilege.  They would risk being sued if they did.  Mr Gordon Pollock QC, counsel for the insurers, suggested to your Lordships that Mr Mallin's motive in withholding the first report (the second was missing until the second day of the trial) was to improve the assured's chances of obtaining a favourable settlement before trial.  There was, however, no evidence at all to support that suggestion.  It had apparently never been put to Mr Mallin that that had been his motive.  Mr Pollock explained that his suggestion was based upon an inference that that had been the motive.  My Lords, I do not think an imputation of a discreditable motive can be properly so based.  Mr Mallin was entitled to have the imputation put to him so that he could deal with it.  The inference is neither an obvious one nor an inescapable one.  The obvious inference, and the one that in the absence of any other evidence I would myself draw, is that the withholding of a privileged document is no more than the instinctive action of a solicitor experienced in litigation.  Mr Pollock drew our attention to the judge's description of passages in Dr Atherton's witness statement as being "disingenuous" in that no reference was made in the statement to the contents of his two reports (see pp 670/671).  Mr Pollock invited us to infer that Mr Mallin had asked Dr Atherton to draft his witness statement omitting any reference to his reports.  But this, too, was not put to Mr Mallin.  Moreover Tuckey J expressly exonerated Mr Mallin from criticism arising out of the contents of Mr Atherton's witness statement (p 671).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92.	In my opinion, the evidence in the case does not warrant any imputation of underhand or unconscionable behaviour against Mr Mallin.  I am prepared to assume, without deciding, that the conduct of solicitors in conducting litigation can be attributed for section 17 purposes to the assured, their client.  The insurers' section 17 case, however, in so far as it is based upon the conduct of Mr Mallin in the conduct of the litigation, is based upon conduct that it is accepted was not dishonest and that cannot, for the reasons I have given, be characterised as underhand and unconscionable. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93.	As to Mr Nicholaidis, it is true that Tuckey J preferred other evidence to that given by Mr Nicholaidis.  But in doing so he did not say that he thought Mr Nicholaidis had given dishonest evidence.  A charge of giving dishonest evidence made against a witness requires, in my opinion, something more than that the judge has not accepted his evidence and has preferred the evidence of someone else.  Leggatt LJ in the Court of Appeal used the word "dishonesty" when referring to Mr Nicholaidis' state of mind (p 367).  But in the passage in question, Leggatt LJ was addressing the question whether Mr Nicholaidis' knowledge and state of mind could be taken to be that of the assured for section 17 purposes.  He held that it could not.  He was not, as I read the judgment, adding a finding of the giving of dishonest evidence to the findings about Mr Nicholaidis that Tuckey J had made.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94.	Leggatt LJ went on to say that Mr Nicholaidis' evidence about what he knew of the defective state of the fire dampers on the <i>Kastora</i> - the evidence that had been disbelieved by the judge - could not be attributed to the assured.  I respectfully agree with that conclusion.  It follows that Mr Nicholaidis evidence and state of mind does not constitute a route whereby a section 17 breach of duty can be brought home to the assured.  I now turn to the section 17 point of principle.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95.	It is accepted that the section 17 duty of the utmost good faith continues to apply after the conclusion of the insurance contract.  It does not follow, however, that the content is the same after the contract as before.  Indeed it cannot be.  Sections 18 to 20 prescribe the contents of the pre-contract duty in terms which are inapplicable thereafter.  It is very possible for the duty that pre-contract is owed by an assured  to be broken by an act or omission which would not in ordinary language be described as a breach of good faith at all.  Under section 18(1) the assured is deemed to know, and is therefore under an obligation to disclose, "every circumstance which, in the ordinary course of business, ought to be known by him" (see also section 19(a)).  So an honest failure to disclose something of which  the assured was in fact unaware may constitute a breach of duty.  Consider also the concept of materiality.  The duty to disclose extends to "every material circumstance" known to the assured (s. 18(1)) or to the assured's agent (s. 19(a)).  The test of what is material is an objective one.  An honest belief by the assured, or the agent, that a particular circumstance is not material, or an honest oversight of the materiality of a particular circumstance, will not assist the assured if, objectively viewed, the circumstance was material.  I need not, perhaps, labour the point that a breach of section 18 or section 19 duty may arise notwithstanding the good faith of the assured.  The addition of the adjective "utmost" does not affect the point.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96.	It seems to me clear, therefore, that the content of the duty of "utmost good faith" post-contract must be examined afresh and is not coloured by the extent of the duty owed by the assured pre-contract.  That this is so is demonstrated also by authority.  <i>Cory v Patton</i> (1872)  7 QB 304 establishes the general proposition that the duty on the assured to disclose a fact material to the risk being undertaken by the insurer does not continue after the insured has become bound by the insurance contract.</p>

<i></i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97.<i>	Niger Co Ltd v Guardian Assurance Co Ltd </i>(1922) 13 LlLR 75 concerned a continuing policy terminable by three months notice.  It was held in your Lordships' House that no duty lay on the assured to disclose to the insurers post-contract facts which, if known, might have induced the insurer to exercise its right to terminate the contract.  Viscount Sumner said this:</p>

<p></p><ul>"The object of disclosure being to inform the underwriter's mind on matters immediately under his consideration, with reference to the taking or refusing of a risk then offered to him, I think it would be going beyond the principle to say that each and every change in an insurance contract creates an occasion on which a general disclosure becomes obligatory, merely because the altered contract is not the unaltered contract, and therefore the alteration is a transaction as the result of which a new contract of insurance comes into existence.  This would turn what is an indispensable shield for the underwriter into an engine of oppression against the assured."  (p 82)<p></p></ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98.	In the same case in the Court of Appeal, Bankes LJ had commented "if people enter into contracts of insurance for long periods, it would be a wise precaution to insert some provision requiring notice to be given them if the nature of the risk does alter or vary appreciably."  ((1921) 6 LlLR 239, 245).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99.	Plainly enough, neither in the Court of Appeal nor in this House was it regarded as a breach of the section 17 duty for the assured to fail to disclose facts within his knowledge which, if disclosed, might have induced the insurer to terminate the policy.</p>

<i></i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100.<i>	Cory v Patton </i>and <i>Niger Co Ltd v Guardian Assurance Co Ltd</i> were followed in New South Wales by Rogers J in <i>NSW Medical Defence Union Ltd v Transport Industries Insurance Co Ltd</i> (1985)  4 NSWLR 107.  Rogers J held that it was not a breach of the continuing duty of good faith for an assured to fail to volunteer to the insurer information material to whether the insured would exercise a right to give notice terminating the contract.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101.	Finally on this point I should refer to <i>New Hampshire Insurance Co  v MGN Ltd</i> [1997]  LRLR 24.  Counsel for the insurer had submitted that where under a policy there was continuing cover subject to a right on the insurers to cancel on notice, an obligation of disclosure lay on the assured and extended to facts relevant to a decision by the insurer whether or not to cancel.  The Court of Appeal rejected this submission.  Potter J, at first instance, described it as "an unwarranted extension of the principle of disclosure" (p 47).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102.	These authorities make clear that the content of the duty of good faith owed by an assured post-contract is not the same as the duty owed in the pre-contract stage.  So what is the content of the duty owed at the claim stage?  It is, at least, that of honesty in the presentation of a claim.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103.	In <i>Britton v Royal Insurance Co</i> (1866) 4F&amp;F 905, 909 Willes J told a jury that:</p>

<p></p><ul>"The law is, that a person who has made such a fraudulent claim could not be permitted to recover at all.  The contract of insurance is one of perfect good faith on both sides, and it is most important that such good faith should be maintained…. It would be most dangerous to permit parties to practise such frauds, and then, notwithstanding their falsehood and fraud, to recover the real value of the goods consumed."<p></p></ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104.	Views to the same effect were expressed in <i>Orakpo v Barclays Insurance Services</i> [1995]  LRLR 443 and in <i>Galloway v. Guardian Royal Exchange (UK) Ltd </i> [1999]  Lloyd's Rep IR 209.  <i>The Michael</i> [1979]  2 Lloyd'd Rep 1 was a case in which a claim under a policy of marine insurance had been presented honestly.  But after the claim had been presented the assured became aware, or had grounds to suspect, that the loss of the insured vessel had been caused not, as had been thought, by perils of the seas, but by scuttling.  This information had not been passed on to the insurers.  The insurers' reliance on this non-disclosure to avoid the policy failed on the facts.  The court was not prepared to find or infer that the claim, honestly presented, had subsequently been dishonestly maintained.  Roskill L.J. dealt with this issue in the following passage, at p 22:</p>

<p></p><ul>"As to the allegation of subsequently maintaining a fraudulent claim, Piermay and Mr Pierrakos are not to be found guilty of fraud merely because, with the wisdom of hindsight, they had information which might, if appreciated at its true value, have led them to the truth at an earlier date.  A plaintiff in litigation is not maintaining a fraudulent claim merely because during interlocutory proceedings he or his solicitors become aware of evidence which may militate against the correctness of the plaintiff's case and its likelihood of ultimate success.  The relevant test must be honest belief."<p></p></ul>
