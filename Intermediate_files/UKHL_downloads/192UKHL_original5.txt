<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal took a different view on the law and the facts. After a full review of authority, Jonathan Parker LJ concluded that s.14A is concerned with knowledge of facts, rather than law, that the claimants' allegations of negligence were relevant under subsection 8(a) as identifying the acts or omissions claimed to have caused the loss or damage in respect of which damages are sought, and that "knowledge" in s.14A means "know with sufficient confidence to justify embarking on the preliminaries to the issue of a writ", while "attributable â€¦ to" in subsection 8(a) means "capable of being attributed to". On the facts, Jonathan Parker LJ pointed to other "possible causes for the failure of the company", notably uncertainties over the future of farm income, the effect of BSE and the strong pound, as well as the alleged activities of a director, Mr Brunt. He took as a finding of fact, and himself also endorsed, a statement by HHJ Playford in his judgment that the claimants' investigation into a possible causal link between their losses and Fawcetts' advice or lack of it "did not even commence until May 1999". On that basis, he concluded that Mr Haward and hence the other claimants "did not acquire the requisite actual knowledge prior to 6 December 1998" (paragraph 170). He recorded at paragraphs 86 and 143-4 that Fawcetts had sought, by respondents' notice and in oral submissions, to raise issues of constructive knowledge on Mr Haward's part under s.14A(10), but he refused at paragraphs 170-171 to entertain any such issue, because it was not investigated and no cross-examination was directed to it at trial before HHJ Playford. Potter LJ agreed with Jonathan Parker LJ's analysis of authority and conclusion. Charles J also agreed, adding that in his view the act or omission alleged to constitute Fawcetts' negligence was not simply their advice, but rather that there were causes of the continuing losses and increasing deficit "which existed and should have been identified by Fawcetts at the times that the relevant purchase and investments were made", but of which the claimants did not become aware until May 1999.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before your Lordships Fawcetts as appellants have not sought to rely on any suggestion of constructive knowledge under s.14A(10). The case is thus a special, and I would think unusual, one, concerned only with the issue of Mr Haward's actual knowledge of the matters referred to in s.14A.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law</p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under s.14A the onus is on a claimant to plead and prove that he first had the knowledge required for bringing his action within a period of three years prior to its bringing. Subsection (6) of s.14A distinguishes two aspects of the knowledge required. The first aspect relates to the seriousness of the damage, the second to "the other facts relevant to the current action" including in particular that such damage was attributable in whole or part to the act or omission alleged to constitute negligence and the identity of the defendant. The seriousness of the damage is relevant because there may be cases where, although it is known that loss has been suffered due to the negligence of another person, the loss may appear for a time so minor that no-one would contemplate instituting proceedings. That is I think more likely in the area of personal injuries and fatal accidents, covered by s.14 on which s.14A(7) to (10) were modelled, than in the area covered by s.14A itself. In both areas, the statutory language assumes that it is known that there has been some injury (under s.14) or damage (under s.14A). But this too can give rise to difficulty. If a doctor advises that it is necessary to operate, or to remove a breast, in order to remove a malignant tumour, one would not usually speak of the patient sustaining an injury until one knew that the diagnosis was misconceived and there was no such tumour. Similarly, if a financial adviser advises in favour of an investment, one would not describe the making of the investment itself as "damage" until one discovered that it had been a bad or unsound investment from the outset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107.&nbsp;&nbsp;In such cases, there is an inter-play between knowledge of what would ordinarily be regarded as injury or damage and knowledge regarding the factual circumstances in which the operation or investment occurred. Yet, the first aspect of the knowledge required relates to damage of sufficient seriousness "to justify [the claimant] instituting proceedings", whereas the knowledge required regarding the attributability of such damage to some act or omission of the defendants is, as will appear, not necessarily such knowledge as to justify proceedings. To maintain a coherent scheme, the better view therefore appears to be to treat the first aspect of knowledge as relating solely to matters of quantum and all questions regarding the evaluation or classification of damage as such as falling within the second aspect of the knowledge required. This is also the view taken in authority: see <i>Dobbie v. Medway Health Authority </i>[1994] 1 WLR 1234, 1241G-1242A, per Sir Thomas Bingham MR. In the present case, the judge said that Mr Haward knew by 6th December 1998 that at any rate part of the large investments which had been made in HAL would not be recovered and had become lost, whatever happened to HAL. But that is not the same as saying that he knew that the investments were bad from the outset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second aspect of knowledge required under s.14A is that the damage was attributable in whole or part to the act or omission which is alleged to constitute negligence. It is clear from both the heading and language of s.14A that this aspect deals with difficulties facing a claimant separate from those which are presented by cases where the fact or quantum of damage itself is latent. The background to s.14A confirms this. The 20th Report of the Law Reform Committee of May 1974 (Cmnd. 5630) led to the definition of knowledge in personal injury cases in the Limitation Act 1975, which became by consolidation s.14 of the Limitation Act 1980. In paragraphs 42, 49 and 54-55, the Law Reform Committee treated the two aspects as independent. In particular in paragraph 49 it said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It has not been suggested to us, and in our view could not reasonably be suggested, that the plaintiff's date of knowledge should arrive until he has knowledge (actual or constructive) both of his injured condition and of its having been caused by an act or omission of the defendant."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee went on to consider whether there should be any further requirement that the plaintiff should know that he had a worthwhile cause of action, or (taking an intermediate possibility suggested, uniquely, by Lord Pearson in <i>Central Asbestos v. Dodd </i>[1973] AC 518) that he should at least be aware that his injury was attributable to some fault of the defendant. They rejected both possibilities. At paragraph 55, they therefore accepted as (they believed) "a date capable of precise definition and not presenting any particular difficulties of proof" the date "when the plaintiff has knowledge, actual or constructive, both of his injured condition and of its having been caused by acts or omissions of the defendant". In the later Law Reform Committee's 24th Report (Latent Damage) of November 1984, which led to the insertion by the Latent Damage Act 1986 of s.14A, applying to cases of negligence not involving personal injury, the Committee at paragraph 4.7 preferred to model s.14A on s. 14, rather than on s.11(3) of the Prescription and Limitation Act (Scotland) Act 1973, because it was arguable that s.11(3)</p>
<p></p><ul>"does not cover lack of knowledge of its [the damage's] causation, or the identity of the person (or persons) liable. By comparison awareness of such matters, which could sometimes be difficult to ascertain in a latent damage context, is specifically included in the definition of knowledge contained in section 14 of the 1980 Act".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110.&nbsp;&nbsp;The reference in parenthesis to awareness of causation being "sometimes â€¦ difficult to ascertain in a latent damage context" cannot mean that the Committee intended that it should only be where damage remained latent that knowledge of causation was to be relevant. Indeed, so long as damage remains latent, knowledge regarding causation cannot really arise as a problem. Another point in this Report which it is of interest to note is the Committee's recognition at the end of paragraph 4.7 - in contrast with the optimism of the 1974 Report - that an approach adapted from s.14 "does have its disadvantages too" and "is a complicated formulation".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of s. 14A (8)(a), it is relevant to consider what is meant by (i) "knowledge", (ii) "the act or omission which is alleged to constitute negligence" and (iii) knowledge that damage was "attributable" to such an act or omission. For the moment, I confine myself to actual knowledge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112.&nbsp;&nbsp;The degree of certainty of knowledge required under s.14 was considered by Purchas LJ giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal in <i>Nash v. Eli Lilly </i>(at p. 792C-D and also p. 796C-D. At p 791G-H Purchas LJ also quoted the conclusion of Lord Donaldson of Lymington MR in <i>Halford v. Brookes </i>[1991] 1 WLR 428, 443, that knowledge here "clearly does not mean 'know for certain and beyond possibility of contradiction'". Purchas LJ proceeded at p 792 C-D "on the basis that knowledge is a condition of mind which imports a degree of certainty and that the degree of certainty which is appropriate for this purpose is that which, for the particular plaintiff, may reasonably be regarded as sufficient to justify embarking upon the preliminaries to the making of a claim for compensation such as the taking of legal or other advice". In <i>Broadley v. Guy Clapham &amp; Co. </i>[1993] 4 Med LR 328, 334, Hoffmann LJ re-phrased the purpose of s.14(1) as being "to determine the moment at which the plaintiff knows enough to make it reasonable for him to <i>begin</i> to investigate whether or not he has a case against the defendant". This was taken up by Brooke LJ in another case under s.14, <i>Spargo v. North Essex District Health Authority </i>[1997] PIQR P235, P242, where he said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;A plaintiff has the requisite knowledge when she knows enough to make it reasonable for her to begin to investigate whether or not she has a case against the defendant. Another way of putting this is to say that she will have such knowledge if she so firmly believes that her condition is capable of being attributed to an act or omission which she can identify (in broad terms) that she goes to a solicitor to seek advice about making a claim for compensation.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand she will not have the requisite knowledge if she thinks she knows the acts or omissions she should investigate but in fact is barking up the wrong tree; or if her knowledge of what the defendant did or did not do is so vague or general that she cannot fairly be expected to know what she should investigate; or if her state of mind is such that she thinks her condition is capable of being attributed to the act or omission alleged to constitute negligence, but she is not sure about this, and would need to check with an expert before she could be properly said to know that it was."<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>All such formulations seem to me relevant also under s.14A, provided that it is remembered that under subs.(8)(a) the requisite knowledge must be of the attributability in whole or part of the damage suffered to the act or omission alleged to constitute negligence. The passage from HHJ Playford's judgment cited in paragraph 103 above was therefore, in my view, incorrect in law.<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113.&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the phrase "the act or omission which is alleged to constitute negligence", the word "constitute" is in my view significant. It indicates that the claimant must know the factual essence of what is subsequently alleged as negligence in the claim. Once such knowledge has been acquired, it is under subs. (9) irrelevant whether or not the claimant knew that the relevant act or omission "did or did not, as a matter of law, involve negligence". So, there must be knowledge of the act or omission allegedly <i>constituting</i> negligence, but there need not be knowledge that, as a matter of law, such act or omission involved negligence. Whether an act or omission involves negligence is a matter of law for the court, even though a court may of course hear a good deal of evidence (e.g. about accountancy principles and practices) in order to determine it. Evidence of relevant accountancy principles or practices will commonly be deployed on the issue whether, as a matter of law, such act or omission involved negligence. The difficulty is that knowledge of such principles or practices may also in some cases be said to bear on the question whether a person suffering loss would attribute such loss to accountants who had advised or not advised him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114.&nbsp;&nbsp;As Charles J rightly observed, there are tensions arising from the inter-action of subs.(8)(a) and subs.(9) of s.14A. Under subs.(9) if a claimant knows the relevant circumstances, it is irrelevant that he does not appreciate that they, as a matter of law, involve negligence. And the history of the legislation, which I have already recited, shows that the aim was also to eliminate awareness of fault from the knowledge required. Yet in everyday life we may only be prepared to attribute responsibility if and when we appreciate what ought normally or properly to have happened, and so it is not surprising the authorities contain not only clear statements in line with the Law Reform Committee's intention in its 20th report, but also statements showing the difficulty of avoiding terminology which has some flavour of fault-based thinking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115.&nbsp;&nbsp;This problem, which can arise most acutely in relation to omissions in professional negligence cases, is closely examined by Janet O'Sullivan in <i>Limitation, latent damage and solicitors' negligence</i> (2004) 20 Journal of Professional Negligence 218, 233-244. It is, as she shows, most acute in a case of alleged negligence on the part of a solicitor or other adviser, where the negligence consists simply in omitting to do something which it was the adviser's duty in law to do (or in doing something that it was his duty not to do) and where the only reason why the client does not attribute any resulting damage to the adviser is that he does not know that the adviser would have been expected so to do (or not to do). Even in such a case, Hart &amp; HonorÃ©, in Causation in the Law (2nd Ed.) p. 38, demonstrate that the concepts of causation (dependent on knowing what is factually usual) and reprehensibility (central to the concept of breach of duty) are conceptually distinct, although on the particular facts coincident.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the position in such case, it is in any event not on all fours with a case where an adviser causes or allows a client to enter into a transaction but the client has no reason to attribute loss suffered in the transaction to his adviser until he discovers that the transaction was from the outset intrinsically unsound. In such a case there is authority that knowledge that the transaction was from the outset unsound (giving rise to a <i>prima facie </i>right to complain) may be distinguished from the (under s.14A(9) irrelevant) knowledge that the adviser was negligent: see <i>Hallam-Eames v. Merrett Syndicates </i>[2001] Ll.R. Prof. Neg. 178, decided by a Court of Appeal consisting of Sir Thomas Bingham MR and Hoffmann and Saville LJJ (as they then were). The distinction may in such a case be narrow, as Hoffmann LJ giving the judgment of the court himself recognised at p.181 (right column) in that case and as Janet O'Sullivan points out in her article at p.236, but it is an important, and I think a just, one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117.&nbsp;&nbsp;I add that I do not consider that the focus of subss.(6)(b) and (8)(a) on facts and the irrelevance under subs.(9) of knowledge, as a matter of law, that such facts involve negligence mean that the decision in <i>HF Pension Trustees Ltd. v. Ellison </i>[1999] Ll.R. Prof. Neg. 489 was correct. The court there treated the impermissibility of transfers, which resulted from advice given by the defendants, as a matter of law. In my view, this impermissiblity should, in context, have been regarded as an (unknown) fact - an aspect of the acts or omissions alleged to constitute negligence - or possibly (as my noble and learned friend Lord Walker has suggested) as unknown damage resulting from such acts or omissions. In either case, it should not have been until the impermissibility was known to the claimants that time started running against them. The distinction between fact and law has never been that rigid (cf e.g <i>Cooper v. Phibbs </i>(1867) LR 2 HL 149 and, in the present field, the decision of Judge Raymond Jack QC, as he then was, in <i>Perry v. Moysey</i> [1998] PNLR 657), while subs.(9) of s.14A goes no further than to make irrelevant knowledge that acts or omissions involved negligence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118.&nbsp;&nbsp;For present purposes what matters is that it is, in my opinion, wrong to suggest that all a claimant needs to know is that he has received professional advice but for which he would not have acted in a particular way which has given rise to loss, or that he has not received advice when, if he had received it, he would have acted in a way which would avoided such loss. The defendants' primary contention to that effect was, I think, accepted by the judge at first instance (cf paragraph 103 above), and was advanced again before the House by counsel for Fawcetts. But it is, in my view, untenable, and could lead to unjust results. Mere "but for" causation is insufficient. This was pointed out by Hoffmann LJ in <i>Hallam-Eames v. Merrett Syndicates </i>[2001] Ll.R. Prof. Neg. 178, 181. The decision in that case illustrates the point, since it was not the writing of the run off policies or of the reinsurances to close ("RITCs") or the certification by the auditors of the accounts which were alone regarded as the acts or omissions alleged to constitute the negligence. Rather it was those facts <i>plus</i> the fact that they exposed the Names to potentially huge liabilities (and in the case of the accounts also attributed values to incurred but not reported losses - "IBNRs") none of which were capable of reasonable quantification: see especially at p.181 (top right and the whole left column). A claimant who has received apparently sound and reliable advice may see no reason to challenge it unless and until he discovers that it has not been preceded by or based on the investigation which he instructed or expected. A claimant who has suffered financial loss in a transaction entered into in reliance on such advice may not attribute such loss to the advice unless and until he either makes the like discovery about the inadequacy of the work done, or at least discovers some respect in which the transaction was from the outset unsound giving him (as Hoffmann LJ said) <i>prima facie </i>cause to complain. Such a scenario may well occur where there are other causes of loss which appear to him capable of explaining the whole loss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, as counsel for the claimants accepted in his note to the judge (paragraph 99 above), a claimant cannot postpone the running of time almost indefinitely by reference to detailed factual points which often only become known in the course of investigation of a possible claim, or during litigation itself. The Court of Appeal was right in <i>Broadley v. Guy Clapham &amp; Co. </i>to disapprove a test adopted by Hirst J in <i>Bentley v. Bristol &amp; Weston Health Authority </i>[1991] 2 Med LR 359, in so far as it would have required a claimant to know <i>all</i> factual matters necessary to establish negligence or to draft a fully and comprehensively particularised claim.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120.&nbsp;&nbsp;The authorities have thus adopted as the relevant test when the claimant acquired "knowledge of the essence of the act or omission to which the injury is attributable": see <i>Nash v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co. </i>[1993] 1 WLR 782, 799C per Purchas LJ and <i>Hallam-Eames v. Merrett Syndicates </i>[2001] Ll.R. 178, 181. The Court of Appeal in <i>Hallam-Eames</i> thus distinguished between, on the one hand, "elaborating the detail by requiring knowledge of precisely how he had come to do the act complained of" (which is irrelevant) and, on the other, knowledge of facts which are "part of the essence of [the] complaint". An example given of the latter was the fact in <i>Dobbie v. Medway Health Authority</i> [1994] 1 WLR 1234 that the breast removed by the surgeon had been healthy. In <i>Hallam-Eames</i>, the essential facts of which knowledge was required were of a reverse character - viz that the run-off policies and reinsurances to close and the certified accounts were in effect unsound (or "unhealthy").  Hoffmann LJ explained:</p>
<p></p><ul>"â€¦ the act or omission of which the plaintiff must have knowledge must be that which is causally relevant for the purposes of an allegation of negligence. There may be many acts, omissions or states which can be said to have a causal connection with a given occurrence, but when we make causal statements in ordinary speech, we select on common sense principles the one which is relevant for our purpose.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>â€¦ .<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>It is this idea of causal relevance which various judges of this court have tried to express by saying that the plaintiff must know the 'essence of the act or omission to which the injury is attributable' (Purchas LJ in <i>Nash v. Eli Lilly </i>[1993] 1 WLR 782, 799) or 'the essential thrust of the case' (Sir Thomas Bingham MR in <i>Dobbie [v. Medway Health Authority] </i>[1994] 1 WLR 1234, 1238)<i> </i>or that 'one should look at the way the plaintiff puts his case, distil what he is complaining about and ask whether he had in broad terms knowledge of the facts on which that complaint is based' (Hoffmann LJ in <i>Broadley [v. Guy Clapham &amp; Co.] </i>[1993] 4 Med LR 328, 332).<p></p></ul>
â€¦
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He [the claimant] must have known the facts which can fairly be described as constituting the negligence of which he complains. â€¦"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hoffmann LJ continued:</p>
<p></p><ul>"What, on these principles, are the facts which constitute the negligence of which the Names complain? It would in our view be incomplete to say that it was the writing of the run-off reinsurance policies or the RITCs or the certification of the syndicate accounts. These facts in themselves do not amount to acts of which the Names would even <i>prima facie </i>be entitled to complain. It is necessary to add the allegation that the run-off policies and RITCs exposed the Names to potentially huge liabilities and that the certified accounts attributed values to IBNRs [incurred but not reported losses], none of which were in fact capable of reasonable quantification."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122.&nbsp;&nbsp;The third element is what is meant by damage being "attributable" in whole or part to the act or omission allegedly constituting negligence. The authorities establish that the word "attributable" means here "capable of being attributed", rather than "caused by": <i>Guidera v. N.E.I. Projects (India) Ltd.</i> (30 January 1990, CA Tr. No. 60 of 1990) per Sir David Croom-Johnson, <i>Nash v. Eli Lilly</i> at pp.797-8, per Purchas LJ and <i>Dobbie v. Medway Health Authority </i>at p.1240, per Sir Thomas Bingham MR. Consistently with the clear wording of the statutory language, the authorities also emphasise that s.14A is concerned with knowledge in this sense of the attributability of the damage suffered to the act or omission allegedly constituting negligence: see e.g. <i>Halford v. Brookes </i>[1991] 1 WLR 428, 443D per Lord Donaldson MR, <i>Dobbie v. Medway Health Authority </i>[1994] 1 WLR 1234, 1240E-H per Sir Thomas Bingham MR and <i>Spargo v. North Essex District Health Authority </i>[1997] PIQR P235, P242, per Brooke LJ in the passages quoted in paragraph 112 above. This is, of course, of particular relevance in cases where there is another possible cause (cf <i>Irshad Ali v. Courtaulds Textiles Ltd. </i>[1999] Lloyd's Rep. Medical 301), though it must always be remembered that all that s.14A requires is knowledge that loss is "capable" of being attributed in whole or "in part" to the act or omission alleged to constitute a particular defendant's negligence. It has indeed been held that a claimant may have the requisite knowledge although he faces alternative possible defendants, one or other but not both of whom may be liable (cf <i>Halford v. Brookes </i>[1991] 1 WLR 428, 443G-H).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123.&nbsp;&nbsp;The singularity of the present case is, as I have indicated, that it concerns only actual knowledge. The authorities show the importance of the constructive knowledge which may arise under s.14(3) and s.14A(10): see e.g. <i>Nash v. Eli Lilly </i>at pp.796F-G and 799E-801A, <i>Broadley v. Guy Clapham &amp; Co. </i>at pp.333 per Leggatt LJ and 333-4 per Hoffmann LJ and <i>Hallam-Eames</i> at pp.180-2. In <i>Broadley </i>the claimant went into hospital for the removal of a foreign or loose body in her knee, but came out with what she was, within a relatively short period, told was permanent foot drop. Leggatt LJ said at p.333 that knowledge of the mechanics of damage to a nerve was not required, and that she had "constructively" within just over a year of the operation "such specific knowledge of an act or omission which might amount to negligence as would have enabled her to investigate it timeously". Hoffmann LJ said at pp.333-4 that:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In this case Mrs Broadley knew, or could have known with the help of the medical advice reasonably obtainable, that her injury had been caused by damage to the nerve resulting from something which Mr Lowy had done or not done in the course of the operation. In my judgment that was all the knowledge or imputed knowledge which she needed to have. â€¦"<p></p></ul>
<p>He considered that the relevant knowledge was either possessed by Mrs Broadley, or could have been ascertained by her from any doctor whom she chose to consult, "within a few months of the operation", and that was "quite enough to make it reasonable for her to commence an investigation into whether or not the acts in question gave rise to a cause of action". A similar explanation of <i>Broadley </i>was given in <i>Hallam-Eames</i> where Hoffmann LJ said at p.180 that</p>
<p></p><ul>"A patient who goes into hospital for an operation on her knee and comes out with something wrong with her foot can reasonably be expected to ask her doctor why this should be so. If she had asked, she would have been told that the operation must have caused damage to the nerve."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;124.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Hallam-Eames</i>,<i> </i>the Court also responded to a submission that "requiring knowledge of whether potential liabilities were capable of reasonable quantification was to introduce dangerously imprecise criteria" by pointing out (at p.182) that</p>
<p></p><ul>"under subs.(10) the Names will be deemed to have the necessary knowledge if on the facts known to or ascertainable by them, it would have been reasonable for them to instruct an expert who could have discovered the circumstances in which the run off policies and RITCs were concluded and the syndicate accounts certified."<p></p></ul>
<p>Whether the Names knew sufficient to put them over this threshold was, Hoffmann LJ pointed out, a question of degree. On the facts, the Court concluded that the issue "of what the plaintiffs knew or could reasonably have ascertained" could not be decided on a summary basis, because, although the accounts showed that "over successive years, the RITC premium was on each occasion substantially larger than in the year before":</p>
<p></p><ul>"We do not however think that this should necessarily have led a Name to infer that the estimate in the previous year was wrong: it could have been because of business written in the pure year or for other reasons. And in any case, even if the previous estimates had been wrong, the fact that until 1985 was left open, RITCs continued to be written on the basis of certified accounts would have led Names to believe that IBNRs were regarded as reasonably quantifiable."<p></p></ul>
