<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cozens-Hardy LJ made similar observations in <i>Yorkshire Woolcombers</i> [1903]  2 Ch 284, 297.  Many of the later cases have emphasised the need for the court to look at the commercial realities of the situation.  The wish to achieve legal certainty by use of a standard precedent cannot override the need to construe any document in its commercial context.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;160.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also necessary to bear in mind Lord Millett's warning in <i>Agnew</i> [2001] 2 AC 710, 730, para 48, that formal provision for a blocked account is not enough "if it is not operated as one in fact."  Lord Millett did not expand on this point, which may raise difficult questions as to what Staughton LJ, in <i>Welsh Development Agency v Export Finance Co Ltd</i> [1992] BCLC 148, 186-7, referred to as "external" and "internal" routes to the construction of commercial documents.  This point is discussed in an article by Stephen Atherton and Rizwaan Jameel Mokal in (2005) 26 Company Lawyer 10, 16-18.  These difficulties suggest to me that the expedient mentioned in the postscript to the judgment of the Master of the Rolls (para 99), although no doubt appropriate and efficacious in some commercial contexts, may not provide a simple solution in every case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;161.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the topic of overruling long-standing decisions which have been relied on by commercial lenders, and on the further topic of prospective overruling, I am in full and respectful agreement with the opinions of my noble and learned friends, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead and Lord Hope.  I would allow this appeal and hold, without any sort of temporal restriction, that <i>Siebe Gorman</i> was wrongly decided on the issue of construction.</p>
<p>BARONESS HALE OF RICHMOND</p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;162.&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that, for the reasons given in the opinion of my noble and learned friend, Lord Scott of Foscote, supplemented by those of Lord Hope of Craighead and Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe, the debenture in this case created only a floating charge. I also agree that that part of the decision in <i>Siebe Gorman &amp; Co Ltd v Barclay's Bank Ltd</i> [1979] 2 Lloyd's Rep 142 which dealt with the effect of the debenture in that case should be overruled with the usual retrospective effect. In common with my noble and learned friend, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, and also Lord Hope, I would not wish to rule out the possibility that this House might one day consider that the only just result was to declare that its decision should have prospective effect only, including the possibility that this could arise in a dispute about the interpretation of a statute.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;163.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other possibility that I would not wish to rule out.  That is whether it might in future be decided that the Court of Appeal, or even the High Court, could decline to follow a previous decision of the Court of Appeal which has been expressly disapproved as part of the <i>ratio decidendi</i> in a case in the Judicial Committee of Privy Council on appeal from a country in which the law on the subject is the same as that in England and Wales. The Court of Appeal in <i>Worcester Works Finance Ltd v Cooden Engineering Co Ltd</i> [1972] 1 QB 210 decided that it was possible. In <i>Davis v Johnson </i>[1979] AC 264, this House stated that the rule laid down in <i>Young v Bristol Aeroplane Co Ltd</i> [1944] KB 718, that with only three exceptions the Court of Appeal is bound by its own previous decisions, was still binding on the Court of Appeal, despite what Lord Diplock described, at p 325C, as the 'one-man crusade' of Lord Denning to free them from its shackles. This was in the context of a much more radical departure from the exceptions allowed in the <i>Young</i> case. <i>Worcester Works Finance</i> was not cited or referred to in either the House of Lords or the Court of Appeal in <i>Davis v Johnson</i>. Privy Council decisions were not discussed in <i>Young</i>. We ourselves have heard no argument on the matter. I would hope, therefore, that nothing which is said in this appeal is taken to rule out the possibility that a further exception or qualification might exist or be developed along the lines indicated above. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;164.&nbsp;&nbsp;In common with your lordships, I would allow this appeal and make the order proposed by Lord Scott. </p>
<p><b>LORD BROWN OF EATON-UNDER-HEYWOOD</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
