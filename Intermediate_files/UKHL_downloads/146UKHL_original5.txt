<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the advantage of reading in draft the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill and gratefully adopt his exposition of the facts, the legislative framework within which these disputed assessments were made, and the two issues arising for your Lordships' determination on the appeal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92.&nbsp;&nbsp;Issue 1 concerns the 25% deduction from the appellants' loss of earnings claim for "saved living expenses" and it is not difficult to understand why it has aroused such strong feelings.  Here are two men, incarcerated in prison for many years for crimes they never committed, entitled by statute to compensation for that grave miscarriage of justice, now required, so it is suggested on their behalf, to give credit against their earning losses for the supposed benefits of being fed, clothed and housed in prison.  If, indeed, this is a correct characterisation of the deduction—if, in other words, the state is exacting a credit for the cost of imprisoning them (although not, of course, the full cost, now running at upwards of £35,000 per annum for each inmate)—their case is unanswerable and their appeal must succeed.  Clearly imprisonment was no benefit whatever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93.&nbsp;&nbsp;But is this, on analysis, the true basis of the deduction?  Is the deduction not rather to be explained, as the respondent submits, on a very different basis?  The loss of earnings claims necessarily suppose that the appellants would have been at liberty to work.  Had this been so they would inevitably have had to keep body and soul together, in short incur basic living expenses. To award them their loss of earnings without taking these expenses into account would not reflect that reality and would, therefore, be to over-compensate them.  A claimant's expenditure on living expenses is no less a necessary pre-condition of his ability to earn than his travel expenses in getting to work.  The appellants' real loss, therefore, can only be their loss of earnings less any such expenses.  So runs the respondent's argument.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94.&nbsp;&nbsp;How then is this deduction properly to be characterised? Is it a credit impermissibly claimed by the state as representing the value of the supposed benefits of being fed, clothed and accommodated in prison or is it a deduction to reflect the basic expenses of living in freedom?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95.&nbsp;&nbsp;To my mind it is plainly the latter and really there has never been any question here of attempting to justify the deduction as a credit for benefits received.  But that is not quite the end of the matter.  It remains to decide whether indeed the appellants' saved living expenses can properly be deducted from their notional earnings in the calculation of their real loss—the object being, as Lord Griffiths put it in <i>Dews v National Coal Board</i> [1988]  AC1, 14, to determine "what the plaintiff has <i>really</i> lost".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96.&nbsp;&nbsp;The central difficulty in addressing this question is the artificiality of the concept of a claimant's real loss.  Realistically it could be argued that the appellants' loss of earnings claims should be assessed at nil.  They are most unlikely ever to have saved any of their notional earnings and, in so far as they have been deprived of the benefit of having spent them, this loss must be assumed to be reflected in the award of compensation for their non-pecuniary loss.  The non-pecuniary award is presumably assessed on the basis of the contrast between the misery of their actual lives in prison and the probable pleasures of their notional lives at liberty.  Life at liberty would not have been much fun had they not spent their (comparatively modest) putative earnings in full.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97.&nbsp;&nbsp;The contrary argument, at its most extreme, would be that the appellants' real loss is the entirety of their net earning loss.  Once tax had been paid (<i>British Transport Commission v Gourlay</i> [1956]  AC 185) and any other direct monetary deductions have been made from the gross earning figure—most notably any national insurance contributions (<i>Cooper v Firth Brown</i> <i>Ltd </i>[1963]  1 WLR 418) and any compulsory pension contributions (<i>Dews v National Coal Board</i> [1988]  AC 1)— the earnings would have been available to spend as the appellants chose.  Of course part of those earnings would have been expended on the basic necessities of life. But the appellants had no less right to determine how this part should be spent (what to eat, what to wear, where to be housed) than the rest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first of those arguments, that the earning loss should be assessed at nil, is not, let it be clear, one that the respondent advances in this case. An argument substantially like it, however, appears to have been advanced (unsuccessfully) in <i>Lim Poh Choo v Camden and Islington Area Health Authority</i> [1980] AC 174, 177.  Logical though it may appear, it does not reflect the conventional approach taken to damages assessments.  General damages, certainly in personal injury cases, are simply not designed to compensate for earning losses i.e. to reflect the benefits to have been expected from spending the lost earnings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second argument seems to me to present altogether greater difficulty.  The general principle is that it is of no concern to the tortfeasor how the claimant might have spent his earnings.  That was why the Court of Appeal in <i>Shearman v Folland</i> [1950]  2 KB 43, rejected the defendant's contention that the seven guineas a week paid by the plaintiff before her accident for board and lodging be set off against the twelve guineas a week which she spent on post-accident nursing home fees: "The precise style in which she would probably or might well have lived is, in our view, a collateral matter, and the two payments are not in pari materia." (p 50).  The court gave the defendant credit for only £1 a week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100.&nbsp;&nbsp;Adopting the same approach in <i>Lim Poh Choo,</i> and setting off the plaintiff's living expenses against the future care costs, Lord Scarman said, at p191:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is a simpler, more realistic, calculation and accords more closely with the general principle of the law that the courts in assessing compensation for loss are not concerned either with how the plaintiff would have used the moneys lost or with how she (or he) will use the compensation received."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101.&nbsp;&nbsp;A further statement of the principle is to be found in Lord Griffiths' speech in <i>Dews v National Coal Board</i> at p14:</p>
<p></p><ul>"When a plaintiff is injured and as a result is paid no wages his immediate real loss is that part of his net earnings that were available for current expenditure.  In respect of this part of his earnings the object of which is to provide income available for current expenditure the tortfeasor is, subject to sums necessarily spent to earn the income, entitled to no credit for expenditure saved as a result of the injury; the principle that it is no concern of the tortfeasor, how the plaintiff chooses to spend his income applies."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the respondent's contention on the present appeal consistent with that statement of principle?  With some hesitation I have concluded that it is, provided always that the deduction sought to be made is confined to the cost of the bare necessities of life.  If restricted in this way (as in <i>Shearman v Folland</i>) to the basic cost of food and shelter, it seems to me capable of falling within Lord Griffiths' formulation of "sums necessarily spent to earn the income".  True, this formulation appears designed principally to allow for travelling expenses (as discussed by Lord Griffiths at p 13).  To my mind, however, it is apt also to encompass basic living expenses, the claimant's ability to earn being dependent no less on his remaining alive from day to day than on arriving daily for work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103.&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be acknowledged that in no other case (except pursuant to section 5 of the Administration of Justice Act 1982) do saved living expenses appear ever to have been set off directly against the actual loss of earnings claim.  In <i>Lim Poh Choo,</i> for example, only the "expenses of earning the income which has been lost" were set off against the lost income, the living expenses ("the domestic element") being set off against the claim for future cost of care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lim Poh Choo</i> nevertheless seems to me broadly to support the approach taken by the assessor in the present case.  So too, still more clearly, does the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Toneguzzo-Norvell v Burnaby Hospital</i> [1994] 1 SCR 114—see particularly the passages cited from McLachlin J's judgment under the heading "The Deduction of 50% for Personal Living Expenses from the award for Lost Earning Capacity during the 'lost years'"—at para 20 of Lord Bingham's opinion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105.&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach is consistent too with the public policy which plainly underlies Parliament's reversal of the Court of Appeal's decision in <i>Daish v Wauton</i> [1972]  2 QB 262 by the enactment of section 5 of the Administration of Justice Act 1982—the provision that any saving attributable to an injured person's maintenance at public expense in a hospital or similar institution must be set off against his loss of earning claim.  True it is that, to avoid any suggestion here that credit is being claimed for the appellants' maintenance at public expense in prison, the focus of the respondent's argument is rather upon the appellants' saving than their maintenance at public expense. As, however, Lord Bridge of Harwich observed in <i>Hussain v New Taplow Paper Mills Ltd</i> [1988]  1 AC 514, 527:</p>
<p></p><ul>"This dichotomy [between the two questions identified by Lord Reid in <i>Parry v Cleaver</i> [1970]  AC 1, 13, namely, first, what did the plaintiff lose as a result of the accident i.e. what sums will he no longer receive and, secondly, what has he in fact received which he would otherwise not have received], however, must not be allowed to obscure the rule that prima facie the only recoverable loss is the net loss."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106.&nbsp;&nbsp;By the same token that as the result of an accident the claimant may have received sums for which he must give credit against his earnings losses, so too he may have been relieved of liabilities for which likewise he should give credit.  Of course, were an injured claimant in fact to be maintained not at public expense but through the benevolence of a sympathetic third party, no credit would fall to be given for any consequent saving to him.  But that is because of the public policy underlying this particular exception to the basic rule.  It cannot avail the appellants here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107.&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, I reject both the appellants' characterisation of this 25% deduction from their earning losses as the taking of credit for the supposed benefits of their being fed and housed in prison and I reject too their contention that it transgresses the principle that it is of no concern to tortfeasors or to courts assessing damages claims (and by analogy assessors determining compensation for miscarriages of justice) how the claimant would have used the moneys lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108.&nbsp;&nbsp;Issue 2 concerns the reductions of the (bulk of the) non-pecuniary loss awards (of 25% in Vincent Hickey's case, 20% in Michael's), to take account of their respective "other convictions . . . and any punishment resulting from them" as provided for by section 133 (4A)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1995 as amended.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appellants' complaint here is again at first blush readily understandable.  These reductions are very substantially greater than the 10% reduction made by the respondent's predecessor as assessor, Sir David Calcutt QC, in the case of Mr Robinson, another claimant in the same miscarriage of justice case, whose record, moreover, was significantly worse than either of theirs.  This looks on the face of it most unfair and certainly I for my part would have had little hesitation in striking down the assessment were it not clear, as I believe it is, why Lord Brennan QC departed from his predecessor's approach, or, indeed, if there appeared no good reason for his having done so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110.&nbsp;&nbsp;The following paragraph (para 5) from the respondent's determination in Vincent Hickey's case is to my mind critical to the proper understanding of his approach:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Having regard to the seriousness of these matters and in particular the robbery at Chapel Hill Farm, I firmly conclude that the non-pecuniary loss award should be subject to a deduction of 25%.  This I regard as the very least deduction that can reasonably be made, having regard to his criminal behaviour."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question but that the respondent knew full well that he was applying a far larger percentage deduction than Sir David had done in Mr Robinson's case.  He was doing so, however, because he did not think that he could reasonably make any lesser deduction consistently with his duty under section 133(4A)(c).  It necessarily followed either that he regarded Sir David's 10% reduction in Mr Robinson's case to have been irrationally low or that he was adopting a different approach from Sir David also with regard to the initial non-pecuniary loss assessments i.e. the assessments which then fell to be reduced to take account of the claimants' criminal records.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112.&nbsp;&nbsp;As Lord Bingham has explained, how precisely the assessor should approach his task generally under section 133(4A), and more particularly how he should give effect to para (c), is problematic and plainly worthy of further consideration.  Most sensibly perhaps he should have regard to the para (c) considerations once and for all when making the assessment in the first place.  But if he chooses to regard para (c) as a discrete provision requiring a separate, second stage determination, then logically he should be making his first stage assessment on the assumption that the claimant had no other convictions whatever and so was suffering much more both from his wrongful imprisonment and from loss of reputation.  Were such an artificial first stage assessment to be made in the case of those like these appellants (let alone Mr Robinson) with significant criminal records, it is hardly surprising that Lord Brennan brought deductions of at least 20% (in Michael's case) and 25% (in Vincent's) necessary.  This seems, I repeat, a curious and intrinsically unsatisfactory approach to the non-pecuniary loss assessment.  Better far, one might think, that a single overall assessment be made to take account of all the relevant factors.  That, however, is not presently an issue before the House and the decision is not impugned on that basis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that, without knowing precisely how each assessor approached the first stage of their respective non-pecuniary loss assessments, it is impossible to say whether or not there is any real inconsistency between their final awards.  The respondent's deductions are not in themselves impugned.  No basis is accordingly established for interfering with them.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons together with those given by Lord Bingham I too would dismiss this appeal.</p>
