<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;143. There are passages in the documents which support the Bank's case that whilst, prior to April 1990, it had concerns about the soundness of BCCI's operations, nonetheless it recognised that its overriding duty was to protect the interests of depositors and that its decisions and its conduct towards BCCI were intended to discharge that duty, so that the allegation of bad faith on its part cannot be established.  Thus in the note sent to the Governors of the Bank dated 15 July 1983 its author states:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The closure route could only be pursued if it could be shown, with reasonable certainty, that the group's operations were fundamentally unsound; and that continued existence posed a greater threat to depositors' money than a winding up.  Without a very wide ranging investigation and the fullest co-operation of other supervisory authorities it would not be possible to state, categorically, that the group's operations are unsound to the extent of endangering depositors."<p></p></ul>
<p>But at this stage in the proceedings a court is not concerned to try to assess which side will probably succeed if there is a trial:  the question is whether there is material which shows that there are issues which should be  investigated at a trial, and in my opinion the material does show this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;144. As regards the prospect from April 1990 onwards of a rescue operation by the Abu Dhabi Government I would not take the view that the plaintiffs have no real prospect of establishing that the Bank knew that it was probable, or was reckless as to the probability, that that Government, notwithstanding its stated willingness to rescue BCCI, would not commit itself fully to meet all its liabilities as more information became available as to the extent of its liabilities and as to the dishonesty of its managers.  In differing from the opinion of Clarke J and the majority of the Court of Appeal that the plaintiffs have no real prospect of success, I take into account two further considerations.  One is that I think that it is reasonably possible that further material may become available to the plaintiffs before trial, and I am in respectful agreement with the view of Auld LJ, at p 180B of his judgment:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In addition to the different function of Bingham LJ's inquiry from the more focused issues for determination in this litigation, there are several obvious disadvantages of his procedure when compared with the court's process for determining the truth of the matter and its legal significance.  His was not a statutory inquiry, so he had no power to compel the attendance of witnesses or require the production of documents;  he heard the evidence of some, but not all, relevant and important players in the story;  there was no counsel to the inquiry and no opportunity for adversarial discovery, interrogation or cross-examination of witnesses;  and, as I have said, he acknowledged that most of his criticisms and a number of his factual conclusions were challenged, the validity of such challenges not capable of being tested on appeal.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"In the circumstances, I am of the view that Clarke J was not entitled…  to conclude, as he did, that all the available material evidence on those questions had been gathered in.  Given the greater generality of the questions in the Bingham inquiry, the limitations of it as a fact-finding exercise when compared with litigation, his acknowledgement of a number of challenges to some of his factual conclusions and the emergence of additional material since the inquiry indicating the Bank's state of knowledge as to the Gokal unrecorded loans, I can see no basis for Clarke J's confidence in this extraordinary and complex case for concluding that Bingham LJ had seen and fully tested all the material evidence available or likely to become available on the issues confronting the court in this case."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;145. Secondly, I consider that the material already available to the plaintiffs provides reasonable grounds for thinking that they may be able to advance their case by the cross-examination of the Bank's officials.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;146. In <i>McDonald's Corporation v Steel</i> [1995] 3 All ER 615 Neill LJ recognised that the prospect of evidence emerging on cross-examination was a matter to be taken into consideration.  Mr Stadlen relied on the judgment of Chadwick LJ in <i>Jarvis v Hampshire County Council </i> The Times 23 November 1999; Court of Appeal (Civil Division) Transcript No 1908 of 1999 where he said, at p 35:</p>
<p></p><ul>"it is an abuse of the process of the court to make allegations of [dishonesty and deliberate abuse of power] in circumstances in which they cannot be supported by particulars; no less so when they are inconsistent with the substantial documentary material which is available.  It is not enough to assert, as counsel for the claimant did assert before us, that - if the matter were allowed to go to trial - something might emerge through cross-examination.  That is not a proper basis on which to make allegations of dishonesty.  The judge was right to strike out those allegations."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;147. But the assessment whether it is reasonable to take the view that evidence may emerge in cross-examination depends on the particular facts of the case.  In <i>Jarvis v Hampshire County Council</i> it was clear that the allegations were groundless and could not be given any substance by the cross-examination of the defendant's witnesses.  But in the present case where there is an arguable case that the Bank had increasing concern about BCCI for a number of years prior to April 1990 and knew from April 1990 onwards of the imminent collapse of BCCI unless there was a rescue, I think that justice requires that the plaintiffs, after discovery and interrogation, should have the opportunity to cross-examine the Bank's witnesses as to their concerns before 1990 and as to their belief from April 1990 onwards that there would be a rescue operation.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;148. The fact that a plaintiff does not have direct evidence as to the belief or foresight or motives of the defendant is not in itself a reason to strike out the action.  In <i>Taylor v Midland Bank Trust Co Ltd</i> the plaintiff alleged dishonest breach of trust and the defendant applied for the dismissal of the claim without trial under rule 24.2(a)(i).  Upholding the decision of Carnwath J to dismiss the application Buxton LJ stated:</p>
<p></p><ul>"[Counsel for the defendant] appeared at one stage to argue that the case must be made good by direct evidence, and could not rely, as it does, on inference.  If that was the submission, I cannot agree with it.  Where the motives or knowledge of a party is in issue, it may often be necessary to rely on inference rather than direct statements or admissions by that party.  There is nothing objectionable in principle in that, however much an inference may be less cogent than an admission.  Nor is it right that, in drawing inferences, a court can only infer this form of dishonesty if the primary evidence admits of no other explanation.  That puts the test too high.  The process of reasoning should be constrained only by the court's appreciation of the seriousness of the charge and the substantiality of the evidence therefore necessary to make it good."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;149. At p 91F of their judgment the majority of the Court of Appeal stated:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Were officials of the Bank to give evidence which was fully tested by cross-examination in the adversarial process of a trial, it is not merely possible, but even likely, that a clearer and somewhat different picture would emerge as to the Bank's corporate state of mind from time to time, as constituted by the states of mind of a small number of its responsible officials.  But we would agree that there is no realistic possibility that the picture which emerged would be fundamentally different.  In that respect the Bingham report is, despite its relatively informal status, an invaluable aid to distinguishing between what is a practical possibility and what is fanciful or inconceivable."<p></p></ul>
<p>I am in full agreement with the first sentence of that passage, but I am, with respect, unable to agree with the last two sentences and I do not share the majority's confidence that though in cross-examination it is likely that a somewhat different picture would emerge, there is no realistic possibility that a fundamentally different picture would emerge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;150. The Bank's application has been to strike out the entire action.  The Bank's case that the plaintiffs have no reasonable prospect of success can be more strongly advanced in respect of the allegations relating to the earlier part of the history of the Bank's dealings with BCCI.  But having regard to the extent to which the allegations in respect of the entire period from 1979 to 1991 are interwoven and interrelated I consider that it would not be appropriate to consider striking out certain parts of the claim and that the entire action should be permitted to proceed to trial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;151. Because of the large number of documents which were referred to by counsel and the detailed and lengthy submissions which were advanced to the House I have thought it right to state my views at much greater length than is usual when an appellate court considers a strike out application, particularly when the appellate court decides that the action should proceed to trial.  But I wish to state my agreement with the observation of my noble and learned friend Lord Steyn as to the duty of the trial judge in paragraph 8 of his speech.  The judge will have to decide the case after the examination and cross-examination of witnesses on the evidence which he hears and he should not be influenced by any parts of the speeches of the House in this hearing which may appear to express any opinion on the facts of the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;152. Accordingly for the reasons which I have given I would allow this appeal.  I would dismiss the Bank's cross-appeal for the reasons given by my noble and learned friend Lord Hope of Craighead and I  would make the order proposed by him. </p>
<p><b>LORD HOBHOUSE OF WOODBOROUGH</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;153. It has been estimated that the trial of this action will occupy a whole year; I sincerely hope that this is too pessimistic.  But, on any view, the continuation of the action will involve the application of very substantial resources both at the trial and in preparation for it by both of the parties and the system of justice.  The volume of paper, forensic and evidential, is already formidable and the events which will have to be trawled over extend over some 15 years.  The investigation of those events gave rise to a Report (the Bingham Report: 1992 HC Paper 198) which runs to 218 printed pages together with 8 volumes of (unpublished) appendices recounting the history in greater detail.  It was thus understandable that it should have been thought right to examine whether such a trial and such proceedings were really appropriate and necessary in order to determine the just outcome to the parties' dispute.  Indeed, under Part 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules now in force it is the overriding objective, and the duty of the courts and the parties, that cases should be dealt with justly and that this includes dealing with cases in a proportionate manner, expeditiously and fairly, without undue expense and by allotting only an appropriate share of the court's resources while taking into account the need to allot resources to other cases.  This represents an important shift in judicial philosophy from the traditional philosophy that previously dominated the administration of justice.  Unless a party's conduct could be criticised as abusive or vexatious, the party was treated as having a right to his day in court in the sense of proceeding to a full trial after having fully exhausted the interlocutory pretrial procedures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;154. There were limited exceptions to this traditional approach.  One was the RSC O.14 procedure for summary judgment.  This was not a procedure for an informal trial; it was a procedure for enabling judgment to be entered for the plaintiff where there was no issue to be tried, in the words of the rule, no "issue or question in dispute which ought to be tried" or "other reason" why there ought to be a trial.  It was to avoid delaying tactics on the part of a defendant and enable speedy judgment to be given for the plaintiff where that was appropriate and just notwithstanding that the defendant asserted that he had a defence.  One of the court's powers under O.14 was to order the defendant to pay money into court as a condition of being permitted to defend.  O.14 was available to the plaintiff alone; there was no equivalent procedure for summary judgment in favour of the defendant  This procedure was not the same as the striking out jurisdiction which had two aspects.  One was the striking out of a party's pleading (or part of it) because the conduct of the party was objectionable, <i>ie</i> abusive or vexatious.  For this purpose evidence was relevant and admissible.  The other was the demurrer procedure which had completely different origins and served a different purpose.  It derived from the formal distinction between law and fact.  It provided a mechanism for testing the propositions of law upon which the party (plaintiff or defendant) was relying; it was decided upon the pleadings alone and no evidence was admissible.  The court could in its discretion deal with the issue of law as a matter of striking out, or by directing the trial of a preliminary point of law, or by directing that the decision of the point of law should be left over to the full trial.  In principle, though not always in practice, the striking out procedure should be used only where the point of law was not reasonably arguable.  Warnings against the inappropriate use of the striking out procedure to decide arguable points of law were given by Lords Templeman and Mackay in <i>Williams &amp; Humbert v W &amp; H Trade Marks</i> [1986]  AC 368, 435-6 and 441; but the motive of simplifying procedures and saving costs was applauded and may, in the end, show that the procedure adopted was appropriate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;155. Another exception in practice was the policy of the Commercial Court to assist the expeditious and efficient determination of disputes of commercial parties by adopting relatively informal procedures, usually at an early stage of the case, to identify the real points at issue and, by deciding them, enable the dispute to be resolved.  Often this was an aspiration rather than a reality.  Commercial disputes often involve lengthy and costly investigations and trials which defeat these aspirations.  At times commercial litigation has been allowed to drift into over elaborate and drawn out procedures which overlook any other priority than investigating every nook and cranny and ensuring that every angle receives the full forensic exposure.  In <i>Ashmore v Corporation of Lloyd's</i> [1992]  1 WLR 446 at pp. 453-4, Lord Templeman objected strenuously to the practice of taking "every point conceivable and inconceivable without judgment and discrimination" and exhorted judges and appellate courts to control the conduct of proceedings.  Lord Roskill agreed with him (at p.448), saying: </p>
<p></p><ul>"The Court of Appeal appear to have taken the view that the plaintiffs were entitled of right to have their case tried to conclusion in such manner as they thought fit and if necessary after all the evidence on both sides had been adduced.  With great respect, like my noble and learned friend, I emphatically disagree.  In the Commercial Court and indeed in any trial court it is the trial judge who has control of the proceedings.  It is part of his duty to identify the crucial issues and to see they are tried as expeditiously and as inexpensively as possible.   .....   Litigants are not entitled to the uncontrolled use of a trial judge's time.  Other litigants await their turn.  …"<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;156. There is always an exercise of judgment to be undertaken by the judge whether the perceived short-cut will turn out to have been beneficial and, inevitably in a proportion of cases expectations will be confounded.  Caution is required.  But it is simplistic to suppose that in complex litigation the exercise should never be attempted.  The volume of documentation and the complexity of the issues raised on the pleadings should be the subject of critical scrutiny and should not without more deter the judge from considering whether it is really necessary to commit the parties and the court to a lengthy trial and all the preparatory steps which that will involve.  Indeed it can be submitted with force that those are just the sorts of case which most strongly cry out for the exclusion of anything that is unnecessary for the achievement of a just outcome for the parties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;157. The present case illustrates these considerations.  The Commercial Judge was faced with an action dependant upon a cause of action of which the parameters were not wholly certain and a statement of claim which may or may not have disclosed a case sufficient in law to enable the plaintiffs to succeed.  He ordered the trial of preliminary questions of law.  He was clearly right to do so even though the decision of those questions has led to appeals to your Lordships' House.  However difficulties then arose with the plaintiffs' pleadings.  At each level the plaintiffs have re-pleaded their case to accommodate the fresh thinking about the elements of the tort of misfeasance in public office.  Further, the courts at each level have been called on to adjudicate upon the proposed revised pleading, your Lordships included.  This has led to an unsatisfactory state of affairs.  Any skilful pleader should be able to draft a pleading which sufficiently makes the minimum allegations to support the legal definition of the tort and I have detected no lack of skill in the lawyers acting for either side in this litigation.  The question then becomes whether the particulars given provide realistic support for the primary allegations.  This has in turn led to a detailed examination both in the courts below and before your Lordships of these allegations.  I will have to comment upon the suitability of that course in your Lordships' House.  It was probably inevitable before the judge and may have been so before the Court of Appeal where questions of leave to amend were also debated.  It was complicated in the Court of Appeal by the fact that Auld LJ did not agree with the majority on the law.  Before the judge and in the Court of Appeal the decision was given on the basis of the Rules of the Supreme Court not the Civil Procedure Rules.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;158. This leads me back to the CPR.  As previously noted, Part 1 adopts a philosophy similar to that enunciated in <i>Ashmore v Lloyd's</i>.  It is followed through into the new version of RSC O.14.  It is Part 24.  It authorises the court to decide a claim (or a particular issue) without a trial.  Unlike O.14, it applies to both plaintiffs (claimants) and the defendants.  It therefore can be used in cases such as the present where the application for judgment without trial is being made by the defendant.  The court may exercise the power where it considers that the "claimant has no real prospect of succeeding on the claim" and "there is no other reason why the case or issue should be disposed of at a trial".  The concluding phrase corresponds to the similar phrase used in RSC O.14 r.3(1) and has not been relied upon in the present case.  The important words are "no real prospect of succeeding".  It requires the judge to undertake an exercise of judgment.  He must decide whether to exercise the power to decide the case without a trial and give a summary judgment.  It is a 'discretionary' power, <i>ie</i> one where the choice whether to exercise the power lies within the jurisdiction of the judge.  Secondly, he must carry out the necessary exercise of assessing the prospects of success of the relevant party.  If he concludes that there is "no real prospect", he may decide the case accordingly.  I stress this aspect because in the course of argument counsel referred to the relevant judgment of Clarke J as if he had made "findings" of fact.  He did not do so.  Under RSC O.14 as under CPR Part 24, the judge is making an assessment not conducting a trial or fact-finding exercise.  Whilst it must be remembered that the wood is composed of trees some of which may need to be looked at individually, it is the assessment of the whole that is called for.  A measure of analysis may be necessary but the 'bottom line' is what ultimately matters.  Part 24 includes provisions covering various ancillary matters, at what stage the application can be made (24.4),  the filing of evidence (24.5) and supplementary powers of the court (24.6).  The Practice Direction which was originally appended filled out some of what is in the rules.</p>
<p></p><ul>"4.2	 Where a defendant applies for judgment in his favour on the claimant's claim, the court will give that judgment if either:<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(1) the claimant has failed to show a case which, if unanswered,<br>      would entitle him to judgment, or<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(2) the defendant has shown that the claim would be bound to be<br>      dismissed at trial.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"4.3 Where it appears to the court possible that a claim or defence may succeed but improbable that it will do so, the court may make a conditional order as described below."<p></p></ul>
<p>The criterion which the judge has to apply under Part 24 is not one of probability; it is absence of reality.  The majority in the Court of Appeal used the phrases "no realistic possibility"and distinguished between a practical possibility and "what is fanciful or inconceivable".  ([2000] 2 WLR p.91G)  Although used n a slightly different context these phrases appropriately express the same idea.  Part 3 of the CPR contains similar provisions in relation to the court's case management powers.  These include explicit powers to strike out claims and defences on the ground, among others,  that the statement of case discloses no reasonable ground for bringing or defending the claim.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;159. Before your Lordships it was accepted by counsel that this part of the appeal should be decided under CPR Part 24 applying the criterion "no real prospect of success".  An exchange of correspondence has confirmed this.  (A similar criterion is also appropriate where there is an application for leave to amend to add a new case.)  Recent statements in the Court of Appeal concerning Part 24 bear repetition:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The words 'no real prospect of being successful or succeeding' do not need any amplification, they speak for themselves.  The word 'real' distinguishes fanciful prospects of success or, as [counsel] submits, they direct the court to the need to see whether there is a 'realistic' as opposed to a 'fanciful' prospect of success."<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"It is important that a judge in appropriate cases should make use of the powers contained in Part 24.  In doing so he or she gives effect to the overriding objectives contained in Part 1.  It saves expense; it achieves expedition; it avoids the court's resources being used up on cases where this serves no purpose and, I would add, generally, that it is in the interests of justice.  If a claimant has a case which is bound to fail, then it is in the claimant's interests to know as soon as possible that that is the position."     <i>Swain v Hillman</i> [2001] 1 All ER 91, 92, 94, Lord Woolf MR<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"The CPR are a procedural code with the overriding objective of enabling the court to deal with cases justly including saving expense and ensuring that it is dealt with expeditiously and fairly.  The court must seek to give effect to the overriding objective when it exercises any power given to it or interprets any rule.  I take this into account when considering the application under Part 24.2. … [The language of Part 3.4] is very akin to that in the now extinct RSC O.18 &amp; 19 and under which this application was commenced (and as good as succeeded) at the first hearing.  This Part includes 'a claim which raises an unwinnable case where continuance of the proceedings is without any possible benefit to the respondent and would waste resources on both sides'." <i>Sinclair v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire and Anor </i>(A2/2000/2075), CA, 12 December 2000, Otton LJ at p 15. (and see <i>Harris v Bolt Burdon</i> 2000 CPLR 9)<p></p></ul>
<p>There is no point in allowing claims to proceed which have no real prospect of success, certainly not in proceeding beyond the stage where their hopelessness has clearly become apparent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;160. The difficulty in the application of the criterion used by Part 24 is that it requires an assessment to be made in advance of a full trial as to what the outcome of such a trial would be.  The pre-trial procedures give the claimant an opportunity to obtain additional evidence to support his case.  The most obvious of these is discovery of documents but there is also the weapon of requesting particulars or interrogatories and the exchange of witness statements may provide a party with additional important material.  Therefore the courts have in the present case recognised that they must have regard not only to the evidence presently available to the plaintiffs but also to any realistic prospect that that evidence would have been strengthened between now and the trial.  Indeed, it was the submission of Mr Stadlen QC for the defendants that Clarke J had applied the right test when he said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In my judgment the question in the instant case is whether the Bank has persuaded the court that the plaintiffs' case is bound to fail on the material at present available and that there is no reasonable possibility of evidence becoming available to the plaintiff, whether by further investigation, discovery, cross-examination or otherwise sufficiently to support their case and to give it some prospect of success.  If the Bank discharges that burden, it will follow that the plaintiffs' claim is bound to fail.  In that event to allow the action to proceed would serve no useful purpose.  It would only involve the expenditure of time and money - in this case a very great deal of both.  Neither party would have any legitimate interest in such expenditure because it could not benefit either." (p.6-7)<p></p></ul>
<p>It is possible that this test, in its reference to cross-examination, may be rather too favourable to the plaintiffs.  It is derived from what was said in relation to a plea of justification by Neill LJ in <i>McDonald's Corporation v Steel</i> [1995]  3 AER 615, a defamation action.  He included cross-examination no doubt because in a defamation action, although the burden of proving justification is upon the defendant, the publisher of the libel, it is normal for the plaintiff to call his evidence first; justification is a defence.  Where an allegation of dishonesty is being made as part of the cause of action of the plaintiff, there is no reason why the rule should not apply that the plaintiff must have a proper basis for making an allegation of dishonesty in his pleading.  The hope that something may turn up during the cross-examination of a witness at the trial does not suffice.  It is of course different if the admissible material available discloses a reasonable <i>prima facie</i> case which the other party will have to answer at the trial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;161. The judge's assessment has to start with the relevant party's pleaded case but the enquiry does not end there.  The allegations may be legally adequate but may have no realistic chance of being proved.  On the other hand, the limitations in the allegations pleaded and any lack of particularisation may show that the party's case is hopeless.  The tort of misfeasance in public office is a tort which involves bad faith and in that sense dishonesty.  It follows that to substantiate his claim in this tort, first in his pleading and then at the trial, a plaintiff must be able to allege and then prove this subjectively dishonest state of mind.  The law quite rightly requires that questions of dishonesty be approached more rigorously than other questions of fault.  The burden of proof remains the civil burden - the balance of probabilities - but the assessment of the evidence has to take account of the seriousness of the allegations and, if that be the case, any unlikelihood that the person accused of dishonesty would have acted in that way.  Dishonesty is not to be inferred from evidence which is equally consistent with mere negligence.  At the pleading stage the party making the allegation of dishonesty has to be prepared to particularise it and, if he is unable to do so, his allegation will be struck out.  The allegation must be made upon the basis of evidence which will be admissible at the trial.  This common sense proposition has recently been re-emphasised by the Court of Appeal in <i>Medcalf v Mardell</i> (A3/2000/6456) 24 November 2000, in which Peter Gibson LJ said (§40):  "The material evidence must be evidence which can be put before the court to make good the allegation."  Evidence which cannot be used in court cannot be relied upon to justify the making of the allegation of dishonesty.  I mention this because it shows the principle to be applied and not because there is any suggestion in the present case that there is any inadmissible material which would support allegations of dishonesty in the present case.  It is normally to be assumed that a party's pleaded case is the best case he can make (or wishes to make).  Therefore, in the present case, the particulars given provide a true guide to the nature of the case being made by the plaintiffs (claimants).</p>
