<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;137.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Connor and Rollock, after a retirement of 6 hours and 46 minutes, the jury convicted both of them by a majority of 10 to 2 of wounding their victim with intent to cause him grievous bodily harm.  The weapon alleged to have caused the wounds was a knife.  It appears that the indictment, in that it contained only this single count, was most unfortunately drafted since it gave no scope for convicting  either defendant of any of the alternative or lesser offences with a different <i>actus reus</i> which on the prosecution case had been committed.  There was no issue that the victim had been seriously assaulted and that the defendants had been involved in a concerted attack on him.  What was disputed was which of them had carried and used the knife.  After a summing up in which the judge may be thought to have given legal directions which were in places too favourable to the defendants but included a direction on joint enterprise (which was the prosecution's primary case), the jury retired.  Five days after the verdicts had been given and the jury discharged and had dispersed, a juror wrote a letter to the court clerk.  The main thrust of the letter was that the majority jurors were determined to convict both defendants and the deliberations reached the stage where they were no longer prepared to listen to the dissenting juror's arguments.  "When I raised objections to this, and said we must then look at whether it was one or the other, they maintained their guilty stance, and said that we could be here for another week.  I said better that, than convict an innocent man, but then it developed into bedlam, and the majority guilty verdict was agreed."  This letter gave vent to the dissenting juror's frustration at her failure to persuade the majority to accept her views and having to accept that majority verdicts could be returned.  But this is just the type of case which the majority verdict procedure was designed to deal with - prolonged period of deliberation - inability of the jury to reach a unanimous verdict - a majority direction - a final verdict returned by the majority.  It can be commented that the disagreement whether either of the defendants were "innocent" perhaps arose from the dissenting juror having overlooked the fact that joint enterprise was a possible conclusion.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;138.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact both these letters, even though received after the jury had been discharged, were treated seriously by the judge who presided at the trial and the Court of Appeal.  Leave to appeal was given in both cases and the letters were disclosed to counsel for the parties. Copies are in the bundles of documents provided to your Lordships.  Both appeals to the Court of Appeal were heard by a constitution presided over by Rose LJ.  The fully reasoned judgment was given in the <i>Mirza</i> appeal; in <i>Connor and Rollock</i> they followed <i>Mirza</i>.  On both appeals they considered that they were bound by <i>R v Qureshi</i> [2002] 1 WLR 518.  No other grounds of appeal than the letters were raised or, if raised, upheld.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;139.&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with all of your Lordships that s.8 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981does not carry the decision of these matters any further.  The outcome of these appeals raises a question of the compatibility of the common law with the requirement of impartiality in Art 6(1) of the Human Rights Convention.  If the common law rule is incompatible, s.8, at any rate in the present factual context, cannot be compatible.  But it must be added that the concept of a court being in contempt of itself cannot, on any view, be correct.  Thus a communication by a juror to the court itself cannot without more, <i>eg</i> malice, dishonesty or improper motive, be a contempt of court; nor can be an inquiry addressed by the court or an authorised agent of the court to a person and a response to the court by that person to that inquiry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;140.&nbsp;&nbsp;In English law the impartiality of the determination of criminal guilt is protected at a number of levels.  It is protected by the trial judge's supervision of the trial and his ability to discharge the jury or individual jurors.  The judge gives them guidance during the trial and, before they retire, gives them directions both upon the law and upon the correct approach to the evidence given.  Thus, the judge includes a direction about discarding prejudice.  The judge is required to exclude prosecution evidence which is prejudicial not probative.  The Court of Appeal has the role already described.  The jurors are randomly selected and are required to take the juror's oath before being empanelled.  They are specifically required not to discuss the case with others or to be influenced by anything they hear or read outside the court room.  The European Court of Human Rights have endorsed the English system in the cases cited by Lord Hope and Lord Rodger, in particular in <i>Gregory v UK</i> 25 EHRR 577.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;141.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>Remli</i> case (22 EHRR 253) stressed by Lord Steyn is clearly different.  The offensive remarks made by the individual before he had been finally selected and empanelled for the relevant case were overheard by a member of the public standing at the door of the court before the actual trial had started.  The defence did not know about this at the time and did not have the opportunity to challenge his inclusion in the jury.  The subsequent municipal right of appeal was confined to questions of law and apparently left no scope for an appeal based on the event complained of.  No question of jury confidentiality arose.  The court was told about the event during the second day of the three day trial.  The Court of Human Rights held that their response to it had been inadequate.  In England there would have been no difficulty.  The trial judge would be expected to respond adequately by investigating the report and dealing with it appropriately across a range of options including discharging the juror in question or the whole jury.  The judge's duties and powers were in no way inadequate.  If he got it wrong, the Court of Appeal could put it right.  In <i>Sander v UK</i> 31 EHRR 1003, a bare majority of the Human Rights Court held, in disagreement with the Court of Appeal, that the trial judge's response had been inadequate.  Paradoxically the Court went on to hold that no reparation was called for as no causal connection was established between the alleged partiality of the jury and the fact that, under the sentence of the court following his conviction, he had spent 3 years in gaol. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;142.&nbsp;&nbsp;The confidentiality of jury deliberations is a well established principle of both English law and Scottish law. (<i>eg</i>, <i>Ellis v Deheer</i> [1922] 2 KB 113, <i>R v Miah</i> [1997] 2 Cr App R 12, <i>Russell v HM Advocate</i> 1991 JC 194, 1992 SLT 25)  The confidentiality is not temporary: it is permanent and not capable of waiver.  Thus, the duty of the juror to respect that confidentiality continues, indeed it especially applies, after the case is over and the jury has been discharged and dispersed.  Nothing could be more destructive of the duty of confidentiality than the juror coming out of court and communicating his or her views about the jury's deliberations to the media or to persons who are likely to disagree with the verdict which was returned.  The rationale of the rule includes the need for finality.  A verdict returned in the presence of all of the jurors and on their behalf is not to be open to second thoughts and must, subject to very limited exceptions, <i>eg</i> patent inconsistency with another verdict, be accepted by the trial judge.  This finality works as much in favour of the accused as against him.  Finality is what the acquitted defendant wants and needs; the convicted defendant on the other hand can always invoke his right of appeal to the Court of Appeal.  But for present purposes, another reason for the principle is more important.  It underpins the independence and impartiality of the jury as a whole.  It enables them to be true to their oath to return a true verdict according to the evidence without fearing the consequences of the reporting of things individual jurors have said or the arguments they have advanced.  They can play their part in the collective deliberations of the jury without fear of quotation, embarrassment or victimisation.  A jury is a collection of lay citizens selected at random.  They arrive at the court with all their preconceptions and misconceptions.  They are shown a video explaining the framework within which a jury is required to play its part and the duty of confidentially.  Those randomly selected are each required to take the juror's oath before they are empanelled.  The trial judge will himself, as the course of the trial dictates, reinforce the message, for example reminding them that the only evidence is that adduced at the trial not what their friends and relations or the media say, and that they must discard any prejudices they may have had and approach the case with an open mind and he will direct them further during his summing-up. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;143.&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is a jury which acts collectively and cohesively which arrives at a verdict which represents the agreed conclusions of the collective deliberation.  Jurors are drawn from all walks of life.  Many of them will be unaccustomed to discussing an issue in such company in a structured way.  Their deliberations may be stormy requiring the reconciliation of strongly held views.  It is essential to their ability nevertheless to perform cohesively and properly deliberate together within the confines of the jury that they are protected by the confidentiality rule.  Before 1974, whilst the verdict had to be unanimous, there were problems which arose from the requirement of unanimity - over lengthy or inconclusive deliberations, time pressures distorting the deliberations or being used to bring pressure upon dissenters.  It also increased the risk of successful jury nobbling.  Hence the introduction of majority verdicts.  This change provided another support to the integrity of the jury.  But it created the risk that, if combined with an abandonment of the confidentiality rule, it would have precisely the opposite effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;144.&nbsp;&nbsp;The jury trial has been adopted in all the main common law jurisdictions.  It is rightly regarded as a bastion of the criminal justice system against domination of the state and a safeguard of the liberty of its citizens.  This is an affirmation of human rights principles.  The detail in each country may differ in order to suit their own culture.  For example in the United States of America there is a very thorough and public procedure of jury vetting which precedes the empanelling of the jury, including an investigation of their prejudices and whether they are prepared to put them on one side and this compensates for allowing individual jurors to be interviewed after the end of the trial upon their reasons for voting for the verdict.  If the criminal justice systems of the United Kingdom were to abandon the jury confidentiality rule, I see no stopping point in the other changes which would consequentially have to be made short of introducing a full-blown pre-trial procedure of jury vetting in order to maintain an acceptable minimum level of finality and public confidence in the jury verdict.  At present, with the jury confidentiality rule, there is an appropriate degree of finality in guilty verdicts and a high level of <i>public</i> confidence in the system.  For the public it is a highly valued part of our unwritten constitution.  The present lack of public confidence relates to the defective enforcement of the criminal law both before and after the trial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;145.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus far, the arguments of the appellants under Art 6(1) of the Convention are clearly unsound.  The rationality of the jury confidentiality rule is incontrovertible.  The objects of the rule are all ones which reinforce the values in that Article.  They provide essential assistance for the jury to operate as a collective body independently of outside influences and be impartial.  It helps them to reach a determination of the criminal charge within a reasonable time without the need for retrials every time a juror wanted to change his or her mind or express his or her dissatisfaction with the reasoning of the majority.  In so far as a verdict of guilty returned at the trial may be alleged to be unsafe, there exists the procedures of the Court of Appeal <i>objectively</i> to review the safety of the conviction and remedy any miscarriage of justice disclosed.  The Court of Appeal also has very wide powers to hear fresh evidence and direct the Registrar to obtain documents and make inquiries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;146.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only tenable argument against the jury confidentiality rule relates to its expression as a rule of admissibility of evidence.  It might be argued that a rule expressed in such terms is disproportionate.  This however is an over-simplification.  The question of admissibility relates not to what the judge or judges see or read but what they take into account in making a substantive decision and what they treat as legitimate evidence for the parties to use in argument.  Thus a jury note or letter will, save in exceptional circumstances, always be looked at by the trial judge and, if there is an appeal, by the Court of Appeal (the legal expression is <i>de bene esse</i> -  <i>ie</i> for what it is worth); its existence and character will normally be disclosed to the parties' counsel and submissions as to its significance, and/or responded to, be invited.  But once its status as a breach of jury confidentiality has been established, the only appropriate response is to treat it as inadmissible in the sense I have described.  A semi-certain doctrine of confidentiality would effectively mean abandoning the rule as such and the protection of the values which it provides.  In the law, it is necessary to have some rules which draw bright lines.  Perhaps the most striking example of this is the rule of legal professional privilege as stated by Lord Taylor CJ with the agreement of all the other members of the House in <i>Reg v Derby Magistrates' Court, Ex p B</i> [1996]  AC 487 at 508 that the rule applies "across the board in every case, irrespective of the client's individual merits".  (This statement has been approved and applied in many subsequent cases.)  The bright line is necessary in order to preserve the beneficial rule: it is not disproportionate.  I therefore reject this argument, however seductively it is presented.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;147.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons and those given and to be given by my noble and learned friends Lord Hope of Craighead and Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, I would dismiss both of the appeals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;148.&nbsp;&nbsp;But like Lord Hope, I would point out that the operation of the existing rule needs additional clarification and explanation.  I can of course only speak about England and Wales.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been statements in the past that the duty of confidentiality applies from the moment the jurors are empanelled or so long as they are in the "jury box".  (See <i>eg</i> the passages quoted from earlier cases, and adopted, in <i>Miah</i> and <i>Qureshi</i>.)  The original statements were coloured by the position at the time they were made: it was not in earlier days the general practice to require juries to retire to consider their verdict and they would confer and decide upon their verdict in the jury box without leaving the court-room; in murder trials, the jury were enclosed, <i>ie</i> segregated, from the moment they were empanelled.  The modern position is more sophisticated and the statement of principle should reflect this.  Obviously from the time the jury are empanelled they must be reminded by the judge what the words "in accordance with the evidence" mean: they must not discuss the case, or any aspect of it, with or be influenced by anyone not of their number, least of all outsiders or the media.  The judge will usually remind them of this when they first disperse on the first day of the trial (assuming the trial is not over by then).  Then, during the course of the trial, it is the continuing duty of the trial judge to deal with any problems which arise with the jury and be alert to detect any signs which may lead to a risk of a mistrial.  To this end the jury must be told of their right and duty both individually or collectively to inform the court clerk or the judge in writing if they believe that anything untoward or improper has come to their notice.  The judge can then deal with the matter in an appropriate way.  He already has to deal with such matters as improper approaches to the jury, an unexpected recognition of or knowledge of a defendant or a witness and personal difficulties of jurors and has a power, within limits, to discharge individual jurors.  He may of course, if necessary, discharge the whole jury and start again.  He should also include in his summing up such suitable reminders warnings and directions as the circumstances require.  After the judge has told the jury to retire and decide upon their verdict and the jury bailiff has been sworn, the trial enters upon a new phase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;After retirement, the judge may either of his own motion or in response to a jury note call the jury back into court and give them further directions or assistance with the evidence in the case.  This he will do in open court.  The jury should however be reminded that everything that is said during their deliberations is confidential to them and may not ever be repeated or discussed outside the jury room.  After verdict and the discharge and dispersal of the jury, the jury's role in the case has come to an end and cannot be resurrected; any matter arising thereafter will be for the Court of Appeal.  But the duty of the juror not to breach the confidentiality continues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Any communication received at any stage of the trial from the jury or any member of it or any communication or report from any one else about the jury or a member of it should be preserved.  The same will apply, within reason, to anything received by the court after the end of the trial so that it can be forwarded or made available to the Court of Appeal or other relevant body.  Any discussion with counsel regarding any communication, whether in the judge's room or in court, must be recorded in a transcribable form and preserved. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;The adequacy of the existing jury video should be reviewed to see that it adequately covers all the points which deal with the rights and duties of jurors in this regard covering and distinguishing between the various stages: during the trial from the time of being empanelled to the time of retirement, during the retirement and the deliberations upon their verdict(s), and the period after they have delivered their verdict(s) and been discharged.  My impression is that it does not.  It is also desirable that the Judicial Studies Board consider the implications of the Opinions delivered in these appeals and whether it would be desirable that trial judges and court clerks receive appropriate additional guidance.  All matters of detail are for the JSB and those responsible for the video to take further in accordance with their more direct experience of current perceptions and practices.  The same applies to any further Practice Directions that the Court of Appeal might decide to make.</p>
<p><b>LORD RODGER OF EARLSFERRY</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;149.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the privilege of reading the speeches of my noble and learned friends, Lord Hope of Craighead and Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough, in draft.  I respectfully agree with them but add some observations of my own since there is a division of opinion among your Lordships.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;150.&nbsp;&nbsp;The central allegation advanced on behalf of the appellant Mirza is that members of the jury at his trial were prejudiced against him on racial grounds and so did not deliberate impartially on his case.  The appellants Connor and Rollock contend that the jury in their trial decided to convict both of them because it would have taken too long to consider the case against each of them separately and, in any event, this would teach them a lesson, things in life not being fair and innocent people sometimes having to pay the price.  In both appeals the allegations are based on a letter sent by a member of the jury after the trial was over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;151.&nbsp;&nbsp;Racial prejudice is an especially corrosive form of prejudice that has come to prominence with changes in the make-up of the British population.  It may take different forms, some being more prevalent in some parts of the country than in others.  The eradication of such prejudice is regarded as a common priority goal for the member states of the Council of Europe:  <i>Sander v United Kingdom </i>(2000) 31 EHRR 1003, 1008, para 23.  But, unhappily, racial prejudice is no new phenomenon in Britain:  until fairly recently, for example, anti-semitism was frequently encountered, especially in middle-class milieux.  Since jurors are drawn from a cross-section of the population, we must therefore suppose that in their everyday lives some may indeed be racially prejudiced, whether against black people or against white people, or against particular racial groups.  But, unhappily too, this is just one of many prejudices which may be found, we must also suppose, in the pool of people summoned for jury service.  Some may be affected by religious bias, others may make it a rule always to believe an Irishman but never to trust a Scotsman, others again will never trust a man in a suit or a woman in trousers, while still others may be predisposed to believe anything - or nothing - that a police officer says.  Except to the extent that the law forbids it, people are free to hold, and to run their lives by, such prejudices - however irrational, unattractive or downright pernicious.  Not so, however, when the same people deliberate as jurors since, if given free rein, any of these prejudices might make for a partial verdict.  The point goes deeper.  Even jurors who harbour no such particular antecedent prejudices will usually identify more readily with people whose way of life is similar to their own and, correspondingly, look askance at those with very different, and apparently inferior, lifestyles.  Yet, more often than not, jurors from ordinary respectable backgrounds have to judge those who, the evidence in the trial shows, lead very different lives - not working, ruthlessly exploiting the social security system, taking drugs, regularly drinking to gross excess and generally acting in an anti-social fashion.  There is an obvious risk that, hearing this kind of evidence, jurors may be biased against such a defendant.  What matters therefore is not the particular type or source of prejudice but the risk that it may result in a partial verdict.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;152.&nbsp;&nbsp;The risk that those chosen as jurors may be prejudiced in various ways is, and always has been, inherent in trial by jury.  Indeed, only the most foolish would deny that judges too may be prejudiced, whether, for example, in favour of a pretty woman or a handsome man, or against one whose dress, general demeanour or lifestyle offends.  The legal system does not ignore these risks:  indeed it constantly guards against them.  It works, however, on the basis that, in general, the training of professional judges and the judicial oath that they take mean that they can and do set their prejudices on one side when judging a case.  Similarly, the law supposes that, when called upon to exercise judgment in the special circumstances of a trial, in general, jurors can and do set their prejudices aside and act impartially.  The recognised starting-point is, therefore, that all the individual members of a jury are presumed to be impartial until there is proof to the contrary:  <i>Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v Belgium </i>(1981) 4 EHRR 1, 21, para 58;  <i>Sander v United Kingdom </i>(2000) 31 EHRR 1003, 1008, para 25.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;153.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appeal by Connor and Rollock also raises a familiar type of complaint.  They allege that the jurors chose the easy way out - convicting both of them - rather than spend time deliberating on their individual guilt.  Alexander Pope skewered that type of abuse almost 300 years ago in his chilling remark, "And wretches hang that jurymen may dine".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;154.&nbsp;&nbsp;The particular allegations in these appeals are therefore modern examples of kinds of criticism that could always, potentially, have been made of jury deliberations and verdicts not only in this country but wherever the jury system has established itself in the English-speaking world.  Various safeguards have been introduced to guard against these possible abuses.  Some systems allow jury vetting, with an elaborate voire dire when the jurors are chosen.  That is not the practice in Britain where jurors are simply chosen at random, with the defence having a right to challenge a juror only on cause shown.  In England, however, the jurors swear an oath, or affirm, that they will "faithfully try the defendant and give a true verdict according to the evidence."  A not dissimilar formula is used in Scotland.  The trial is then conducted in a serious atmosphere and in a manner that constantly reminds the jurors that the crucial responsibility for deciding the case rests with them.  Before they retire to deliberate, the judge gives them directions which they are duty-bound to apply.  Not least they are told that, when considering their verdict, they must put aside all prejudices of whatever kind and reach their verdict only on the evidence.  Therefore, despite what is sometimes said, the idea is not that the jurors may indulge their different prejudices and that these will then, mysteriously, cancel one another out.  On the contrary, the jurors are expected - perhaps for the only time in their lives - to decide the issues without prejudice.  They are also expected to apply the other directions on law that the judge has given them.  Individual jurors will usually come under group pressure to fulfil these expectations.  The European Court of Human Rights ("the European Court") recognises that these features of jury trial in Britain help guarantee the objective impartiality of the jury:  <i>Pullar v United Kingdom </i>(1996) 22 EHRR 391;  <i>Gregory v United Kingdom </i>(1997) 25 EHRR 577.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;155.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like any other human institution, however, trial by jury in criminal cases is neither perfect nor infallible.  Some distinguished commentators therefore advocate its abolition and replacement with a system of trial by (imperfect and fallible) judges - as has largely happened in civil cases in England and Wales.  Trial by jury must, of course, be fair.  But counsel did not submit that a fair jury trial was impossible in cases like the present.  Nor did they submit that, whether by virtue of article 6(1) of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms ("the Convention") or otherwise, juries should be required to give reasons for their verdicts.  On the contrary, the appeals were argued on the footing that, in principle, jury trial was fair, even though the jury did not give reasons for their verdict.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;156.&nbsp;&nbsp;Allegations of misconduct by jurors may surface at any stage of a trial before the jury has returned a verdict.  In such cases there is no reason why the allegations should not be investigated.  Judges must accordingly take appropriate steps to investigate and deal with any such matter that arises then.  For instance, after the appellant Mirza gave evidence in his trial, the jury questioned his use of an interpreter.  This was thought to be indicative of possible prejudice.  The problem was addressed by a joint admission of counsel for the prosecution and the defence, by passages in counsel's speeches to the jury and in the judge's summing up.  In practice the court will respond in various ways, depending on the circumstances.  If it turns out on investigation of an allegation that the jury as a whole is fatally compromised, the judge will discharge them.  Where only one particular juror is fatally compromised, the judge will discharge that juror and the trial will proceed with the remaining jurors.  In less serious cases the judge will deal with the matter by giving the jury appropriate directions.  The approach adopted by the English courts is to be contrasted with that of the court in <i>Remli v France </i>(1996) 22 EHRR 252.  That court refused to take any notice of a racist remark that a juror was alleged to have made before the hearing of the case began.  Not surprisingly the European Court held that there had been a breach of article 6(1) of the Convention.</p>
