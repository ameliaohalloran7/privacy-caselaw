<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77. But there is a third question, which was the subject of some debate in the light of the <i>Hunt</i> case but has now been brought right out into the open by sections 3(1) and 6(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998.  It used to be whether placing the burden on the accused by the particular statute can be justified by broader considerations of policy: see Peter Mirfield, The Legacy of <i>Hunt </i>[1988] Crim L R 19; D J Birch, Hunting the Snark; the Elusive Statutory Exception [1988] Crim L R 221; Peter Mirfield, An Ungrateful Reply [1988] Crim L R 233.  It can now be expressed in the language which is appropriate to an examination of the Convention rights.</p>
<i><p><i>(b) making use of section 3(1)</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78. Section 3(1) of the 1998 Act provides that, so far as it is possible to do so, primary and secondary legislation must be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights.  I should now like to explain how, as I see it, this important and far-reaching new approach to the construction of statutes should be employed consistently with the need (a) to respect the will of the legislature so far as this remains appropriate and (b) to preserve the integrity of our statute law so far this is possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79. The first point, as I said in paragraph 108 of my speech in <i>R v A</i> [2001]  UKHL 25, is that the effect of section 3(1) is that the interpretation which it requires is to be achieved only so far as this is possible.  The word "must", which section 3(1) uses, is qualified by the phrase "so far as it is possible to do so".  The obligation, powerful though it is, is not to be performed without regard to its limitations.  Resort to it will not be possible if the legislation contains provisions, either in the words or phrases which are under scrutiny or elsewhere, which expressly contradict the meaning which the enactment would have to be given to make it compatible.  The same consequence will follow if legislation contains provisions which have this effect by necessary implication.  Further justification for giving this qualified meaning to section 3(1) is to be found in the words "read and give effect."  As the side note indicates, the obligation is one which applies to the interpretation of legislation.  This function belongs, as it has always done, to the judges.  But it is not for them to legislate.  Section 3(1) preserves the sovereignty of Parliament. It does not give power to the judges to overrule decisions which the language of the statute shows have been taken on the very point at issue by the legislator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80. The second point, as I said in paragraph 110 of my speech in <i>R v A</i>, is that great care must be taken, in cases where a different meaning has to be given to the legislation from the ordinary meaning of the words used by the legislator, to identify precisely the word or phrase which, if given its ordinary meaning, would otherwise be incompatible.  Just as much care must then be taken to say how the word or phrase is to be construed if it is to be made compatible.  The justification for this approach to the use of section 3(1) is to be found in the nature of legislation itself.  Its primary characteristic, for present purposes, is its ability to achieve certainty by the use of clear and precise language.  It provides a set of rules by which, according to the ordinary meaning of the words used, the conduct of affairs may be regulated.  So far as possible judges should seek to achieve the same attention to detail in their use of language to express the effect of applying section 3(1) as the parliamentary draftsman would have done if he had been amending the statute.  It ought to be possible for any words that need to be substituted to be fitted in to the statute as if they had been inserted there by amendment.  If this cannot be done without doing such violence to the statute as to make it unintelligible or unworkable, the use of this technique will not be possible.  It will then be necessary to leave it to Parliament to amend the statute and to resort instead to the making of a declaration of incompatibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81. As to the techniques that may be used, it is clear that the courts are not bound by previous authority as to what the statute means.  It has been suggested that a strained or non-literal construction may be adopted, that words may be read in by way of addition to those used by the legislator and that the words may be "read down" to give them a narrower construction that their ordinary meaning would bear: Clayton and Tomlinson, The Law of Human Rights, para 4.28, p 168 (Oxford, 2000).  It may be enough simply to say what the effect of the provision is without altering the ordinary meaning of the words used: see <i>Brown v Stott</i> 2000  JC 328, 355B-C, per Lord Justice General Rodger.  In other cases, as in <i>Vasquez v The Queen</i> [1994]  1 WLR 1304, the words used will require to be expressed in different language in order to explain how they are to be read in a way that its compatible.  The exercise in these cases is one of translation into compatible language from language that is incompatible.  In other cases, as in <i>R v A</i>, it may be necessary for words to be read in to explain the meaning that must be given to the provision if it is to be compatible.  But the interpretation of a statute by reading words in to give effect to the presumed intention must always be distinguished carefully from amendment.  Amendment is a legislative act.  It is an exercise which must be reserved to Parliament. </p>
<i></i><p><i><i>(c) application of section 3(1) in this case</i> </i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82. The haphazard way in which reverse burden of proof provisions have been introduced into legislation by Parliament has been identified and persuasively criticised: Andrew Ashworth and Meredith Blake, The Presumption of Innocence in English Criminal Law [1996] Crim L R 306.  As they say, at p 314, nothing could be clearer than the 11th Report of the Criminal Law Revision Committee, <i>Evidence (General)</i>, Cmnd 4991 (1972), para 140 where the Committee stated: "we are strongly of the opinion that, both on principle and for the sake of clarity and convenience in practice, burdens on the defence should be evidential only."  It is generally accepted that <i>Woolmington </i>changed the law as to the burden of proof in the case of common law defences such as self-defence and non-insane automatism: Professor J C Smith, The Presumption of Innocence (1987) 38  NILQ 223, 226; <i>Vasquez v The Queen</i> [1994]  1 WLR 1304, 1309G-H.  The same approach has been taken in Scotland to where the onus lies in the case of all common law pleas and defences other than the plea of diminished responsibility and the defence of insanity: <i>Lambie v H M Advocate</i>, 1973 JC 53 (incrimination); <i>Ross v H M Advocate</i>, 1991 JC 210 (non-insane automatism).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83. The lack of clarity and the inconvenience of applying a different rule to defences created by statute is obvious in the present case.  Section 28(4) of the 1971 Act provides that nothing in that section shall prejudice any defence which it is open to a person when charged with an offence to which that section applies to raise apart from that section.  In this case the appellant did raise such a defence.  It was his defence of duress.  That defence was intimately bound up with his defence under the statute, as it depended entirely upon what the jury made of his evidence.  But the trial judge had to direct the jury that the onus as regards the defence of duress rested on the prosecution.  The jury were not told why there was a difference as to where the onus lay.  There was no need for this information to be given to them.  But it would not be surprising if they found it hard to maintain a clear distinction between the two positions as to onus when they examined the evidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84. There is no doubt that it is possible, in the light of section 3(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998, to read sections 28(2) and 28(3) of the 1971 Act in such a way as to impose no more than an evidential burden on the accused.  As it is a rule of construction, the exercise which section 3(1) prescribes makes it necessary to identify the words used by the legislature which would otherwise be incompatible with the Convention right and then to say how these words are to be construed according to the rule to make them compatible.  But in this case there is no difficulty.  As Lord Cooke of Thorndon said in <i>R v Director of Public Prosecutions, ex parte Kebilene</i> [2000 ]  2 AC 326, 373G:</p>
<p></p><ul>". . . for evidence that it is a <i>possible</i> meaning one could hardly ask for more than the opinion of Professor Glanville Williams in 'The Logic of "Exceptions"' [1988] CLJ 261, 265 that 'unless the contrary is proved' can be taken, in relation to a defence, to mean 'unless sufficient evidence is given to the contrary;' and the statute may then be satisfied by 'evidence that, if believed, and on the most favourable view, could be taken by a reasonable jury to support the defence'."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85. In <i>Vasquez v The Queen</i> [1994]  1 WLR 1304 the Privy Council were asked to consider the question whether section 116(a) of the Belize Criminal Code which placed the burden on the defendant to prove extreme provocation as a defence to murder contravened the defendant's right under 6(3)(a) of the Constitution of Belize to be presumed innocent until he was proved guilty.  Applying the principles described in <i>Attorney-General of The Gambia v Momodou</i> <i>Jobe </i>[1984]  AC 689, 700 by Lord Diplock and in <i>Attorney-General of Hong Kong v Lee Kwong-kut</i> [1993]  AC 951, 962 by Lord Woolf, the Board held that section 116(a) was in conflict with the Constitution and that it had to be modified to conform to it.  The words "if either of the following matters of extenuation be proved on his behalf" were to be construed as though they read "if there is such evidence as raises a reasonable doubt as to whether": p 1314D-E, per Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle.  It was by this means that Belize was brought into line with the other Commonwealth countries of the Caribbean, where the onus of proof of unprovoked killing was placed on the prosecution.  It provides a good example of the use of an interpretative obligation of the kind that has now been written into our domestic law by section 3(1) of the 1998 Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86. More recently, in <i>Michael Yearwood v The Queen</i> [2001]  UKPC  (June 2001) the Board held that section 239 of the Grenada Criminal Code, which is in the same terms as section 116 of the Belize Criminal Code, had to be read and given effect to in a way that was compatible with the provisions for the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms to which every person is entitled under the Constitution of Grenada, and in particular with section 8(2)(a) of the Constitution which entitles a person who is accused of a criminal charge to the presumption of innocence.  It held that the words "are proved on his behalf" in section 239 must be read and given effect to as if for those words there were substituted the words "are the subject of such evidence as to raise a reasonable doubt."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87. Of course, the fact that it is possible for a statutory provision to be read in this way does not mean that it must be so read.  The first question is whether, leaving aside section 3(1), there would be a breach of the Convention.  For the reasons which I sought to explain in <i>R v Director of Public Prosecutions, ex parte Kebilene</i> [2000]  2 AC 326, 383-388, I do not think that a reverse onus provision will inevitably give rise to a finding of incompatibility.  In <i>Salabiaku v France</i> (1988)  13 EHRR 379 at p 388, para 28 the European Court of Human Rights said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Presumptions of fact or of law operate in every legal system. Clearly, the Convention does not prohibit such presumptions in principle.  It does, however, require the contracting states to remain within certain limits in this respect as regards criminal law… Article 6(2) does not therefore regard presumptions of fact or of law provided for in the criminal law with indifference.  It requires states to confine them within reasonable limits which take into account the importance of what is at stake and maintain the rights of the defence."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88. Mr Owen said that the court was not concerned in the <i>Salabiaku</i> case with a provision applicable to a person charged with a serious criminal offence which placed the burden of proof on him with respect to an essential element of it.  That is true, but I do not think that this deprives it of value as a statement of principle.  What it means is that, as the article 6(2) right is not absolute and unqualified, the test to be applied is whether the modification or limitation of that right pursues a legitimate aim and whether it satisfies the principle of proportionality: <i>Ashingdane v United Kingdom</i> (1985)  7 EHRR 528;  see also <i>Brown v Stott</i> [2001]  2 WLR 817.  It is now well settled that the principle which is to be applied requires a balance to be struck between the general interest of the community and the protection of the fundamental rights of the individual.  This will not be achieved if the reverse onus provision goes beyond what is necessary to accomplish the objective of the statute.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89. The statutory objective is to penalise the unauthorised possession of dangerous or otherwise harmful drugs.  But the statute recognises, among other things, that it would be wrong to penalise those who neither knew nor suspected nor had reason to suspect the existence of some fact alleged by the prosecution which it is necessary for the prosecution to prove if he is to be convicted of the offence charged (section 28(2)) or that the substance or product in question is a controlled drug (section 28(3)(b)(i)).  That being so, it is hard to see why a person who is accused of the offence of possessing a controlled drug and who wishes to raise this defence should be deprived of the full benefit of the presumption of innocence.  The systems of control and prosecution might well be in jeopardy if there were to be an initial onus on the prosecution to establish that the accused knew these things.  The right to silence and the covert and unscrupulous nature of drug-related activities must be taken into account in the assessment as to whether a fair balance had been achieved.  But we are not concerned here with the initial onus.  As I have said in my answer to the first issue, the prosecution do not need to prove that the accused knew that the thing in his possession was a controlled drug.  This is a matter which must be raised by the defence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90. The choice then is between a persuasive burden, which is what the ordinary meaning of the statutory language lays down, and an evidential burden, which is the meaning which it is possible to give to the statutory language under section 3(1) of the 1998 Act.  If the evidential burden were to be so slight as to make no difference - if it were to be enough, for example, for the accused merely to mention the defence without adducing any evidence - important practical considerations would suggest that in the general interest of the community the burden would have to be a persuasive one.  But an evidential burden is not to be thought of as a burden which is illusory.  What the accused must do is put evidence before the court which, if believed, could be taken by a reasonable jury to support his defence. That is what Professor Glanville Williams envisaged when he was giving this meaning to the words "unless the contrary is proved": "The Logic of 'Exceptions'" [1988] CLJ 261, 265.  It is what the Judicial Committee envisaged in <i>Vasquez v The Queen</i> [1994]  1 WLR 1304, 1314G-H and in <i>Michael Yearwood v The Queen</i> [2001]  UKPC .  It is what the common law requires of a defendant who wishes to invoke one of the common law defences such as provocation or duress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91. The practical effect of reading section 28(2) and section 28(3) as imposing an evidential burden only on the accused and not a persuasive burden as they have been understood to impose hitherto is likely in almost every case that can be imagined to be minimal.  In <i>Salmon v H M Advocate</i>, 1999  JC 67, 75C-D, the Lord Justice General said this as to the effect on the accused of the persuasive burden:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is perhaps worth stating explicitly that, even though subsections (2) and (3) speak of the accused proving something, this does not imply that, to establish a defence, the accused must necessarily give evidence.  Doubtless, that would often be the simplest method of proof, but the necessary evidence might come, for example, from a 'mixed' statement or from witnesses speaking to what the accused was told was in the container or to the accused's apparent astonishment when the contents of the container were revealed and found to be a controlled drug."<p></p></ul>
<p>Those words are equally in point as an explanation of what the evidential burden requires of the accused.  The change in the nature of the burden is best understood by looking not at the accused and what he must do, but rather at the state of mind of the judge or jury when they are evaluating the evidence.  That is why, in the interests of clarity and convenience as well as on grounds of principle, a fair balance will be struck by reading and giving effect to these subsections as imposing an evidential burden only on the accused.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92. It is worth noting in this connection that Parliament itself has recently recognised the force of the argument that as a general rule statutory provisions which require the accused to prove something as a defence to the offence with which he has been charged should be read and given effect to as if they imposed only an evidential burden on him and not a probative one.  The Terrorism Act 2000 contains several provisions which say that it shall be a defence for a person charged with an offence to prove something.  For example, section 57(2) provides that it shall be a defence for him to prove that his possession of an article was not for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism.  But section 118(2), which applies to a number of provisions in the Act including section 57(2) which say that it is a defence for a person to prove something, provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"If the person adduces evidence which is sufficient to raise an issue with respect to the matter the court or jury shall assume that the defence is satisfied unless the prosecution proves beyond reasonable doubt that it is not."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93. Section 53(3) of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 is to the same effect.  It provides a defence to the offence of possession described in section 53(2).  It places the onus of proving the contrary beyond a reasonable doubt on the prosecutor if sufficient evidence of that fact is adduced to raise an issue with respect to it.  It is not unreasonable to think that, if Parliament were now to have an opportunity of reconsidering the words used in section 28(2) and (3) of the 1971 Act, it would be content to qualify them in precisely the same way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94. I would therefore read the words "to prove" in section 28(2) as if the words used in the subsection were "to give sufficient evidence", and I would give the same meaning to the words "if he proves" in section 28(3).  The effect which is to be given to this meaning is that the burden of proof remains on the prosecution throughout.  If sufficient evidence is adduced to raise the issue, it will be for the prosecution to show beyond reasonable doubt that the defence is not made out by the evidence.  The question whether these provisions must be read and given effect to in that way in this case depends on the issue of retrospectivity, to which I now turn.</p>
<i><p><i>The third issue: retrospectivity</i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
(a) <p><i>introduction</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95. The appellant's argument on this issue was presented under two main heads, which were stated as alternatives.  The first was based upon the provisions of section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998, read together with those of section 7(1)(b) and section 22(4).  The second was based upon the provisions of section 6(1) of the Act without reference to section 22(4).  Section 6(1) provides the starting point for each of these two alternative heads of argument.  It provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96. Each of these two alternatives raises questions about the structure of the 1998 Act.  So I must now try to describe that structure, with particular reference to the issue about the extent to which its provisions were intended to be retrospective.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97. It is first necessary to have regard to the Convention.  Article 13 of the Convention provides that everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in the Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority.  This article is not one of the Convention rights to which effect is given by the 1998 Act, but this was no accident.  As I observed in <i>Brown v Stott</i> [2001]  2 WLR 817, 847B, the reason which was given for its omission from the articles set out in Schedule 1 to the Act was that sections 7 to 9 of the Act were intended to lay down an appropriate remedial structure for giving effect to the Convention rights as defined by section 1(1) of the Act.  The state's obligation to provide an effective remedy before a national tribunal in the event of a violation of the Convention rights is part of the background against which the provisions of subsections (2) to (4) of section 22 were enacted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98. The relevant subsections of section 22 are in these terms:</p>
<p></p><ul>"(2) Sections 18, 20, 21(5) and this section come into force on the passing of this Act.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(3) The other provisions of this Act come into force on such day as the Secretary of State may by order appoint; and different days may be appointed for different purposes.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(4) Paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of section 7 applies to proceedings brought by or at the instigation of a public authority whenever the act in question took place; but otherwise that subsection does not apply to an act taking place before the coming into force of that subsection."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99. These provisions provide important guidance as to the application of the Act to events occurring or legislation passed prior to its coming into force.  As a general rule the approach which was taken by Parliament was to apply the Act prospectively as from the date when the relevant provisions were brought into force and not retrospectively.  The purpose of the government, as the White Paper which introduced the Bill explained, was to see "rights brought home": Rights Brought Home: The Human Rights Bill, Cm. 3782 (1997), para 1.19.   The provisions of sections 7 to 9 of the Act which deal with proceedings, judicial acts and judicial remedies were for the most part designed to apply to events occurring or legislation passed after the Act came into force.  In general it was as from the date of the coming into force of the 1998 Act that the rights were intended to be brought home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100. But this not the whole story, as can be seen from an examination of section 3 and section 22(4) of the Act.  Section 3(2)(a) provides that the interpretative obligation which section 3(1) lays down applies to primary and secondary legislation "whenever enacted".  Section 22(4) provides that section 7(1)(b) applies to proceedings brought by or at the instigation of a public authority "whenever the act in question took place".  It is these provisions which open the door to the appellant's first alternative argument on retrospectivity.</p>
(b) <i><p><i>the first argument - section 22(4)</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101. This argument depends upon section 22(4), and it was presented in two ways.  That subsection applies only to proceedings brought by or at the instigation of a public authority.  The appellant's first approach was to apply the subsection to the prosecuting authority.  The second was to apply it to the court as a public authority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102. Had the appellant's complaint been that the prosecutor had acted in a way which was inconsistent with his article 6(2) Convention right the statutory route would have been easy to follow.  The certified question refers to "an investigating or prosecuting authority", and there is a reference to the "prosecuting authority" in the relevant paragraph of the statement of facts and issues.  The Crown Prosecution Service, which was the prosecuting authority in this case, is a public authority within the meaning of sections 7 and 22(4) of the 1998 Act.  Prosecutions brought by the CPS are proceedings brought by a public authority within the meaning of section 22(4).  So section 7(1)(b) applies to proceedings brought by the CPS whenever the act in question - that is, the act on its part which is made unlawful by section 6(1) - took place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103. As for section 7(1)(b), it enables a person who claims that a public authority has acted in a way which is made unlawful by section 6(1) of the Act to rely on the Convention right or rights concerned in any legal proceedings.  The expression "legal proceedings" in this paragraph is defined in subsection (6) of section 7, which provides: </p>
<p></p><ul>"In subsection (1)(b) 'legal proceedings' includes -<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a) proceedings brought by or at the instigation of a public authority; and<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b) an appeal against the decision of a court or tribunal."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104. The effect of section 22(4) is to limit the extent to which section 7(1)(b) can be applied retrospectively.  It can be used retrospectively in proceedings brought <i>by</i> or at the instigation of public authorities - that is to say, to enable a person to rely on the Convention right or rights defensively.  This may be done at the stage of any appeal against the decision of any court.  So the retrospective use of section 7(1)(b) is permitted by section 22(4) at each stage of an appeal, including an appeal to your Lordships' House.  The appeal is treated by the Act as if it were part of the same legal proceedings as those brought by or at the instance of the public authority, irrespective of the person at whose instance the appeal is brought.  But it is plain that section 7(1)(b) may not be used with retrospective effect in proceedings brought <i>against</i> a public authority.   That is the effect of the concluding words of section 22(4).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105. This was the route for the giving of retrospective effect to a Convention right which I had in mind when I said in <i>Reg v Director of Public Prosecutions, ex parte Kebilene</i> [2000]  2 AC 326, 375D:</p>
<p></p><ul>"If the Act of 1998 were in force, the appropriate remedy would be to raise at the trial or on appeal under section 7 of that Act the question whether, in terms of section 6(1) of the Act, he was acting or had acted in a way which was incompatible with a Convention right.  That in turn would require section 16A [of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989] as amended to be construed, in terms of section 3(1) of the Act of 1998, so far as it was possible to do so in a way which was compatible with Convention rights.  But, as the legislation is not yet in force, we have not reached that stage."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106. Mr Starmer sought to rely on this passage in support of his argument. But in that case the court was being asked to review an exercise of the discretion of the Director of Public Prosecutions in giving his consent to the prosecution of the applicants under section 16A of the 1989 Act as amended.  There was no doubt that the court was dealing there with proceedings brought by or at the instigation of a public authority.  Nor was it in question that it was his act in consenting to the proceedings that had led to the alleged incompatibility with the applicants' Convention right.  The situation was the same in <i>Wallbank v The Parochial Church Council of Aston Cantlow and Wilmcote (Case No.: A3/2000/0644), 17 May 2001(CA).</i>  In that case it was conceded that the questions whether the Parochial Church Council was a public authority within the meaning of section 6 of the 1998 Act and, if so, whether its action in serving notice upon the defendants was unlawful by reason of article 1 of the First Protocol, read either alone or with article 14 of the Convention, were open to the defendants to raise although the impugned notice was served on 12 September 1994 - long before the 1998 Act was brought into force.  That too was a case where a potential victim was seeking to rely on an alleged breach of a Convention right in legal proceedings brought by a public authority within the meaning of section 22(4).  It was a case where a public authority, which was what the Parochial Church Council was held to be, was seeking to rely on acts of its own which were lawful under the domestic law at the time when they were done but were incompatible with the Convention right.</p>
