<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;57. Wade and Forsyth on Administrative Law 8th Ed at page 219 also state that the courts adopt a liberal approach:</p>
<p></p><ul>"A statutory power will be construed as impliedly authorising everything which can fairly be regarded as incidental or consequential to the power itself; and this doctrine is not applied narrowly."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then after referring to a number of authorities the authors say at page 220:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Statutory powers therefore have considerable latitude, and by reasonable construction the courts can soften the rigour of the ultra vires principle.  Although this book contains so many instances of that principle being infringed, it must be remembered that the courts intervene only where the thing done goes beyond what can fairly be treated as incidental or consequential."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;58. In my opinion the liberal approach stated in the authorities is applicable to the determination of the powers of the Commission as well as to the determination of the powers of local authorities and commercial companies, notwithstanding that the Commission was established pursuant to the Belfast Agreement.  A body such as the Commission, like any corporation created by statute, is bound to have incidental functions to perform and I do not consider that it is appropriate to hold that it has no powers other than those expressly conferred on it by statute:  as Lord Selborne stated in <i>Attorney-General v Great Eastern Railway Company</i> at p 478, if a corporation is not to have a power reasonably incidental to its express powers, the exercise of that power should be expressly prohibited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;59. When I turn to consider whether the power to intervene in an inquest can be implied as fairly incidental to what is expressly authorised by section 69 and when, in accordance with the authorities to which I have referred, that question is approached in a liberal and not in a narrow way, I am of opinion that the power is fairly incidental to the express powers given by the section.  Section 69(5)(a) empowers the Commission to give assistance to an individual who applies to it and who has commenced or wishes to commence proceedings involving law or practice relating to the protection of human rights, and section 69(5)(b) empowers the Commission itself to bring such proceedings.  On a strict construction it can be argued that as Parliament in section 69(5)(a) has only authorised the Commission to give assistance to a person who himself is bringing proceedings, Parliament did not intend that the Commission should itself intervene in proceedings.  Similarly it can be argued that as Parliament in section 69(5)(b) empowered the Commission itself to bring proceedings, Parliament did not intend that the Commission should intervene in proceedings which it had not commenced.  But I consider that a more liberal interpretation leads to the conclusion that where Parliament has expressly authorised the Commission to assist an individual to bring proceedings in respect of human rights and to bring proceedings itself, it is incidental to those powers for the Commission also to have the power to intervene in proceedings where a human rights issue arises and where the court permits it to intervene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60. I consider that this conclusion is supported by the provisions of section 69(6) which state that the Commission shall promote understanding and awareness of the importance of human rights in Northern Ireland.  Again it can be argued that the power relates to educating the public and public bodies as to the importance of human rights, particularly by research and educational activities, and that the power does not extend to making submissions to a court on a point of human rights law.  But on a more liberal approach, and bearing in mind that on occasions this House has permitted an interested body to intervene in proceedings to make submissions, as where Amnesty International was permitted to make submissions in <i>R v Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, Ex parte Pinochet Ugarte</i> [2000]  1 AC 61, I am of opinion that the making of legal submissions to a court can be regarded as incidental to the power of promoting understanding of human rights.  I do not express any opinion on the ambit of section 71(1) save to say that I do not consider that it operates to prevent the Commission intervening to make submissions in an inquest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;61. Therefore I would allow the appeal and would hold that the Commission had power to intervene in the proceedings of the inquest to make submissions on a human rights issue.  However I wish to emphasise that the only issue before the House is whether such an intervention is within the powers of the Commission, and I also desire to express my full agreement with the observations of my noble and learned friend Lord Slynn of Hadley in paragraph 25 of his speech that it is for the court to decide whether it will permit the Commission to intervene and that the Commission should exercise caution in deciding whether to apply to intervene in proceedings.</p>
<p><b>LORD HOBHOUSE OF WOODBOROUGH</b></p>
<p><b>My Lords,</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;62. This appeal from the Court of Appeal of Northern Ireland raises a question of the construction of s.69 in Part VII of the Northern Ireland Act 1998.  Sections 68 and 72 create a new statutory body to be known as the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission (the 'Commission') and s.69 states what are the functions of that body.  The question is whether the statutory functions include intervening in legal proceedings, specifically applying to intervene in inquests when a point has arisen in an inquest to which the European Convention on Human Rights (the 'Convention') as incorporated into the law of Northern Ireland is or may be relevant.  It is the opinion of Carswell LCJ and, in the Court of Appeal, of McCollum LJ and Sir John MacDermott that the statutory functions of the Commission do not include such intervention.  Kerr J dissenting preferred the contrary view.</p>
<i></i><p><i>The Approach to the Question of Construction</i>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;63. The primary guide to construction is to be found in the preamble of the Act.  It states that it is: </p>
<p></p><ul>     "&nbsp;&nbsp;An Act to make new provision for the government of Northern Ireland for the purpose of implementing the agreement reached at multi-party talks on Northern Ireland set out in Command Paper 3883" <p></p></ul>
<p>The agreement referred to is the multi party agreement generally known as the 'Belfast Agreement'.  It was a unique constitutional document of both national and international significance.  It represented an agreement between the governments of the United Kingdom and the Irish Republic as to the status of Northern Ireland and included, <i>inter alia</i>, provision for various institutions to be set up in the respective countries.  However, it also represented a political settlement within the respective countries themselves.  It had been negotiated with the participation of the recognised political parties and was commended to the people of the North and the South for their approval.  It was validated by referenda held in each country.  By the Belfast Agreement the parties, in a section headed "Rights, Safeguards and Equality of Opportunity", affirmed their commitment to human rights and the British Government undertook to complete the incorporation of the Convention into the law of Northern Ireland giving direct access to the courts and giving the courts the power to overrule legislation of the Northern Ireland Assembly on grounds of inconsistency (paragraph 2), providing for equal opportunities (paragraph 3) and the setting-up of a new Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission to consult and advise upon supplementing Convention rights in Westminster legislation (paragraph 4). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;64. Counsel for the Commission, rightly, drew your Lordships' attention to paragraphs 4 and 5 of this section of the Belfast Agreement as being relevant to the understanding of s.69 and what were to be the functions of the Northern Ireland Commission.</p>
<p></p><ul>"4.&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission (see paragraph 5 below) will be invited to consult and to advise on the scope for defining, in Westminster legislation, rights supplementary to those in the European Convention on Human Rights, to reflect the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland, drawing as appropriate on international instruments and experience.  These additional rights to reflect the principles of mutual respect for the identity and ethos of both communities and parity of esteem, and - taken together with the ECHR - to constitute a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland. Among the issues for consideration by the Commission will be:<p></p></ul>
* the formulation of a general obligation on government and public bodies fully to respect, on the basis of equality of treatment, the identity and ethos of both communities in Northern Ireland; and
* a clear formulation of the rights not to be discriminated against and to equality of opportunity in both the public and private sectors.
<p>New Institutions in Northern Ireland</p>
5. <p>New Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, with membership from Northern Ireland reflecting the community balance, will be established by Westminster legislation, independent of Government, with an extended and enhanced role beyond that currently exercised by the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights, to include keeping under review the adequacy and effectiveness of laws and practices, making recommendations to Government as necessary; providing information and promoting awareness of human rights; considering draft legislation referred to them by the new Assembly; and, in appropriate cases, bringing court proceedings or providing assistance to individuals doing so."</p>
<p>The Irish Government was also to take comparable steps to strengthen the protection of human rights within its own jurisdiction, together with itself establishing a Human Rights Commission for the Republic in accordance with separate provisions contained in paragraph 9.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;65. These then are the provisions of the Belfast Agreement which are implemented by sections 68 and following of the Act.  Indeed it easily perceived that s.69 has been drafted using paragraph 5 as a blueprint.  This is the context in which the s.68 should be construed.  The Commission put at the forefront of its case the well known statement of Lord Selborne LC in the case of <i>Att-Gen v Great Eastern Rly </i>Co (1880)  5 App Cas 473 at 478 which concerned an Act of Parliament for the construction and operation of railways by railway companies, referring to what had been said in an earlier case, <i>Ashbury Rly Carriage and Iron Co v Riche</i> LR 7 HL 653, concerning the powers of an industrial company under its memorandum:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It appears to me to be important that the doctrine of <i>ultra vires,</i> as it was explained in that case, should be maintained.  But I agree with James LJ that this doctrine ought to be reasonably, and not unreasonably, understood and applied, and that whatever may fairly be regarded as incidental to, or consequential upon, those things which the legislature has authorised, ought not (unless expressly prohibited) to be held, by judicial construction, to be <i>ultra vires</i>."<p></p></ul>
<p>In the same case Lord Blackburn said (p.481):</p>
<p></p><ul>" ... those things which are incident to, and may be reasonably and properly be done under the main purpose, though they may not be literally within it, would not be prohibited."<p></p></ul>
<p>Thus, for commercial entities, a commercial approach should be adopted and reasonable implications made.  Similar approaches have been adopted in relation to Local Government and similar authorities.  But the Commission is neither a commercial enterprise nor a Local Authority.  It is a specially constituted body with defined powers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66. The authorities helpfully cited in the Opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Hutton show how far removed the context of that type of statute is from the context of the Northern Ireland Act 1998.  The Belfast Agreement was an intensely political act where, after very difficult negotiations and a referendum campaign, agreement was finally obtained for a document which then fell to be given effect to in an Act of Parliament.  Matters which might easily be thought to be reasonable for inclusion in the Belfast Agreement may well not have been included for some political reason not apparent subsequently to lawyers who have not been privy to what occurred.  The question whether a Human Rights body should be empowered to intervene in litigation otherwise than on behalf of a legitimate party to that litigation could be an activity with considerable political significance so long as sectarian divisions persist.  It must have been a political judgment how proactive and interventionist a Commission would be acceptable to the people of Ulster as a whole.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;67. The Commission's argument in your Lordships' House was unable to derive any support from the terms of the Belfast Agreement nor from the actual wording of paragraph 5.  Section 69 clearly follows the scheme of paragraph 5 and is intended to reproduce it.  There is a reference in both paragraph 5 and section 69(5) to legal proceedings but it was specifically accepted by counsel appearing on the appeal for the Commission that it could not gain assistance from these provisions as they were not wide enough (even on its own approach) to give the Commission the powers it claims in the present case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;68. There is a further point.  A primary function of the Commission is stated in s.69(1) and (2) to be to review and make recommendations before two years have elapsed for improving its effectiveness and the adequacy and effectiveness of the functions conferred on it in Part VII of the Act.  It is thus contemplated that the functions may have been drawn more narrowly than the Commission thinks is appropriate and it requires the Commission to address that problem by making recommendations to the Secretary of State.  This recognises that enhancements of the Commission's powers beyond those expressly granted will raise political considerations to be assessed by the Executive not the Judiciary.  In declining to be drawn into the extension of the powers of the Commission, I consider that the Lord Chief Justice and the majority of the Court of Appeal correctly understood the intent of the Belfast Agreement and the implementing legislation and their place in the constitutional framework of the Province.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;69. The argument of the Commission as presented to your Lordships (supported by the Secretary of State as an intervener) was put in three ways.  The first was to submit that there was an over-arching purpose to be found in s.69 which was to give the Commission whatever powers were appropriate for a Human Rights Commission and the various subsections were merely examples of such powers.  But this is not how section 69 is drafted nor, for that matter, is paragraph 5 drafted in that way either.  They are lists of specific functions.  The nearest that s.69 comes to a general purpose is in subsection (1).  But this provision for keeping under review the adequacy and effectiveness of the law and practice of Northern Ireland is preliminary to the exercise of its functions under (2), (3), (7) and (9) and cannot be said to justify claiming a power to intervene in judicial proceedings.  This was the second way in which the Commission put its argument, relying on the words "keep under review".  But this argument fails because, as I have said, these words do not imply a power to intervene in judicial proceedings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70. The third way of putting its argument was that upon which the Commission mainly relied.  This was that the duty to "promote understanding and awareness of the importance of human rights": subsection (6).  The corresponding words in the Belfast Agreement are "providing information and promoting awareness of human rights".  If this was intended to imply a power to intervene in judicial proceedings it is an odd way to do it.  The obvious import is public education and this is exemplified by the two examples given - "research" and "educational activities": this is how it expressly visualises that the purpose described will be carried out.  The context of subsection (6) is further demonstrated by its juxtaposition with the preceding subsection, subsection (5) (cross-linking with sections 70 and 71).  As counsel specifically accepted, subsection (5) is drawn in specifically limited terms which preclude construing subsection (5) as authorising the claimed power to intervene.  When a section includes a specific subsection dealing with and limiting the Commission's power to involve itself in litigation, it is not consonant with the ordinary canons of statutory construction to construe another subsection which does not expressly do so as removing the limitations in the specific provision.  But in any event, where incidental powers are concerned, they should only be implied where they are reasonably implicit in the performance of the primary express function.  Engaging in litigation cannot be said to be implicit in or necessary for the subsection (6) function of promoting understanding and awareness.  Subsection (6) already contains its own addition of incidental powers.  Where the draftsman of the Act has wished to include incidental powers he has done so expressly, as he has done in subsections (8) and (9).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;71. Therefore I would not construe s.69, even divorced from its context, as conferring the power claimed.  When one adds the legislative context of the Act as being legislation to give effect to the Belfast Agreement, I consider that the correctness of the answer given by the courts in Northern Ireland is clear.  If the Commission desires powers greater than those expressly given by s.69 it should recommend to the Secretary of State that it be given them and the Secretary of State can make the necessary political decision and take steps to implement it.  It would appear that the Secretary of State already believes that the Commission should have the claimed power; if so it is for him to initiate the appropriate legislative steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72. There was a subsidiary point which I should mention.  It was suggested that the Commission should have the power claimed so that it could act as an <i>amicus curiae</i>.  This argument was misconceived for a number of reasons.  First, there already exist powers to appoint <i>amici</i> and they are constitutionally to be exercised by the Attorney-General.  Secondly, the Commission does not see its role as being impartially to assist the court which is the role of an <i>amicus</i>.  The Commission has avowedly the object of arguing strenuously for its view of human rights and their protection.  This is no criticism of the Commission but it is not the role of an <i>amicus</i>.  In some circumstances a court can request an advocate to assist it by representing an unrepresented party.  But that is not the present case and the provision of assistance to unrepresented or inadequately represented parties or acting for victims of human rights infringements is already expressly dealt with in s.69(5), s.70 and s.71.  (It should be noted, <i>pace</i> what my noble and learned friend Lord Slynn has said in paragraph 23 of his Opinion, that in sections 70 and 71 the "person" referred to is not the Commission but the person whom the Commission is assisting or acting for.)  So this submission by the Commission did not assist its case on the appeal.  Similarly, reference to the fact that your Lordships are, as the supreme court of this country, willing on occasions exceptionally to entertain written or oral submissions from persons or entities not parties to the relevant appeal again does not assist because what is in question in the present case is not the powers of the court but the powers of the Commission.  As regards the powers of the Court and their exercise, I would join my noble and learned friends in what they have said in that connection in paragraphs 25 and 61. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73. Accordingly I would dismiss this appeal.</p>
