<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66.	Two points emerge from an examination of the wording of these subsections.  The first is that the original offence and the alternative offences of which the person may be found guilty in the circumstances referred to are regarded as being in law different offences: see the words "of any offence not included above" in subsection (2) and "that other offence" in subsection (3).  The second is that these provisions only apply where the trial is on indictment.  Section 6 does not apply to proceedings in the magistrates' court.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;67.	As to the first point, the alternative offences mentioned in section 6(2) and (3) are not treated by the statute, either expressly or by implication, as forming part of the same offence as that which has been specifically charged in the indictment.  This approach reflects a concept which is followed consistently throughout the entire scheme relating to committal proceedings and custody time limits in the magistrates' courts.  In terms of section 1(1) of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 the justice may issue a summons requiring a person to appear before the magistrates' court to answer to an information that he has, or is suspected of having, committed "an offence".  The function of the magistrates' court, as described in sections 4 to 6 of that Act, is to inquire into "an offence as examining justices": see section 5(1) and section 6(1) and (2).  If a magistrates' court is satisfied that there is sufficient evidence to put the accused on trial by jury "for any indictable offence", the court must commit him for trial: section 6(1).  The implication is that it will take that step with regard to "the offence under inquiry": see the concluding words of the subsection.  Alternatively the court may commit him for trial "for the offence" if it is satisfied that all the evidence before the court consists of written statements tendered under the 1980 Act without consideration of their contents.  Regulation 2(2)(c) of the 1987 Regulations defines a reference to a person's first appearance in relation to proceedings in a magistrates' court for an offence as being a reference to the time when he first appears or is brought before the court "on an information charging him with that offence."  Regulation 4(5)(a) refers, where a court proceeds "to inquire into an information as examining justices", to the time when it begins to hear evidence for the prosecution "at the inquiry".</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;68.	Thus the scope of the inquiry is determined by the information which has been laid before the magistrates' court.  The guiding principle is that the offence should be described in the information clearly and definitely, without duplicity or uncertainty: Stone's Justices' Manual 2000, I-420.  The court's function is to inquire into the offence charged in the information as examining justices.  I do not think that there is any ambiguity about what is meant in regulation 4(4) by the word "offence" in these circumstances.  It means the offence with which the person is charged in the information which has been laid against him in that court.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;69.	It is normal and proper practice for the prosecution to review the charge or charges in the information which was initially laid before the court as further inquiries are conducted into the state of the evidence.  This may lead to the bringing against the accused of what are undoubtedly fresh charges, with the consequence that these new charges will attract their own custody time limit.  But the question may be raised, as it has been in this case, as to whether the new charges truly are fresh charges or whether they are simply the old charges in a revised form and are thus subject to the original custody time limit.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70.	In <i>R v Burton on Trent Justices, Ex p Ashleigh-Nicholson</i> [1998]  COD 262, 17 December 1997 the applicant was charged with a number of offences of dishonesty.  When he was charged with three further offences of dishonesty he was refused bail.  A draft indictment was prepared which contained a number of new counts.  The prosecutor applied to the magistrates' court for the new counts to be put to the applicant, for the old charges to be discharged and for the applicant to be remanded in custody.  He also asked the court to note that, since there were new charges, there were correspondingly new custody time limits.  The applicant applied for judicial review on the ground that the so-called new charges were simply the old charges with amendments which amounted to changes of detail only.  The Divisional Court remitted this matter to the magistrates to consider.  Lord Bingham of Cornhill CJ said:</p>

<p></p><ul>"The legislative intention underlying the introduction of custody time limits is clear.  It would defeat that purpose if relatively minor or unimportant amendments to charges were to enable the authorities to remand a defendant in custody for extended periods.  On the other hand, if there is a substantial difference between one charge and another then it may indeed be just that that result should follow.  But whether the difference between one charge and another is substantial must in my judgment depend, as I say, on more than a superficial comparison of the wording and may in a case of any doubt involve some consideration of underlying materials."<p></p></ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;71.	But the question whether the difference between one charge and another is substantial would seem to be capable of only one answer if they involve two offences which are in law distinct or separate offences.  As Lord Widgery CJ said in <i>Jemmison v Priddle</i> [1972]  1 QB 489, it is legitimate to charge in a single charge one activity even though that activity may involve more than one act.  Questions as to whether, if a person stabs another person several times or steals several different chattels from several different rooms in the same dwelling house, he has committed one offence or several are best answered by applying common sense and deciding what is fair in the circumstances: <i>R v Fyffe, Edwards, Woodford, Holloran and Callan </i>[1992]  Crim LR 442, <i>per </i>Russell LJ.  But the general rule is that not more than one offence may be charged in one charge or, where the offence is charged in an indictment, in one count: Indictments Act 1915, Schedule 1, rule 4.  The purpose of sections 6(2) and 6(3) of the Criminal Law Act 1967 is to enable alternative verdicts to be returned by juries under certain circumstances in the Crown Court.  In the magistrates' court, to which section 6 of the 1967 Act does not apply, no relaxation is permitted against the rule against duplicity.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72.	As to the second point, it is not part of the function of the magistrates' court in the case of an information charging an offence triable on indictment to consider whether a jury would be entitled to find the person guilty of another offence in the event of its finding him not guilty of the offence which has been specifically charged against him.  The court's sole function is to examine the question whether there is sufficient evidence to put the accused on trial for the offence charged in the information.  Furthermore the concern of the justices in these proceedings is essentially with questions of fact rather than with questions of law.  The operation of the custody time limits is linked to the same process.  Regulation 4(4) is designed to fit in with that procedure.  The maximum period of 70 days begins to run when the accused first appears or is brought before the court "on an information charging him with that offence": regulation 2(2)(c).  It ends, where the court proceeds to inquire into the information as examining justices, when it begins to hear evidence for the prosecution at the inquiry: regulation 4(5)(a).  If the words "an offence triable on indictment" in regulation 4(4) were to be read as extending to the alternative offences of which the accused might be convicted after trial on indictment, this would introduce questions of law into the custody time limit regime which would greatly complicate the justices' function as examining magistrates.  I would regard this as introducing an amendment to the regime which, if it is to be made, ought to be left to the legislature.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73.	For these reasons I would hold that there is no basis, if the ordinary canons of construction are to be applied, for reading in these additional words into regulation 4(4).  In my opinion each offence which is the subject of an information which is laid before a magistrates' court attracts its own custody time limit.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74.	There remains the question whether this interpretation produces an absurd result which cannot have been intended by Parliament.  I see the force of the objection to the introduction of a new custody time limit, in a case which does not involve any new facts, simply because the prosecution has decided after some weeks to depart from the more serious charge of murder and substitute for it the less serious charge of manslaughter.  But I would be reluctant to hold, on the basis of this example, that Parliament must have intended <i>in every case </i>that, for the purposes of the custody time limits laid down in regulation 4, the offence charged is to be regarded as including also a charge of a lesser offence of which the person could, by virtue of section 6 of the Criminal Law Act 1967, be found guilty.  The regulation cannot mean one thing in one case and something else in another.  We cannot pick and choose according to the facts of each case.  It seems to me that, unless your Lordships can be confident that an absurd result will be produced in <i>all</i> cases, the proper conclusion is that the regulation must be applied according to the ordinary meaning of the words used by Parliament.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75.	Subsection (2) of section 6 of the 1967 Act deals with the alternative offences which are available to the jury on an indictment for murder.  It is sufficient for present purposes to consider the alternative offence of manslaughter.  One of the features of this offence is that, for a verdict of manslaughter to be returned instead of murder, the jury normally needs to be in possession of facts which are additional to those which are needed to prove murder.  Provocation reduces murder to manslaughter, but a jury is not entitled to consider this matter unless there is some evidence of a specific act or words of provocation resulting in loss of self-control by the accused: <i>R v Acott </i> [1997]  1 WLR 306.  This may involve the consideration of further information which was not, for the purposes of the murder charge, before the justices.  Then there is the case of persons suffering from diminished responsibility.  Section 2 of the Homicide Act 1957 provides that a person who is suffering from diminished responsibility who would be liable, but for that section, to be convicted of murder is liable instead to be convicted of manslaughter.  The prosecutor does not normally have to lead evidence as to the accused's mental state on a murder charge.  This is because the presumption of mental capacity is normally sufficient to prove that he acted consciously and voluntarily: <i>Bratty v Attorney General for Northern Ireland </i>[1963]  AC 386, 407, <i>per</i> Viscount Kilmuir LC.  But a prosecutor who, after further investigation, decides to reduce a charge of murder to one of manslaughter on the ground of diminished responsibility may have to undertake the additional burden of leading evidence as to the accused's mental state.  This may give rise to the need to bring further information before the justices, as the issue may then be raised as to whether the accused lacked the necessary intention because he was truly suffering not from diminished responsibility but from insanity.  I do not think that it would be right in cases of that kind to regard the murder charge and the manslaughter charge as based on the same facts.  They relate, of course, to the same incident of homicide.  But there are additional facts in the one case which are not present in the other, and it is those additional facts which justify the reduced charge.  I would not, speaking for myself, regard it as absurd that where manslaughter is substituted for murder in such a case by the prosecutor there should, for the purposes of regulation 4(4), be a new custody time limit.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76.	Then there is the fact that section 6 of the 1967 Act refers to a variety of other offences of which the accused may be found guilty by a jury: see subsection (2) in regard to an indictment for murder and subsection (3) in regard to an indictment for any offence except treason or murder.  In neither case however is a precise list given of these alternatives.  They are to be determined either by reference to other legislation (see subsection (2)), or by reference to what is included either expressly or by implication "in the indictment" (see subsection (3)).  The problem here, as I see it, is that these provisions are not apt for consideration at the stage of committal proceedings in the magistrates' court.  There is no indictment at that stage, and there are at least some grounds for thinking that the justices ought not to have to consider the questions of law which may be raised by consideration of the available alternatives.  Here again I would not, speaking for myself, regard it as absurd to suppose that Parliament did not intend to bring these alternative offences into consideration in that court for custody time limit purposes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77.	For these reasons I am not persuaded that the ordinary meaning of the words used in regulation 4(4) should be departed from and that there should be read into it a reference to the alternative offences of which the person could be found guilty by virtue of section 6 of the Criminal Law Act 1967 after trial in the Crown Court.</p>

<i><p><i></i></p>

<p><i>Compatibility with article 5</i></p>

</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78.	The next question is whether, in the light of the meaning which I would give to the word "offence" in regulation 4(4) according to its ordinary construction, there is an incompatibility with article 5 of the Convention which ought to be removed by applying to the regulation the approach to construction which the court is directed to take by section 3(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79.	Section 3(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998 provides that, so far as it is possible to do so, primary legislation and subordinate legislation must be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with Convention rights.  This means that, if according to its ordinary construction regulation 4(4) is incompatible with any of the Convention rights, a possible meaning for regulation 4(4) must be found that will prevent the need for a declaration of incompatibility.  But one must first be satisfied that the ordinary construction of the regulation gives rise to an incompatibility.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80.	Article 5 of the Convention, so far as relevant to this case, provides:</p>

<p></p><ul>"1 Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person.  No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:<p></p></ul>

…

(c) <p></p><ul>the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so;<p></p></ul>

…

<p></p><ul>3 Everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this article shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial.  Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial."<p></p></ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81.	Mr MacDonald submitted that the central purpose of article 5 was to protect the individual from a detention which was arbitrary.  In <i>Bozano v France </i>(1986)  9 EHRR 297, para 54 the European Court said:</p>

<p></p><ul>"The main issue to be determined is whether the disputed detention was 'lawful,' including whether it was in accordance with 'a procedure prescribed by law'.  The Convention here refers essentially to national law and establishes the need to apply its rules, but it also requires that any measure depriving the individual of his liberty must be compatible with the purpose of article 5, namely to protect the individual from arbitrariness."<p></p></ul>

<p>In <i>Brogan v United </i>Kingdom (1988)  11 EHRR 117, para 58 the Court said again that the fundamental right enshrined by article 5 was the protection of the individual against arbitrary interferences by the State with his right to liberty.  To the same effect was the following passage in the Court's judgment in <i>Amuur v France</i> (1996)  22 EHRR 533, para 50:</p>

<p></p><ul>"Where the 'lawfulness' of detention is in issue, including the question whether 'a procedure prescribed by law' has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law, but it requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of article 5, namely to protect the individual from arbitrariness." <p></p></ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82.	In the light of these authorities Mr MacDonald submitted that it was not enough that the provisions of the 1987 Regulations relating to a person's detention while he was in the custody of the magistrates' court were precise and accessible.  They had also to be so framed as to protect him against decisions which were arbitrary.  The Regulations were defective in this respect because they left it open to the prosecution, during the running of the period of 70 days referred to in regulation 4(4), to subject the accused to a fresh period of 70 days simply by charging him with a different offence based on the same facts as those in the original information.  The custody time limit could be extended several times over by this means. Unless an abuse of process could be established, decisions to that effect by the prosecutor were not subjected to any judicial control.  To the extent to which the system which the regulations laid down was open to decisions by the prosecutor which were arbitrary, it was incompatible with article 5 of the Convention.</p>

<i><p><i></i></p>

<p><i>The Scheme of Article 5</i></p>

</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83.	Article 5.1 guarantees liberty and security of person.  In this context the concepts of liberty and security are linked together, with the broad aim of protecting the person against an arrest or detention which is arbitrary: <i>Bozano v France</i>, para 54; <i>Amuur v France</i>, para 50.  As the European Court said in <i>W v Switzerland</i> (1993)  17 EHRR 60, para 30, continued detention can be justified in a given case only if there are specific indications of a genuine requirement of public interest which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighs the rule of respect for individual liberty.  To this end article 5.1 provides a right to liberty, which is subject to six specified exceptions and to two overriding requirements.  The first requirement is that any deprivation of liberty must be in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law.  The second requirement is that it must be lawful.  To be lawful in this context, the detention must not only be lawful under domestic law.  It must satisfy the requirements of the Convention that the domestic law on which the decision is based must be sufficiently accessible to the individual and must be sufficiently precise to enable the individual to foresee the consequences of the restriction: see <i>R v Governor of Brockhill Prison, Ex p Evans (No 2)</i> [2000]  3 WLR 843, 857H - 858C.  It is the latter of these two overriding requirements that is in issue in this case.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84.	Paragraphs 2 to 5 of article 5 provide a set of distinct procedural rights for persons who have been arrested or are being detained.  We are concerned in this case with paragraph 3, which comprises three distinct rights.  These are (1) the right to be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power; (2) the right to be released on bail, except where continued detention can be justified; and (3) the right to be tried within a reasonable period.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85.	Two points in particular require to be noted about article 5.3 in the present context.  The first is that the right to be released on bail is not absolute.  But if bail is to be refused, the refusal must be justified on the facts of each case to the satisfaction of the judge or other officer.  The second is that the purpose of the right to be tried within a reasonable period in article 5.3 is to ensure that no one spends too long in detention before trial.  In <i>Wemhoff v Germany</i> (1968)  1 EHRR 55, para 5 the European Court said that the concern of article 5.3 was to minimise the period of provisional detention of the accused rather than to avoid prolongation of the trial.  In this regard it may be regarded as laying down a more exacting requirement than the article 6.1 right to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time.  In <i>Yagci and Sargin v Turkey</i> (1995) 20 EHRR 505, para 50 the Court said: </p>

<p></p><ul>"It falls in the first place to the national judicial authorities to ensure that, in a given case, the detention of an accused person pending trial does not exceed a reasonable time.  To this end they must examine all the facts arguing for or against the existence of a genuine requirement of public interest justifying, with due regard to the principle of presumption of innocence, a departure from the rule of respect for individual liberty and set them out in their decisions on the applications for release."<p></p></ul>

<i><p><i>Is Regulation 4(4) Incompatible?</i></p>

</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86.	The question whether the system which regulation 4 of the 1987 Regulations lays down for limiting the periods during which a person can be detained while in the custody of the magistrates' court is open to the criticism that it is arbitrary contrary to the right to liberty in article 5.1, or is incompatible with the article 5.3 right to trial within a reasonable time, must be examined in the context in which the regulation is intended to operate.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87.	The primary means for controlling the detention of a person while he is in the custody of the magistrates' court are to be found in the provisions of the Bail Act 1976.  The function of the 1987 Regulations made under section 22 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 is to set maximum custody time limits.  If a custody time limit expires before the completion of the stage of the proceedings in question, the accused must be granted bail.  It is also open to the justices to grant bail at any time before the expiry of the time limit, bearing in mind that section 4(1) of the Bail Act 1976 gives a general right to bail except in certain specified circumstances: see Schedule 1 to that Act.  Furthermore the accused, if remanded in custody, must be brought again before the magistrates' court to enable his case to be reviewed at regular intervals, as the general rule is that a magistrates' court may not remand a person for a period exceeding 8 clear days: Magistrates' Courts Act 1980, section 128(6).  His detention is thus subject to judicial control in the magistrates' court throughout the period while he is in the custody of that court.  Decisions which are taken in magistrates' courts are amenable to judicial review.  And if a magistrates' courts decides to extend, or further extend, a custody time limit the accused may appeal against that decision to the Crown Court: Prosecution of Offences Act 1985, section 22(7).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88.	The effect of these provisions can, I think, be summarised in this way.  A person can only be detained in the custody of a magistrates' court while awaiting the completion of a preliminary stage of the proceedings under a procedure which has been laid down by statute, and the effect of regulation 4 of the 1987 Regulations is that any such detention is subject to strictly defined custody time limits.  As to the complaint that this procedure is not precise or accessible because of the possibility of the substitution of fresh custody time limits, I would reject it.  The provisions of the Bail Act 1976 and of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980, as amended, deal with the procedure for remands in custody in considerable detail with a view to ensuring that every situation is provided for.  It is a procedure which is prescribed by law.  Detention under this procedure is lawful under domestic law, and it complies with the general requirements of the Convention.  If a fresh custody time limit is to be substituted, the procedure under which this is to be done is laid down by statute and the regulation defines the length of the substituted time limit.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89.	The complaint that the procedure is open to abuse as a result of decisions by the prosecutor which are arbitrary and may result in the person's detention for a time that is more than can be described as reasonable is, at first sight, a more substantial one.  It is the case, as I have said, that regulation 4(4) has the effect that each offence which is charged in the magistrates' court attracts its own custody time limit.  This aspect of the regulation has a legitimate purpose, which is to give sufficient time to the prosecutor to prepare the evidence relating to each offence for examination by the justices.  Like any other procedure prescribed by law, it is vulnerable to abuse if it is used for improper purposes.  But this is a matter which is subject to judicial control by the justices or the stipendiary magistrate.  On the one hand it is open to the court, applying the approach which was indicated by Lord Bingham CJ in <i>R v Burton on Trent Justices, Ex p Ashleigh-Nicholson</i> [1998]  COD 262, to hold that the new charge is simply a reproduction of the old charge with amendments which are minor or unimportant, and on this ground to refuse to accept that the new charge has given rise to a fresh custody time limit.  On the other it is open to the court to refuse to inquire into the information relating to the new charge on the ground that to do so would be an abuse of the process of the court.  That would not prevent the same charge being brought again in the Crown Court if the justices were to decide to commit the accused to the Crown Court for trial on the information relating to charges which are already before them.  But it would prevent the substitution of a new custody time limit while the case remains in the magistrates' court.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90.	Against that background I would hold that the fact that regulation 4(4) of the 1987 Regulations, construed according to the ordinary canons of construction in the manner which I favour, enables the accused to be subjected to a fresh time limit when a new offence is alleged against him does not give rise to an incompatibility either with article 5.1 or with article 5.3.  I see no need therefore in this case to resort to the new rule of construction laid down by section 3(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998.</p>

<i><p><i>Abuse of Process</i></p>

</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91.	The question to which I now turn is the meaning to be given to the concept of abuse of process in the context of a complaint that the Crown has acted in the magistrates' court in a manner which conflicts with the purpose for which the custody time limit has been laid down in regulation 4(4) of the 1987 Regulations.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92.	In my opinion the essence of abuse of process in the context of criminal proceedings is that the prosecutor has sought to take advantage of a procedural rule for a purpose which can be described as improper or as arbitrary.  Difficulty has arisen because it has been suggested in some of the authorities that a complaint of abuse of process has to contain an allegation of bad faith.  Before I discuss this issue I must first refer to the relevant authorities.</p>
