<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;71.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rabinder Singh QC (for the respondent) also made some powerful general submissions in response to the argument that if the respondent's right was a public law right, the most appropriate remedy must be a public law remedy.  He cited the well-known observations of Lord Wilberforce in <i>Davy v Spelthorne Borough Council</i> [1984]  AC 262, 276, as to the need for caution in importing the expressions "private law" and "public law" into English law, which typically fastens, not on principles, but on remedies (I would also respectfully note the valuable observations of my noble and learned friends Lord Hope of Craighead and Lord Rodger of Earlsferry in <i>Davidson v Scottish Ministers</i> [2005]  UKHL 74, paras 41-42 and 73-77).  As Mr Rabinder Singh points out, there is something strange about giving the label "private law tort" to misfeasance in public office, a tort which (by definition) can be committed only by a public official acting as such.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is one of the special features of the tort.  Another is that it is an intentional tort, and moreover one which can be established only by proof of bad faith.  As a matter of principle an intentional tort, and especially one necessarily involving bad faith, may differ from other torts in the need for proof of actual damage (see the observations of Lord Hoffmann in <i>Wainwright v Home Office</i> [2004]  2 AC 406, 425-426, paras 42-46, not resiling from what he said in <i>Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd</i> [1997]  AC 655, 707) as it does in relation to causation (see <i>Smith New Court Securities Ltd v Scrimgeour Vickers (Asset Management) Ltd</i> [1997]  AC 254, 279-280).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are nevertheless formidable objections (set out more fully in your Lordships' speeches) to the proposition that the tort of misfeasance in public office should be actionable without proof of special damage, whether the proposition is put in that wide form, or is limited to cases where the misfeasance takes the form of targeted malice which breaches the claimant's constitutional rights.  I will list very briefly the main objections to the narrow proposition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the point at issue seems never to have risen for decision either in England or elsewhere in common law jurisdictions, the great weight of authority treats damage as an element of the tort, and (apart from the decision now under appeal) there is no definite authority the other way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Some cases of "targeted" malice are very clear, such as the early Canadian case of <i>Roncarelli v Duplessis</i> [1959]  SCR 121 (discussed by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Odhavji Estate v Woodhouse</i> [2003]  SCC 69, para 19).  But the weight of authority is against treating targeted malice as being in a special category, rather than as being at the brightest end of a spectrum (see <i>Odhavji </i>at para 22 and the decision of this House in <i>Three Rivers District Council v Governor and Company of the Bank of England</i> [2003] 2 AC 1 at pp191-192 (Lord Steyn), 219-223 (Lord Hutton), 230-231 (Lord Hobhouse) and 235 (Lord Millett, who expressed most strongly the view that there is a single tort of intention).  A rule that the targeted malice limb (only) of the tort is actionable without proof of special damage would therefore be unprincipled and difficult to apply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;The same objection applies to the notion that the scope of the tort could be kept within sensible boundaries by making it actionable <i>per se</i> only if there is a breach of a constitutional right enjoyed by the claimant.  In <i>R v Secretary of State for the Home Department Ex p Leech</i> [1994] QB 198, 210, Steyn LJ said of a prisoner's right to confidentiality for correspondence with his solicitors, </p>
<p></p><ul>"Even in our unwritten constitution it must rank as a constitutional right."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But so long as we have no written constitution, any syllabus of the citizen's constitutional rights (or, equally, of the citizen's "core" constitutional rights) is bound to be controversial.  Mr Sales suggested that the notion of core constitutional rights has a part to play in the development of the law, but only in the field of the interpretation of primary legislation (as in <i>R v Secretary of State for the Home Department Ex p Simms</i> [2002]  2 AC 115, 130 (Lord Steyn), 131 (Lord Hoffmann) or in the review of secondary legislation (as in <i>Leech</i>); in that area he said, the Court can take a nuanced approach.  I see a lot of force in that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Human Rights Act 1998 is now in force and (if the facts of the case occurred again) a prisoner would have a clear claim under sections 6, 7 and 8 of the Act by reference to both Article 6 and Article 8 of the Convention (the Article 8 claim appears to me to be the stronger).  Despite <i>Greenfield</i>, the developing domestic jurisprudence under the Act may lead to modest (but more than nominal) awards of damages in cases of deliberate official wrongdoing, even if it does not occasion monetary loss.</p>
<i>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not include among what I see as powerful objections either the historical origins of the tort, or fear of a flood of what Mr Sales called gold-digging claims.  Historically the tort of libel developed, as misfeasance in public office did, from the action on the case.  But both have come a long way since then.  If (as is still the case after <i>Rantzen v Mirror Group Newspapers (1968) Ltd</i> [1994]  QB 670) a claimant can recover general damages of over £100,000 for a single libel without proof of any monetary loss whatsoever, ancient legal history cannot be a good reason why misfeasance in public office should not develop in the same direction.</p>
<i>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor am I impressed by predictions of a flood of unmeritorious claims.  It is not easy to bring a claim of this sort.  Experienced judges (and the civil juries whom they sometimes have to direct in such cases) know that the police and prison officers have a difficult job to do, often in the face of provocation, and that they are not infallible.  Awards of general or aggravated damages take these matters into account, and are rarely extravagant.  Extravagant awards can be and are reduced on appeal.  But deliberate abuse of public office directed at an individual citizen calls for an effective sanction enforceable as of right by that citizen.  Exemplary damages, even if anomalous, have a part to play in discouraging abuses of power in a democratic society: <i>Kuddus v Chief Constable of Leicestershire Constabulary</i> [2002] 2 AC 122. </p>
<i>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless the four main difficulties outlined above, which are much more fully developed in the speeches of your Lordships, lead me, with some reluctance, to the conclusion that this appeal must be allowed.<i> </i></p>
<p><b>LORD CARSWELL</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the advantage of reading in draft the opinions prepared by my noble and learned friends, Lord Bingham of Cornhill and Lord Rodger of Earlsferry.  I am in full agreement with their reasons and conclusions and wish to add only a few observations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78.&nbsp;&nbsp;The distinction between actions in tort in which it is not necessary to prove special or material damage in order to succeed (torts actionable <i>per se</i>) and those in which such proof is an essential<i> </i>ingredient of the claimant's case stems from the ancient dichotomy between actions in trespass and actions on the case.  The discussion of the development of the two forms of action contained in Maitland, <i>The Forms of Action at Common Law, </i>Lecture VI shows how that development may be regarded as no more than accidental and the distinction is described in <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i>, 19th ed (2006), para 1.46 as being of limited relevance; for a useful synopsis see also <i>Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts</i>, 5th ed (1984), pp 28-31.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79.&nbsp;&nbsp;In actions on the case, the category into which the tort of misfeasance in public office falls, "damage is the gist of the action" (<i>Salmond &amp; Heuston on Torts</i>, 21st ed, (1996) p 6) and the claimant will fail if he cannot prove it.  For the reasons set out by Lord Bingham, I agree that the authorities establish that that tort is properly classed among those in which proof of material damage is required.  I also agree with his opinion that the conclusion reached by the Court of Appeal, that where the tortious act amounts to a breach of the claimant's constitutional rights it is actionable <i>per se</i>, cannot be supported.  In my opinion it would not be a readily workable expedient and it has insufficient authority to support it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80.&nbsp;&nbsp;One might question, more generally, whether the law should continue to support a distinction between those actions in which proof of material damage is needed and those in which there is no such requirement.  It might not unreasonably be said that any civil wrong should carry damages and that those who deliberately flout the law and deprive others of their rights by abusing their position should be liable to the victims of such acts.  The common law is capable of accommodating changes necessary to allow it to adapt to modern needs, as your Lordships recognised in the recent torture case <i>A v Secretary of State for the Home Department (No 2) </i>[2005] UKHL 71; [2005] 3  WLR 1249.  It might therefore be theoretically possible to abolish the distinction and hold that all torts are actionable without proof of material damage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not satisfied, however, that it would be advisable for the House to take such a course, were it minded to do so.  The underlying dichotomy between trespass and case would still remain, even if it became of even less relevance than now.  It would be a departure from the prevailing trend in other common law jurisdictions and would be out of harmony with the Scots law governing damages in actions for delict.  There are other avenues for a claimant in a case of the present type who cannot establish any material damage, even if they may not afford a perfect remedy in all cases.  Finally, it would be likely to open the door to claims for exemplary damages in a broader class of cases than those in which they may now be awarded.  Notwithstanding the fact that the House has ruled in <i>Kuddus v Chief Constable of Leicestershire </i>[2001] UKHL 29; [2002] 2 AC 122 that exemplary damages may in principle be awarded in cases of misfeasance in public office, I should myself prefer to confine the award of such damages very closely indeed.</p>
