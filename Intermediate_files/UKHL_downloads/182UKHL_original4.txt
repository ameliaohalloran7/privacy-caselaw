<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have explained, acknowledgments may well leave issues of quantum outstanding and negotiations designed to resolve these to my mind <i>should</i> qualify for without prejudice protection.  In these cases the policy underlying the without prejudice rule seems to me to outweigh the countervailing policy reason for lengthening the period in which the creditor must issue proceedings.  There are, after all, sound policy reasons for having limitation periods in the first place: disputes, if eventually they need to be litigated, should be litigated before they become too stale. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76.&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, therefore, some acknowledgments will indeed attract   without privilege protection.  But these will be cases where the extent of the liability is genuinely in dispute and the parties are attempting to settle that difference.  Had Mr Rashid, for example, in fact been seeking to question the sufficiency of the sum obtained from the mortgagee's sale of the property and had the correspondence been devoted to resolving that particular issue, without prejudice protection might well have applied.  But that simply was not the case.  The correspondence treated the debt as an undisputed liability and dealt only with whether, when and to what extent Mr Rashid could meet that liability.  The question before your Lordships is whether in those circumstances the without prejudice rule should be extended at the expense of the statutory provision for acknowledgments.  For the reasons given I would hold not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would accordingly allow Bradford &amp; Bingley's appeal, set aside the orders of the Court of Appeal and Judge Hawkesworth, and restore the order of the deputy district judge giving judgment for Bradford &amp; Bingley in the sum of £22,127.86.</p>
<p><b>LORD MANCE</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the advantage of reading in draft the speeches prepared by my noble and learned friends Lord Hoffmann, Lord Hope of Craighead and Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first issue is whether either or both of the Advice Centre's letters of 26th September and 4th October 2001, if admissible in evidence, constituted an acknowledgement of the appellant bank's claim for the purposes of sections 29(5) and 30 of the Limitation Act 1980. On this issue, I agree with Lord Brown's reasoning and conclusions in paragraphs 53-60. The letters acknowledged the existence of "the outstanding balance, owed to you" or "the outstanding amount". The appellant bank is entitled to prove the unstated quantum of that admitted balance or amount by any admissible means, including oral evidence, in accordance with the Court of Appeal's decision in <i>Dungate v. Dungate </i>[1965] 1 WLR 1477. By the first letter, written in response to the appellant bank's insistence on proposals for repayment, Mr Rashid was simply requesting time to "start to repay" the outstanding balance. By the second letter, written in response to the bank's reiteration of its insistence and its indication that it would consider writing off a substantial sum if Mr Rashid raised a lump sum payment "in full and final settlement", Mr Rashid was simply offering "approximately £500 towards the outstanding amount as a final settlement". In each case, he was clearly acknowledging the outstanding debt without question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue thus arises whether these letters are, as His Honour Judge Hawkesworth and the Court of Appeal have held, inadmissible as having been written impliedly without prejudice. I agree that there is a short answer to this issue. The letters were not without prejudice, because they were not written in the context of any dispute regarding the debt, or of any attempt to compromise any such dispute. Indeed, the agreed statement of facts before the House admits that there has never been any dispute about the quantum of the debt or the appellant bank's entitlement to a judgment in respect of it (apart from the dispute about limitation which was not and could not have been in existence at the date of either letter in 2001, or indeed until after 3 January 2003, twelve years from the date of Mr Rashid's last payment).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81.&nbsp;&nbsp;The existence of a dispute and of an attempt to compromise it are at the heart of the rule whereby evidence may be excluded (or disclosure of material precluded) as "without prejudice". This is clear from the passage which Lord Brown has in paragraph 62 cited in full from Lord Griffiths' speech in <i>Rush &amp; Tompkins Ltd. v. Greater London Council </i>[1989] AC 1280 at page 1299D, commencing:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The 'without prejudice' rule is a rule governing the admissibility of evidence and is founded upon the public policy of encouraging litigants to settle their differences rather than litigate them to a finish".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to disclosure, Lord Griffiths concluded at page 1305D-E that:</p>
<p></p><ul>"….. the general public policy that applies to protect genuine negotiations from being admissible in evidence should also be extended to protect those negotiations from being discoverable to third parties."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rule does not of course depend upon disputants already being engaged in litigation. But there must as a matter of law be a real dispute capable of settlement in the sense of compromise (rather than in the sense of simple payment or satisfaction).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, in <i>Turner v. Railton</i> (1796) 2 Esp. 474, evidence was admitted that the defendant's former attorney had admitted the debt claimed and made an offer on the defendant's behalf to pay a certain sum on account, and Lord Kenyon said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Concessions made for the purpose of settling the business for which the action is brought, cannot be given in evidence; but facts admitted I have always received."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, in <i>Thomson v. Austen</i> (1823) LJ KB (OS) 99, where evidence of an admitted cross-debt was in part excluded, the court is reported as saying:</p>
<p></p><ul>"We also think that the evidence which was refused was not indicative of any intention to make a compromise, for if it had been so, he would have offered some concession, some sacrifice for the sake of peace; but he simply wishes the matter ended, and then makes an unqualified admission".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A similar though not identical passage is attributed to Bayley J in another report at (1823) 2 Dowl. &amp; Ry. 358.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, the respondent, Mr Rashid, was not offering any concession. On the contrary, he was <i>seeking</i> one in respect of an undisputed debt. Neither an offer of payment nor actual payment of a smaller sum in purported discharge of a larger admitted indebtedness has the effect in law of discharging that indebtedness: cf <i>Foakes v. Beer </i>(1884) 9 App. Cas. 605; <i>D &amp; C Builders Ltd. v. Rees</i> [1966] 2 QB 617 (authorities which we were not in any way asked to reconsider). But, even if Mr Rashid had been offering a lesser sum on a basis which could, if accepted, have precluded the appellant bank from pursuing the admitted larger debt (as might have been the case under Scots law, which has no doctrine of consideration, or which might have been the case under English law, if Mr Rashid had been offering a composition to all his creditors), there would have still have been no relevant dispute about his indebtedness, and the "without prejudice" rule would still have had no application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is sufficient to allow this appeal. But I wish to say a few words on the situation where (unlike in this case) words such as "without prejudice" are expressly used. If they are used in the context of an attempt to compromise a dispute, then the "without prejudice" rule, which I have already described, applies. Indeed, in an article of great learning and continuing value, '<i>Without Prejudice' Communications - their admissibility and effect </i>(1974) U.B.C. Law Review 85 (on which Robert Walker LJ also drew in <i>Unilever plc v. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company</i> [2000] 1 WLR 2436), Mr David Vaver (now Reuters Professor of Intellectual Property Law at Oxford) concludes at page 90 that the express use of the term "without prejudice" was developed by the legal profession by about 1830 as a result of the distinction drawn by previous court decisions (to two of which I have referred) between admissions of liability and offers of compromise. Even where there is a dispute, not every offer of compromise is necessarily intended to be without prejudice, and the express use of the phrase not only puts the matter beyond doubt in a situation where there is an offer to compromise an existing dispute, but is also capable of throwing some light on the answer to the objective question whether such a situation existed. But its use is by no means conclusive. Neither a dispute nor a concession or offer to compromise can be conjured out of mere words.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Vaver submits at page 134, and I agree with him, that the "without prejudice" rule of admissibility should be "strictly confined" to "the area of its legitimate utility ….. in the facilitation of disputes". In that area, concerning admissibility in court or disclosure, the court is, as Lord Griffiths stated in <i>Rush &amp; Tompkins</i>, giving effect to a rule of public policy. But there are, as Mr Vaver recognises, other contexts in which the phrase "without prejudice" may be deployed by one or more parties, in a way which can have some effect on their legal relations (rather than on admissibility or disclosure). When Mr Guppy in Dickens' Bleak House (chapter IX) insisted after the event that his unsuccessful move "to file a declaration - to make an offer" of marriage to Miss Esther Summerson had been "without prejudice", he was not suggesting that the offer had been made to compromise some dispute between them, merely that he did not want to be embarrassed by later reference to it, and Miss Summerson was fully entitled therefore to qualify her response: "I will never mention it," said she, "unless you should give me future occasion to do so."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86.&nbsp;&nbsp;The use and potential significance of the phrase "without prejudice" in contexts where there is no dispute or attempt to compromise is considered in Mr Vaver's article at pages 132 and 164-169. At page 132, he identifies two relevant questions, the one what effect (if any) may have been intended, the other whether the court ought to give effect to that intention. At pages 164-169, he points out that the intention is likely to have been to deprive a communication or act of all or a particular legal consequence which it would otherwise have or to reserve or preserve a course of action which might otherwise be prejudiced. He cites as examples <i>Oliver v. Nautilus Steam Shipping Co. Ltd. </i>[1903] 2 KB 639 and <i>Unsworth v. Elder Dempster Lines Ltd. </i>[1940 1 KB 658, and, in the context of limitation, <i>Cory v. Bretton </i>(1830) 4 Car. &amp; P. 462; 172 ER 783, where the provision in a letter that it was "not to be used in prejudice of my rights …." was read as meaning that an apparent acknowledgement of indebtedness in the same letter was "clearly a conditional statement," as well as <i>In re River Steamer Company</i> (1871) LR 6 Ch.App. 822, 831-2, where the phrase "without prejudice" meant that the debtor could not be regarded as having entered into the new contract - an acknowledgement being at the date of these last two cases only capable of restarting the limitation period if read as implying a fresh promise to meet the old debt. In any such case, it is a matter of construction and substantive law (rather than admissibility or privilege) whether effect will be given to the intention. But, as Mr Vaver points out, the phrase may also be used unthinkingly or superfluously, in which case it falls simply to be ignored: cf also <i>Nicholson v. Southern Star Fire Insurance Co. Ltd. </i>(1927) 28 SR (NSW) 124, <i>re Brisbane City Council and White </i>(1981) 50 LGRA 225, where the phrase was "futile" in the context of an originating process, and the <i>Unilever </i>case, where Robert Walker LJ at page 2448A referred to "the uncontroversial point that 'without prejudice' is not a label which can be used indiscriminately so as to immunise an act from its normal legal consequences, where there is no genuine dispute or negotiation". In his Treatise on the Anglo-American System of Evidence (2nd Ed. 1923) paragraph 1061, Wigmore echoed Dickens in noting the confusion resulting from the unthinking use of the phrase as a "shibboleth", and the Law Reform Committee made the same point with judicious understatement in its sixteenth report on <i>Privilege in Civil Proceedings</i> (Cmnd. 3472: December 1967) paragraph 23.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of this analysis, it is wrong to assimilate the express use or effect of the phrase "without prejudice" in a context where there is no dispute or attempt to compromise a dispute with the significance of the "without prejudice" rule which applies, or of the "privilege" which exists, where there is an attempt to compromise a dispute. I am unable therefore to agree with my noble and learned friend Lord Brown's statement in paragraph 63 that "generally speaking" communications marked "without prejudice" will "attract the privilege even without the public policy justification of encouraging parties to negotiate and settle their disputes out of court".  It is not open to a party or parties to extend at will the reach of the "without prejudice" rule or of the "privilege" it affords as regards admissibility or disclosure. Nor is this conclusion in any way affected if one takes the view (which Hoffmann LJ, as my noble and learned friend then was, did in <i>Muller v. Linsley and Mortimer </i>[1996] 1 PNLR 74, at pages 77D and 79G) that convention, rather than a questionable view of public policy, was the basis of the prohibition which (unless otherwise stipulated: cf <i>Cutts v. Head </i>[1984]  Ch. 290) precludes the use of without prejudice communications on questions of costs. Indeed, Hoffmann LJ at page 79F identified the conventional position regarding costs as "the only case" where the use of without prejudice communications otherwise than as admissions was precluded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88.&nbsp;&nbsp;Had there been a dispute and an attempt at its compromise, the further issue would have arisen whether the use of Mr Rashid's acknowledgment of his indebtedness to satisfy sections 29(5) and 30 of the Limitation Act 1980 fell within one of the qualifications or exceptions to the "without prejudice" rule, variously addressed by Mr Vaver at pages 143-164, by Lord Griffiths in <i>Rush &amp; Tompkins </i>at page 1300B-1301D, by Hoffmann LJ in <i>Muller</i> at page 79D-G and by Robert Walker LJ (as my noble and learned friend then was) in <i>Unilever </i>at pages 2444D-2446D.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89.&nbsp;&nbsp;Two possibilities may be suggested. One, the broader, is that an unequivocal admission made during without prejudice communications regarding the possible compromise of a dispute may be isolated from the remainder of the communications and so used against the party making it, whether on the issue of liability or to restart the limitation period. This appears to be the view taken at first instance in Scotland: cf <i>Watson-Towers v. McPhail </i>1986 SLT 617 and <i>Daks Simpson Group plc v. Kuiper </i>1994 SLT 689 (use as admissions on liability of statements in the course of without prejudice communications which were, in the first case, "not … a hypothetical admission or concession for the purpose of securing a settlement but … a statement of fact" and, in the second case, not "offers, suggestions, concessions or whatever" but "a clear and unequivocal admission or statement of fact"); and cf <i>Richardson v. Quercus Limited</i> 1999 SC 278 (adoption of the same approach to restart the running of limitation).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90.&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Lord Brown that English law has viewed the matter in different terms. Lord Griffiths in <i>Rush &amp; Tompkins </i>put the position as follows:</p>
<p></p><ul>"There is also authority for the proposition that the admission of an 'independent fact' in no way connected with the merits of the cause is admissible even if made in the course of negotiations for a settlement. Thus an admission that a document was in the handwriting of one of the parties was received in evidence in <i>Waldridge v. Kennison </i>(1794) 1 Esp. 142. I regard this as an exceptional case and it should not be allowed to whittle down the protection given to the parties to speak freely about all issues in the litigation both factual and legal when seeking compromise and, for the purpose of establishing a basis of compromise, admitting certain facts. If the compromise fails the admission of the facts made for the purpose of the compromise should not be held against the maker of the admission and should therefore not be received in evidence."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Unilever</i> at pages 2448H-2449B, Robert Walker LJ said that the authorities showed that the protection of admissions was "the most important practical effect" of the without prejudice rule, and that</p>
<p></p><ul>"… to dissect out identifiable admissions and withhold protection from the rest of without prejudice communications (except for a special reason) would not only create huge practical difficulties but would be contrary to the underlying objective of giving protection to the parties, in the words of Lord Griffiths in the <i>Rush &amp; Tompkins </i>case [1989] AC 1280, 1300: 'to speak freely about all issues in the litigation both factual and legal when seeking compromise and, for the purpose of establishing a basis of compromise, admitting certain facts.' Parties cannot speak freely at a without prejudice meeting if they must constantly monitor every sentence, with lawyers or patent agents sitting at their shoulders as minders".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92.&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, therefore, I see the first-instance Scots authorities as taking an approach differing from the English appellate approach. A limited review suggests that other Commonwealth jurisdictions also adopt an approach which is generally similar to the English, rather than the Scots: see e.g. (a) as regards Canada, <i>Evidence in Canada </i>(Sopinka, Lederman and Bryant) (2nd Ed. 1999 paragraph 14.204 and Supplement 2004, paragraph 14.204.1, explaining that the theory "that all admissions in the course of negotiations towards settlement are protected by a privilege based on public policy" is "now universally accepted in Canada", following the British Columbia Court of Appeal decision in <i>Middlekamp v. Fraser Valley Real Estate Board</i> (1992) 96 DLR (4th) 227 (although one can find earlier authority adopting Wigmore's different theory in <i>Kirschbaum v. "Our Voices" Publishing Co. </i>[1971] 1OR 737, to which Lord Sutherland referred in <i>Daks Simpson Group plc v. Kuiper)</i>; (b) as regards Australia, <i>Cross on Evidence (Australian Edition) </i>(J. D. Heydon) (2004) paragraphs 25350 and 25375, where the exception is explained as limited to statements of fact that have "no reference at all to the dispute" or are not "reasonably incidental to [the] negotiations"; and <i>Law of Privilege </i>(McNicol) (1992) pages 477-478, submitting that "future courts should be careful not to restrict without prejudice privilege too much" under this test, and concurring with Lord Griffiths' comments concerning <i>Waldridge v. Kennison</i>;  and (c) as regards South Africa, <i>The South African Law of Evidence </i>(formerly Hoffmann and Zeffertt, now Zeffertt, Paizes and Skeen) page 617, where the exception is said to be even more narrowly limited to "admissions that are quite unconnected with or irrelevant to the settlement". In <i>Kapeller v. Rondalia Versekeringskorporasie van Suid-Afrika Bpk </i>1964 (4) SA 722 (T) (mainly reported in Afrikaans, but summarised in Zeffertt, Paizes and Skeen at page 617), Viljoen R was able to distinguish a clear admission by a motor insurer as to liability in respect of a motor accident from the without prejudice negotiations which followed on that basis regarding quantum, and so to treat the admission as restarting the limitation period. I can understand that line of reasoning. But the Scots cases appear on their facts to me to go considerably further.<i> </i>However, I think it preferable to say no more about the scope of any exception, until a case arises where it falls squarely for determination on the facts.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93.&nbsp;&nbsp;The other, more limited half-way possibility, supported by my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann, invokes and seeks to build on his observations in <i>Muller v. Linsley and Mortimer </i>at pages 79F-80A to the effect that (with the one possible conventional qualification relating to costs, to which I have referred) the rationale of the without prejudice rule is directed solely to circumstances where a statement made without prejudice is proposed to be used as an admission in relation to the subject-matter of dispute. The possibility involves distinguishing between the use of Mr Rashid's admission as an acknowledgment to avoid any limitation problem and its use as an admission to prove liability on the merits at trial. In <i>Belanger v. Gilbert</i> [1984] 6 W.W.R. 474, 476, (British Columbia Court of Appeal) (cited in <i>Evidence in Canada </i>at paragraph 14.226), one of the three members of the court, Lambert JA, supported this distinction, saying:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In my opinion it is possible for a letter to be considered as a "without prejudice" letter and inadmissible in evidence in relation to its contents about the flow of settlement negotiations either on liability or quantum, but at the same time for the same letter to be admissible in evidence for the exclusive purpose of s.5 of the Limitation Act. It is not necessary to decide that question on the facts of this case, and I explicitly do not do so."<p></p></ul>
<p>In support of this distinction, the argument is no doubt that a debtor who makes an unqualified admission in the course of without prejudice negotiations for the compromise of a dispute is, in effect, encouraging the creditor not to commence proceedings, so that, while it would be wrong to treat the admission as prejudicing the debtor on the merits, it would be equally wrong to allow him to take the benefit of time gained in negotiations when it came to a limitation issue. On the other hand, an acknowledgment may, in this country, be made before or after the date when the limitation period would otherwise expire (a date which may itself also be open to argument in some cases), and it may be said that the public policy in allowing parties to negotiate freely would be undermined if, during any negotiations, they had to keep an eye open for the possible impact on limitation of any admissions they were without prejudice prepared to make. The argument that a creditor may in such a context be encouraged not to commence proceedings may also be said to have a certain circularity, on the basis that a creditor engaging in without prejudice negotiations should always keep an eye on the limitation position for the very reason that the negotiations are without prejudice. However, since the suggested distinction between the different effects (on the merits and on limitation) of one and the same admission were not explored in any detail before us, perhaps for good reason, I think it again best to say no more on the point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reasons I have given, I agree that this appeal should be allowed.</p>
