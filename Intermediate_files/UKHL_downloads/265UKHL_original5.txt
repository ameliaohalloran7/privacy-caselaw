<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord President's observation was, of course, made against the background of the view that he had already expressed at p 765A that there was a presumption that, where the appointment was made to a recognised form of ministry within the Church and where the duties of that ministry were essentially spiritual, there was no intention that the arrangements made with the minister would give rise to obligations enforceable in the civil law.  For the reasons already given, however, I do not share the view that there is such a presumption.  If anything, I would hold that, especially in the sex discrimination field where contracting out is not permitted, the presumption is the other way.  But I would rather not proceed on the basis that the issue can be solved by the application of a presumption which assumes that if the parties had thought about it at the time they were entering into their contract they would have dealt with the issue expressly in their contract.  As the Lord President said at p 769B, it is the interplay between the 1975 Act and the 1921 Act that lies at the heart of the question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122.&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the Equal Treatment Directive (Directive 76/207/EC) of 9 February 1976 which, although it was adopted after the 1975 Act, sets out the Community principle of equal treatment and the way it is to be put into effect in the Member States which the 1975 Act is taken as having implemented.  The 1975 Act is, as it was put in <i>Alabaster v Barclays Bank plc</i> [2005]  ICR 1246, 1259, para 36, Parliament's chosen vehicle for remedying unfairness in terms and conditions of employment on grounds of sex.  Article 1.1 of the Directive states:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The purpose of this Directive is to put into effect in the Member States the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, including promotion, and to vocational training and as regards working conditions and, on the conditions referred to in paragraph 2, social security.  This principle is hereinafter referred to as 'the principle of equal treatment'."<p></p></ul>
Article 5.1 provides:
<p></p><ul>"Application of the principle of equal treatment with regard to working conditions, including the conditions governing dismissal, means that men and women shall be guaranteed the same conditions without discrimination on grounds of sex."<p></p></ul>
<p>Article 6 provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Member States shall introduce into their national legal systems such measures as are necessary to enable all persons who consider themselves wronged by failure to apply to them the principle of equal treatment within the meaning of Articles 3, 4 and 5 to pursue their claims by judicial process after possible recourse to other competent authorities." <p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Report of the Committee on Commissions (Bills and Overtures) to the General Assembly of May 2002, in which the instruction of the General Assembly was sought to transmit the appellant's complaint of discrimination to a Special Commission to determine the issues raised by it, it was stated:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The Church being committed to gender equality and the protection of its ministers from discrimination on grounds of sex, the Special Commission should give due consideration to the principles contained in the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, whilst recognising that because of the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Church to legislate and adjudicate finally in all matters of doctrine, worship, government and discipline in the Church, the Act does not form part of the law of the Church."<p></p></ul>
<p>The Church's position could not have been more bluntly.  There is, as one would expect, an unequivocal commitment to the principle of equal treatment.  But there is an assertion that the 1975 Act does not form part of the law of the Church, as it claims exclusive jurisdiction in all matters of doctrine, worship, government and - as is especially important in this case - discipline.  It is not difficult to see the potential for conflict between this position and article 6 of the Directive which provides that the Member States shall introduce into their national legal systems such measures as are necessary to enable persons who consider themselves wronged by a failure to comply with the principle to pursue their claims by judicial process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;124.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Directive cannot, of course, be relied on directly against the respondents.  It does not have direct effect: <i>Marshall v Southampton and South-West Hampshire Area Health Authority Case 152/84</i> [1986] ICR 335, para 48.  But the court, when it is called upon to interpret national law, "is required to do so, as far as possible, in the light of the wording and the purpose of the directive in order to achieve the result pursued by the latter and thereby comply with the third paragraph of Article 98 of the Treaty [now Article 249 EC]": <i>Marleasing SA v La Comercial Internacional de Alimentación SA </i>(Case C-106/89) [1990] ECR I-4135, para 8.  The important and difficult question is whether section 3 of the 1921 Act together with article IV of the Declaratory Articles must now be read in accordance with the<i> Marleasing</i> principle as permitting an employment tribunal to exercise the jurisdiction that has been given to it by section 63(1) of the 1975 Act in the appellant's case.  The Lord President said at p 770F-G that he found it unnecessary to determine this question.  On my approach to this case there is no escape from it.  But it is first necessary, as Mr Napier QC who developed this part of the appellant's case recognised, to address the question whether the Equal Treatment Directive applies to the appellant's complaint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Napier submitted that the principle of equal treatment in terms of article 5 of the Equal Treatment Directive extended to the "working conditions" which are available to men and women generally, and that it was not restricted to any particular kind of contractual relationship.  The essence of his argument is to be found in Cox J's observation in <i>Fletcher v NHS Pensions Agency</i>, UKEAT/0424/04/RN, para 56 where she said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The Directive, like so many EU instruments, is broadly drafted and is to be broadly interpreted, having regard to its central purpose of ensuring equal treatment for men and women as regards their working conditions."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;126.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Lawrie-Blum v Land Baden-Wurttemberg</i> [1986] ECR 2121, the court said in para 15 that the criterion for the application of article 48 of the Treaty as to the free movement of persons (now article 39 EC) was the existence of an employment relationship.  In para 17 it said that the concept of "worker" for the purposes of that article must be defined in accordance with the objective criteria which distinguish the employment relationship by reference to the rights and duties of the persons concerned, and that the essential feature of an employment relationship was that for a certain period of time a person performs services for and under the direction of another person in return for which he receives remuneration.  The same approach to the meaning of this word in Community law has been taken in the context of equal pay cases under article 141(1) EC: see <i>Allonby v Accrington &amp; Rossendale College</i> (Case C-256/01) [2004] ECR I-00873, para 43.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;127.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Napier submitted that a broader approach was being taken in cases under the Equal Treatment Directive than had been done in the cases about equal pay.  I do not find it difficult to apply that definition of the expression "worker" for the purposes of equal pay to the appellant's case.  It is true that she was not being asked to work for or under the direction of the respondents.  She was being asked to work for and under the direction of the parish minister, her duties in this regard being essentially spiritual ones. But this was a requirement of her contract with the respondents in return for which she was entitled to receive from them her salary and other benefits.  I do accept Mr Napier's point however that the context of the Equal Treatment Directive a broad view is taken and that the issue is not resolved by making distinctions which are purely technical.  In <i>Coote v Granada Hospitality Ltd</i> (Case C-185/95) [1998] ECR I-5199 the protection of the Directive was extended to a refusal by an employer to provide references after the end of the employment relationship, on the ground that fear that discriminatory measures might be taken against them against which no legal remedy was available would be liable seriously to jeopardise implementation of the aim pursued by the Directive: para 24.  In <i>Wippel v Peek &amp; Cloppenburg GmbH &amp; Co KG</i> (Case C313/02) [2005] IRLR 211 the Court held that the Directive applied to a worker whose hours of working and the organisation of whose work were dependent upon the quantity of available work and were determined only on a case-by-case basis by agreement between the parties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;128.&nbsp;&nbsp;The most significant feature of the Equal Treatment Directive for present purposes, however, is the absence of any indication that it was the intention to exclude from its protection any class or category of worker by reference to the occupation or profession on which they were engaged.  Article 2.2 provides that the Directive is without prejudice to the right of Member States to exclude from its field of application those occupational activities and, where appropriate, the training leading thereto, for which, by reason of their nature or the context in which they are carried out, the sex of the worker constitutes a determining factor.  Section 19(2) of the 1975 Act provides an example of a situation in the case of religious bodies where it was appropriate to exclude the application of the Directive.  For the rest, the wording of the Directive indicates that the principle of equal treatment with regard to working conditions is of general application, to all men and to all women.  The court should not be astute to look for a qualification on this generality which the Directive itself does not provide for.  A derogation from article 2.4, for example, must be interpreted strictly: <i>Kalanke v Freie Hansestadt Bremen</i> (Case C-450/93) [1995]  ECR I-3051, para 21.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;129.&nbsp;&nbsp;Why then should a person who is employed to work as an associate minister be excluded from the scope of the Directive?  The position which she occupied can of course be said to be that of an ecclesiastical office-holder: <i>Scottish Insurance Commissioners v Church of Scotland</i>, 1914 SC 16, per Lord Kinnear at p 23-24;<i> In re National Insurance Act 1911</i> [1912] 2 Ch 563, 568, per Parker J.   But, as Slynn J said in <i>Hugh-Jones v St John's College, Cambridge</i> [1979]  ICR 848, 852H, an office holder can agree to execute work or labour.  It is not the fact that the appellant held an ecclesiastical office that is determinative for present purposes.  It is the fact that she undertook to perform services for another in return for remuneration that brings her within the description of a "worker", with the result that the conditions under which she agreed to do so were "working conditions", that brings her within the scope of the Directive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;130.&nbsp;&nbsp;Given then that she is within its scope, how are the 1975 Act and the 1921 Act to be reconciled?  It should be noted that, as Lord Keith of Kinkel pointed out in <i>Webb v EMO Air Cargo (UK) Ltd</i> [1993] ICR 175, 186, the <i>Marleasing </i>principle applies whether the domestic legislation came after or preceded the Directive: see <i>Marleasing SA v La Comercial Internacional de Alimentación SA</i> (Case C-106/89) [1990] ECR I-4135, para 8.  So the fact that the 1921 Act was enacted long before the adoption of the Equal Treatment Directive does not relieve the court from its obligation to construe that Act as far as possible in order to achieve the result pursued by the Directive.  It is worth noting too that the 1921 Act was enacted long before it was recognised that women had a fundamental right not to be discriminated against on grounds of sex.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;131.&nbsp;&nbsp;Great care must, of course, be taken to respect the Church's right to exclusive jurisdiction in all matters spiritual as defined in article IV of the Declaratory Articles.  The principle of subsidiarity which is enshrined in article 5 EC encourages respect for the constitutional and religious traditions of Member States.  Religious traditions are part of the cultural heritage of Europe, and it can be taken to be a principle of EC law that action to intrude upon those traditions will only be taken at Community level where the aims to be pursued cannot be achieved at the level of Member States.  The principle of equality which lies at the heart of the Equal Treatment Directive is of general application, however.  The only concession that it makes to the need to restrict its application is that stated in article 2.2, where the sex of the worker constitutes a determining factor in the occupational activity.  The Church of Scotland does not need to invoke that restriction, as the rule since 1968 has been that women are eligible to ordination on the same terms and conditions as are applicable to men.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;132.&nbsp;&nbsp;The critical words in article IV are those where it refers to "all matters of doctrine, worship, government and discipline in the Church" and to all questions concerning membership and office in the Church".  A claim of unlawful discrimination in the employment field has nothing to do with matters of doctrine, worship or government or with membership in the Church.  But it may have something to do with the way that discipline is exercised, and it may also have something to do with the way a person is deprived of an office in the Church.  As the Report of the Committee on Commissions (Bills and Overtures) to the General Assembly of May 2002 shows, the Church accepts the principle of equal treatment but claims exclusive jurisdiction to deal with the appellant's claim that she has been wronged by the respondent's failure to apply that principle to her.  I do not think that this claim goes far enough.  The solution that it offers falls short of what article 6 of the Directive requires - the introduction into the domestic system of such measures as are necessary to enable such persons to pursue their claims by judicial process after possible recourse to other competent authorities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;133.&nbsp;&nbsp;Article IV of the Declaratory Articles is sufficiently broadly worded for it to be possible, without prejudice in any way to its generality, to say on which side of the dividing line between matters civil and matters spiritual this case lies.  In my opinion the provision of a remedy for unlawful discrimination is a civil matter, not a spiritual one.  So the exercise of the exclusive jurisdiction of the Church in spiritual matters does not extend to a claim by persons "employed" by the respondents within the meaning of section 82(1) of the 1975 Act that they have been unlawfully discriminated against.  In such cases it is for the civil courts whose jurisdiction in civil matters is expressly preserved by section 3 of the 1921 Act, and to whom jurisdiction in these cases has been given by section 63(1) of the 1975 Act, to provide the appropriate remedy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;134.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would hold therefore that it is not open to the Church to claim exclusive jurisdiction under section 3 of the 1921 Act where it is alleged that a person whom the respondents have "employed" as an associate minister has been unlawfully discriminated against in regard to her conditions of working, including those governing her dismissal.  The appellant is entitled to the determination of her claim by an employment tribunal in the exercise of the jurisdiction that has been given to it by section 63(1) of the 1975 Act.</p>
<i><p><i>Article 234 EC</i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;135.&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Dunlop QC for the respondents said that the conclusion that the appellant was entitled to the protection of the Equal Treatment Directive would have wide ramifications and she sought a reference to the European Court of Justice under article 234 EC for a preliminary ruling on the question whether she was entitled to that protection.  But the fact that your Lordships' decision may have wide ramifications is not the test.  We have to consider whether there is a real issue which needs to be determined by that court, having regard to the guidance that it has already given on the application of the Directive.  I would hold that the matter at issue in this case is <i>acte claire</i> and that a reference would be inappropriate.</p>
<i><p><i></i></p>
<p><i>Conclusion</i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;136.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons I would hold that the employment tribunal has jurisdiction to determine the appellant's claim that she had been unlawfully discriminated against.  I would allow the appeal, recall the interlocutor of the First Division of the Court of Session and remit the appellant's discrimination claim for determination by an employment tribunal under section 63(1) of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD SCOTT OF FOSCOTE</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;137.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the advantage of reading in advance the opinions prepared by my noble and learned friends Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, Lord Hope of Craighead and Baroness Hale of Richmond and agree that, for the reasons they give this appeal should be allowed. I wish, in particular, to express my agreement that the agreement between the appellant and the Church of Scotland Board of National Mission, whereunder in return for salary, accommodation and other benefits the appellant undertook to perform the duties of an associate minister, was an agreement which created legal obligations between the parties. If the Board had withheld or reduced her salary the civil courts would surely have had jurisdiction to entertain an action for payment. If the reason for non-payment had been that she had declined to perform the duties of her office, the civil courts would have had jurisdiction to decide whether that circumstance justified the withholding of salary. The fact that her duties were duties of an office would have made no difference whatsoever (c/f <i>Miles v Wakefield Metropolitan District Council </i>[1987] AC 539). It seems to me clear that the agreement was one which created a legally binding relationship between the parties to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;138.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the appellant was a person who had been contractually employed by the Board to work as an associate minister I can see no reason why she, or others who have been similarly engaged, should be excluded from the scope of the Equal Treatment Directive or regarded as falling outside the statutory jurisdiction given to the employment tribunal (see section 63(1) of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975). The exclusive jurisdiction reserved to the Church of Scotland by Article IV of the Declaratory Articles applies to "matters of doctrine, worship, government and discipline in the Church". Notwithstanding that the appellant's complaints of unlawful discrimination arise out of the disciplinary proceedings instituted against her by the Presbytery of Angus they do not themselves constitute "matters of … discipline" so as to be within the Church's exclusive jurisdiction. If in their conduct of disciplinary proceedings the Church authorities have committed some form of unlawful discrimination, they cannot, in my opinion, rely on section 3 of the Church of Scotland Act 1921 as immunising them from the jurisdiction of the civil courts and tribunals to deal with such matters or from the remedies that the civil law makes available to the victim.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;139.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, for the reasons given by my noble and learned friends, allow this appeal and make the order Lord Hope has proposed.</p>
<p>BARONESS HALE OF RICHMOND</p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;140.&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree, for essentially the same reasons as those given by my noble and learned friend, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, that this appeal should be allowed. The principal question before us is whether the arrangements made between the appellant and the relevant authorities in the Church of Scotland constituted "employment" within the meaning of section 82(1) of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975:</p>
<p></p><ul>"'employment' means employment under a contract of service or of apprenticeship or a contract personally to execute any work or labour . . ."<p></p></ul>
<p>I am in no doubt that those arrangements do fall within that definition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;141.&nbsp;&nbsp;The familiar concepts of the common law are of limited help in construing modern employment legislation. As the learned authors of <i>Harvey on Industrial Relations and Employment Law</i> point out, at para A.1.2,</p>
<p></p><ul>"At common law the expressions 'employer' and 'employee' have no precise meaning in law apart from their context. The common law understands the expression 'master and servant' and 'employer and employee' is frequently used as a modern translation thereof. . . However, whereas 'master and servant' has a precise connotation, 'employee' may be - and often is - used in a sense wider than that of 'servant', and 'employer', than that of 'master'."<p></p></ul>
<p>Hence careful attention has to be paid to the definition section of the relevant statute, because these draw some quite deliberate distinctions. The definition of "employment" with which we are concerned is, of course, wider than that covered by a contract of service between master and servant, because it encompasses "any contract personally to execute any work or labour." So the authorities on what did or did not fall within the common law's understanding of a master-servant relationship will not give us much help. In Harvey, the view is taken, at para A.1.4, that "the distinction is between those who work for themselves and those who work for others, regardless of the nature of the contract under which they are employed."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;142.&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the common law's distinction between a servant and an office-holder is not of much help. Before the days of modern employment legislation, it was often in the interests of a person deprived of his occupation to assert that he was an office-holder rather than a servant. A servant could be dismissed at will, provided that the terms of his contract of service were observed. The same applied to some office-holders. But where there was a public element to the office, for example of constable, there was a long line of authority requiring that the office-holder be given a right to be heard before being deprived of his office: see <i>Ridge v Baldwin</i> [1964] AC 40, 65, per Lord Reid; <i>Malloch v Aberdeen Corporation</i> [1971] 1 WLR 1578, 1595, per Lord Wilberforce. But once the Industrial Relations Act 1971 introduced the right not to be unfairly dismissed, the question arose of when an office-holder might also be said to be employed for that purpose: see <i>102 Social Club and Institute Ltd v Bickerton</i> [1977] ICR 911, 918, EAT, per Phillips J. The EAT in that case set out a number of factors to be considered in deciding whether the secretary of a members' club might also be an employee. There are clear cases where, for example, a company director also has a written contract of service, but this may also be implied, for example where the director is required to work full time for the company in return for a salary: see <i>Trussed Steel Concrete Co Ltd v Green</i> [1946] Ch 115, Cohen J.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;143.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is powerful authority for the proposition that, even before the new sections 10A and 10B introduced by the Employment Equality (Sex Discrimination) Regulations 2005, SI 2005/2467, an office-holder might fall within the wider definition of "employment" for the purposes of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975. In <i>Perceval-Price v Department of Economic Development</i> [2000] IRLR 380. the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal was concerned with whether a full-time chairman of industrial tribunals, a full time chairman of social security appeal tribunals, and a social security commissioner were covered by the Equal Pay Act (Northern Ireland) 1970 or the Sex Discrimination (Northern Ireland) Order 1976. It was common ground, uncontroversial one might think, that they were statutory office-holders. Section 1(9) of the 1970 Act dealt with people in the public service who at common law were not regarded as employed under a contract of service:</p>
<p></p><ul>"This section shall apply to - <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;service for the purposes of a Minister of the Crown or government department, other than service of a person holding a statutory office, or<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;service on behalf of the Crown for purposes of a person holding a statutory office or purposes of a statutory body<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>as it applies to employment by a private person, and shall so apply as if references to a contract of employment included references to the terms of service."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The identical provision appears in section 1(8) of the Equal Pay Act 1970 and in section 85(2) of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 dealing with the application of that Act to the Crown.  Thus while civil servants were included, statutory office-holders were expressly excluded. However, the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal held that that express exclusion had to be disregarded, because it was inconsistent with the terms of the 1976 Equal Treatment Directive (Directive 76/207/EC). It was also common ground that the Directive had direct effect and that the Departments responsible were emanations of the State. Hence the women concerned had directly enforceable claims if the Directive had been infringed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;144.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no appeal to this House against that decision. There were two necessary ingredients in the decision which are directly relevant to the case before us. The first was that, without the express exclusion, these office-holders would have been covered by the definition of "employed" in section 1(7) of the 1970 Act:</p>
<p></p><ul>" … 'employed' means employed under a contract of service or apprenticeship or a contract personally to execute any work or labour."<p></p></ul>
<p>This, of course, is the equivalent of the definition of "employment" in the 1975 Act. Thus the Court regarded these judicial officer-holders as employed under a "contract personally to execute any work or labour".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;145.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second necessary ingredient was that these officers were "workers" and thus entitled to the same working conditions as men under Article 5 of the 1976 Directive. The Court applied the test in <i>Lawrie-Blum v Land Baden-Wurttemberg</i> [1986] ECR 2121, para 17:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The essential feature of an employment relationship, however, is that for a certain period of time a person performs services for and under the direction of another person in return for which he receives remuneration."<p></p></ul>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice, Sir Robert Carswell, giving the judgment of the Court, pointed out that the object of Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome and the Equal Pay and Equal Treatment Directives was to give protection against inequality and discrimination to those who might be vulnerable to exploitation. The concept of a worker should be construed purposively by reference to this objective. The Court went on:</p>
<p></p><ul>"All judges, at whatever level, share certain common characteristics. They all must enjoy independence of decision without direction from any source, which the respondents quite rightly defended as an essential part of their work. They all need some organisation of their sittings, whether it be prescribed by the president of the industrial tribunals or the Court Service, or more loosely arranged in collegiate fashion between the judges of a particular court. They are all expected to work during defined times and periods, whether they be rigidly laid down or managed by the judges themselves with a greater degree of flexibility. They are not free agents to work as and when they choose, as are self-employed persons. Their office accordingly partakes of some of the characteristics of employment . . . "<p></p></ul>
