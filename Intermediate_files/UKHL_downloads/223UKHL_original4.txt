<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80.&nbsp;&nbsp;But in this case all we know is that the appellant suspected that the money "was" the proceeds of crime.  The appellant must be dealt with according to the terms of his plea.  We cannot say that he was wilfully blind as to the purpose of the agreement, because that is not what he admits to.  He suspected that he was being asked to convert the proceeds of criminal conduct.  But he did not know that this was the origin of the money that was actually being given to him.  He was prepared to go ahead and convert the money without knowing that it was in fact the proceeds of crime.  It would not be quite right to say that he was reckless.  All he was to do was simply to convert money from one currency into another - an everyday transaction which involves no risk to anyone.  But he was willing to go ahead with this without troubling to find out whether or not what he was proposing to do was criminal.  A person who is in that state of mind cannot be said to intend that the fact or circumstance that makes his act criminal should exist.  That being the position I would hold that, although he was suspicious, the appellant cannot be said to have intended that the money should be the proceeds of crime when he came to deal with it.</p>

<i><p><i></i></p>

Conclusion

<p><i></i></p>

<p><i></i></p>

</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81.&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the terms of his plea, I see no escape from the conclusion that the appellant's case is caught by section 1(2) of the 1977 Act.  He cannot be said to be guilty of the conspiracy to commit the substantive offence under section 93C(2) because he did not know, and therefore did not intend, that the money which he agreed to convert would be the proceeds of crime when at some future date he came to perform his part of the agreement.  I would allow the appeal and set aside the conviction.</p>

<i><p><i>A postscript</i></p>

<p><i></i></p>

<p><i></i></p>

</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82.&nbsp;&nbsp;As Hooper LJ observed in <i>R v Liaquat Ali and others</i> [2005] EWCA Crim 87, para 151, the consequence of the approach to the meaning of section 1(2) of the 1977 Act which I favour is that the prosecution has a heavier burden to discharge in suspicion cases which are charged as a conspiracy than it would have to prove the substantive offence.  He made some suggestions, which I would respectfully endorse, as to how this problem might be addressed.  I think however that may be worth adding these further comments.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion the position that has now been reached compares unfavourably with the way in which the same course of criminal conduct would have been dealt with by the Crown in Scotland, to which section 93C(2) of the 1988 Act also extends: see section 79(3) of the Criminal Justice Act 1993.  Conspiracy is still a common law crime in Scotland.  But it is not the practice to resort to a conspiracy charge in cases where the substantive offence is a statutory one.  The reason is that the Crown does not need to do this in order to obtain a conviction for engaging in a continuing course of criminal conduct.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, of course, the law in Scotland too that a person cannot be punished more than once for the same offence.  And Lord Bingham of Cornhill CJ's statement in <i>R v Kidd</i> [1998]  1 WLR 604, 607B-C that a person cannot be lawfully punished for offences for which he has not been indicted and which he has denied or declined to admit and have not been proved against him is as true for Scotland as it is for England and Wales.  But it has always been open to the prosecutor in Scotland to allege by way of a single charge (or count, as it would be called in England) that the accused engaged in a continuing course of criminal conduct which involved the commission of a series of identical criminal acts.  This practice is resorted to in a wide variety of cases, including sexual offences against children and crimes of dishonesty such as fraud or embezzlement, where the acts tend to be repeated many times before they are detected.  It may be resorted to also in cases involving the statutory offences of money laundering.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85.&nbsp;&nbsp;If this had been done in <i>Liaquat Ali's</i> case, each act of money laundering within the period specified in the indictment would have been treated not as a separate offence but as part of the same continuing course of criminal conduct.  If the accused had been found guilty, a single sentence would have been imposed on him, not for each act of money laundering taken separately but for engaging in a course of criminal conduct that was made up of all of the acts that were proved against him.  In that way the objection that he was at risk of being charged in one count for two or more separate offences would have been avoided.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86.&nbsp;&nbsp;On 10 March 2006, for example, Zohaib Assad and Mohammad Ahmad were found guilty after trial in the High Court of Justiciary at Glasgow on three charges of money laundering, contrary to sections 327(1)(d) and (e), 329(1)(c) and 330(1) of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.  The charges of which they were convicted narrated that they had engaged in this conduct "between 23 February 2003 and 26 September 2003, both dates inclusive".  Their acts in possessing the money, transferring it overseas and failing to disclose what they were doing were treated as separate activities and hence as separate crimes.  In the first charge they were accused of non-disclosure, contrary to section 330(1).  In the second charge it was narrated that between these dates they had possession of "criminal property, namely qualities of cash amounting to £2,827,078.75 of money", contrary to section 329(1)(c).  In the third charge it was narrated that between these dates they transferred and removed from Scotland "criminal property, namely quantities of cash amounting to £2,256,646.00 of money" by paying the cash into a bank and transferring its value to Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates and China, contrary to section 327(1)(d) and (e).  The lesser amount in the third charge reflected the fact that not all of the money referred to in the second charge had been removed from Scotland.  The accused were convicted on each of these charges on the terms set out in the indictment, except that the amount in the second charge was amended at the close of the Crown case to £2,442,318.75. Assad was sentenced to three years imprisonment on the first charge, to seven years on the second and to seven years on the third. Ahmad was sentenced to two years imprisonment on the first charge, to six years on the second and to six years on the third. These sentences were all to be served concurrently.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87.&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand, of course, that the system of prosecuting crime in Scotland differs in many respects from that in England and Wales and that it is not possible simply to export isolated parts of that system from one jurisdiction to another.  The narrative form of charge that is used in Scotland is a significant difference.  It is competent at any time before the determination of the case, unless the court sees just cause to the contrary, for the prosecutor to amend the indictment by deletion, alteration or addition to cure any variation between it and the evidence: Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995, section 96(2).  This enables an accused who wishes to plead guilty to identify precisely, word by word, the parts of the narrative in any charge that he pleads guilty to and the parts that fall outside the scope of his plea.  The narrative can also be amended by the jury when it returns its verdict in the light of the evidence.  An attempt was made, following recommendations by the Law Commission (Law Com No 277), in section 17 of the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004 to devise a system which was suitable for use in England and Wales which would overcome the problem caused by the duplicity rule.  But strong opposition was expressed to that section as not being in the interests of justice, and it has not yet been brought into force.  A further study of how these matters are handled in Scotland might point the way forward.  In any event, something must be done soon if offences of the kind enacted by section 93C(2) of the 1988 Act which are now to be found in Part 7 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 are not to be impossible of prosecution, or at least more difficult to prosecute than the wording used to describe those offences contemplates, because of the duplicity rule.</p>

<p>BARONESS HALE OF RICHMOND</p>

<p>My Lords,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88.&nbsp;&nbsp;A and B agree that A will bring money into B's bureau de change and that B will change it into another currency. A knows that the money he intends to bring in is the proceeds of crime. B does not know this but he has thought about it. He suspects that the money will be the proceeds of crime and intends to exchange it even if this is so. Is either of them guilty of the crime of conspiracy?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 1 of the Criminal Law Act 1977 defines the statutory offence of conspiracy:</p>

<p></p><ul>"(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to the following provisions of this Part if this Act, of a person agrees with any other person or persons that a course of conduct shall be pursued which, if the agreement is carried out in accordance with their intentions, either - <p></p></ul>

<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;will necessarily amount to or involve the commission of any offence or offences <i>by one or more</i> of the parties to the agreement, or<p></p></ul>

<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;would do so but for the existence of facts which render the commission of the offence or any of the offences impossible,<p></p></ul>

<p></p><ul>he is guilty of conspiracy to commit the offence or offences in question.<p></p></ul>

<p></p><ul>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Where liability for any offence may be incurred without knowledge on the part of the person committing it of any particular fact or circumstance necessary for the commission of the offence, a person shall nevertheless not be guilty of conspiracy to commit that offence by virtue of subsection (1) above unless <i>he and at least one other party</i> to the agreement intend or know that that fact or circumstance shall or will exist at the time when the conduct constituting the offence is to take place." <p></p></ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90.&nbsp;&nbsp;This offence was created as a result of the Law Commission's recommendations in their Report, <i>Conspiracy and Criminal Law Reform, </i>1976, Law Com No 76. This was part of the Commission's programme of codification of the criminal law. The eventual aim was to abolish all the remaining common law offences and replace them, where appropriate, with offences precisely defined by statute. The common law offences were seen as unacceptably vague and open to development by the courts in ways which might offend the principle of certainty. There was an additional problem that it could be a criminal conspiracy at common law to engage in conduct which was not in itself a criminal offence: see Law Com No 76, para 1.7. This was a major mischief at which the 1977 Act was aimed, although it retained (as a temporary measure) the convenient concept of a common law conspiracy to defraud: see Law Com No 76, paras 1.9 and 1.16. Henceforward it would only be an offence to agree to engage in a course of conduct which was itself a criminal offence. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91.&nbsp;&nbsp;The substantive criminal offence in issue here is that which used to be contained in section 93C(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 (as amended by the Criminal Justice Act 1993 and now replaced by Part 7 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002):</p>

<p></p><ul>"A person is guilty of an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to suspect that any property is, or in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents, another person's proceeds of criminal conduct, he - <p></p></ul>

<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;conceals or disguises that property; or<p></p></ul>

<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;converts or transfers that property or removes it from the jurisdiction,<p></p></ul>

<p></p><ul>for the purpose of assisting any person to avoid prosecution for an offence to which this Part of this Act applies or the making or enforcement in his case of a confiscation order."  <p></p></ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92.&nbsp;&nbsp;Difficulties have arisen in the application of statutory conspiracy to this offence (among others). The tendency of courts and prosecutors has been to ask themselves, has the substantive offence been committed? If so, was it the result of an agreement or collaboration between two or more people? Did it happen more than once, over a period of time, with different combinations of perpetrators? If so, would it not be a great deal more convenient, and easier to explain to a jury, if we charge it as a single conspiracy rather than as a series of separate substantive offences?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet it is absolutely plain that the offence of conspiracy consists in the agreement, not its carrying out. The offence can be committed whether or not the plot is ever put into effect or the substantive offence committed. Thus it is <i>not</i> an essential ingredient of the crime of conspiracy to launder the proceeds of crime that the money in the conspirators' contemplation actually be such proceeds, whereas this is an essential ingredient of the substantive offence: see <i>R v Montila</i> [2004] 1 WLR 3141. This makes conspiracy a harsh and controversial crime. Equally, it is plain that the mere fact that the substantive offence has been committed does not necessarily mean that the individuals guilty of it are also guilty of conspiracy. Perhaps some of the difficulties have arisen because of an understandable tendency to conclude that if the substantive offence has been committed then those who were "in it together" must be guilty of conspiracy. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, in the example given above, it is clear that both A and B are guilty of the section 93C(2) offence. One transfers and one converts. One knows and one suspects (with reasonable cause) that it is the proceeds of crime. One has the prescribed purpose and the other must have it if, as he suspects, the money is the proceeds of crime. The money is, in fact, the proceeds of crime. It is scarcely surprising, therefore, that they pleaded guilty to the conspiracy and the court accepted their plea.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it does not follow that they <i>are</i> guilty of conspiracy. As conspiracy is a "thought crime", which may be committed without any overt acts other than those manifesting the agreement, the state of mind required for the conspiracy may be different from, and more exacting than, the state of mind required for the substantive offence. It all depends upon the application of section 1(1) and (2) of the 1977 Act to the facts.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this example, I believe that we are all agreed that the requirements of section 1(1) have been met. A and B agreed to engage in a course of conduct. That course of conduct, if carried out in accordance with their intentions, will necessarily involve the commission of the section 93C(2) offence by A. That is enough to meet section 1(1). B is a conspirator even if what is agreed upon will not involve him in the commission of any substantive offence. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97.&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that we are also agreed that, at this stage of the inquiry, their intentions may be conditional. There are many different kinds of conditional intent. There may be factual circumstances necessary to the carrying out of the purpose: we will blow up the Palace of Westminster if the King comes to open Parliament. Or there may be pre-conditions which the conspirators have set themselves: we will use our bombs if the IRA cease-fire ends. No substantive crime will be committed unless the condition materialises, but it is now generally accepted that they are guilty of a conspiracy to commit that crime. Or there may be provision for contingencies which could arise in a necessarily uncertain future: we will shoot if we have to in order to accomplish our purpose; or we will assist a suicide if we think it appropriate. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98.&nbsp;&nbsp;In all those examples, both parties are involved in the guilty intention. They need  not know that what they intend is a crime, but they know all they need to know in order to discover that it would be a crime were they to ask a lawyer about it. In our example, however, A knows everything but B only suspects. His intention is not to convert the money <i>only if</i> it is the proceeds of crime but to convert the money <i>even if</i> it is the proceeds of crime. He may be guilty of the substantive offence of converting the money without actually knowing the fact necessary for the commission of the offence, that the money is in fact the proceeds of crime. Thus section 1(2) applies to him. We do not need to consider Professor Elliott's 'scandalous paradox' (though we may share his views) "<i>Mens Rea</i> in Statutory Conspiracy, (1) A Comment" [1978] Crim LR 202, 205.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore B is not guilty of conspiracy unless both he and A "intend or know" that the money is the proceeds of crime. A knows that it is. B does not. But does he <i>intend</i> that it will be? Is a conditional intent of the "even if" kind sufficient for the purpose of section 1(2) as many think that it is for the purpose of section 1(1)?  My Lords, I cannot see why it should be sufficient for the one but not for the other. The main objection in both cases is that it could be seen as "a recklessness formula in disguise", a phrase taken from Professor David Ormerod's most helpful Current Legal Problems lecture, "Making Sense of <i>Mens Rea</i> in Statutory Conspiracies" (2006) CLP forthcoming, to which I am much indebted. Even the late Professor JC Smith seems to have regretted that the Law Commission, in their determination to exclude recklessness, might have "thrown out the baby, conditional intention, with the bathwater, recklessness" (see "<i>Mens Rea</i> in Statutory Conspiracy: Some Answers" [1978] Crim LR 210, at 212). My Lords, I do not think that they did.  The dividing line between them may be narrow, but it is discernible. Once again, it is important to distinguish between what happens when the substantive offence is committed - when the men have intercourse with the woman whether or not she consents - and what happens when they agree to do so. When they agree, they have thought about the possibility that she may not consent. They have agreed that they will go ahead <i>even if at the time when they go ahead they know that she is not consenting</i>. If so, that will not be recklessness; that will be intent to rape. Hence they are guilty of conspiracy to rape. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100.&nbsp;&nbsp;So if, in our example, the conspirator agrees to launder the money even if at the time he does so he is told that it is in fact the proceeds of crime, then he does indeed intend that fact to be the case when he does the deed. The fact that he is equally happy to convert the money even if it is not the proceeds of crime makes no difference. So perhaps the real question for the jury is, "what would he have done if, when the money came in, someone had let him know the truth?" Would he have said, "take it away"? Or would he have said "hand it over"? </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, this provides an entirely principled and sensible way of making sense of the language of section 1(1) and (2) of the 1977 Act. It can also make sense of the appellant's plea. He would have converted the money even if he had known that it was the proceeds of crime. But he did not know, so he hoped for a more lenient sentence as a result of persuading the prosecution to accept a plea on that basis. Much ink has been spilled, in and out of the courts, on this knotty problem, and I could spill some more; but as I understand that your Lordships take a different view from mine, there is little to be gained by my saying any more than that I agree with Professor Ormerod's views on this matter. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102.&nbsp;&nbsp;In common with all of your Lordships, I agree that the substantive offence requires that the accused <i>actually</i> suspects that the money is the proceeds of crime. Without that actual suspicion, he cannot act with the purpose required. I would therefore have answered the second certified question accordingly. But in respectful disagreement with your Lordships, I would have answered the first certified question as follows: "yes, provided that he intended to put the agreement into effect even if the property was in fact the proceeds of crime".  </p>

<p><b>LORD BROWN OF EATON-UNDER-HEYWOOD</b></p>

<p>My Lords,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the advantage of reading in draft the opinion of my noble and learned friend, Lord Hope of Craighead.  I agree with him that the appeal must be allowed and the appellant's conviction set aside.  Because of the obvious importance of the case, however, and because for my part I have found it a difficult one, I wish to express my own reasoning.  I can do so comparatively briefly: all the relevant facts and law are helpfully set out in Lord Hope's speech and I shall repeat only the most essential matters.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104.&nbsp;&nbsp;The two questions certified by the Court of Appeal for your Lordships' determination are these:</p>

<p></p><ul>"(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Can a defendant be convicted of a statutory conspiracy to contravene section 93C(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 if he enters into an agreement to convert property . . .  which he had reasonable grounds to suspect was the proceeds of crime and did in fact suspect but did not actually know was the proceeds of crime?<p></p></ul>

<p></p><ul>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the objective requirement that a defendant can be convicted of an offence under section 93C(2) of the Criminal Law Act 1988 if he had reasonable grounds to suspect that the property converted etc was the proceeds of crime (without having actual knowledge or suspicion) incompatible with the subjective requirement that the activity of the defendant must be for the specified purpose of assisting another to avoid prosecution for a criminal offence or avoiding the making or enforcement of a confiscation order?"<p></p></ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is convenient to start with the second question since this goes directly to the substantive offence under section 93C(2) and arises, therefore, before one comes to consider the crime of conspiracy (the subject of the first question).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 93C(2) provides:</p>

<p></p><ul>"A person is guilty of an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to suspect that any property is, or in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents, another person's proceeds of criminal conduct, he—<p></p></ul>

<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;conceals or disguises that property; or<p></p></ul>

<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;converts or transfers that property or removes it from the jurisdiction,<p></p></ul>

<p></p><ul>for the purpose of assisting any person to avoid prosecution for an offence to which this Part of this Act applies or the making or enforcement in his case of a confiscation order."<p></p></ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107.&nbsp;&nbsp;For simplicity's sake I shall hereafter refer to (i) "property [which] is, or in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents, another person's proceeds of criminal conduct" as "hot property" (the equivalent of Lord Hope's description in paragraph 76 of cash being "A"); (ii) any treatment of such hot property described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of the subsection as its "laundering"; and (iii) the purpose of assisting someone to avoid prosecution or confiscation as "an illicit purpose".</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108.&nbsp;&nbsp;If indeed the section contemplated that the defendant (D) might be guilty of the offence merely because "he had reasonable grounds to suspect" that the property was hot (i.e. merely because objectively grounds existed which would make a reasonable person suspect that the property was hot), then certainly I would regard that as incompatible with the requirement that D also be proved to have laundered the hot property for an illicit purpose.  Plainly he could not have that illicit purpose unless subjectively he also either actually knew or at the very least suspected the property to be hot.  It is, therefore, I readily accept, necessarily implicit in the section that not only must D have reasonable grounds to suspect that the property is hot but also that he <i>does</i> suspect it.  That requirement, of course, presents no problem whatever in the present case: the appellant <i>did</i> suspect that the money he had laundered was the proceeds of crime and, indeed, he pleaded guilty (to the conspiracy count) on that explicit bass.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109.&nbsp;&nbsp;I should perhaps add that I can see an argument for suggesting that not even actual suspicion that the property is hot is a sufficient basis for inferring that when laundering it D had the necessary illicit purpose: if all D knows is that the property may be hot and he suspects it is, it is not immediately obvious that any dealing with it is then for an illicit purpose.  Again, however, it seems to me necessarily implicit in the section that it is.  The section would otherwise be unworkable. The illicit purpose requirement must be regarded as satisfied whenever property is laundered by someone suspecting it to be hot.  He has at least that contingent purpose.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110.&nbsp;&nbsp;None of these difficulties, it should be noted, arise under the legislation in its present form: Part 7 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.  Section 328(1) provides that "A person commits an offence if he enters into or becomes concerned in an arrangement which he knows or suspects facilitates (by whatever means) the acquisition, retention, use or control of criminal property by or on behalf of another person," and section 340(3) states that: "Property is criminal property if (a) it constitutes a person's benefit from criminal conduct or it represents such a benefit (in whole or part and whether directly or indirectly), and (b) the alleged offender knows or suspects that it constitutes or represents such a benefit."</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111.&nbsp;&nbsp;I pass to the altogether more difficult question arising on the appeal, the scope for a conspiracy charge in the context of section 93C(2) offences.  Section 1 of the Criminal Law Act 1977 as amended provides:</p>

<p></p><ul>"(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to the following provisions of this Part of this Act, if a person agrees with any other person or persons that a course of conduct shall be pursued which, if the agreement is carried out in accordance with their intentions, either—<p></p></ul>

<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;will necessarily amount to or involve the commission of any offence or offences by one or more of the parties to the agreement, or<p></p></ul>

<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;would do so but for the existence of acts which render the commission of the offence or any of the offences impossible,<p></p></ul>

<p></p><ul>he is guilty of conspiracy to commit the offence or offences in question.<p></p></ul>

<p></p><ul>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Where liability for any offence may be incurred without knowledge on the part of the person committing it of any particular fact or circumstance necessary for the commission of the offence, a person shall nevertheless not be guilty of the conspiracy to commit that offence by virtue of subsection (1) above unless he and at least one other party to the agreement intend or know that that fact or circumstance shall or will exist at the time when the conduct constituting the offence is to take place." <p></p></ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112.&nbsp;&nbsp;As Lord Hope observes at paragraph 75, a conspiracy is complete when the agreement to enter into it is formed, even if nothing is done to implement it, and the statutory language itself assumes that implementation of the agreement lies in the future: "The question whether its requirements are fulfilled is directed to the stage when the agreement is formed, not to the stage when it is implemented."</p>
