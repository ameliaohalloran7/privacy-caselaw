<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;324. On 8 August 1991 Mr Parkyn received a standard form letter from the bank asking for confirmation that Mr Parkyn would act for the bank in connection with the second charge that the bank were to be granted by Mrs Bennett over 15, Elthiron Road to secure the liabilities to the bank of Mr and Mrs Bennett.  The letter did not indicate the </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nature of those liabilities.  The letter said, also, this:</p>
<p></p><ul>"As your firm already acts for the mortgagor, the bank expects that you will advise the mortgagor on the nature and effect of the legal charge. . . . . Please also stress to the mortgagor that the legal charge is for all sums due by our aforesaid customers."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;325. On 13 August 1991, Dickinson Manser &amp; Co confirmed they were willing to act for the bank.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;326. It had been arranged that Mr and Mrs Bennett would attend at the bank's Dumfries branch in order to sign the guarantee.  But, in the event, Mrs Bennett was unable to keep the appointment and, instead, it was agreed that the guarantee would be sent to the bank's branch in the Haymarket, London, and would be signed there.  It was signed there on 12 August 1991.  Mrs Bennett received no legal advice regarding the guarantee, nor was she advised by the bank to take legal advice about it before she signed, nor did the bank have any reason to suppose that she had received any legal advice about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;327. On 14 August 1991 Mr Parkyn wrote to Mr Bennett about the instructions he had received from the bank regarding the second charge over 15, Elthiron Road.  His letter said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"I confirm I have now received mortgage instructions from [the bank] for an advance of £150,000 to be secured by way of a second charge over the above property . . ."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;328. The letter reveals a misunderstanding on Mr Parkyn's part of the nature of the liabilities to be secured by the second charge.  The purpose of the charge was to secure the liabilities of Mr and Mrs Bennett under the guarantee, which Mr Parkyn had not seen and knew nothing about.  The guarantee secured payment, up to a limit of £150,000, of the company's indebtedness to the bank.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;329. On 17 September 1991, Mr Parkyn wrote to Mr and Mrs Bennett enclosing for their signature three documents, namely, the legal charge, a declaration of occupancy, and a consent to mortgage.  Presumably Mr Parkyn had been sent these documents by the bank.  He gave an explanation of these documents in his letter.  As to the legal charge, the letter said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"the charge is intended to secure both your liabilities to the bank however they are incurred.  I would point out that whilst the facility is for £150,000, the charge covers all liabilities to the bank whatsoever the amount . . . ."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;330. There was, as Chadwick LJ pointed out ([1999] 1 FLR 1115, 1124) nothing in the letter to suggest that Mr Parkyn was aware that the charge was to secure his clients' liabilities as guarantors of the company's indebtedness to the bank.  The judge accepted Mrs Bennett's evidence that she never saw this letter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;331. The three documents were signed by the requisite signatories on 1 October 1991.  The deputy judge accepted Mrs Bennett's evidence that she did not receive any legal advice about the nature or effect of the documents and that, save as contained in the letter of 17 August 1991 that Mrs Bennett did not see, Mr Parkyn did not give any.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;332. On 1 October 1991, Dickinson Manser &amp; Co wrote to the bank as follows:</p>
<p></p><ul>"We write to advise you that completion . . . took place on 1 October 1991, and your instructions have been complied with . . .  Except as noted below, there is no matter not already disclosed to you which we should draw to your attention in connection with this matter."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing at all was "noted below".  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;333. This letter of 1 October 1991, read in the context of the bank's letter of 8 August 1991 (referred to in para 324 above), entitled the bank to suppose that Dickinson Manser &amp; Co had advised Mrs Bennett on the nature and effect of the legal charge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;334. After completion of the legal charge the bank allowed the company to draw down on the £380,000 overdraft facility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;335. It is, in my opinion, important to emphasise that there was no evidence that Mr Parkyn knew about the guarantee that Mr and Mrs Bennett had signed.  Nor, therefore, was there any reason for him to be aware that the second charge of 15, Elthiron Road was securing their liabilities as guarantors of the company's debts to the bank.  The evidence justifies the inference that he thought they were principal debtors.  Nor was there any evidence that Mr Parkyn knew anything about the charges that the company had given to the bank and to SWIFT respectively, securing the liabilities of the company to them.  And, in particular, there was no evidence that either Mr Parkyn, or Mrs Bennett, knew about the ranking agreement under which SWIFT's charge was to rank ahead of the bank's charges for an amount not exceeding £250,000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;336. About seven months before taking the second charge over 15, Elthiron Road, the bank had received a valuation of the company's factory premises with the proposed new factory built thereon.  The valuation was well below the likely construction costs that the company would incur in building the new factory.  The bank did not disclose this information to Mrs Bennett or to Mr Parkyn and there is no reason to suppose that either of them was aware of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;337. The bank had taken no steps at all to satisfy itself that Mrs Bennett's consent to giving the guarantee had been properly obtained.  So the judge concluded that constructive notice of Mr Bennett's undue influence in procuring her consent to the guarantee should be imputed to the bank.  He held that she was not bound by the guarantee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;338. The bank did not appeal against this conclusion.  The reason the bank did not do so was that Mr Bennett remained bound by the guarantee.  The legal charge secured his liabilities to the bank as well as those of Mrs Bennett.  So if the bank could uphold the legal charge against Mrs Bennett, the company's debts for which Mr Bennett was liable under the guarantee would be secured by the legal charge  whether or not Mrs Bennett was bound by the guarantee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;339. As to the question whether the bank had constructive notice of Mr Bennett's undue influence in procuring Mrs Bennett to consent to the legal charge, the deputy judge would, but for the bank's omission to disclose to Mr Parkyn, or to Mrs Bennett, the existence of the ranking agreement or the valuation of the company's factory premises, have regarded the bank as protected by its reasonable belief that Mrs Bennett had received appropriate legal advice about the nature and effect of the legal charge.  He cited passages from the judgments in <i>Massey v Midland Bank Plc</i> [1995]  1 All ER 929,  <i>Barclays Bank Plc v Thomson</i> [1997]  4 All ER 816, <i> Banco Exterior Internacional v Mann</i> [1995]  1 All ER 936  and <i>Midland Bank Plc v Serter</i> [1995]  1 FLR 1034 and concluded, correctly in my opinion, that the fact that Dickinson, Manser &amp; Co had been acting not only for Mrs Bennett but also for Mr Bennett and for the bank itself did not detract from the reasonableness of the bank's expectation that the solicitors would have given Mrs Bennett adequate advice about the legal charge.  He said [1997] 1 FLR 801, 834:</p>
<p></p><ul>"A bank is in no worse position merely because, to its knowledge, the solicitor is acting both for the prospective surety and for the debtor." <p></p></ul>
<p>and, at p 835:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Unless a bank is put on notice by other matters within its knowledge that the solicitors have not performed their duty to give independent advice to the surety it is as much entitled [where the solicitor is acting also for the creditor] as in any other case to assume that the solicitors have been acting properly." <p></p></ul>
<p>I agree with both those statements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;340. But the judge accepted, at p 840, the submission made by counsel for Mrs Bennett that because the bank had failed to disclose to Mr Parkyn, or to Mrs Bennett, the ranking agreement between the bank and SWIFT and had failed to disclose the disparity between the development cost and the ultimate value of the factory premises, the bank had failed "to show that it took reasonable steps to bring home to Mrs Bennett the risks she was running". </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;341. The judge treated the non-disclosure as a constructive notice point.  His reasoning, I think, proceeded in this way:</p>
<p></p><ul>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The bank's knowledge of the relationship between Mr and Mrs Bennett and of the nature of the transactions she was entering into, ie the guarantee and the legal charge, put the bank on notice of the risk that her agreement to the transactions might have been procured by the undue influence of her husband.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The bank could avoid being on constructive notice of any such impropriety by taking reasonable steps to satisfy itself that Mrs Bennett understood the nature and effect of the transactions.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;The bank's failure to disclose the material facts regarding the SWIFT ranking agreement and the value of the factory premises was a failure to take reasonable steps.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a failure to take reasonable steps because unless Mr Parkyn was given this information he could not be expected to give Mrs Bennett appropriate advice about the risks she was running.<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;342. The Court of Appeal disagreed.  Chadwick LJ [1999] 1 FLR 1115, 1142 accepted that the facts in question</p>
<p></p><ul>"were facts which a competent adviser, advising Mrs Bennett as to the risk that the bank would need to have recourse to the security which she was providing, would need to know . . . . " <p></p></ul>
<p>but held, at pp 1142-1143:</p>
<p></p><ul>"the judge was wrong to hold that the bank was required to bring those facts to the notice of Mr Parkyn or his client:  or … to hold that … the bank was not entitled to assume that Mr Parkyn would become aware of those facts in the course of considering what advice he needed to give Mrs Bennett . . . . " <p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;343. Chadwick LJ thought that the bank was entitled to assume that Mr Parkyn would inform himself of the nature of the liabilities secured by the legal charge, and, in doing so, would become aware that "those liabilities are themselves liabilities under a guarantee for a company's indebtedness to the bank" and that Mr Parkyn would then "inform himself as to the company's financial position".  He continued:</p>
<p></p><ul>"That must, at the least, involve questioning the true value of the assets in the balance sheet and understanding the ranking of whatever charges have been created over those assets". <p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;344. In my respectful opinion, this view of what a solicitor in the position of Mr Parkyn would inquire into and discover is unrealistic.  Let it be supposed that Mr Parkyn had known about the guarantee.  It is to be expected that he would have advised Mrs Bennett that the risk of the bank seeking to enforce the charge so as to recover the £150,000 would depend upon the fortunes of the company.  He might have asked her if she was satisfied about the company's prospects.  He probably would have asked her if she knew anything about the company's existing indebtedness to the bank and the extent of its overdraft facility.  If she did not know these things, he might have advised her to find out about them or have asked her if she wanted him to try and do so.  But it seems to me highly unlikely that he would on his own initiative have examined the company's latest balance sheet — which would probably have been well out of date — or have inquired into the balance sheet values of its assets.  I think it highly unlikely that, without special instructions to do so, he would have carried out a search in order to discover what charges were registered against the company.  In the ordinary discharge of his duties as a solicitor advising Mrs Bennett about the nature and effect of the legal charge I do not believe he would have become aware either of the ranking agreement between the bank and SWIFT or of the valuation of the factory premises that the bank had obtained.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;345. In my opinion, however, both the deputy judge and the Court of Appeal approached this question of disclosure from the wrong angle.  The point was not, in my view, a constructive notice point.  It was simply a disclosure point.  Did the bank have an obligation to the proposed surety to disclose this information to the surety?  If it did, what is the consequence of the non-disclosure?  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;346. In my opinion, the ranking agreement between the company, the bank and SWIFT falls within the general proposition expressed by Vaughan Williams LJ in <i>London General Omnibus Co Ltd v Holloway</i> [1912]  2 KB 72, 79  (see para 186 above).  </p>
<p>A surety who pays off the creditor is entitled to be subrogated to the rights of the creditor in respect of the debt in question.  And if the creditor, in order to discharge the debt, has recourse to security provided by the surety, the same applies.  So, in the present case, if Mrs Bennett had paid the bank the £150,000, or if the bank had obtained payment by realising its security over 15, Elthiron Road, Mrs Bennett would have been entitled to the benefit of the Bank's rights against the company in respect of the £150,000.  These rights would have included the bank's rights under its fixed and floating charges.  But those rights were subject to the ranking agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;347. Moreover the ranking agreement reduced the amount of the company's assets that would be available for the payment of the company's debts to the bank and correspondingly increased the likelihood that the bank would make a call on Mr Bennett or Mrs Bennett, or both, under the guarantee and would enforce its security over 15, Elthiron Road.  The ranking agreement did affect the rights of Mrs Bennett as surety.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;348. In my opinion, the bank ought to have disclosed to Mrs Bennett, or to the solicitor acting for her, the existence of the ranking agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;349. The deputy judge thought that the facts regarding the valuation of the factory premises should also have been disclosed by the bank.  Here, I do not agree.  It is, I think, up to an intending surety to satisfy himself about the value of the principal debtor's assets or the principal debtor's credit worthiness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;350. The bank's obligation to disclose the existence of the ranking agreement arose, in my opinion, under the general law applicable to suretyship contracts.   Mr Jarvis QC, counsel for the bank, accepted that if the bank had an obligation to disclose the ranking agreement and if Mrs Bennett and Mr Parkyn were on 1 October 1991 unaware of it, Mrs Bennett was entitled to have the legal charge set aside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;351. I would allow her appeal on this ground.</p>
<i><p><i>Kenyon-Brown v Desmond Banks &amp; Co</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;352. This is the solicitors' negligence case.  The solicitors, appellants before your Lordships, are Desmond Banks &amp; Co.  The proprietor of the firm, Mr Desmond Banks, acted in the matters that have given rise to this litigation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;353. Mrs Kenyon-Brown, the respondent before the House, contends that Mr Banks acted negligently in failing to advise her properly on 12 January 1993, when she and her husband attended at his offices to sign a second legal charge of their jointly owned holiday cottage, Rock Cottage, Melplash, Bridport, to National Westminster Bank Plc.  The charge secured Mr Kenyon-Brown's indebtedness to the bank.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;354. In her statement of claim Mrs Kenyon-Brown pleaded that Mr Banks owed her a duty to advise her, before she signed the legal charge,</p>
<p></p><ul>"(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;that there was a conflict of interest between the plaintiff and Mr Kenyon-Brown in respect of the proposed mortgage;  and/or<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;that the said conflict might prevent or inhibit the defendants from disclosing or explaining all aspects of the transaction to the plaintiff or from giving advice to the plaintiff which would conflict with Mr Kenyon-Brown's interests;  and/or<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;that she could and/or should obtain advice from an independent solicitor in respect of the proposed mortgage;  and/or<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;that the proposed mortgage would confer no benefit upon her;  and/or<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(v)&nbsp;&nbsp;as to the nature and effect of the mortgage."<p></p></ul>
<p>She pleaded that Mr Banks had failed to give her advice in respect of these matters, or any advice about the proposed mortgage, and that in consequence she had suffered loss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;355. She quantified her loss as being one half of the sum of £55,000 then owing by Mr Kenyon-Brown to the bank.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;356. Mr Banks accepted in his defence that he had owed Mrs Kenyon-Brown a duty to advise her "as to the meaning and effect" of the legal charge, but denied any breach of duty and denied, if there had been any breach of duty, that the breach had caused any loss.  Directions were given for issues of liability to be tried before issues of damage.  At trial, on the liability issues, the familiar two issues arose.  What was the extent of the duty owed by Mr Banks?  Had there been any breach of that duty?  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;357. The material facts can be quite shortly stated.  Mr and Mrs Kenyon-Brown were directors of and shareholders in KB Insurance Brokers (London) Ltd (KB) and PM Insurance Services Ltd (PM).  These companies were controlled by Mr Kenyon-Brown but Mrs Kenyon-Brown did play some part in the insurance businesses that they carried on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;358. In 1983 a controlling interest in each company was sold to Crusader Insurance Company Ltd (Crusader). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;359. In 1986 Mr and Mrs Kenyon-Brown purchased Rock Cottage for £50,000 with the aid of a £30,000 advance from Nationwide Building Society secured by a mortgage of Rock Cottage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;360. In 1988 they purchased 53, Dene Road, Northwood, with the aid of a £30,000 advance from National Westminster Home Loans Ltd secured by a mortgage of 53, Dene Road.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;361. Both properties were in their joint names.  53, Dene Road was their home.  Rock Cottage was a holiday cottage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;362. In 1989 the opportunity to repurchase from Crusader the shares in KB and PM arose.  As the deputy judge, Mr Peter Leaver QC, found:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Mrs Kenyon-Brown was very much against doing so, but was overborne by her husband and very reluctantly agreed to the repurchase."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;363. Finance was needed for the repurchase of the shares and a loan from National Westminster Bank Plc to be secured by a second mortgage of 53, Dene Road was arranged.  The loan was to be a loan to Mr Kenyon-Brown alone, not to the two of them jointly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;364. Mr Banks, who had acted for Mr and Mrs Kenyon-Brown in their purchase of 53, Dene Road, and had acted previously for KB and for PM, acted for them in connection with the grant to the bank of the second mortgage of 53, Dene Road.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;365. By a letter of 13 November 1989 the bank asked Mr Banks to arrange for the legal charge to be signed by Mr and Mrs Kenyon-Brown and to confirm, when returning the signed document, that Mrs Kenyon-Brown had received legal advice about it.  So Mr Banks arranged a meeting with her at his offices on 15 November 1989.  His attendance note records the advice he gave her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;366. Mr Banks pointed out to her that the advance was to be to Mr Kenyon-Brown alone, not to the two of them jointly.  Mrs Kenyon-Brown responded that she trusted her husband.  Mr Banks was instrumental in arranging for the sum secured by the legal charge to be limited to £150,000.  No allegation has been made that in advising Mrs Kenyon-Brown on this occasion Mr Banks was in breach of the duty he owed her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;367. The legal charge over 53, Dene Road was duly completed.  It secured the liabilities to the bank of Mr Kenyon-Brown, subject to the agreed limit of £150,000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;368. By 1992, the bank was seeking further security in respect of Mr Kenyon-Brown's indebtedness and agreement was apparently reached between it and Mr Kenyon-Brown that it would be given a second charge over Rock Cottage.  By a letter of 15 December 1992 the bank sent Mr Banks the proposed form of legal charge for signature by Mr and Mrs Kenyon-Brown.  The letter said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"We shall be grateful if you will confirm that Legal Advice was given to Mrs Kenyon-Brown when the charge form is returned."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;369. On 12 January 1993 Mrs Kenyon-Brown had a meeting with Mr Banks at his offices.  His attendance note reads:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Advised on mortgage.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>— Jessica is happy to go along with it — doesn't want me to go into it in detail — even if money is borrowed by N alone to buy shares in KB in his name.  Dene Road already mortgage.  Copy mortgage to JKB.  Mrs KB appeared to understand it fully and despite the terms of my warning to be totally unconcerned that the mortgage of property jointly owned by her would benefit her husband alone and be without limit."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;370. As indicated by the attendance note, the form of legal charge contained no limit on the amount of Mr Kenyon-Brown's liabilities to the bank that would be secured.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;371. The legal charge was duly completed and dated 12 January 1993.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;372. At the trial, Mrs Kenyon-Brown was the only witness who gave oral evidence but the deputy judge said that he did not find her evidence about the events of 15 November 1989 or 12 January 1993 persuasive.  He said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Ultimately, I came to the conclusion that her evidence could not be relied upon."<p></p></ul>
<p>He recorded, however, that she said that she could not contradict Mr Banks' attendance note of the 12 January 1993 meeting.  He expressed his conclusions in the following passage:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In my judgment the evidence in the present case comes nowhere near proving that the defendant was negligent in the manner of which Mrs Kenyon-Brown complains.  It is for Mrs Kenyon-Brown to satisfy me, on the balance of probabilities, that the defendant failed to discharge his duty to her properly in the ways of which she complains.  Mrs Kenyon-Brown has failed to satisfy me that the defendant gave no advice.  Indeed the attendance note . . . . makes it plain that the defendant did give advice.  On Miss Smith's second submission, that the defendant should, in the light of the conflict of interests, have told her to go to another solicitor, I hold that the law does not require that she [sic] should do so.  While it may, in some cases be prudent for a solicitor so to advise, it will depend upon the facts of the case as to whether it was negligent or not to do so.  Although Mrs Kenyon-Brown told me that she was sure that if she had been advised to go to another solicitor she would have gone, I could not accept that evidence.  I form the view that Mrs Kenyon-Brown was quite clear as to what she was doing by entering into the second mortgage, and wanted to do so notwithstanding the defendant's 'warning'."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;373. These conclusions might be thought to have made the prospects of an appeal unpromising.  But there was an appeal and the appeal succeeded (although Wilson J dissented) [2000] PNLR 266.  The main judgment was given by Mance LJ.  He based his reasoning substantially on the judgment of the Court of Appeal in <i>Etridge (No 2)</i> [1998] 4 All ER 705.  He cited paragraphs 19 to 26 of Stuart-Smith LJ's judgment under the heading "Independent legal advice".  In these paragraphs Stuart-Smith LJ was considering the advice that needs to be given where a solicitor is instructed to advise a person who may be subject to the undue influence of another.  I have criticised the contents of these paragraphs in an earlier section of this opinion and shall not repeat the criticism here.  The duty of a solicitor always depends on the extent of the instructions given to and accepted by him, either expressly or by implication, by conduct or otherwise.  The normal duty of a solicitor instructed to advise a would-be surety, whether a wife of the principal debtor or anyone else, about the document or documents the surety is being asked to sign, is to explain the nature and effect of the document in order to try and make sure that the surety knows what he or she is doing.  The particular circumstances of a particular case may add to or reduce the extent of the duty owed by the solicitor.  There was, in my opinion, nothing in the circumstances which resulted in Mr Banks advising Mrs Kenyon-Brown about the proposed second mortgage of Rock Cottage to add to the normal duty that I have described.  Mance LJ said that since Mr Banks knew that Mrs Kenyon-Brown reposed trust and confidence in her husband (see the contents of the attendance note of the 15 November 1989 meeting) and that the second mortgage of Rock Cottage appeared to be entirely in Mr Kenyon-Brown's interests and was without limit of amount, he was on notice that "there might be undue influence".  This is something that was never pleaded.  It may be right that a solicitor who is advising a client about a transaction and has reason to suspect that the client is the victim of undue influence is placed under a duty to the client to try and protect her (see <i>Bank of Montreal v Stuart</i> [1911]  AC 120, 138).  But if a case of that sort is to be advanced against a solicitor, it must be pleaded.  A solicitor does not have reason to suspect undue influence simply because he knows a wife has trust and confidence in her husband and is proposing to give a charge over her property to support his financial position.  That she is willing to do so is consistent with a normal relationship between spouses.  Mance LJ said, at p 281:</p>
<p></p><ul>"There is no suggestion, or likelihood in the light of Mr Banks' attendance note, that Mr Banks ascertained the amount outstanding (well in excess of the limit of liability in the second mortgage of 53, Dene Road), its origin and the circumstances in which it came to be outstanding, let alone the prospects of its repayment or of the additional security over Rock Cottage being called upon.  Nor did he ask why Mrs Kenyon-Brown was willing to grant such additional security.  Still less, therefore, did he know that her husband had told her that she would be bankrupted if she did not enter into the mortgage.  Nor did he elicit the fact (about which she gave evidence) that she did not consider the marriage to have any long term future but wished, on the other hand, to avoid bringing it to an end until her son (aged 14 at the beginning of 1983) was older and to maintain a tolerable atmosphere at home in the meantime while she was living with Mr Kenyon-Brown.  These are considerations which would have been central to an evaluation whether it made sense for the wife to enter into the mortgage and to a balanced decision whether to do so, made free of any undue influence by Mr Kenyon-Brown.  Mr Banks did not know of them.  Nor, therefore, could he either discuss them with Mrs Kenyon-Brown or, if he concluded in their light that a conflict of interest existed, suggest that she discuss them with another solicitor."<p></p></ul>
