<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Calveley and Others v Chief Constable of Merseyside Police</i> [1989]  AC 1228 police officers brought an action in negligence against a Chief Constable on the ground that disciplinary proceedings had been negligently conducted.  The decision in <i>Hill</i> was cited to the House.  Giving the opinion of a unanimous House, Lord Bridge of Harwich observed [at 1238D-H]:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is, I accept, foreseeable that in these situations the suspect may be put to expense, or may conceivably suffer some other economic loss, which might have been avoided had a more careful investigation established his innocence at some earlier stage.  However, any suggestion that there should be liability in negligence in such circumstances runs up against the formidable obstacles in the way of liability in negligence for purely economic loss.  Where no action for malicious prosecution would lie, it would be strange indeed if an acquitted defendant could recover damages for negligent investigation.  Finally, all other considerations apart, it would plainly be contrary to public policy, in my opinion, to prejudice the fearless and efficient discharge by police officers of their vitally important public duty of investigating crime by requiring them to act under the shadow of a potential action for damages for negligence by the suspect.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>If no duty of care is owed by a police officer investigating a suspected crime to a civilian suspect, it is difficult to see any conceivable reason why a police officer who is subject to investigation under the Regulations of 1977 should be in any better position."<p></p></ul>
<p>This was clearly an application of the second ground of the decision in <i>Hill.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the principle enunciated in <i>Hill</i> has been applied in a number of Court of Appeal decisions: <i>Alexandrou v Oxford</i> [1993] 4 All ER 328, 340J;  <i>Ancell v McDermott</i> [1993]  4 All ER 355, at 365G-H.  <i>Osman v Ferguson</i> [1993]  4 All ER 344;  <i>Cowan v Chief Constable for Avon and Somerset Constabulary</i> (2002)  HLR 830, para 44.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22.&nbsp;&nbsp;Acknowledging that <i>Elguzouli-Daf v Commissioner of Police</i> [1995] QB 335 is a different case altogether, counsel for the Commissioner relied on it by analogy.  The two appeals before the Court of Appeal in that case raised the question of law whether the Crown Prosecution Service owed a duty of care to those whom it was prosecuting.  Relying in large measure on the reasoning in <i>Hill</i> the Court of Appeal held that there was no such duty.  The court held that different considerations arise in cases where the police had by conduct assumed a responsibility.  Although not expressly mentioned in the judgments this was clearly a reference to the principle in <i>Hedley Byrne &amp; Co. Ltd v Heller and Partners Limited</i> [1964]  AC 465.  In my judgment I said [349C-350C]:</p>
<p></p><ul>"That brings me to the policy factors which, in my view, argue against the recognition of a duty of care owed by the CPS to those it prosecutes.  While it is always tempting to yield to an argument based on the protection of civil liberties, I have come to the conclusion that the interests of the whole community are better served by not imposing a duty of care on the CPS.  In my view, such a duty of care would tend to have an inhibiting effect on the discharge by the CPS of its central function of prosecuting crime.  It would in some cases lead to a defensive approach by prosecutors to their multifarious duties.  It would introduce a risk that prosecutors would act as to protect themselves from claims of negligence.  The CPS would have to spend valuable time and use scarce resources in order to prevent law suits in negligence against the CPS.  It would generate a great deal of paper to guard against the risks of law suits.  The time and energy of CPS lawyers would be diverted from concentrating on their prime functions of prosecuting offenders.  That would be likely to happen not only during the prosecution process but also when the CPS is sued in negligence by aggrieved defendants.  The CPS would be constantly enmeshed in an avalanche of interlocutory civil proceedings and civil trials.  That is a spectre that would bode ill for the efficiency of the CPS and the quality of our criminal justice system.<p></p></ul>
<i><p></p><ul>Conclusion<p></p></ul>
</i><p></p><ul>While Mr Richards, who appeared for the CPS, disputed that even the element of foreseeability of harm is established, I would be prepared to accept that the plaintiffs can satisfy this requirement.  For my part the matter turns on a combination of the element of proximity and the question of whether it is fair, just and reasonable that the law should impose a duty of care.  It does not seem to me that these considerations can sensibly be considered separately in this case: inevitably they shade into each other.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Recognising that individualised justice to private individuals, or trading companies, who are aggrieved by careless decisions of CPS lawyers, militates in favour of the recognition of a duty of care, I conclude that there are compelling considerations, rooted in the welfare of the whole community, which outweigh the dictates of individualised justice.  I would rule that there is no duty of care owed by the CPS to those it prosecutes."<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>. . . <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>I have rested my judgment on the absence of a duty of care on the part of the CPS.  If my conclusion is wrong, I would for the reasons I have given in dealing with the question whether a duty of care exists rule that the CPS is immune from liability in negligence."<p></p></ul>
<p>Rose LJ agreed and Morritt LJ agreed in a short concurring judgment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23.&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly after the decision in <i>Elguzouli-Daf</i> the same issue came before a differently constituted Court of Appeal (Butler-Sloss and Millett LJJ and Sir Ralph Gibson): <i>Kumar v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis </i>(unreported) 31 January 1995.  Again, the case involved a strike out application.  The thrust of the case was that in instituting and continuing a patently hopeless prosecution for rape, based only on the evidence of a woman who had made repeated false allegations of rape, the police acted in breach of a duty of care.  Following <i>Hill</i> and <i>Elguzouli-Daf, </i>a unanimous Court of Appeal upheld the order of the deputy High Court judge to strike out the pleading.  Giving the principal judgment Sir Ralph Gibson observed in a detailed review:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In my judgment, for similar reasons [to those given in <i>Elguzouli-Daf],</i> the interests of the whole community are better served by not imposing a duty of care upon the police officers in their decisions whether or not to place sufficient reliance upon the account of a complainant to justify the making of a charge against an accused."<p></p></ul>
<i><p>XII.  Comparative Law</p></i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24.&nbsp;&nbsp;Counsel for Mr Brooks candidly accepted that he was arguing for a new development.  In that context he pointed out that <i>Hill</i> has not been followed in Canada: <i>Doe v Board of Commissioners of Police for Metropolitan Toronto</i> (1989)  58 DLR (4th) 396; <i>Jane Doe v Board of Commissioners of Police for Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto</i> (1990)  72 DLR (4th) 580, 585; <i>Jane Doe v Board of Commissioners of Police for Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto</i> (1998)  160 DLR (4th) 697; <i>Odhavji Estate v Woodhouse and others</i> [2003]  3 SCR 263.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25.&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, in South Africa the Constitutional Court did not follow <i>Hill</i>: <i>Carmichele v Minister of Safety and Security</i> (2001) 12 BHRC 60; see also <i>Hamilton v Minister of Safety and Security</i> 2003  (7) BCLR 723 (C).  On the other hand, the decision of the Australian High Court in <i>Sullivan v Moody</i> [2002]  LRC 251 is generally speaking consistent with <i>Hill</i>: paras 57 and 60.  That is so despite the fact that the three-stage approach in <i>Caparo</i> is not part of the law of Australia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26.&nbsp;&nbsp;This <i>tour d'horizon</i> was interesting.  But one must not lose sight of the fact that <i>Hill</i> has not been challenged in this appeal.  In any event, ultimately the principle in <i>Hill</i> must be judged in the light of our legal policy and our bill of rights.</p>
<i>XIII.  The Status of Hill</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;27.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the decision in <i>Hill</i> there have been developments which affect the reasoning of that decision in part.  In <i>Hill</i> the House relied on the barrister's immunity enunciated in <i>Rondel v Worsley</i> [1969] 1 AC 191.  That immunity no longer exists: <i>Arthur J S Hall &amp; Co (A Firm) v Simons</i> [2002] 1 AC 615.  More fundamentally since the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in <i>Z and others v United Kingdom</i> 34 EHRR 97, para 100, it would be best for the principle in <i>Hill</i> to be reformulated in terms of the absence of a duty of care rather than a blanket immunity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28.&nbsp;&nbsp;With hindsight not every observation in <i>Hill</i> can now be supported.  Lord Keith of Kinkel observed that "From time to time [the police] make mistakes in the exercise of that function, but it is not to be doubted that they apply their best endeavours to the performance of it": 63D.  Nowadays, a more sceptical approach to the carrying out of all public functions is necessary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;29.&nbsp;&nbsp;Counsel for the Commissioner concedes that cases of assumption of responsibility under the extended <i>Hedley Byrne</i> doctrine fall outside the <i>Hill</i> principle.  In such cases there is no need to embark on an enquiry whether it is "fair, just and reasonable" to impose liability for economic loss: <i>Williams v Natural Life Health Foods Limited</i> [1998] 1 WLR 830.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the core principle of <i>Hill</i> has remained unchallenged in our domestic jurisprudence and in European jurisprudence for many years.  If a case such as the Yorkshire Ripper case, which was before the House in <i>Hill,</i> arose for decision today I have no doubt that it would be decided in the same way.  It is, of course, desirable that police officers should treat victims and witnesses properly and with respect: compare the Police Conduct Regulations 2004 (No. 645).  But to convert that ethical value into general legal duties of care on the police towards victims and witnesses would be going too far.  The prime function of the police is the preservation of the Queen's peace.  The police must concentrate on preventing the commission of crime; protecting life and property; and apprehending criminals and preserving evidence: see section 29 of the Police Act 1996, read with Schedule 4 as substituted by section 83 of the Police Reform Act 2002; section 17 of the Police (Scotland) Act 1967; <i>Halsbury's Laws of England,</i> Vol 36 (1), para 524; <i>The Laws of Scotland, Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, </i>1995, para 1784; <i>Moylan, Scotland Yard and the Metropolitan Police,</i> 1929, 34.  A retreat from the principle in <i>Hill</i> would have detrimental effects for law enforcement.  Whilst focusing on investigating crime, and the arrest of suspects, police officers would in practice be required to ensure that in every contact with a potential witness or a potential victim time and resources were deployed to avoid the risk of causing harm or offence.  Such legal duties would tend to inhibit a robust approach in assessing a person as a possible suspect, witness or victim.  By placing general duties of care on the police to victims and witnesses the police's ability to perform their public functions in the interests of the community, fearlessly and with despatch, would be impeded.  It would, as was recognised in <i>Hill, </i>be<i> </i>bound to lead to an unduly defensive approach in combating crime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;31.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true, of course, that the application of the <i>Hill</i> principle will sometimes leave citizens, who are entitled to feel aggrieved by negligent conduct of the police, without a private law remedy for psychiatric harm.  But domestic legal policy, and the Human Rights Act 1998, sometimes compel this result.  In <i>Brown v Stott</i> [2003]  1 AC 681, Lord Bingham of Cornhill observed [at 703D]:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The Convention is concerned with rights and freedoms which are of real importance in a modern democracy governed by the rule of law.  It does not, as is sometimes mistakenly thought, offer relief from 'The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to.'"<p></p></ul>
<p>I added [at 707E-708A]:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In the first real test of the Human Rights Act 1998 it is opportune to stand back and consider what the basic aims of the Convention are . . .  The inspirers of the European Convention, among whom Winston Churchill played an important role, and the framers of the European Convention, ably assisted by English draftsmen, realised that from time to time the fundamental right of one individual may conflict with the human right of another  … .  They also realised only too well that a single-minded concentration on the pursuit of fundamental rights of individuals to the exclusion of the interests of the wider public might be subversive of the ideal of tolerant European liberal democracies.  The fundamental rights of individuals are of supreme importance but those rights are not unlimited: we live in communities of individuals who also have rights.  The direct lineage of this ancient idea is clear: the European Convention (1950) is the descendant of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) which in article 29 expressly recognised the duties of everyone to the community and the limitation on rights in order to secure and protect respect for the rights of others."<p></p></ul>
<p>Unfortunately, when other specific torts and the Race Relations Act 1976 (as amended) are inapplicable, an aggrieved citizen may in cases such as those under consideration have to be content with pursuing a complaint under the constantly improved police complaints procedure: see Police Reform Act 2002, the Police (Conduct) Regulations 2004 and Police (Complaints and Misconduct) Regulations 2004.  For all these reasons, I am satisfied that the decision in <i>Hill</i> must stand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32.&nbsp;&nbsp;While not challenging the decision of the House of Lords in <i>Hill </i>counsel submitted that it can be distinguished.  The only suggested distinction ultimately pursued was that in <i>Hill</i> the police negligence was the indirect cause of the murder of the daughter whereas in the present case the police directly caused the harm to Mr Brooks.  That hardly does justice to the essential reasoning in <i>Hill</i>.  In any event, <i>Calveley, Elguzouli-Daf, </i>and <i>Kumar</i> were cases of alleged positive and direct negligence by the police.  The distinction is unmeritorious.</p>
<i><p>XIV.  The Three Critical Questions</p></i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33.&nbsp;&nbsp;That brings me to the three critical alleged duties of care before the House.  It is realistic and fair to pose the question whether the three surviving duties of care can arguably be said to be untouched by the core principle in <i>Hill.</i>  In my view the three alleged duties are undoubtedly inextricably bound up with the police function of investigating crime which is covered by the principle in <i>Hill</i>.  For example, the second duty of care is to "take reasonable steps to afford [Mr Brooks] the protection, assistance and support commonly afforded to a key eye-witness to a serious crime of violence."  It is quite impossible to separate this alleged duty from the police function of investigating crime.  The same is, however, true of the other two pleaded duties.  If the core principle in <i>Hill</i> stands, as it must, these pleaded duties of care cannot survive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;34.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unnecessary in this case to try to imagine cases of outrageous negligence by the police, unprotected by specific torts, which could fall beyond the reach of the <i>Hill</i> principle.  It would be unwise to try to predict accurately what unusual cases could conceivably arise.  I certainly do not say that they could not arise.  But such exceptional cases on the margins of the <i>Hill</i> principle will have to be considered and determined if and when they occur.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;35.&nbsp;&nbsp;Making full allowance for the fact that this is a strike out application, and that the law regarding the liability of the police in tort is not set in stone, I am satisfied that the three duties of care put forward in this case are conclusively ruled out by the principle in <i>Hill, </i>as restated, and must be struck out.</p>
<i>

<p>XV.  Disposal</p></i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;36.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would allow the appeal of the Commissioner.</p>

            She did not note down this information provided by the Plaintiff or

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Paragraph 5(2)</strong> 
        of the Statement of Facts and Issues states the 'Second Duty' as being 
        to:</p>

        of claim relating to the Second Duty in the "Annexe to Order of Court 
        of Appeal of 26th March 2002 - Re-Amended Particulars of Claim" are found 
        in <strong>Para 54(ii) - pages 123 - 124:</strong></p>

        the protection, support and assistance appropriate to a person in the

        violence. The Plaintiff repeats and relies upon the matters set out in 
        <strong>paragraph 51(iii) above.</strong> This failure comprised all police 
        officers involved in witness liaison with the Plaintiff and is not limited

            scene of the attack. He told her that it had been carried out by 5-6 
            white male youths and indicated that they had run off in the direction 
            of Dickinson Road. He also told her that one of the youths had called 
            out "what what nigger" immediately before the assault on Stephen Lawrence. 
            She did not note down this information provided by the Plaintiff or 
            act on it or cause it to be acted on at the time. She questioned the 
            Plaintiff as to whether the assailants were known to him and as to 
            whether he was carrying a weapon. She asked these questions more than 
            once and seemed reluctant to accept his answers. She did not ask him 
            for descriptions of the assailants. She did not, or at least did not 
            appear, to take his account seriously. She did not try to establish 
            if the Plaintiff had been attacked himself. She did not offer him 
            any support or check to see whether he was all right. She did not 
            appear to appreciate that he was in a distraught and frightened condition 
            as a result of the attack and the condition of his friend lying on 
            the pavement, nor that he was frustrated by the apparent delay in 
            the arrival of the ambulance that had been called."</td>

            chose the latter as he found being in the hospital very distressing.

            and felt that he would have been arrested, had he done so. He waited 
            in the car for what felt like up to 30 minutes before the Fifth Defendant
