<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proceedings </p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;247.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the proceedings the Douglases and Northern and Shell plc, the publisher of OK, claimed damages for breach of confidence.  OK also claimed damages for interference with its business by unlawful means.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;248.&nbsp;&nbsp;In a comprehensive judgment Lindsay J held that Hello did not, by its publication of the unauthorised pictures, commit the tort of inducing a breach of contract.  The Douglases did not break their contract.  They fulfilled their contractual obligation to do the best they could to exclude the media and the public from the wedding.  Nor did Hello commit the tort of interfering with OK's business by unlawful means.  Hello did not intend to injure OK.  But Hello was liable to the Douglases and OK for breach of confidence: [2003] All ER 996.  In a supplemental judgment the judge awarded damages of £1,047,756, divisible as to £14,600 to the Douglases and the balance to OK: [2004] EMLR 2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;249.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal, comprising Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers MR, and Clarke and Neuberger LJJ, upheld the judge's decision on the Douglases' breach of confidence claim and on OK's claims based on economic torts.  The court reversed the judge's decision on OK's breach of confidence claim: [2006] QB 125.  The overall outcome was that the Douglases' breach of confidence claim succeeded but OK's claims wholly failed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;250.&nbsp;&nbsp;OK appealed to your Lordships' House.  Hello did not appeal against the decision in favour of the Douglases.  </p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Misuse of private information</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;251.&nbsp;&nbsp;Photographs are much the best way of conveying an impression of how everybody looked at a wedding.  Photographs make one a spectator at the wedding.  Information communicated in other ways, in sketches or descriptive writing or by word of mouth, cannot be so complete or accurate.  The Douglases and OK claim that, save to the extent OK published authorised photographs, photographic information about their wedding was private.  Publication of this information without the Douglases' approval was misuse of this information. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;252.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr and Mrs Douglas sought to keep this information private primarily to protect their 'image'.  Film directors take into account the public perception of actors and actresses when casting for films.  Miss Zeta-Jones said the 'hard reality of the film industry is that preserving my image, particularly as a woman, is vital to my career'.  Mr Douglas said his name and likeness are valuable assets to him.  It is important for him, for professional reasons, to protect his name and likeness and prevent unauthorised use of either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;253.&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the understandable importance to Mr and Mrs Douglas of their public image, it is necessary first to mention and put on one side certain points in this regard.  The identity of this couple made their wedding an eminently newsworthy event.  By publishing pictures of the wedding Hello was exploiting that fact. In principle that was unexceptionable.  Publication of wedding photographs in Hello was not, <i>of itself, </i>improper exploitation of the reputation, name or likeness of the Douglases such as may be protected in some circumstances in the United States of America: see Corpus Juris Secundum, vol 77, (2006), pp 591-592, para 51.  Nor did Hello's publication of pictures of this event constitute 'character merchandising' or, still less, a case of 'false endorsement' as discussed by Laddie J in <i>Irvine v Talksport Ltd</i> [2001] 1 WLR 2355.  Thus it is unnecessary to consider how far English law has developed, or should develop, in these fields.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;254.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor is it necessary to consider further the legal foundation for the Douglases' claim.  This is not an issue on this appeal.  Your Lordships are concerned only with OK's claim.  OK's claim is based solely on breach of confidence.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confidential information</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;255.&nbsp;&nbsp;As the law has developed breach of confidence, or misuse of confidential information, now covers two distinct causes of action, protecting two different interests: privacy, and secret ('confidential') information.  It is important to keep these two distinct.  In some instances information may qualify for protection both on grounds of privacy and confidentiality.  In other instances information may be in the public domain, and not qualify for protection as confidential, and yet qualify for protection on the grounds of privacy.  Privacy can be invaded by further publication of information or photographs already disclosed to the public.  Conversely, and obviously, a trade secret may be protected as confidential information even though no question of personal privacy is involved.  This distinction was recognised by the Law Commission in its report on Breach of Confidence (1981) Cmnd 388, pages 5-6.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;256.&nbsp;&nbsp;OK's claim is that Hello committed a breach of confidence by publishing a confidential secret.  OK's interest was wholly commercial, in maximising the financial advantage flowing from having an exclusive right to publish the authorised pictures.  Accordingly, as my noble and learned friend Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe says, OK's claim has to be based on a right to short-term confidentiality for a commercial secret.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;257.&nbsp;&nbsp;So the first step is to identify the 'secret'.  The secret information cannot lie in the differences between the unapproved photographs and the approved photographs.  The secret cannot lie there, because the six unapproved photographs contained nothing not included in the approved photographs.  That is common ground.  This being so, the inevitable differences, in expression and posture and so on, cannot constitute 'confidential' information for the purposes of this equitable principle.  The expression of the bride in one wedding photograph compared with her expression in another is insufficiently significant to call for legal protection.  It has not been suggested that the unapproved photographs were embarrassing in any way, or that they were detrimental to the Douglases' image.  Accordingly, once the approved pictures were published, albeit simultaneously, publication of the unapproved pictures was not a breach of confidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;258.&nbsp;&nbsp;OK sought to avoid this difficulty by defining the commercial secret in wider terms.  The secret comprised photographic information about the entire wedding as an event, and not just the particular wedding photographs OK was permitted to publish.  Publication of the approved photographs did not destroy the confidentiality of the remainder of the information.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;259.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assume, without deciding, that this generic class of information was confidential at the outset.  Even so, this formulation of the commercial secret leads nowhere, for the same reason as applies to the narrower formulation of the secret: the unapproved pictures contained nothing not included in the approved pictures, and the approved photographs were published at much the same time as the unapproved photographs.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;260.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons I am unable to accept OK's claim based on confidentiality.</p>
<i></i><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlawful interference with business</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;261.&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn finally to OK's claim based on the tort of intentionally causing loss by unlawful means.  This is a 'two party' situation. There is no question of Hello injuring OK through an intermediary. Thus the first question is whether the harm caused to OK by Hello's publication of the unapproved photographs was effected by unlawful means. In my view this claim fails at this point. I have rejected OK's claim based on breach of confidence. The only other conduct which may constitute unlawful means is Rupert Thorpe's trespass at the wedding. But he was not Hello's agent.  The background was that Hello's bid of £1 million for the exclusive right to the wedding photographs was rejected by the Douglases.  Thereafter, before the wedding, Hello indicated to paparazzi that it would pay well for photographs.  Hello knew the reputation of the paparazzi for being able to intrude.  By its actions Hello was encouraging the paparazzi to do just that.  The six photographs themselves plainly indicated they were taken covertly.  'Yet', the judge said, 'these defendants firmly kept their eyes shut lest they might see what they undeniably knew would have become apparent to them'. Even so, I do not see how Hello can be held liable for the photographer's trespass. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;262.&nbsp;&nbsp;This being so, OK's case does not get off the ground. Hello did not use unlawful means. I would dismiss this appeal.</p>
LORD WALKER OF GESTINGTHORPE
<p>My Lords,</p>
<i><p><i></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i>The economic torts</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;263.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the privilege of reading in draft the opinions of my noble and learned friends Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead and Lord Hoffmann, both of which cast welcome light on the obscurities of the so-called economic torts.  In relation to these torts there is (as I see it) a large measure of agreement between my noble and learned friends, though with some differences in emphasis, and some more substantial differences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;264.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both my noble and learned friends agree that the "unified theory" of the economic torts, attractive though it is, must be rejected.  The tort of intentionally inducing a breach of contract is essentially different from inflicting harm by unlawful means, although in some factual situations they may overlap.  The majority decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Millar v Bassey</i> [1994]  EMLR 44 was mistaken.  The decision of this House in <i>Merkur Island Shipping Corporation v Laughton </i> [1983]  AC 570  should not be followed, so far as it holds that inducing an actual breach of contract is not a necessary ingredient of the <i>Lumley v Gye</i> tort (<i>Lumley v Gye</i> (1853)  2 E&amp;B 216).  On these points Lord Nicholls and Lord Hoffmann are at one, and I respectfully concur in their reasoning and conclusions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;265.&nbsp;&nbsp;I must however set out briefly my views on those points on the economic torts on which my noble and learned friends seem to differ; and on the tort of conversion, on which they certainly differ.  I must also set out the reasons why, in respectful disagreement with the majority, I would for my part dismiss the appeal in <i>Douglas v Hello! Ltd</i>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;266.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the economic torts, the most important difference is in the identification of the control mechanism needed in order to stop the notion of unlawful means getting out of hand—for example, a pizza delivery business which obtains more business, to the detriment of its competitors, because its drivers regularly exceed the speed limit and jump red lights.  Lord Hoffmann sees the rationale of the unlawful means tort as encapsulated in Lord Lindley's reference (in <i>Quinn v Leatham</i> [1901] AC 495, 535) to interference with "a person's liberty or right to deal with others."  In his view acts against a third party count as unlawful means only if they are (or would be if they caused loss) actionable at the suit of the third party.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;267.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Hoffmann does not question the correctness of the decisions of the Court of Appeal in <i>RCA Corporation v Pollard</i> [1983]  Ch 135 or of Jacob J in <i>Isaac Roen v Red Box Toy Factory Ltd</i> [1999]  FSR 785, which show that a bootlegger's activities, although actionable by the owner of the intellectual property rights in question, are not actionable (by statute or at common law) by a contractual licensee entitled to exploit those rights, even if the licensee's profits are demonstrably reduced by the unlawful activities.  As Oliver LJ said in <i>RCA Corporation v Pollard</i> [1983]  Ch 135, 153, </p>
<p></p><ul>"the defendant's conduct involves no interference with the contractual relationships of the plaintiffs but merely potentially reduces the profits which they make as the result of the performance by Mr Presley's executors of their contractual obligations."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;268.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Nicholls also accepts the correctness of <i>Isaac Oren v Red Box Toy Factory Ltd</i> (and also, I infer, the correctness of <i>RCA Corporation v Pollard</i>).  He proposes a wider test of unlawful means relying on the notion of instrumentality as the appropriate control mechanism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;269.&nbsp;&nbsp;Faced with these alternative views I am naturally hesitant.  I would respectfully suggest that neither is likely to be the last word on this difficult and important area of the law.  The test of instrumentality does not fit happily with cases like <i>RCA Corporation v Pollard,</i> since there is no doubt that the bootlegger's acts were the direct cause of the plaintiff's economic loss.  The control mechanism must be found, it seems to me, in the nature of the disruption caused, as between the third party and the claimant, by the defendant's wrong (and not in the closeness of the causal connection between the defendant's wrong and the claimant's loss). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;270.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not, for my part, see Lord Hoffmann's proposed test as a narrow or rigid one.  On the contrary, that test (set out in para 51 of his opinion) of whether the defendant's wrong interferes with the freedom of a third party to deal with the claimant, if taken out of context, might be regarded as so flexible as to be of limited utility.  But in practice it does not lack context.  The authorities demonstrate its application in relation to a wide variety of economic relationships.  I would favour a fairly cautious incremental approach to its extension to any category not found in the existing authorities.</p>
<i><p><i>Conversion</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;271.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Nicholls makes a powerful case for extending the tort of conversion so as to cover the appropriation of choses in action.  But in my opinion his proposals would involve too drastic a reshaping of this area of the law of tort.  The reshaping would be inconsistent with the basis on which Parliament enacted the Torts (Interference with Goods) Act 1977, after long consideration by the Law Revision Committee.  It would have far-reaching consequences which this House is not in a position to explore or assess fully.  This is an area in which reform must come from Parliament, after further consideration by the Law Commission.  In any case the confused facts of the <i>OBG</i> appeal (in which the liquidators eventually concurred in the settlement with NWW) makes it a singularly unsuitable case for a major change in the law.</p>
<i></i><p><i><i>Privacy and confidence: Introduction</i></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;272.&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to breach of confidence. This House has quite recently reaffirmed that English law knows no common law tort of invasion of privacy: <i>Wainwright v Home Office</i> [2004] 2 AC 406.  But the law of confidentiality has been, and is being developed in such a way as to protect private information.  The process of development is referred to in the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann in <i>Wainwright v Home Office</i> [2004]  2 AC 406, paras 28 to 30 and in all the speeches in <i>Campbell v MGN Ltd</i> [2004]  2 AC 457 (Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead at paras 11-22, Lord Hoffmann at paras 43-52, Lord Hope of Craighead at paras 85-86 and 105-113, Baroness Hale of Richmond at paras 132-141 and Lord Carswell at paras 166-167).  The most important single step in the course of the law's recent development has been the speech of Lord Goff of Chieveley in <i>Attorney-General v Guardian Newspapers Ltd (No 2)</i> [1990] 1 AC 109, 280 (his speech was not in terms concurred in by the other members of the Appellate Committee but Lord Goff's exposition of the law has commanded general acceptance).  In an important passage at pp281-282 Lord Goff stated a broad general principle of confidence subject to three limiting principles:  (1) "the principle of confidentiality only applies to information to the extent that it is confidential;" (2) "it applies neither to useless information, nor to trivia;" and (3) the public interest protecting confidence "may be outweighed by some other countervailing public interest which favours disclosure." (It was on the application of this third principle to a borderline factual situation that this House was divided in <i>Campbell v MGN Ltd</i>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;273.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first issue in this appeal raises questions as to whether and how far the law of confidence should be developed further.  The most important of these questions, to my mind, are (i) whether claimants can simultaneously assert rights of confidence for the protection of both personal privacy and short-term commercial secrecy (until profitable publication in the mass media of an "exclusive" which waives personal privacy on a selective basis); and (ii) what special rules apply to the publication of photographs of individual claimants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;274.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unnecessary, by way of introduction, to go again over the ground covered in <i>Wainwright v Home Office</i> and <i>Campbell v MGN Ltd.</i>  But it is perhaps worth noting that there is not a complete jurisprudential void between <i>Prince Albert v Strange</i> (1849) 2 De G &amp; Sm 652 and the cases which can be seen as the beginning of the modern line of authority (<i>Duchess of Argyle v Duke of Argyle</i> [1967] Ch 302, <i>Coco v Clark (Engineers) Ltd</i> [1969] RPC 41 and <i>Fraser v Evans</i> [1969]  1 QB 349).  The cases cited in the three last-mentioned decisions show a continuous, if hardly abundant, stream of authority.  <i>Philip v Pennell</i> [1907] 2 Ch 577 is of some interest as it shows the court addressing the distinction between intellectual property rights in the form of a communication and confidentiality in its substance.  It was concerned with letters written by James M'Neill Whistler (who had died in 1903).  The letters were lawfully in the hands of two authors who had been commissioned to write a biography of Whistler, but his executrix applied for an injunction to restrain both publication of the letters and dissemination of information contained in them.  The judgment of Kekewich J harked back to the great controversy as to whether at common law there was any copyright in published works (see <i>Millar v Taylor</i> (1769)  4 Burr 2303, which, with its background and sequels, is well described in Laddie, Prescott and<i> </i>Vitoria, The Modern Law of Copyright and Designs, 3rd ed (2000) paras 3.2-3.7).  Kekewich J rightly distinguished between property in the letters as tangible property; copyright in the linguistic contents of the letters as literary compositions; and the more debatable right to restrain misuse of confidential information contained in the letters.  On the last point he remarked (at p587):</p>
<p></p><ul>"It cannot be said that the confidence runs with the letters."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;275.&nbsp;&nbsp;That observation still holds good in that information, even if it is confidential, cannot properly be regarded as a form of property.  Its practical significance has been overtaken by <i>Attorney-General v Guardian Newspapers Ltd (No 2).</i>  Kekewich J's judgment is also of interest as an early recognition, or at least a hint, that a celebrity's private life may be a saleable commodity (at p589):</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is a recognised duty of every man, and more especially of a successful man in any profession, to make his life and experience useful to others, and it would be inconsistent with this to hold that a writer of letters must be presumed to have intended that those letters should not be used at some time or other, on a proper occasion and in a proper manner, towards that end."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be compared with Sedley LJ's view (expressed in the present case when the Court of Appeal gave its reasons for discharging the injunction, [2001] QB 967, para 140) that Mr Douglas and his bride</p>
<p></p><ul>"had sold most of the privacy which they now seek to protect to [OK!] for a handsome sum."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I start with some sympathy for what I take to be Sedley LJ's instinctive feeling that it is not obvious why a claimant should be able to invoke the law's protection for the confidentiality of his or her private life (this claim being based on the high principle of respect for human autonomy and dignity) and also to invoke its protection for the commercial confidentiality of the same or similar material, as a trade secret, until it is to be disclosed for profit at a time of his or her own choosing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;276.&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to investigate that problem it is necessary to enquire more closely into what is happening, in legal terms, when a court makes an order for the protection of confidential information.  If the person disclosing the information is in contractual relations with the claimant, the most natural claim will be for breach of an express or implied term in the contract.  That was the basis for the decision in <i>Pollard v Photographic Co</i> (1888)  40 Ch D 345 (the case of the commercial photographer who was commissioned to take photographs of the Pollard family, and started selling prints of Mrs Pollard as a Christmas card).  Where there is no contractual tie the cause of action is the equitable jurisdiction to restrain (or if it cannot be restrained, to award compensation or an account of profits for) breach of confidence.  This jurisdiction does not depend on treating confidential information as property, although it is often referred to, loosely or metaphorically, in those terms.  Professor Finn (as he then was) has written (Fiduciary Obligations (1977) para 293):</p>
<p></p><ul>"Perhaps the most sterile of the debates which have arisen around the subject of information received in confidence is whether or not such information should be classified as property."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a valuable discussion of the whole topic in Toulson &amp; Phipps, Confidentiality (1996) paras 2-12 to 2-18.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;277.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before your Lordships, Mr Millett QC (for the appellant OK!) strongly disclaimed any reliance on confidential information as property, referring to the speech of Lord Upjohn in <i>Phipps v Boardman</i> [1967]  2 AC 46, 127-128, as well as to Toulson &amp; Phipps.  He did so advisedly, since although clause 2 of the contract between the Douglases and OK! was expressed as a transfer of exclusive rights to publish (and licence republication of) approved photographs, that way of putting his case (if otherwise sound) would not catch the publication of different, pirated photographs.  Mr Millett relied instead on pictorial information about the wedding as an abstract, generic concept in which the Douglases enjoyed rights of confidentiality, and in which OK! became entitled, by contract rather than by assignment, to concurrent rights of confidentiality.  This approach was noted (but not accepted) by the Court of Appeal in this case, [2006] QB 125, para 138:</p>
<p></p><ul>"If we are wrong in our conclusions that OK! had no right of commercial confidence in the information portrayed by Hello!'s photographs, this can only be on the basis that the photographs published by Hello! fell within the generic class of commercially confidential information to which OK! were party and which OK! were entitled to protect."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;278.&nbsp;&nbsp;The authorised photographs taken at the wedding (and later selected and approved by Mr and Mrs Douglas) gave a lot of information, so far as still photographs could, about the event: what the bride wore, how she and the groom conducted themselves towards each other, what the wedding cake looked like, and so on.  The unauthorised photographs disclosed the same sort of information (aptly summed up by Sedley LJ, [2001] QB 967 at para 328, as "the simple information: 'this is what the wedding and the happy couple looked like'").  They disclosed it in a different and by most standards obviously inferior manner (though the informality of the unposed and sometimes unfocused images has a certain appeal).  Mr and Mrs Douglas would have been most unlikely to have selected any of the unauthorised pictures for publication, but it has not been suggested that they disclosed anything embarrassing (such as a fleeting moment of disharmony between the happy couple).  The information which they impart is, on the way Mr Millett put his case, essentially the same, and entitled to protection as confidential information.</p>

<p><i>The judgments below</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;279.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four sets of reported judgments in the case: the reasons of the Court of Appeal (Brooke, Sedley and Keene LJJ), given on 21 December 2000 [2001] QB 967, for lifting the injunction by its order of 23 November 2000; the judgment of Lindsay J on liability given on 11 April 2003 and reported as <i>Douglas v Hello! Ltd (No. 5)</i> [2003]  3 All ER 996;  the judgment of Lindsay J on quantum, given on 31 July 2003 and reported as <i>Douglas v Hello! Ltd (No. 6)</i> [2004] EMLR 2; and the judgment of the Court of Appeal (Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, Clarke and Neuberger LJJ) now under appeal, given on 18 May 2005 and reported as <i>Douglas v Hello! Ltd (No. 3)</i> [2006] QB 125.  I need not comment on Lindsay J's judgment on quantum, but the other judgments call for mention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;280.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first decision of the Court of Appeal was interlocutory in nature and (as Brooke LJ noted in para 62 of his judgment) it was reached after oral submissions prepared and made under severe time constraints.  It is therefore not surprising that this Court of Appeal decision concentrated on the alleged invasion of the privacy of the individual claimants as the claim for which an award of damages was least likely to be an adequate remedy.  Nevertheless all three members of the Court noted that the wedding was not an ordinary private occasion.  Brooke LJ stated (para 95):</p>
<p></p><ul>"So far as privacy is concerned, the case of the first and second claimants is not a particularly strong one.  They did not choose to have a private wedding, attended by a few members of their families and a few friends, in the normal sense of the words 'private wedding'.  There is nothing in the Court's papers to belie the suggestion at p88 of the disputed issue 639 of 'Hello!' that they invited 250 guests, and the trappings of privacy in this context are identical with the trappings of confidentiality to which I have alluded earlier in this judgment."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already set out what Sedley LJ said at para 140 (he developed the point in paras 141 and 142).  Keene LJ observed (para 169):</p>
<p></p><ul>"In the present case, it is of considerable relevance that very widespread publicity was to be given in any event to the wedding very soon afterwards by way of photographs in 'OK!' magazine.  The occasion thereby lost much of its private nature.  The claimants were by their security measures and by their agreements with the service companies seeking not so much to protect the privacy of the first two claimants but rather to control the form of publicity which ensued."<p></p></ul>
