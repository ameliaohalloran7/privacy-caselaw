<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79.&nbsp;&nbsp;If that were not enough, the integrity of the criminal justice system requires that it make sense to victims and the general public as well as to the accused. How can it possibly be explained to the victim in this case that her abuser can be prosecuted for the oral sexual intercourse but not for the vaginal? Women vary in whether they see oral or vaginal intercourse as more serious and in their degrees of reluctance to comply with either. How can it be explained that he can be prosecuted for any peripheral and preparatory sexual acts but not for those which were part and parcel of committing or attempting to commit the act of vaginal intercourse? And if he is prosecuted for those other acts, will the fact that they also had vaginal sexual intercourse be considered relevant or will it have to be kept from the jury? Mr Meeke was careful not to offer us an answer to this question. This sort of irrational and incoherent distinction is exactly what brings the legal system into disrepute.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, what are the countervailing considerations of justice to the offender? The offender knows perfectly well that he is committing a criminal offence at the time when he commits it. A time limit is not an essential ingredient of the substantive offence or a substantive defence. It is in no way comparable to the requirement of mens rea, as held by this House in <i>R v K </i>[2001] UKHL 41; [2002] 1 AC 462. It is a procedural bar which brings a fortuitous advantage to a defendant, even if there is a good reason for it. Sometimes the advantage is particularly undeserved. We do not know why this complainant said nothing until she was 17, but sexual abusers commonly groom their victims by making them believe that their behaviour is normal. They make their victims fall in love with them. They often threaten or cajole their victims into silence. Delayed reporting is then the result of the abuser's own actions and merits no special protection. It is only when the delay has prejudiced the chances of a fair trial that special protection is deserved. That is not this case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the countervailing considerations of policy and justice did not require the trial judge to stay the proceedings as an abuse of process and he was entirely justified in refusing to do so. The public conscience would be more affronted by the prohibition of prosecution for offences which have undoubtedly been committed. Although the categories of abuse of process cannot be closed, it would be a misuse of principle and language to call what happened in this case an abuse.</p>
<i></i><p><i>Statutory construction </i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, although not an abuse, the prosecution has been able to side-step a limitation which remained on the statute book at the material time. The fact that many now think that it should not be there, and that Parliament has since legislated to remove it, is neither here nor there if the statute must be construed so as to give it effect in this case. The normal process of statutory construction involves ascertaining the intention of Parliament from the words used. Two possible constructions of the words used might have been argued in this case although neither was.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is that the time bar applied to the offence of unlawful sexual intercourse under section 6(1) by paragraph 10 of Schedule 2 was also intended to apply to the offence of indecent assault under section 14. This cannot be so. There are many offences of indecent assault to which any supposed rationale for this time bar cannot possibly apply - forcible oral intercourse being a good example.  If Parliament had wanted to apply the time limit to indecent assault, it has had ample opportunity so to do, most notably in 1922 when it was legislating for both offences at the same time. There is absolutely nothing in the Schedule to suggest that the express words in paragraph 10 should be read by implication into paragraph 17 where they do not appear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is to suggest that the offence of indecent assault does not include the indecent touching involved in vaginal sexual intercourse. This too is quite untenable. Vaginal sexual intercourse is rarely if ever the sort of passive invitation involved in the cases of <i>Fairclough v Whipp</i> [1951] 2 All ER 834 and <i>DPP v Rogers</i> [1953] 1 WLR 1017 which necessitated the Indecency with Children Act 1960. It was decided in <i>R v McCormack</i> [1969] 2 QB 442 that a charge of unlawful sexual intercourse necessarily included an allegation of indecent assault; it was also decided in that case that penetration of the vagina with something other than a penis is an indecent assault unless done with valid consent, even if there was no evidence of compulsion or hostility. Penetration of other orifices with a penis is either an indecent assault or buggery.  No rational distinction can be drawn between the different sorts of penetration for this purpose. There is nothing in the words "indecently assaults" to suggest that it should be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way in which this argument can be put is not at the level of the language used by Parliament in defining the individual offences but at the general level of underlying intention: when Parliament enacted a general offence which was capable of covering conduct included in a more specific offence it did not intend that the general offence could be prosecuted in circumstances where the more specific one could not. There are several difficulties with applying this principle in this case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is that there is no rational coherence in the statutory scheme which makes it necessary to draw such a conclusion. It has developed piecemeal over time, sometimes by Parliamentary amendment and sometimes by statutory interpretation. Perhaps Parliament did not foresee either in 1922 or in 1956 that an indecent assault might include a consensual act without compulsion or hostility: see <i>R v McCormack</i> [1969] 2 QB 442. Perhaps it did not address its mind to exactly what was meant by sexual intercourse: the definition in section 44 of the 1956 Act makes it clear that penetration but not emission of seed is required but does not say which orifice is to be penetrated: the reference to sexual intercourse "whether natural or unnatural" might suggest that orifices other than the vagina were included. But if that were so, there should also have been an appeal against the conviction on count 4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second difficulty is that it is not possible, in the light of the Parliamentary history, to say which came first, the general or the particular. Indecent assault was enacted before the time-limited offence of unlawful sexual intercourse, but was extended to consensual activities with girls under 16 afterwards. Nor is it possible to say which, at whatever may have been the material time for ascertaining the Parliamentary intention, was regarded as the more serious offence. Throughout most of their combined history, they attracted the same maximum penalty of two years' imprisonment, but unlawful sexual intercourse was triable only on indictment whereas indecent assault could be tried summarily, no doubt because some of the behaviours covered were seen as less serious. Then in 1985, the maximum penalty for indecent assault upon a woman was raised to 10 years. This was mainly to bring it into line with the penalty for indecent assault upon a man, but also in recognition of the fact that some of the behaviours included were indeed serious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88.&nbsp;&nbsp;The third difficulty (which weighed with Deane and Dawson JJ, the dissenters in <i>Saraswati  v The Queen</i> (1991) 172 CLR 1 in the High Court of Australia) is that there are many situations in which the general and the more specific offences are not mutually exclusive. The fact that the more specific cannot be charged does not necessarily preclude a charge of the more general: the fact, for example, that a boy under 14 was presumed at common law to be incapable of the act of intercourse and therefore could not be charged with rape did not preclude his being charged with indecent assault based on the same conduct. The fact that the same conduct may amount to a summary offence which can only be prosecuted within six months and a more serious offence for which there is no time limit does not preclude the bringing of the more serious charge. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89.&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the 1956 Act was a mess when it was enacted and became an ever greater mess with later amendments. It is not possible to discern within it such a coherent Parliamentary intention as to require it to be construed so as to forbid prosecution for a "mere" act of sexual intercourse after 12 months where that act properly falls within the definition of an indecent assault. Although we do have to try to make sense of the words Parliament has used, we do not have to supply Parliament with the thinking that it never did and words that it never used.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultra vires</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90.&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully accept that there are certain things which are outside the competence of prosecutors as public officials to do. The difficulty is in formulating a reliable principle which would forbid a prosecution which was neither an abuse of the criminal justice process nor contrary to the implied intention of Parliament. The rationale behind the time limit can no longer be that which it was said to be in <i>R v Blight </i>22 NZLR 837. If it is that the defendant can no longer have a fair trial, I would certainly agree that such prosecutions should be stayed either as an abuse of process or as outside the prosecutor's competence to bring. If it is, as was suggested by the Criminal Law Revision Committee when it recommended retention of the time limit in its 15th report in 1984, that people should not be prosecuted for offences which were "stale",  it is unclear what this means in a case where a fair trial is still possible. If it means that something which was once a matter deserving of punishment is no longer so because of the passage of time, then this will not invariably be so. At one extreme will be the teenage romance between a boy and a girl who have since gone their separate ways, where no possible personal or public interest would be served by prosecution. At the other will be prolonged and serious abuse of a position of trust by a person who might well be left to do it again unless action is taken. It will all depend upon the circumstances, in which the interests of the accused, the victim and of society will all play their part. A just and humane prosecution policy should be capable of taking all these factors into account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I cannot see any balance of those interests in this case which would lead to the conclusion that this prosecution should not have been brought. I would dismiss this appeal.</p>
