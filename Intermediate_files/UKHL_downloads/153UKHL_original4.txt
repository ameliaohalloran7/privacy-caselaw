<p align="right"><a href="countr-3.htm">(back to preceding text)</a></p>

<p class="para">68.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first question that the EC claimants ask to be referred is whether a national measure prohibiting the economic activity of hunting within the territory of a Member State engages the application of article 28 EC in circumstances where the prohibition has the predictable effect of extinguishing or diminishing the market for a product used wholly or mainly for that activity and thereby eliminates or reduces both cross-border and domestic trade in that product. I agree that it is not clear beyond the bounds of reasonable argument that the 2004 Act does not engage that article. The only basis on which it was said by the Court of Appeal not to be applicable was that Joined Cases C-267/91 and 268/91 <i>Keck and Mithouard</i> [1993] ECR I-6097 consciously made a new start in the application of the <i>Dassonville </i>principle (Case 8/74 <i>Procureur du Roi v Benoît and Gustave Dassonville </i>[1974] ECR 837) in the case of rules that were not “aimed at” products from other member states: [2007] QB 305, para 144. According to that principle, although the measure may not be intended to govern trade in goods between Member States, the decisive factor is its effect on intra-Community trade, whether actual or potential. It is true that in <i>Keck</i>, para 14, the European Court of Justice said that it was necessary to re-examine and clarify its case law on this matter. This was because of the increasing tendency of traders to invoke what is now article 28 EC as a means of challenging any rules whose effect was to limit their commercial freedom “even where such rules are not aimed at products from other Member States.” But the Court’s case law after <i>Keck </i>has limited its application to “selling arrangements” in the narrow sense of that expression - such as the places and times at which products may be sold and the way in which they may be advertised for sale and marketed: eg Case C-71/02 <i>Herbert Karner Industrie-Auktionen GmbH v Troostwijk GmbH </i>[2004] ECR I-3025, para 38; Joined Cases C-158/04 and 159/04, the <i>Alfa Vita Vassilopoulos AE and Carrefour Marinopoulos AE </i>case, 14 September 2006, para 17, 18. I think that it is clear from these developments that the <i>Keck </i>exception does not apply in this case because the ban on hunting is not of that character.  </p>
<p class="para">69.&nbsp;&nbsp;But that is not an end of the matter. The ban is non-discriminatory. It affects domestic goods used for or in connection with hunting just as much as it affects foreign products that are used for or in connection with these purposes - horses bred in Ireland for sale to customers in England, for example. Nor would it be realistic to say that this is a disguised restriction on trade between Member States within the meaning of the article: Joined Cases C-1/90 and C-176/90 <i>Aragonesa de Publicidad Exterior SA and Publivía SAE v Departamento de Sanidad y Seguridad Social de la Generalitat de Cataluña </i>[1991] ECR I-4151, para 25. There is nothing either in the terms of the Act or any part of its legislative history that indicates that protectionism of that kind was to even the slightest degree in the minds of the legislators. These facts suggest non-applicability. But it is common ground that article 28 applies irrespective of whether the measure in question was intended to restrict or regulate trade between Member States. Can it be said then that, although discrimination on grounds of nationality was not the aim, article 28 is engaged because the legislation prevents or substantially restricts access to the English market by Irish breeders and dealers and restricts access to Irish products by English purchasers?  </p>
<p class="para">70.&nbsp;&nbsp;Two recent opinions by the Advocate General in cases that still await judgment suggest that it is unclear what answer that the European Court would give to that question: Advocate General Léger in Case C-110/05 <i>Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic</i>, 5 October 2006, para 40; Advocate General Kokott in Case C-142/05 <i>_klagaren v Mickelsson</i>, 14 December 2006, paras 66-67. <i>Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic </i>was initially allocated to a chamber of three judges, but after the Advocate General had given his opinion it was re-allocated to the Grand Chamber which ordered on 7 March 2007 that an oral hearing should take place. Parties were invited to submit written pleadings on the question to what extent should national measures which govern the use of products - which is this case - be considered to be measures having equivalent effect to quantitative restrictions on imports within the meaning of article 28 EC. As matters stand, pending a decision by the Grand Chamber in that case, the issue cannot be regarded as <i>acte clair</i>.<i> </i></p>
<p class="para">71.&nbsp;&nbsp;The EC claimants also seek a preliminary reference on the question whether a national measure prohibiting the economic activity of hunting within the territory of a Member State engages article 49 in circumstances where as a predictable consequence of the prohibition providers of hunting-related services are prevented from providing such services and recipients of hunting-related services (whether established in that Member State or in other Member States) are prevented from receiving them. I think that the position is just as, if not more, unclear in the case of this article. It is common ground that there is no <i>Keck </i>exception in the case of services: see the opinions of Advocate General Stix-Hackl in Case C-36/02 <i>Omega Spielhallen-und Automatenaufstellungs-GmbH v Oberbürgermeisterin der Bundesstadt Bonn</i> [2004] ECR I-9609, para 36-37 and Advocate General Jacobs in Case C-405/98 <i>Konsumentombudsmannen (KO) v Gourmet International Products AB (GIP) </i>[2001] ECR I-1795, para 71. And it is clear too that discrimination, or an intention to discriminate, is not the test. In Case C-275/92 <i>Her Majesty’s Customs and Excise v Gerhart Schindler and Jörg Schindler </i>[1994] ECR I-1039, para 43 the Court said that according to its case law national legislation may fall within the ambit of what is now article 49 EC “even if it is applicable without distinction” when it is liable to prohibit or otherwise impede the activities of a provider of services in another Member State where he lawfully provides similar services. The <i>Omega </i>case and Case C-60/00<i> Mary Carpenter v Secretary of State for the Home Department </i>[2002] ECR I-6279 provide examples of cases where a non-discriminatory impediment was held to engage article 49 EC.<i>  </i></p>
<p class="hditl">72.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal held that the hunting ban did not engage article 49 EC because it did not have a “direct inhibiting” effect on the rights to provide services: see Robert Walker LJ’s formulation of the test in R (Professional Contractors Group Ltd) v Inland Revenue Commissioners [2002] STC 165. What it did was to render the market for such services less attractive. But it is at least arguable that this is too severe a test. There are indications in the Court’s case law that all that is required is a foreseeable and logical link between the measure at issue and trade between Member States, something that is likely to deter free movement: opinion of Advocate General Cosmas in Case C-134/94 Esso Española SA v Comunidad Autónoma de Canarias [1995] ECR I-4223, para 19; Omega, para 25. So I do not think that the position can be said to be acte clair against these claimants. Nor is the jurisprudence sufficiently clear in its application to the facts of this case, where a measure which was not to the slightest degree meant to be discriminatory has had an effect on the provision of services between Member States which is so minimal, for it to be acte clair in their favour either.</p>
<p class="para">73.&nbsp;&nbsp;But no good purpose would be served by seeking a preliminary ruling on these matters if it was clear that we would be bound to hold, applying the relevant test, that any such restrictions as result from the ban imposed by the Act were justified on grounds of public policy under article 30 EC in the case of goods, and under article 46 EC read with article 55 EC in the case of services, respectively and were proportionate.  </p>
<p class="hditl">Justification and Proportionality</p>
<p class="para">74.&nbsp;&nbsp;These then are the crucial questions. Although there is a degree of overlap, it is best to examine the cases of the HR Claimants and the EC Claimants separately.</p>
<p class="para">75.&nbsp;&nbsp;I deal first with the case for the HR Claimants. The first paragraph of article 1 of Protocol 1 provides that no-one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law. The second provides that the preceding provisions shall not in any way impair the right of the State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest. Both deprivation and control are in issue in this case. It is not for your Lordships to say, as a matter of fact, whether the ban on hunting which has these effects was or was not in the public interest or the general interest. This was a question for the democratically elected members of the House of Commons to decide. The questions for your Lordships are whether it was open to them to take that view and whether the prohibitions that were enacted were proportionate.  </p>
<p class="para">76.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not find it possible to answer either of these questions in the negative. The legislators’ objective was based partly on the view that causing cruelty to animals was morally objectionable and partly on the view that the activities which they wished to prohibit did in fact cause cruelty. Whether there was a pressing social need to give effect to those views involved a question of balance between competing interests. This raises the familiar question as to where the margin lies between the area of the discretionary judgment that the court will accord to a democratically elected assembly in matters of social policy and those areas where the court can legitimately intervene on the ground that it is especially well placed to assess whether an interference is needed and is proportionate.  </p>
<p class="para">77.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was plainly a choice to be made between acutely competing interests - between those who wished to continue to participate in these activities and those who wished to prohibit them. They were wholly at odds as to whether there was a factual justification for the interference with the HR claimants’ article 1 protocol 1 Convention right. The claimants said that those in favour of the prohibition had failed to address the issue of relative suffering. It had not been shown that hunting for foxes with hounds was less humane than other methods of killing them. The respondents said that the justification was to be found in the objectives of reducing suffering, reducing instances of disorder associated with hunting and dealing with the criminality associated with hare coursing, and that the issue of relative suffering was not determinative.  </p>
<p class="para">78.&nbsp;&nbsp;If relative suffering had been the determinative issue, a close and careful examination of the factual basis for that decision would have been necessary to judge whether there was a sufficient justification for impairing the Convention right: <i>R v Shayler</i> [2003] 1 AC 247, para 61. But in my opinion it was not necessary for those who were promoting the legislation to deal with the issue in that way. It was open to them to focus on the nature of the activities without comparing them with others, bearing in mind that they were being engaged in for sport and recreation. It was open to them to form their own judgment as to whether they caused a sufficient degree of suffering in that context for legislative action to be taken to deal with them. Having decided that there was a sufficient degree of suffering in that context, it was open to them too to decide that prohibiting these activities in the manner laid down by the 2004 Act was proportionate. </p>
<p class="para">79.&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn then to the case for the EC Claimants, assuming for this purpose that the restrictions that are in issue engage articles 28 and 49 EC. It is well understood that measures which are liable to constitute restrictions on the free movement of goods or services may be justified if they pursue legitimate aims and they are proportionate to those aims. In his opinion in <i>Commission of the European Communities v Italian</i> <i>Republic</i>, paras 34-35, Advocate General Léger said that a national rule which hinders the free movement of goods is not necessarily contrary to Community law if it may be justified by one of the public interest grounds set out in article 30 EC, but that any derogation from the fundamental principle of the free movement of goods must be viewed restrictively. The qualifications in article 30 EC as to goods, and in article 46 EC read with article 55 EC as to services, both permit prohibitions or restrictions on grounds of public policy. But where this ground is relied on the national authorities must be able to demonstrate, first, that their rules are necessary in order to attain the public policy objective and, second, that those rules are proportionate to the aim. The test was laid down by the European Court in the <i>Omega </i>case, para 36, in these terms:</p>
<p class="qt">“…measures which restrict the freedom to provide services may be justified on public policy grounds only if they are necessary for the protection of the interests which they are intended to guarantee and only in so far as those objectives cannot be maintained by less restrictive measures.”     </p>
<p class="para">80.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first question which the national court must address is to identify the object that the 2004 Act was intended to achieve. The Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal both held that it was a composite one: to prevent or reduce unnecessary suffering to wild animals, overlaid by a moral viewpoint that causing suffering to animals for sport was unethical and should, so far as was practical and proportionate, be stopped: Divisional Court, para 339; Court of Appeal, para 56. The EC Claimants criticised both branches of the concurrent findings of fact which these courts made on this issue.</p>
<p class="para">81.&nbsp;&nbsp;The claimants submitted that, while preventing unnecessary suffering was a legitimate objective, the moral overlay had no basis in the statute. Moreover the nature of the overlay and its relationship with the objective of preventing unnecessary suffering was uncertain and unsatisfactory. The European Court had placed strict limits on the ability of governments to escape judicial review by asserting a moral justification for their laws. In Case C-145/88 <i>Torfaen Borough Council v B &amp; Q plc</i> [1989] ECR I-3851, para 29, Advocate General van Gerven had stressed that the Court must exercise some control over what was regarded by a Member State as falling within the concept of public morality. That there was such an overlay was highly questionable, as the terms of the Act showed clearly that it was not motivated by a general disapproval of killing animals for sport. It had gone out of its way to accommodate the practice of field sports such as shooting and falconry.   </p>
<p class="para">82.&nbsp;&nbsp;They submitted that these considerations gave rise to two questions of principle on which a preliminary ruling should be sought: (1) what, if any, limits apply to the right of a Member State to invoke public morality as an additional justification for a measure engaging the application of articles 28 and 49 EC, in circumstances where the primary justification is the prevention of unnecessary suffering to animals; and (2) where a national court considers a national measure to have a composite objective (preventing unnecessary suffering to animals and public morality), must the proportionality test be satisfied in relation to both parts of the objective, or may the measure be justified on the basis that it is proportionate to the second part of that composite objective only.           </p>
<p class="para">83.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would have been difficult to avoid a reference to the European Court for a preliminary ruling on these questions if it had been necessary to answer them in order to arrive at a decision in this case. But I do not think that it is necessary to descend to that detail of analysis in order to deal with what is really a quite straightforward issue. The findings of the courts below as to the legislative object of the 2004 Act which invited such detailed questions were, for the purpose of deciding this issue, unnecessarily elaborate. The Inner House in <i>Adams v Scottish Ministers</i> held that the broad legislative aim of the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002 (asp 6) was to prevent cruelty to animals: 2004 SC 665, paras 30-52. Mounted foxhunting with hounds was considered by the Scottish Parliament to be cruel, as killing foxes by this method was done predominantly for sporting enjoyment and because there were thought to be other more effective and no more painful forms of pest control. There are significant differences of detail between the two Acts, but in my opinion the prevention of cruelty to animals is equally sound as a description of what in essence the House of Commons was seeking to achieve when it passed the 2004 Act. Simplifying the aim in this way helps to answer the issues that the EC Claimants have raised.  </p>
<p class="para">84.&nbsp;&nbsp;To return to the <i>Torfaen </i>case, the Advocate General said that the public policy objection required the existence of a genuine and sufficiently serious threat to the requirements of public policy affecting one of the fundamental interests of society. The Court repeated this formulation of the principle in the <i>Omega </i>case, para 30. It also made the point that, as a justification for derogating from the fundamental principle of the freedom to provide services, the words “public policy” had to be interpreted strictly.  But it added these important qualifications in para 31:</p>
<p class="qt">“The fact remains, however, that the specific circumstances which may justify recourse to the concept of public policy may vary from one country to another and from one era to another. The competent national authorities must therefore be allowed a margin of discretion within the limits imposed by the Treaty.”</p>
<p class="para">In Case C-159/90 <i>Society for the Protection of Unborn Children Ireland Ltd v Grogan </i>[1991] ECR I-4685, para 26 Advocate General van Gerven referred to choices of a moral and philosophical nature the assessment of which fell within the sphere in which each Member State possesses an area of discretion “in accordance with its own scale of values and in the form selected by it": Case C - 121/85 <i>Conegate v H M Customs and Excise </i>[1986] ECR 1007, para 14. <i> </i></p>
<p class="para">85.&nbsp;&nbsp;The history of legislation in the United Kingdom for the prevention of cruelty to animals leaves no room for doubt that in this country, whatever may be the case elsewhere, the subject is deeply rooted in public policy. It has been for a long time regarded as one of the fundamental interests of society about which Parliament is expected, when the need arises, to legislate. So I see no need for a reference to the European Court on the additional questions about public morality which the EC Claimants have suggested to decide this issue. It was within Parliament’s margin of discretion to address the widespread concerns that had been raised about the hunting of foxes and the other sporting activities referred to in the 2004 Act and, if it judged that it was necessary to deal with these concerns by legislation, to proceed to do so “within the limits imposed by the Treaty". Whether the legislation was within those limits depends on whether the conditions of justification and proportionality are satisfied.</p>
<p class="para">86.&nbsp;&nbsp;The crucial question is whether it was open to the legislators to conclude that the activities that were to be prohibited by the 2004 Act were cruel if engaged in for sport. If it was, I do not see how it can be doubted that they were entitled to conclude that prohibition of those activities was necessary in order to prevent them from being carried on by those who wished to do so. For the reasons that I have already given in the case of the HR claimants, I consider that it was open to them to conclude that they gave rise to unnecessary suffering and that, if they were engaged in for sport, they were cruel. That is sufficient to meet the condition of justification. There remains the question whether the restrictions on free movement of goods and freedom to provide services were out of proportion to the aim sought by or the result brought about by the national rule: Advocate General van Gerven in<i> Society for the Protection of Unborn Children Ireland Ltd  v Grogan</i>, para 27. It is for the national court to rule on this issue within the limits of Community law: ibid, para 28.</p>
<p class="para">Various factors come into play at this point. Although it is common ground that the question whether there is a restriction within the meaning of the Treaty is not subject to the <i>de minimis </i>principle, the extent of the restriction has a part to play in the assessment of proportionality: Advocate General van Gerven in<i> Society for the Protection of Unborn Children Ireland Ltd  v Grogan</i>, para 29.87.&nbsp;&nbsp; So too is the fact that it is not discriminatory: Case C-275/92 <i>HM Customs and Excise v Schindler </i>[1994] ECR I-1039, para 61. There is no indication whatever that the restrictions that have been enacted in this case were aimed at intra-Community trade. They were aimed entirely at activities carried on within our own Member State, as a measure of social policy. Such interference as there has been and is likely to be with the free movement of goods and the free provision of services between other Member States is purely incidental. It is trivial in comparison with the widespread interference in these respects within the domestic market. It was not suggested that the legislative aim could have been achieved by measures which were less restrictive of intra-Community trade. Due weight must of course be given to the freedoms guaranteed by the Treaty. But I am in no doubt that, taken overall, the prohibitions satisfy the requirement of proportionality in accordance with Community law. </p>
<p class="para">88.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I would hold that a preliminary ruling on the question whether these measures engage article 28 and 49 EC and on the two further questions which have been proposed on the issues of justification and proportionality would serve no useful purpose in this case, and that a reference to the European Court is unnecessary.</p>
<p class="hditl">Conclusion</p>
<p class="para">89.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reasons given by Lord Bingham and by my noble and learned friend Baroness Hale of Richmond, and these additional reasons of my own, I would dismiss both appeals. </p>
<p class="lawlord">LORD RODGER OF EARLSFERRY</p>
<p class="mylords">My Lords,</p>
<p class="para">90.&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with your Lordships that these appeals should be dismissed. In particular, I agree with the reasons to be given by my noble and learned friend, Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood. I therefore confine myself to some additional observations on the application of article 8(1) - the point which seems to me to be of most general importance.</p>
<p class="para">91.&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly, the early decisions of the European Court on “private life” in article 8(1) tended to concern sexual and emotional relationships within an intimate circle - for which people want privacy. Article 8(1) guarantees a prima facie right to such privacy. If someone complains of a violation of that right, the essential touchstone may well be whether the person in question had a reasonable expectation of privacy: <i>Campbell v MGN Ltd </i>[2004] 2 AC 457, 466, para 21, per Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead.</p>
<p class="para">92.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the European Human Rights Commission long ago rejected any Anglo-Saxon notion that the right to respect for private life was to be equated with the right to privacy. In <i>X v Iceland </i>(1976) 5 DR 86 the applicant complained that a law prohibiting the keeping of dogs in Reykjavik violated his article 8(1) rights. The European Court held that the right to respect for private life did not end at a right to privacy, but comprised also, to a certain degree, the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings, especially in the emotional field, for the development and fulfilment of one’s own personality. Sadly, it did not extend to developing relationships with dogs and so the Commission rejected his application as inadmissible.</p>
<p class="para">93.&nbsp;&nbsp;It soon became clear that article 8 was not concerned merely to protect relationships in a narrow domestic field. In <i>Niemietz v Germany </i>(1992) 16 EHRR 97, 111, para 29, the Court held:</p>
<p class="qt">“it would be too restrictive to limit the notion to an ‘inner circle’ in which the individual may live his own personal life as he chooses and to exclude therefrom entirely the outside world not encompassed within that circle. Respect for private life must also comprise to a certain degree the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings.”</p>
<p class="para">So article 8(1) had been violated by a search of the office where the applicant pursued his profession as a lawyer, since “it is, after all, in the course of their working lives that the majority of people have a significant, if not the greatest, opportunity of developing relationships with the outside world.”</p>
<p class="para">94.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Pretty v United Kingdom </i>(2002) 35 EHRR 1, 35, para 61, the European Court pointed out that “private life” in article 8(1) is “a broad term". The Court also said that the notion of “personal autonomy” is an important principle underlying the interpretation of the various guarantees, including the right to “personal development", in that aspect of article 8(1).</p>
