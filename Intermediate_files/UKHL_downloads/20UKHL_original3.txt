<p class="para">54.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case it might be said that S&amp;R was not a business being carried on corruptly but rather that there was no business at all. Mr Stojevic, in the name of the company, was pretending to carry on a fictitious business. With false pretences and fabricated documents he was fraudulently inducing Komercni Bank and other banks to pay large sums to S&amp;R. It might be argued that the adverse interest rule, as formulated by Estey J in <i>Canadian Dredge &amp; Dock Co Ltd v The Queen</i>,<i> </i>applies, in that Mr Stojevic was, from the outset, acting pursuant to a criminal plan that was exclusively for his own benefit. Such an argument would, however, be fallacious. Mr Stojevic was using S&amp;R for his own dishonest purposes, but in a manner that resulted in substantial payments being made to S&amp;R. It has never been suggested that Mr Stojevic’s conduct did not fall to be attributed to S&amp;R so as to render S&amp;R liable in deceit. That S&amp;R was properly held liable is the basis of S&amp;R’s claim. The fraudulent business must be treated as the business of S&amp;R carried on, in the first instance, to benefit S&amp;R.</p>
<p class="para">55.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Brindle submits that the <i>Hampshire Land </i>principle applies so as to prevent attribution in this case. For the reasons that I have given I do not consider that that principle has any application. Nor does the adverse inference rule apply so as to prevent the attribution of Mr Stojevic’s fraudulent conduct to the company. Mr Brindle has not suggested that the banks are not to be treated as the primary victims of the fraud that Mr Stojevic has caused S&amp;R to commit. He submits, however, that the fraud should not be attributed to S&amp;R because it has come home to roost, making S&amp;R a secondary victim. Neither authority nor common sense supports this proposition. As Mr Sumption points out, a company that commits fraud is always liable to find itself a secondary victim in this way. Mr Brindle’s submission amounts, on analysis, to an argument that <i>ex turpi causa </i>should never prevent a company from recovering compensation for the consequences of fraud which those managing the company have caused it to commit. That submission falls to be considered in the context of the alternative way that Mr Brindle advances his case. </p>
<p class="para">56.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reasons that I have given I find that neither the <i>Hampshire Land </i>principle nor the adverse interest rule prevents the attribution of Mr Stojevic’s fraud to S&amp;R. </p>
<i><p class="para">The very thing</p></i>
<p class="para">57.&nbsp;&nbsp;This argument is founded upon the fact that Mr Sumption has conceded that Moore Stephens owed a duty of care to S&amp;R and that it is to be assumed for the purposes of the <i>ex turpi causa </i>issue that the duty of care has been broken. Mr Brindle’s argument is, in essence, that if a duty exists to take action that will prevent a claimant from committing an illegal act, the claimant must have a remedy for breach of that duty, otherwise the duty will be rendered nugatory. Mr Brindle relies on reasoning of Buxton LJ to this effect in <i>Reeves v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis </i>[1999] QB 169. The relevant issue under consideration was whether, on the premise that suicide was to be treated as illegal conduct, <i>ex turpi causa </i>would bar a claim against the police for negligently permitting a prisoner to commit suicide. In holding that it would not Buxton LJ observed at p. 185: </p>
<p class="qt">“Here, the alleged turpitudinous act is the very thing that the defendant had a duty to try to prevent, imposed by a law of negligence which itself appeals to public conscience or at least public notions of reasonableness”</p>
<p class="para">58.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Brindle’s argument is that fraud by S&amp;R was one of the very things that Moore Stephens owed a duty of care to prevent. It follows that <i>ex turpi causa</i> should not defeat a claim for breach of that duty. I propose, when approaching Mr Brindle’s alternative argument, to consider it initially in relation to a solvent company with independent and innocent shareholders which suffers damage because its directing mind and will involves it in fraud.</p>
<i><p class="para">Claim by the company against the directing will and mind</p></i>
<p class="para">59.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lord Scott and Lord Mance consider that a company must be able to bring a claim against a director who, in breach of duty, causes the company damage by involving it in fraud. I sympathise with their reaction. Imagine a group of investors who float a company to own and operate a yacht commercially. They engage a skipper to whom they entrust the management of the business. In breach of duty he charters the yacht to drug smugglers, with the consequence that the vessel is seized and confiscated. It would seem contrary to justice if the company could not bring an action against the skipper for misfeasance for the benefit of the shareholders. Why should the skipper be entitled to pray in aid the very thing that his breach of duty had brought about? On what principled basis can one avoid the application of <i>ex turpi causa </i>in such circumstances?</p>
<p class="para">60.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Mance considers that <i>Hampshire Land </i>can be pressed into service. For the reasons that I have given I do not agree. It makes no sense to say that the fraud should not be attributed to the company. The fact that fraud has been attributed to the company is the very thing about which the company is complaining. The company’s complaint is that its directing will and mind has infected it with turpitude. If <i>ex turpi causa </i>is not to apply in such circumstances, the reason should simply be that the public policy underlying it does not require its application.</p>
<p class="para">61.&nbsp;&nbsp; One can readily reach that conclusion where all the shareholders are innocent. Recovery from the directing mind and will does not result in any individual recovering compensation for his own wrong. The position becomes unclear, however, if some of the shareholders were complicit in the directing mind and will’s misconduct. Lord Mance states that in such circumstances some process designed to achieve the ends of justice would “without doubt” prevent the fraudulent shareholders from profiting from their dishonesty.  Lord Mance may well be right, but it is not apparent to me that the law provides a mechanism for achieving this. What would seem to be involved would be a lifting of the veil of incorporation in order to ensure that shareholders who were complicit in the illegal manner of operating the company would not be able to share in the recovery from the directing mind and will. This would, I believe, be without precedent. </p>
<p class="para">62.&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation becomes more complicated when one considers a claim against auditors, such as that with which this appeal is concerned, by a company that has independent shareholders. Here the argument is that auditors should not be entitled to pray in aid the very illegality that their breach of duty has permitted to occur. The same problem arises where some of the shareholders are complicit in the fraud being perpetrated on the banks by the directing mind and will. But more intractable is the problem of contributory negligence. The duty owed by the auditors to the company is a duty of care. It would not seem just for a company to make a full recovery of damages against auditors for the benefit of banks which have themselves negligently failed to carry out appropriate “due diligence” before advancing monies to the company. Mr Brindle recognised this, for he opened his case by submitting that any apparent unfairness in holding Moore Stephens liable to S&amp;R would be met by contribution under the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945. But it is not easy to see how the Act would apply. Moore Stephens’ liabilities would reflect S&amp;R’s liabilities to the banks and the damages paid by Moore Stephens would be paid, indirectly to the banks. Lack of care on the part of the banks in their dealings with S&amp;R ought to be taken into account for the purposes of contributory negligence. Yet such lack of care could not be prayed in aid by S&amp;R in answer to claims framed by the banks in deceit - <i>Standard Chartered Bank v Pakistan National Shipping Corpn (Nos 2 and 4) </i>[2002] UKHL 43; [2003] 1 AC 959. Nor is there any obvious mechanism by which such lack of care could be relied upon by Moore Stephens in answer to the claim brought by S&amp;R.</p>
<p class="para">63.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, I would not think it right to hold as a matter of general principle that <i>ex turpi causa</i> does not apply to a claim by a company against its auditors for failing to detect that the company has been operating fraudulently unless it were demonstrated how the difficulties to which I have referred could be resolved. There has been no such demonstration in this case. Thus I am not able to join Lord Scott and Lord Mance in concluding, for the reasons that they have given, that <i>ex turpi causa </i>does not apply to S&amp;R’s claim. At the same time, I have not been persuaded by Mr Sumption’s primary case that the reliance test, or the principle of public policy that underlies it, would necessarily defeat S&amp;R’s claim if S&amp;R were a company with independent shareholders that had been “high-jacked” by Mr Stojevic. In that, at least, I believe that I share common ground with all your Lordships. </p>
<i><p class="para">The significance of the fact that S&amp;R was a “one man company”</p></i>
<p class="para">64.&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn to consider Mr Sumption’s fall back position. This applies to what, by way of shorthand, is described as a “one man company", that is a company where the sole shareholder is also the person who runs the company or, if there is more than one shareholder, where the shareholders together run the company. Mr Sumption argued that where all who have ownership and control of a company are complicit in a fraud carried out by the company there is no room for the application of the <i>Hampshire Land </i>principle. In support of this argument he drew attention to United States jurisprudence that establishes a “sole actor” exception to the adverse interest rule.</p>
<p class="para">65.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Brown and Lord Walker have based their decision on Mr Sumption’s fall back position. Lord Walker identifies the reason for the <i>Hampshire Land </i>principle to be that it would be “unjust to its innocent participators (honest directors who were deceived, and shareholders who were cheated)” to fix a company with its directors’ fraudulent intention. Where there are no honest directors or shareholders there is “<i>ex hypothesi </i>no innocent participator". It follows that there is no room for the application of <i>Hampshire Land.</i></p>
<p class="para">66.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Scott and Lord Mance do not accept this analysis. They would include among the “innocent participators” the creditors of a company in circumstances where the company is insolvent or is threatened with insolvency. They postulate that the duty owed by auditors is owed for the benefit of these participators also, and that <i>ex turpi causa </i>should not defeat a claim brought for their benefit.</p>
<p class="para">67.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reasons that I have already given, I consider that the real issue is not whether the fraud should be attributed to the company but whether <i>ex turpi causa </i>should defeat the company’s claim for breach of the auditor’s duty. That in turn depends, or may depend, critically on whether the scope of the auditor’s duty extends to protecting those for whose benefit the claim is brought.</p>
<p class="para">68.&nbsp;&nbsp; One fundamental proposition appears to me to underlie the reasoning of Lord Walker and Lord Brown. It is that the duty owed by an auditor to a company is owed for the benefit of the interests of the shareholders of the company but not of the interests of its creditors. It seems to me that here lies the critical difference of opinion between Lord Walker and Lord Brown on the one hand and Lord Mance on the other. Lord Mance considers that the interests that the auditors of a company undertake to protect include the interests of the creditors.</p>
<p class="para">69.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was initially doubtful as to whether it would be right to decide this strike out application on the basis that the interests of creditors fall outside the scope of the duty of care that auditors owe to a company. I was concerned that such an approach was precluded by Mr Sumption’s concession of the existence both of a duty and, for the purposes of argument, a breach. In oral submission however, Mr Sumption made it plain that his concession in respect of the duty owed by Moore Stephens was a limited one.</p>
<p class="para">70.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sumption conceded that Moore Stephens owed a duty to S&amp;R to ensure, so far as reasonable care permitted, that S&amp;R’s accounts showed a true and fair view of its affairs. He conceded that, for the purpose of the strike out application, it should be assumed that Moore Stephens was in breach of this duty. He further conceded that, had they performed this duty, they would have discovered the fraud that was taking place. Finally he conceded that Moore Stephens would then have reported the fraud to the authorities, which would have brought S&amp;R’s operations to a halt. Thus, as a matter of causation, the assumed breach of duty resulted in the losses sustained by S&amp;R as a result of the continuing fraud. What Mr Sumption did not accept, however, was that reporting the fraud to the authorities formed any part of the duty owed to S&amp;R. </p>
<p class="para">71.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sumption submitted that the duty owed to a company by its auditors was exclusively for the benefit of its shareholders. No duty was owed to creditors. The duty of the auditors to exercise due care when reporting on the accounts enabled the shareholders to hold the management of a company to account. Accounting standards and duty to the public went beyond the auditor’s duty to the company. Indeed it overrode the duty of confidentiality that would otherwise be owed to the company. It was this public duty that might require an auditor to “shop” a company if there was reason to think that it was involved in crime.  Mr Sumption submitted that “against that background it is very difficult to see how the law can rationally hold an auditor liable when the entire shareholder body and the entire management is embodied in a single individual who knows everything because he has done everything".</p>
<p class="para">72.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Those submissions were largely founded on the decision of this House in <i>Caparo. </i>While the plaintiff in that case was a company, its primary claim was in its capacity as purchaser of the shares in a public company (“Fidelity”) of which the defendants were the statutory auditors. The claim was in the tort of negligence. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants had been negligent in auditing Fidelity in that they had approved accounts which, inter alia, overvalued the assets of the company. The plaintiff alleged that, foreseeably, reliance on the audited accounts had led it to pay an excessive amount for the shares of Fidelity in a successful take-over bid. The question of whether the defendants owed a duty of care to the plaintiff was tried as a preliminary issue. </p>
<p class="para">73.&nbsp;&nbsp;After lengthy consideration of authorities dealing with the duty of care in relation to negligent misstatements Lord Bridge of Harwich remarked at p. 623:</p>
<p class="qt">“These considerations amply justify the conclusion that auditors of a public company’s accounts owe no duty of care to members of the public at large who rely upon the accounts in deciding to buy shares in the company. If a duty of care were owed so widely, it is difficult to see any reason why it should not equally extend to all who rely on the accounts in relation to other dealings with a company as lenders or merchants extending credit to the company. A claim that such a duty was owed by auditors to a bank lending to a company was emphatically and convincingly rejected by Millett J. in <i>Al Saudi Banque v. Clarke Pixley</i>…” </p>
<p class="para">74.&nbsp;&nbsp;At p. 626, after considering the provisions in the Companies Act 1985 that relate to auditors, Lord Bridge added:</p>
<p class="qt">“No doubt these provisions establish a relationship between the auditors and the shareholders of a company on which the shareholder is entitled to rely for the protection of his interest. But the crucial question concerns the extent of the shareholder’s interest which the auditor has a duty to protect. The shareholders of a company have a collective interest in the company’s proper management and in so far as a negligent failure of the auditor to report accurately on the state of the company’s finances deprives the shareholders of the opportunity to exercise their powers in general meeting to call the directors to book and to ensure that errors in management are corrected, the shareholders ought to be entitled to a remedy. But in practice no problem arises in this regard since the interest of the shareholders in the proper management of the company’s affairs is indistinguishable from the interest of the company itself and any loss suffered by the shareholders, e.g. by the negligent failure of the auditor to discover and expose a misappropriation of funds by a director of the company, will be recouped by a claim against the auditors in the name of the company, not by individual shareholders. </p>
<p class="qt">I find it difficult to visualise a situation arising in the real world in which the individual shareholder could claim to have sustained a loss in respect of his existing shareholding referable to the negligence of the auditor which could not be recouped by the company.”    </p>
<p class="para">75.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Oliver of Aylmerton also gave detailed consideration to the role of auditors in the light of the relevant statutory provisions. The following passages from his opinion at pp. 630 and 631 are of particular relevance:</p>
<p class="qt">“It is the auditors’ function to ensure, so far as possible, that the financial information as to the company’s affairs prepared by the directors accurately reflects the company’s position in order, first, to protect the company itself from the consequences of undetected errors or, possibly, wrongdoing (by, for instance, declaring dividends out of capital) and, secondly, to provide shareholders with reliable intelligence for the purpose of enabling them to scrutinise the conduct of the company’s affairs and to exercise their collective powers to regard or control or remove those to whom that conduct has been confided….</p>
<p class="qt">Thus the history of the legislation is one of an increasing availability of information regarding the financial affairs of the company to those having an interest in its progress and stability. It cannot fairly be said that the purpose of making such information available is solely to assist those interested in attending general meetings of the company to an informed supervision and appraisal of the stewardship of the company’s directors, for the requirement to supply audited accounts to, for instance, preference shareholders having no right to vote at general meetings and to debenture holders cannot easily be attributed to any such purpose. Nevertheless, I do not, for my part, discern in the legislation any departure from what appears to me to be the original, central and primary purpose of these provisions, that is to say, the informed exercise by those interested in the property of the company, whether as proprietors of shares in the company or as the holders of rights secured by a debenture trust deed, of such powers as are vested in them by virtue of their respective proprietary interests.”</p>
<p class="para">76.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Lord Bridge and Lord Oliver cited with approval the decision of Millett J in <i>Al Saudi Banque v Clarke Pixley </i>[1990] Ch 313. That was an action brought in negligence against the auditors of a company by a number of banks. They alleged that they had relied upon favourable auditors’ reports, negligently given, in advancing money to the company. Some of the banks were already creditors of the company at the time that the reports were made. The question of whether the auditors owed a duty to the banks was tried as a preliminary issue. Millett J held that no duty was owed, relying in part on the reasoning of the majority in the Court of Appeal in <i>Caparo</i> [1989] QB 653<i>. </i>He held that the necessary proximity between the banks and the auditors was not established. He went on, however, to hold that it would not be just and reasonable to impose such a duty on the auditors. This was because breach of the duty would expose the auditors to liability for sums advanced by the banks to the company of an indeterminate amount, which would be unknown to the auditors and unforeseeable by them.</p>
<p class="para">77.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sumption also relied upon the decision of Hobhouse J. in <i>Berg, Sons &amp; Co Ltd v Mervyn Hampton Adams and Others </i>[2002] Lloyd’s Rep PN 41. The relevant claim in that case was brought by a company in liquidation (“Berg”) against its auditors (“Dearden Farrow”) for negligently failing to qualify the accounts of the company, as a consequence of which the company incurred further liabilities. The company had only one active director, a Mr Golechha, who was also the ultimate beneficial owner of all the shares in the company. At p. 44 Hobhouse J outlined the nature of Berg’s case:</p>
<p class="qt">“The essence of the claim made by the first Plaintiffs, Berg, against Dearden Farrow is that Mr Surrey ought not to have accepted the statements made, and the assurances given, to him by Mr Golechha. It is no part of the Plaintiffs’ case that Mr Golechha, nor any director or shareholder of Berg, was in any way misled by anything which Dearden Farrow said or did; nor is it alleged that Mr Golechha, or any member of the company, in any way relied upon anything Dearden Farrow said or did. It further is not alleged that Mr Golechha was not fully aware of all relevant facts and considerations. Under these circumstances, it will be appreciated that there are serious further difficulties in the way of formulating and substantiating the claim of Berg against the Defendants. The existence of a contractual duty to exercise proper skill and care in and about the audit owed by the Defendants to Berg is not in dispute. But whether, assuming that there has been some breach, there is on any view a right to recover anything more that nominal damages is very definitely in dispute. The Defendants submit that the first Plaintiffs’ claim is misconceived and cannot succeed even if some breach of contract is established.”  </p>
<p class="para">78.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hobhouse J considered the implications of the decision in <i>Caparo </i> on the duty of care owed by auditors and reached the following conclusion:</p>
<p class="qt">“It also follows that the purpose of the statutory audit is to provide a mechanism to enable those having a proprietary interest in the company or being concerned with its management or control to have access to accurate financial information about the company. Provided that those persons have that information, the statutory purpose is exhausted. What those persons do with the information is a matter for them and falls outside the scope of the statutory purpose. In the present case the first Plaintiffs have based their case not upon any lack of information on the part of Mr Golechha but rather upon the opportunity that the possession of the auditor’s certificate is said to have given for the company to continue to carry on business and to borrow money from third parties. Such matters do not fall within the scope of the duty of the statutory auditor.”</p>
<p class="para">79.&nbsp;&nbsp;At p. 53 Hobhouse J referred to an accurate statement of the <i>Hampshire Land </i>principle<i> </i>in <i>Bowstead on Agency</i> (15th edition, 1985), Art 102:</p>
<p class="qt">“Where an agent is party or privy to the commission of a fraud upon or misfeasance against his principal, his knowledge of such fraud or misfeasance, and of the facts and circumstances connected therewith, is not imputed to the principal.”</p>
<p class="para">He commented, at p 54:</p>
<p class="qt">“In the present case it has not been proved that there was any fraud by Mr Golechha in relation to the 1981 audit, still less that at that time Mr Golechha was practising any fraud upon his principal, Berg. There was no entity which it can be said he misled or in relation to which it can be said that he was acting fraudulently in relation to the audit in October 1982. However one identifies the company, whether it is the head management, or the company in general meeting, it was not misled and no fraud was practised upon it. This is a simple and unsurprising consequence of the fact that every physical manifestation of the company Berg was Mr Golechha himself. Any company must in the last resort, if it is to allege that it was fraudulently misled, be able to point to some natural person who was misled by the fraud. That the Plaintiffs cannot do.”</p>
<p class="para">80.&nbsp;&nbsp;This comment demonstrates that <i>Hampshire Land </i>had no application to the facts of that case, but it has wider implications. Taken with the other passages in the judgment to which I have referred, it supports Mr Sumption’s proposition that it is very difficult to see how the law can rationally hold an auditor liable when the entire shareholder body and the entire management is embodied in a single individual who knows everything because he has done everything. If that proposition is correct, it follows that any breach of duty on the part of Moore Stephens will not sound in damages because it has caused no loss. </p>
<p class="para">81.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had difficulty in this case in distinguishing between questions of duty, breach and actionable damage and, indeed, it is questionable whether it is sensible to attempt to distinguish between them. In <i>Caparo </i>at p. 627 Lord Bridge stated:</p>
<p class="qt">“It is never sufficient to ask simply whether A owes B a duty of care. It is always necessary to determine the scope of the duty by reference to the kind of damage from which A must take care to save B harmless. ‘The question is always whether the defendant was under a duty to avoid or prevent that damage, but the actual nature of the damage suffered is relevant to the existence and extent of any duty to avoid or prevent it:’ see <i>Sutherland Shire Council v. Heyman</i>, 60 A.L.R. 1, 48, <i>per</i> Brennan J. Assuming for the purpose of the argument that the relationship between the auditor of a company and individual shareholders is of sufficient proximity to give rise to a duty of care, I do not understand how the scope of that duty can possibly extend beyond the protection of any individual shareholder from losses in the value of the shares which he holds.” </p>
<p class="para">Lord Oliver made a similar comment at p. 651:</p>
<p class="qt">“It has to be borne in mind that the duty of care is inseparable from the damage which the plaintiff claims to have suffered from its breach. It is not a duty to take care in the abstract but a duty to avoid causing to the particular plaintiff damage of the particular kind which he has in fact sustained.” </p>
