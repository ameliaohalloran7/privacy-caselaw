<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99.&nbsp;&nbsp;This analysis by the Whole Court of the nature of the personal fee was critical to their decision.  Discussing the nature of the deed granted by Major George Skene in 1721, they held, at pp 943-944:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It was itself a substantive and <i>de praesenti</i> disposition to a certain disponee, and to a certain series of heirs of entail, with all the restrictions prescribed by that statute.  It was thus itself a habile entail.  It is true that Major Skene's right under that entail was still only such a personal fee as has been described, and that in order to render its conditions and restrictions real burdens upon the estate, three proceedings were still requisite."<p></p></ul>
<p>Similarly, describing the situation of Elizabeth Skene, who by her general service had taken the personal fee out of Major Skene's <i>haereditas jacens</i>, the court said, at p 947:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In virtue of that title she had all the powers and privileges of ownership arising from a personal fee as formerly mentioned, excepting in so far as these powers and privileges were restricted by the entail....  No doubt, while her right under the entail remained only personal, and the conditions in favour of the heirs of entail were not made real burdens upon the lands by her being infeft in them under these burdens, the rights of these subsequent heirs of entail were exposed to the risk of being defeated, in the manner already explained, - that is to say, by third parties obtaining themselves first infeft in the land, in virtue either of onerous and bona fide purchases from the heirs-at-law of the entailer, or of legal execution for payment of the onerous debts of such heirs, if these heirs should, in that character, have made up a feudal title to the lands.  But, subject to that risk, the personal fee was vested in Elizabeth Skene by the deed of entail itself, and her general service as heir of entail;  and a <i>jus crediti</i> was created in favour of the subsequent heirs of entail."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100.&nbsp;&nbsp;When after four days of argument your Lordships' House affirmed the decision of the Court of Session, (1863) 4 Macq 469, it was on the basis of that analysis.  For instance, Lord Westbury LC said, at p 487, that Major Skene's settlement remained effectual "as a disposition of the personal fee, although the parties entitled under it would be obliged to resort to some other mode of obtaining a feudal tradition of the subject."  He went on to say, at p 488, that, despite subsequent actings by Major Skene, the settlement "remained what it originally was, an actual immediate conveyance, giving right to, and capable of receiving, feudal investment, and consequently possessing the elements of a habile entail."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101.&nbsp;&nbsp;As the law stands today, the uninfeft proprietor is in much the same position as at the time of the decision of the Whole Court and of this House.  He has the right to possess the subjects and to reap the fruits, including taking the rents;  he has the power to sell the subjects and, by deducing title, to dispone them for either onerous or gratuitous causes.  When he dies, his right to the subjects forms part of his heritable, as opposed to his moveable, estate for purposes of legal rights:  Stair, <i>Institutions of the Law of Scotland </i>3.5.6;  Succession (Scotland) Act 1964, section 10(2);  cf Gloag and Henderson, <i>The Law of Scotland</i> (11th edition, 2001), para 36.07.  Subject to that Act, the uninfeft proprietor can bequeath the subjects in his will.  In addition under section 12 of the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1970 he can grant a standard security over the subjects.  In one very real sense, however, the position of the uninfeft proprietor has actually moved on since 1862 - and even more so since the eighteenth century when the deeds under consideration in the <i>Earl of Fife</i>'s case were executed.  Even in 1862 an uninfeft proprietor required the active involvement of the feudal superior if his infeftment was to become public, but since the Conveyancing (Scotland) Act 1874, once infeft, a disponee has been deemed to be entered automatically with his superior.  So an uninfeft proprietor has it in his own power to do everything necessary to become infeft and so to vest the real or feudal right in himself, simply by recording the disposition in the register.  If anything, therefore, the position of an uninfeft proprietor vis à vis the granter of the disposition has been strengthened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102.&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision of the Whole Court, as affirmed by this House, in the <i>Earl of Fife</i>'s case therefore constitutes the most authoritative possible licence for describing the holder of the personal fee, personal title or uncompleted title as an "owner" and his rights as "powers and privileges of ownership":  the execution and delivery of the disposition can be said to vest in him "most of the essential attributes of ownership".  The Whole Court and your Lordships' House would therefore have found little to quarrel in the well-known passage in Lord President Emslie's opinion in <i>Gibson v Hunter Home Designs Ltd (in liquidation)</i> 1976 SC 23, 27:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In the law of Scotland no right of property vests in a purchaser until there has been delivered to him the relevant disposition.  On delivery of the disposition the purchaser becomes vested in a personal right to the subjects in question and his acquisition of a real right to the subjects is dependent upon recording the disposition in the appropriate Register of Sasines.  Putting the matter in another way the seller of subjects under missives is not, in a question with the purchaser, divested of any part of his right of property in the subjects of sale until, in implement of his contractual obligation to do so, he delivers to the purchaser the appropriate disposition."<p></p></ul>
<p>In the distinguished company of Lord President M'Neill, Lord Justice Clerk Inglis and the other judges of the Court of Session - not to mention your Lordships' House - Lord President Emslie can scarcely be accused of unorthodoxy, far less of heresy.  Moreover, whatever criticisms might now be made of the language or reasoning in <i>Earl of Fife v Duff</i> would be pointless quibbles when the passage has stood for more than 150 years.  For present purposes, the case is useful as marking the high point in the authorities characterising uninfeft proprietors, like the appellants, as having the powers and privileges of owners.  Indeed, although Mr Hodge frequently referred to uninfeft proprietors, such as the appellants, as the "creditors" of the granter of the disposition, in reality there is nothing by way of positive action that they can or need demand of the granter.  All that they want, and can or need demand, is that the granter leave them alone and do nothing to prevent them completing their title.  Seen from the other side, in practice the only obligation of the granter is to leave them alone and do nothing to prevent them completing their title.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is important to notice that, however far the judges went in describing the uninfeft proprietor as an owner in <i>Earl of Fife v Duff</i>, what he had was a "personal fee", with the corresponding obligations on the disponer being personal obligations.  The personal fee had indeed the characteristics of a personal right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104.&nbsp;&nbsp;For one thing, the right was transferred by assignation - in due course under section 22 of the Titles to Land Consolidation (Scotland) Act 1868.  Even after section 3 of the Conveyancing (Scotland) Act 1924 made it possible for an uninfeft disponer to deduce title from the person last infeft, such assignations remained competent.  In practice, however, the convenience of the new system meant that they fell into desuetude after 1924.  They were eventually abolished by section 48 of the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1970.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105.&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, perhaps, the judges of the Whole Court in the <i>Earl of Fife</i>'s case quite specifically pointed out, 24 D 936, 942, that the uninfeft proprietor's personal fee was of no effect against third parties who might attach the estate by legal execution for the debts of the disponer, or who might in <i>bona fide</i> purchase it from him, and be first infeft.  For present purposes this means that the personal fee was held to be of no effect against adjudgers and <i>bona fide </i>purchasers who were first infeft.  That remains the position today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106.&nbsp;&nbsp;With this introduction, I can now turn to see how the law that applies to the present case has developed.</p>
<i><p>Section 31(1) of the 1985 Act</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107.&nbsp;&nbsp;In critical respects the language of section 31(1) of the 1985 Act repeats the language of earlier bankruptcy statutes.  Parliament first says that by virtue of the act and warrant the whole estate of the debtor vests in the permanent trustee.  The relevant picture is therefore not of the permanent trustee stepping into the shoes of the debtor, but of the debtor's estate being taken from her and placed in the hands of a completely different individual, the trustee for the debtor's creditors.  This suggests that, in so far as the debtor herself may be subject to personal obligations, those obligations do not affect this new person, the permanent trustee.  That is, of course, consistent with the general rule in sequestrations that the permanent trustee is not bound by contracts entered into by the debtor unless he expressly or impliedly adopts them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 31(1)(b) then explains precisely what is meant by the heritable estate vesting in this way.  The particular form of vesting was originally chosen to allay any alarm that applying sequestration to heritable estate would subvert the feudal principles of transmission, upon which the whole system of heritable conveyances was built:  Bell, <i>Commentaries on the Laws of Scotland </i>(5th edition, 1826), Vol 1, p 400.  The wording of the present provision is rather obscure but its interpretation is perhaps helped by noticing that it derives from the rather clearer words of section 23 of the Act of 1793 (33 Geo III, c 74):</p>
<p></p><ul>"which adjudication being of the nature of an adjudication in implement, as well as for payment or security of debt, shall be subject to no legal reversion."<p></p></ul>
<p>The model for vesting is based on adjudication which "is a judicial disposition to the subject":  Bankton, <i>Institute of the Laws of Scotland</i> 3.2.49.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the act and warrant from the sheriff has the same effect as if a decree of adjudication in implement of sale had been pronounced in favour of the permanent trustee.  Since an adjudication in implement is a way of obtaining specific implement of a seller's obligation to convey property, armed with his decree or judicial disposition, the trustee can proceed to infeft himself as owner - nowadays by recording a notice of title on the register, as the respondent did in this case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 31(1)(b) then says that the act and warrant has the same effect as if a decree of adjudication for payment and in security of debt, subject to no legal reversion, had been pronounced in favour of the permanent trustee.  Normally, an adjudger initially acquires only a right to the subjects which is redeemable within ten years on payment of the debt, but the effect of this part of section 31(1) is to confer "a right of absolute property in the trustee, for the benefit of the creditors, according to their rights and interests at the time":  <i>Mansfield v Walker's Trs </i>(1833) 11 S 813, 829 - 830 per Lord Craigie.  Again, the trustee's right under the judicial disposition will be converted into a real or feudal right only if he records a notice of title in the register, as the respondent did.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111.&nbsp;&nbsp;At first sight it looks as if the legislature has piled Pelion upon Ossa, since both the adjudication in implement and the adjudication for payment and in security result in the trustee having an absolute right of property on infeftment.  But, in actual fact, giving the act and warrant the effect of an adjudication for payment and in security is significant because it is one of the ways in which the law of sequestration builds upon the pre-existing law of adjudication for debt.  In particular, the trustee in sequestration is to be treated as an adjudger for payment with a decree in his favour for the benefit of the creditors.  And it is because he is treated as an adjudging creditor, and not merely as a purchaser, of the debtor's heritable estate that the trustee can set out to destroy the rights of uninfeft purchasers of that estate by infefting himself before they do.  A purchaser could not do this:  <i>Rodger (Builders) v Fawdry </i>1950 SC 583.</p>
<i><p>Adjudgers and prior personal rights</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112.&nbsp;&nbsp;The eighteenth and nineteenth century case law which I must now examine bears witness to a prolonged struggle to define the position of creditors who obtain a decree of adjudication against their debtor's estate.  At an early stage it was accepted that <i>bona fide </i>purchasers were not affected by personal rights against the seller which were not recorded in the register.  After all, such purchasers could be taken to have consulted the register and to have proceeded on the information about the seller's title to be found there.  The same could be said of creditors who insisted on the debtor providing them with a heritable security.  Both groups transacted on the faith of the register.  But, it was argued, creditors who used adjudication to obtain a security over their debtor's property were different.  They had originally chosen to lend money or to transact with the debtor either without taking any security at all or else on the basis of a personal security, such as caution from a third party.  At all events, these creditors had not relied on the debtor's land for security and had not therefore relied on his title to the land as set out in the register.  So, if it turned out that the debtor had entered into personal obligations relating to the land, such creditors could not claim to have been misled by the unqualified nature of his title in the deeds recorded in the register.  If they proceeded to adjudge their debtor's property, there was therefore no reason why they should be in any better position than the debtor himself on whom they had chosen to rely:  they should take his property <i>tantum et tale</i>, subject to any personal obligations, including obligations to uninfeft purchasers, that affected his right to the property.  So ran the argument that was eventually to fail - but only after a valiant fight by its proponents.</p>
<i><p>A trio of cases</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113.&nbsp;&nbsp;For present purposes the story begins with the seminal case, <i>Bell v Gartshore </i>(1737) M 2848;  5 Br Suppl 198;  2 Ross's LC 410;  Arniston Collection of Session Papers Vol 7 (1720 - 1737) No 51 (Advocates Library).  Alexander Oliphant bought a tenement in Kelso which was being sold by the adjudging creditors of William Chatto.  Without becoming infeft, in 1730 Oliphant disponed the decree of sale to Chatto's son, who also was not infeft.  Two years later Chatto junior granted a heritable bond to Bell of Blackethouse who had paid two bills of exchange for him and was entitled to relief.  Bell entered into possession but was not infeft.  In 1734 John Gartshore, another creditor of Chatto junior, adjudged the decree of sale of the tenement from him and obtained a charter of resignation from the superior, the Duke of Roxburgh, on which he was infeft.  A question arose as to the respective entitlements of Chatto junior's two creditors, Bell and Gartshore.  The critical issue was whether, by granting the heritable bond, Chatto junior had denuded himself of his entire personal right to the tenement, with the result that, when Gartshore purported to adjudge it from him, there was nothing left to be carried by the adjudication.  Apparently at the insistence of Lord Kilkerran, the Court of Session reconsidered their original decision in favour of Bell.  Departing from certain earlier cases, the court, presided over by the newly installed Lord President Forbes of Culloden, eventually held, by a majority, that the granting of the heritable bond did not denude Chatto junior of his personal right to the tenement.  It followed that the adjudication operated so as to vest that personal right in Gartshore.  Since Gartshore was infeft and Bell was not, Gartshore's right was to be preferred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114.&nbsp;&nbsp;Counsel for Bell - Andrew M'Douall, the future Lord Bankton and institutional writer - sought to argue that the case was concerned with nothing more than the effect of a personal conveyance by an uninfeft proprietor.  The importance of the case for present purposes lies in the successful contrary submission for Gartshore, apparently written by Robert Dundas of Arniston - who had, however, been appointed to the bench as Lord Arniston a few days before the crucial penultimate hearing.  The argument was to this effect.  The heritable bond granted by Chatto junior to Bell was, indeed, merely a personal conveyance.  There was no provision for recording such a personal conveyance in the register.  It followed that, if the effect of such a personal conveyance were that it denuded the granter of all his rights in the subjects, then anyone purchasing from him would in fact acquire nothing - even though the purchaser would have no way of knowing this.  If the purchaser then went on to become infeft and to record the instrument of sasine, anyone consulting the register would be misled into thinking that the purchaser had a valid title, when in fact he had no title at all.  It was no answer to say that any subsequent purchaser would be secure because he had purchased on the faith of the record, since there was no law that protected a purchaser against latent claims that did not appear on the face of the records.  Therefore, for the system of registration to work, the underlying assumption must be that unfeudalised personal conveyances did not denude the granter, whether he was infeft or uninfeft.  Counsel summarised his argument in this way, at p 2852:</p>
<p></p><ul>"A latent conveyance, by a person not infeft, is none of those grounds of challenge that are appointed to be recorded;  and therefore, supposing such a latent conveyance to be good in its nature against a purchaser, the records will not secure him, nor anything else, but the positive prescription of 40 years."<p></p></ul>
<p>Lord Kilkerran observed, 5 Br Suppl, 198, 199:</p>
<p></p><ul>"<i>1mo</i>, I have ever held it as a point, that he who first completes the real right, or in other words, he who first denudes the person last infeft, has the preferable right to the lands;  and herein lies the mistake of the advocates for Bell, that they still speak of denuding of the personal right, when truly that is not the question.  For the personal right is not the subject of competition;  it is the real right to the lands.  What else is the personal right but an obligation on the person last infeft, and a power given to the disponee to denude the granter by a procuratory or precept;  and the only question is, who denudes him first;  not who gets the first transmission of that power?"<p></p></ul>
<p>Lord Kilkerran's third point, at p 199, was:</p>
<p></p><ul>"<i>3tio</i>,<i> </i>Suppose the second assignee to the personal right infefts and conveys, that purchaser is safe <i>ex</i> <i>concessis</i>.  But upon what foundation can that be true, if his author derived his right <i>a non habente</i>?  It is no answer that the purchaser from one infeft is safe because he purchases upon the faith of the records;  for I know no statute that provides that a purchaser on the faith of the records is safe:  no law has said so.  Certain deeds are not effectual against purchasers, if not recorded.  But if any deed be of its nature effectual, which the law has not required to be recorded, it will remain effectual, and be a gap in our security from the records:  so I take the consequence of the doctrine to be unavoidable, that the purchaser from the second assignee infeft cannot be safe, and consequently our records are no longer a security.  The distinction that is put between purchasing from one infeft, and from one not infeft, resolves into this, that we will stop short, and not contradict the principles of law, in that case also, when disposition is from one infeft;  for in reality there is nothing in the distinction."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115.&nbsp;&nbsp;In his <i>Institute of the Law of Scotland</i> 2.7.26, written between 1765 and 1768, Erskine stated the law in the light of this case as follows:</p>
<p></p><ul>"By our former practice, where a person not infeft in lands disponed his right first to one and afterward to another, the first disponee was preferred to the subject, upon this ground, that one whose right to lands were merely personal, which is no more than a <i>jus obligationis</i>, may divest himself fully by any personal deed properly expressing his will to transfer the right;  so that after the first disposition, no right is left in the disponer which can be carried by the second….  But this rule, besides that it is not justly applicable to feudal rights, which require seisin to perfect them, rendered the security of singular successors precarious, since there is no necessity of registering any personal right.  It is therefore fixed by the later practice that the granter of a personal right of lands is not so divested by a first disposition but that he may effectually make over the right to another, either by voluntary or judicial conveyance;  and that the preference between the two disponees ought to be settled not according to the dates of the several grants, because they cannot be discovered by the records, but according to the priority of the seisins following on them;  <i>Bell</i>, 22 June 1737."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although <i>Bell v Gartshore</i> was specifically concerned with the position of an adjudger, within a few years, for the kinds of reason that I have outlined in paragraph 112, the court came to draw a distinction between adjudgers and <i>bona fide </i>purchasers from an infeft proprietor.  Such an argument certainly found favour in <i>Ireland v Neilson </i>(1755) 5 Br Supp 828 where the debtor had acquired the land by fraud:  it was held that the adjudgers were affected by the debtor's fraud, even if a purchaser would not have been.  See also <i>Gibb v Livingston </i>(1763) 4 Br Supp 897.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117.&nbsp;&nbsp;But any possible trend against adjudgers received a check in <i>Douglas v Adjudging Creditors of Kelhead</i> (1765) 3 Ross's LC 169;  sub nom <i>Douglas v Stewarts </i>M 15616;  Campbell Collection of Session Papers Vol 64 (1792) No 43 (Advocates Library).  Counsel for the adjudgers was Robert MacQueen, the future Lord Braxfield and a noted authority on feudal law.  In 1705 Sir William Douglas had bound himself in his marriage contract to provide the estate of Kelhead in favour of himself and the heirs-male of his body.  He failed to carry out that obligation.  Instead, in 1724 he executed a strict entail of the lands, which was recorded in the register of tailzies, but no infeftment followed upon it.  He died in 1733 and, eventually, in 1751 his son, Sir John Douglas, succeeded in having the entail reduced on the ground that Sir William had had no power to entail the estate of Kelhead since it had been provided to the heirs of the marriage.  Sir John was then infeft in fee simple in the estate and proceeded to borrow large sums.  In due course, during Sir John's lifetime, a process of ranking and sale of the estate was brought at the instance of his creditors, some being heritable creditors infeft and others being personal creditors who had adjudged and one of whom was infeft.  Sir John's eldest son, Captain Douglas, objected to the sale on the ground that, by serving heir to Sir William, his father had barred himself from reducing the entail.  The creditors argued that, even supposing that the reduction of the entail could be taken out of the way, this could not affect their debts since the feudal right of the estate was vested in Sir John as a fee-simple without any fetters or limitations whatever and so it was liable for the payment of all his personal debts.  In other words the entail would never be more than a personal right which would not affect the creditors, since it had not been feudalised by infeftment and recording in the register of sasines.  The Court of Session upheld this argument, in respect of both the heritable creditors and the adjudging personal creditors.  Captain Douglas reclaimed against the interlocutor in respect of the adjudging personal creditors.  The court adhered to its decision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118.&nbsp;&nbsp;The argument of James Burnett, the future Lord Monboddo, for Captain Douglas was that there was a great distinction between the heritable creditors, who had contracted on the faith of the records in the register, and the adjudging creditors who had lent their money on personal bonds and who could not therefore be said to have contracted upon the faith of the records.  (The general creditors in the present case are in a broadly similar position.)  Mr Burnett argued that such a personal creditor could not be in a better condition than his debtor.  When he lent money to the debtor, he got no more than the debtor's promise to repay it and, when he subsequently adjudged the debtor's property, this was simply a method of operating payment.  Mr MacQueen's argument for the adjudgers was to the effect that in law all of Sir John's creditors, irrespective of whether they were infeft on a heritable security or they adjudged in security of their debts, trusted their money on the faith of his infeftment in the estate, as appearing from the records.  The argument continued, 3 Ross's LC 169, 172:</p>
<p></p><ul>"For the law looks to the situation of the estate at the time the creditors lent their money, and holds, that a creditor lending his money to a person standing infeft in an estate in fee simple, or before the tailzie is recorded, contracts with that person upon the faith of the public records, as much as he who lends his money to him upon an heritable bond and infeftment.  If the last is secured in his real right against the challenge of an after heir of entail, so also must the former be secure in the legal effect and operation of his personal debt upon an estate which stood vested in his debtor in fee simple at the time of the contract."<p></p></ul>
<p>Since the creditors had carried the estate by adjudication and infeftment, the personal deed of entail could not compete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119.&nbsp;&nbsp;The adjudging creditors won.  Although the opinions of the judges are not reported, Lord Monboddo recorded, at pp 173 - 174, that the court took the case upon the general point that "no entail can be effectual against a purchaser, creditor by heritable bond, or adjudger, unless completed by infeftment…."  In <i>Black and Grant v Gordon </i>(1794) 3 Pat 317 Lord Justice Clerk Braxfield followed this decision in another case where an entail had been recorded in the register of tailzies but infeftment had not followed.  Dismissing an appeal from that decision, your Lordships' House rejected the appellants' argument that the adjudging creditors could not claim to have relied on the title as it stood in the register of sasines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120.&nbsp;&nbsp;The dispute about the position of adjudgers came to a head in <i>Mitchells v Ferguson</i> (1781) M 10296;  Hailes 879;  3 Ross's LC 120;  Faculty Collection Session Papers, December 1780 - February 1781, No 35 (Advocates Library).  The facts are complex and the pleadings somewhat tortuous.  A simplified version suffices for present purposes.  In 1768 William Donald sold his house to Agnes Carson but, pending payment, the disposition was held by Donald's man of business.  As found by the Lord Ordinary (Monboddo), the price was paid by a certain William Ferguson, on the basis that Carson would grant him a heritable bond or a disposition in security.  When she failed to do so, Ferguson raised proceedings for implement of this obligation and obtained a decree in absence on 4 July 1777.  The following month, on 9 August 1777, the Mitchells, as creditors of Donald, obtained a decree of adjudication of the house against him and were infeft.  Carson, however, raised a multiplepoinding and suspension of the decree in absence.  The question was whether, by reason of the adjudication, the Mitchells took the title to the house subject to the obligations of Donald under the sale to Carson.  The Lord Ordinary, relying on <i>Ireland v Neilson </i>and <i>Gibb v Livingston</i>, held that Donald's creditors could not carry off the house by adjudication except under the burden of the previous sale.  The Mitchells reclaimed and a hearing in presence was ordered.  The reclaiming motion was allowed.  Lord Monboddo dissenting, the court held, M 10296, 10299, that "the adjudication and infeftment following upon it are preferable to the personal disposition founded on by Ferguson."</p>
