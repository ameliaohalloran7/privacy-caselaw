<p class="para">75.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last paragraph of her fourth affidavit Ms Conlon deposed:</p>
<p class="qt">“I would respectfully point out that the current policy may be subject to change on the restoration of the local Assembly.  It will require the approval of the incoming Minister and the Executive.  If legislation is sanctioned, the legislative programme will also be determined by the Executive.  Any new legislation will require the development of a significant raft of subordinate legislation and extensive guidance before it can be brought fully into operation.  For these reasons it is not possible to offer any realistic or reliable timetable for the implementation of the necessary legislation in this regard.”</p>
<p class="para">76.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Conlon’s fifth affidavit gives a candid account of events since the restoration of devolved government on 8 May 2007.  On that day the new Minister in charge of the Department received a ‘first-day briefing', followed by other consultations and discussions within the Department.  A policy paper dated 27 June 2007 puts even more clearly the points made in para 3.39 of ‘Adopting the Future':</p>
<p class="qt">“<i>Profile of Children</i></p>
<p class="qt">6. The majority of children needing adoption today are no longer healthy babies, ‘given up’ for adoption by parents with whom they will have no contact.  They are more usually slightly older children in the care system, often with health or emotional difficulties incurred through a background of abuse or neglect.  They generally know their birth families and it is important in many cases that they continue to have some degree of contact with them.  As mentioned earlier, the life outcomes for children who spend long periods in care are extremely poor compared to their peers outside the care system.  Despite the evidence to suggest the success of adoption in providing secure families for children, the numbers of children adopted from care remain low.</p>
<i><p class="qt">Profile of Adopters/Support</p></i>
<p class="qt">7. Whilst the profile of children has changed, the wishes and expectations of the traditional profile of adopters has not, with the result that increasing numbers of prospective adopters in Northern Ireland are choosing to adopt a child from abroad, where there are healthy babies with limited likelihood of contact with birth families.  The implications of this are twofold:</p>
<p class="qt">*Firstly, we need to ensure that the opportunities for Northern Ireland’s children to find permanent families to support them into adult life are not unnecessarily restricted; and </p>
<p class="qt">*Secondly, both adopted children and their new families need significant levels of support if these new families, created by the state, are to succeed.</p>
<i><p class="qt">Adoption by Unmarried Couples</p>
</i>
<p class="qt">8. In view of the necessarily rigorous assessment process to which every person who wishes to adopt is subject, there are very few criteria set out in law which would automatically preclude people from adopting a child.  A person’s <i>eligibility</i> to adopt under the law is only the most basic consideration for adoption agencies.  The much more crucial test is the <i>suitability</i> of the prospective adopter to adopt a child.  Despite this, the law does require that where a couple wish to <i>jointly</i> adopt a child, they must be married.”</p>
<p class="para">77.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of her fifth affidavit Ms Conlon deposes that the Minister is aware of the appeal now before your Lordships, that he has made no final decisions on the detail of the reform of adoption legislation in Northern Ireland, and there may be a further public consultation exercise relating to the final form and content of new legislation.</p>
<p class="para">78.&nbsp;&nbsp;In short the position, as it appears from Ms Conlon’s unchallenged evidence, is that the Government of Northern Ireland intends to introduce new legislation on adoption; that there has been extensive consultation on a number of proposals, including permitting joint adoption by unmarried couples; that the Department’s stated policy is to proceed with that proposal, despite the adverse reaction to the consultation; but that no final decisions have been taken by the Minister as to the measures to be put before the Assembly for debate and decision.</p>
<p class="hditl">“No more, but certainly no less”</p>
<p class="para">79.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, I have had the great advantage of reading in draft the opinions of my noble and learned friends, Lord Hoffmann and Lord Hope of Craighead.  There is much in their opinions with which I fully agree, but I respectfully differ from their conclusions.  In particular, I agree with all that Lord Hoffmann says about the reasoning of the Court of Appeal, which concluded that the issue of discrimination under article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights did not arise at all, or (if it did arise) was to be regarded as justifiable.  I agree with Lord Hoffmann that opposition to the proposed change in Northern Ireland’s adoption law seems to be based on the fallacy of turning a reasonable generalisation into an irrebuttable presumption.  I agree as to the importance of the guidance given by Lord Bingham of Cornhill in <i>R (Ullah) v Special Adjudicator</i> [2004]  2 AC 323, para 20: </p>
<p class="qt">“The duty of national courts is to keep pace with the Strasbourg jurisprudence as it evolves over time: no more, but certainly no less.”</p>
<p class="para">The full quotation is set out in para 30 of Lord Hoffmann’s opinion.  I read the guidance as having a rather wider application.</p>
<p class="para">80.&nbsp;&nbsp;I respectfully agree, though not without some reservations, with Lord Hope’s view that just because the law has now changed in England and Wales and in Scotland, it does not follow that the law must be changed in Northern Ireland also.  It may be said that those parts of the United Kingdom have moved ahead of many other European countries (as appears from the need for denunciation of the 1967 Convention in order to make this change in domestic law).  In principle the content of human rights should (almost by definition) be the same world-wide, and if there were to be significant long-term differences in the protection afforded to human rights in communities in different parts of the United Kingdom it would, I think, be a cause for serious concern.  Nevertheless religious and social differences between different regions and localities may be relevant to the sort of balancing exercise which the Human Rights Act 1998 calls for (that is illustrated, on a very small scale, by the decision of this House in <i>Belfast City Council v Miss Behavin’ Limited</i> [2007] UKHL 19; [2007]  1 WLR 1420).   So long as the position in the Council of Europe is still regulated by the 1967 Convention I do not consider that it could be said that Northern Ireland is obviously too far behind.</p>
<p class="para">81.&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation and consideration of complex legislation, challenging deep-seated social attitudes, does take time (see the remarks of Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead in <i>Bellinger v Bellinger (Lord Chancellor intervening)</i> [2003] UKHL 21; [2003]  2 AC 467,  paras 42-49, and also some remarks of my own in <i>M v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions</i> [2006] UKHL 11; [2006]  2 AC 91, paras 91-96).   <i>Bellinger v Bellinger</i> was of course an extreme case, as it raised the very difficult issue of the definition of gender reassignment.  But the definition of “different-sex couples and same-sex couples who are living together in a stable relationship” (article 7(2) of the new draft European Convention on the Adoption of Children) is not without difficulties (compare section 144(4) to (6) of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 and the recent decision of the Strasbourg Court in <i>Burden v United Kingdom</i> Application No 13378/05, 29 April 2008, [2008] ECHR 357). <i> </i>The Government of Northern Ireland is barely one year past the resumption of devolved government under the Northern Ireland Act 1998.  It would be unrealistic to suppose that the proposal to change the law about joint adoptions will not be subject to a great deal of controversy in the Assembly.  But it would be premature, I suggest, for your Lordships to assume that it would fail.</p>
<p class="para">82.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, in respectful disagreement with Lord Hoffmann and Lord Hope, and echoing Lord Nicholls in <i>Bellinger</i> at para 49, the change in the law sought by the appellants</p>
<p class="qt">“must be a matter for deliberation and decision by Parliament when the forthcoming Bill is introduced.”</p>
<p class="para">I reach this conclusion for three reasons.  First, it is far from clear that the Strasbourg Court would hold that the Adoption Order infringes the European Convention on Human Rights.  So long as the 1967 Convention remains in force the Court would be more likely, in my opinion, to reach the opposite conclusion.  Second, the decision to be made is one that ought to be made by a democratically-elected legislature.  Third, your Lordships’ House can deal with this matter only by the blunt instrument of a declaration as to the position of the Family Division under section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998.  This would, I think, put the Family Division, and the other officials and agencies involved in the adoption process, in a difficult position.  Ms Conlon’s fourth and fifth affidavits refer to the amount of work (involving subordinate legislation and departmental guidance) which would be necessary to give full effect to the legislative change.  That is one of the reasons why it is likely to take some time.  If instead your Lordships make the order which Lord Hoffmann proposes, judges, lawyers, officials and agencies would be faced with a very abrupt change in the law.  No doubt they would all do their best to cope with that new situation but I suspect that there would be many practical difficulties.</p>
<p class="para">83.&nbsp;&nbsp;For my part I would therefore dismiss this appeal.  But I would do so with a warning that if within two or three years a clear consensus on this point emerges within the Council of Europe and in the jurisprudence of the Strasbourg Court, and if the Northern Ireland Assembly does not legislate in line with that consensus, the issue would most probably have to be reconsidered by the new Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, and the outcome would probably be different.</p>
<p class="para">BARONESS HALE OF RICHMOND</p>
<p class="para">My Lords,</p>
<p class="para">84.&nbsp;&nbsp;This case raises an issue of fundamental importance in the operation of the Human Rights Act 1998. How should the courts of this country respond where a provision in subordinate legislation is said to be incompatible with the Convention rights, but the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg might well regard the matter as within the margin of appreciation allowed to member states? Should the courts form their own view of the content of the Convention rights or should they leave it to the legislators? Are the “Convention rights” for the purpose of section 1(1) of the 1998 Act, the rights as defined by Strasbourg but given effect in UK law, or are they the rights defined by United Kingdom law within the parameters defined by Strasbourg?   </p>
<i>
</i><p class="paraleft"><i>Adoption law and practice</i>  </p>
<p class="para">85.&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue happens to arise in the context of the continued exclusion of unmarried couples from jointly adopting in Northern Ireland. A sketch of the background from a family law point of view may therefore be helpful. Adoption is the most serious and far-reaching order known to family law. The Adoption (Northern Ireland) Order 1987 is modelled on the Adoption Act 1976 of England and Wales, under which an adoption order achieved an almost “total legal transplant” of a child from one family to another. Article 40(1) and (2) of the 1987 Order provides that:</p>
<p class="para">“(1) An adopted child shall be treated in law - </p>
<p class="para">(a) where the adopters are a married couple, as if he had been born as a child of the marriage (whether or not he was in fact born after the marriage was solemnised);</p>
<p class="para">(b) in any other case, as if he had been born to the adopter in wedlock…</p>
<p class="para">(2) An adopted child shall . . . be treated in law as if he were not the child of any person other than the adopters or adopter.”</p>
<p class="para">Thus an adoption order does far more than deprive the birth parents of their parental responsibility for bringing up the child and confer it upon her adoptive parents (provided for in article 12). It severs, irrevocably and for all time, the legal relationship between a child and her family of birth. It creates, irrevocably and for all time (unless the child is later adopted again into another family), a new legal relationship, not only between the child and her adoptive parents, but between the child and each of her adoptive parent’s families. Their parents become her grandparents, their brothers and sisters her uncles and aunts. References to a parent, child or any other relationship in a statute or legal instrument (such as a will) automatically include an adoptive relationship unless it is specifically excluded.</p>
<p class="para">86.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why the law takes the making of an adoption order so seriously. Only a Health and Social Services Trust or Board, or a registered adoption society, may arrange adoptions (article 11). Their work in choosing potential adopters, approving a child for adoption, matching a particular child to a particular adopter or adopters is closely regulated by the Adoption Agencies Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1989 (SR 1989 No 253) (made under article 10). The child must spend a probationary period of at least 13 weeks with the prospective adopters before the order is made (article 13). The agency, or if the child was not placed through an agency, the local Board or Trust must report to the court on the suitability of the prospective adopters and any other matters relevant to the operation of article 9 (articles 22 and 24).</p>
<p class="para">87.&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 9 has already been quoted in full by my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann (para 10). It requires both courts and adoption agencies to “regard the welfare of the child as the most important consideration” in all their decisions. They must be satisfied, not only that adoption, but also that adoption by the particular prospective adopter or adopters “will be in the best interests of the child".  They must give full consideration to “the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of the child throughout his childhood” and “the importance of providing the child with a stable and harmonious home". They must also “so far as practicable, first ascertain the wishes and feelings of the child regarding the decision and give due consideration to them, having regard to his age and understanding.”</p>
<p class="para">88.&nbsp;&nbsp;The court must also appoint a guardian ad litem for the child, who has the duty of safeguarding the interests of the child in the manner prescribed by the Adoption Rules (article 66; see Order 84 of the Rules of the Supreme Court (Northern Ireland) 1980, rules 18(1) and 6(3)-(6)). Parental agreement, either to the adoption order itself or to an order freeing the child for adoption, is required unless it can be dispensed with (articles 16 to 18).</p>
<p class="para">89.&nbsp;&nbsp;Broadly speaking, there are three different types of adoption. First is the traditional model, of a young unmarried mother giving up her healthy new born baby, reluctantly but voluntarily, to a married couple who are unable to have children of their own. The “total legal transplant” concept was developed mainly with this kind of adoption in mind. But in England and Wales, the traditional model has largely disappeared. Very few unmarried mothers wish to give up their babies for adoption. Couples who only want to adopt a healthy young baby often have to go abroad to find one. Inter-country adoption has to some extent taken over this traditional “children for families” role. </p>
<p class="para">90.&nbsp;&nbsp;Second is adoption by step-parents, after the relationship (if any) between the birth parents has ended. At one stage this was seen by many as the sensible solution when an unmarried, widowed or divorced mother married. Hence the numbers grew as the divorce rate grew. But it became increasingly unpopular with the adoption professionals, who saw it as denying and distorting the birth family relationships. Often, it was felt, the motive was to cut a divorced father out of his children’s lives. The <i>Report of the Departmental Committee on the Adoption of Children</i>, chaired by Sir William Houghton (1972, Cmnd 5107) recommended that the courts be obliged to consider alternatives to adoption where step-parents applied. The 1987 Order contained such a provision until it was repealed under the Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995 (SI 1995/755 (NI 2)). The numbers of step-parent adoptions, especially following divorce, have certainly decreased but there remain circumstances in which they may be the best solution for the child. In England and Wales, the Adoption and Children Act 2002 has provided a way in which step-parents can share parental responsibility with the birth parents without displacing either of them. It has also provided a new model of adoption, in which the parent to whom the step-parent is married remains a birth parent, while the step-parent becomes an adoptive parent, replacing the other birth parent.</p>
<p class="para">91.&nbsp;&nbsp;While the first two types of adoption have been decreasing in numbers, a third has been increasing. This is the adoption of children who are being looked after by local authorities, because their birth parents are unable to look after them properly, and who are desperately in need of a new “family for life". Because of the shortcomings of a life spent in local authority care, a move to find “permanency” for these children developed during the 1970s. While previously only healthy white babies had been thought adoptable, it was now recognised that no child was unadoptable. These children were not new born. Some were of mixed race or from ethnic backgrounds where adoption was rare or unknown. Many had histories, sometimes very tragic histories, which left them with very special needs. Some had disabilities with which their parents were unable to cope. Prospective adopters who were looking for a healthy white baby, to take the place of the one they were unable to have themselves, were much less likely to want an older child with special needs. A rather different sort of adoptive family was required, perhaps a couple who had successfully brought up their own children, perhaps a couple who had been fostering the child, perhaps a single person who could give the child the one to one attention she required. Apart from the particular parenting problems these children might present, there might also be the stress of a contested adoption if the birth parents did not agree and a need for continued contact of some sort between the child and her birth family.</p>
<p class="para">92.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was against this changing social background that the law of adoption in England and Wales was radically overhauled by the Adoption and Children Act 2002. The process began with the <i>Review of Adoption Law:</i> <i>Report to Ministers of an Interdepartmental Working Group</i>, published by the Department of Health and Welsh Office as a Consultation Document in 1992. As with the review of child care law which had led to the Children Act 1989, this was a collaboration between the family law team at the Law Commission and the relevant government departments. It was followed by a white paper, <i>Adoption: The Future</i>, Cm 2288, in 1993; then by a draft Bill, <i>Adoption - A Service for Children</i>, published for consultation in 1996. The 1997 general election intervened. </p>
<p class="para">93.&nbsp;&nbsp;But interest revived in 2000 when the Prime Minister led a review, specifically in order to encourage the greater use of adoption by local authorities for the children they were looking after. It was felt that the greater emphasis on promoting permanence through family reunification or kinship care, resulting from the Children Act 1989, had distracted professional attention from finding adoptive homes for the children for whom family care would not be possible. The Performance and Innovation Unit published a report for consultation in July 2000, followed by a white paper, <i>Adoption: A New Approach</i>, Cm 5017, in December 2000. The emphasis was all upon finding safe, secure and permanent new families for children looked after by local authorities, mainly through changes in policy and practice; but the white paper also contained a commitment to changing the law.  The Bill which became the 2002 Act was similar in structure to the Bill which had been published in 1996.</p>
<i>
<p class="para">The debate about unmarried adopters</p>
</i><p class="para">94.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, and all the preceding reviews, would have retained the then existing law, which provided for only two kinds of adoption: a joint adoption by a married couple, both of whom thereafter became the child’s parents, and a sole adoption by a single (or effectively single) person, who thereafter became the child’s only parent. The reasons were given in the 1992 <i>Review</i>:</p>
<p class="para">“26.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . unmarried parents do not have the same legal obligations to one another as a married couple have. Should the relationship break down, the caring parent may therefore be less financially secure than if they were married. Furthermore, one of the special features of adoption is that it transfers a child from one family to another and gives the child a legal relationship with all members of the new family, including grandparents, aunts and uncles. However great the commitment of unmarried adoptive parents to a child might be, it is open to question how far their wider families would be willing to accept that child as part of their family.</p>
<p class="para">26.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also important to bear in mind Article 6(1) of the European Adoption Convention [1967] which prohibits adoption by unmarried couples. Although some unmarried couples might be suitable adoptive parents for a child, we feel that the security and stability which adopted children need are still more likely to be provided by parents who have made a publicly recognised commitment to their relationship and who have legal responsibilities towards each other.”</p>
<p class="para">At the same time, as the <i>Review </i>recognised,</p>
<p class="para">“26.13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not propose any changes to the law relating to single applicants, including lesbians and gay men. There are examples of extremely successful adoptions, particularly of older children and children with disabilities, by single adopters. Some children are only able to settle in single parent households, as a result of experiences in their early lives.</p>
<p class="para">26.14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some agencies may place a child with a single applicant who is living with a partner. As a matter of practice, to safeguard the child, they also assess the suitability of the partner. We have suggested above that an unmarried couple should not be allowed to adopt jointly . . . We do not feel that this is necessarily incompatible with allowing a single person who has a partner to adopt.”  </p>
<p class="para">95.&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar sentiments were expressed in the 1993 white paper, which emphasised that adoption by single people should be seen as exceptional (para 4.38) and endorsed “the general preference of authorities, adoption agencies and their staffs for adoption by married couples” (para 4.40).  In the 2000 review and white paper, despite the emphasis on finding families for children rather than children for families, and on a “non-judgmental” approach to assessing suitability to adopt, there was no discussion of broadening the eligibility criteria. In none of these documents was there any discussion of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<p class="para">96.&nbsp;&nbsp;An Adoption and Children Bill went through most of its stages in the Commons in 2001 but was lost when Parliament was dissolved for the 2001 General Election. The same Bill was introduced in the 2001 - 2002 session. It retained the existing eligibility criteria, which the Minister had described at its first second reading in the House of Commons as “absolutely right” (<i>Hansard (HC Debates)</i>, 26 Mar 2001, Vol 365, col 709). But at the next second reading (<i>Hansard (HC Dbates)</i>, 29 October 2001, Vol 373,) several back bench members flagged their intention to support amendments which would allow unmarried couples, whether of the same or opposite sexes, to adopt jointly. They had the support of BAAF, the umbrella group to which most, if not all, British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering belong. The Government allowed a free vote and the amendments were passed at the report stage in the Commons (<i>Hansard (HC Debates)</i>, 16 May 2002, Vol 385, cols 967 - 1006). </p>
<p class="para">97.&nbsp;&nbsp;The arguments were simple. Unmarried couples were already in practice allowed to adopt; but only one of them could do so legally, thus reducing the other to second class status and depriving the child of the benefit of two legal parents. At the same time, unmarried couples were deterred from coming forward to adopt. There were children looked after by local authorities whose unmarried foster parents would like to adopt them. There was a shortage of people who were willing to adopt some kinds of children who really needed it, in particular older boys. The Bill required adoption agencies and courts to make the welfare of the child throughout her life their paramount consideration. But this restriction meant that, in a very few cases, they were unable to do what was best for the child. </p>
<p class="para">98.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the report stage in the House of Lords, the Bill was restored to its original position.  The arguments were much the same as those in the 1992 <i>Review</i> and 1993 white paper. There was also some concern about adoption by same sex couples (<i>Hansard (HL Debates)</i>, 16 October 2002, Vol 639, cols 864 to 910). On 28 October 2002, the Joint Committee on Human Rights published its 24th Report of the session 2001-02, <i>Adoption and Children Bill: as amended by the House of Lords on Report, </i>HL Paper 177. This expressed the view that “a blanket ban on unmarried couples becoming eligible to adopt children would amount to unjustifiable discrimination on the ground of marital status, violating article 14 combined with article 8” (para 25).<i> </i>On 4 November 2002, the Commons declined to accept the Lords’ amendments and on 5th November, the Lords voted by a majority of 31 not to insist on them.</p>
