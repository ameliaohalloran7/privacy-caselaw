<p align="right"><a href="briggs-3.htm">(back to preceding text)</a></p>

<p class="para">92.&nbsp;&nbsp;In para 46 the Court stated what was objectionable in the Dutch court’s findings in <i>Geerings</i> which distinguished it from <i>Phillips</i> and <i>Van Offeren</i>: “that the applicant had obtained unlawful benefits from the crimes in question although [he] was never shown to hold any assets for whose provenance he could not give an adequate explanation, [such finding having been reached] by accepting a conjectural extrapolation based on a mixture of fact and estimate contained in a police report".</p>
<p class="para">93.&nbsp;&nbsp;That seems to me to describe the present case precisely.  Then, in para 47, the court ruled out the confiscation of benefit calculated by reference to “assets which are not known to have been in the possession of the person affected, the more so if the measure concerned relates to a criminal act of which the person affected has not actually been found guilty.”  The Court continued, “If it is not found beyond a reasonable doubt that the person affected has actually committed the crime, and if it cannot be established as fact that any advantage, illegal or otherwise, was actually obtained, such a measure can only be based on a presumption of guilt.  This can hardly be considered compatible with article 6(2).”</p>
<p class="para">94.&nbsp;&nbsp;That again (with one important exception, the standard of proof, to which I shall return) seems to me to describe this case.  I cannot with respect accept Lord Mance’s analysis (at para 129) of paragraph 47 of <i>Geerings</i>, an analysis which effectively equates the Court’s first reason for distinguishing <i>Phillips</i> and <i>Van Offeren</i> with its second reason: that the applicant had in fact been acquitted of the very crimes the proceeds of which were imputed to him as benefits  received.  Rather I understand the Court’s reasoning in paras 46 and 47 to amount to this: the prosecution must either demonstrate that the defendant holds or has held assets the provenance of which he cannot satisfactorily explain (as in <i>Phillips</i> and <i>Van Offeren</i>—see para 44), or must establish beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant has committed some other offence (or offences) from which it can be presumed that he obtained advantage.  In the latter case, of course, article 6(2) applies but is satisfied.</p>
<p class="para">95.&nbsp;&nbsp;The obvious difference between <i>Geerings</i> and the present case is that in the present case the appellant, so far from having been acquitted of the cannabis offence, was found by the judge beyond reasonable doubt to have committed it.  On this basis and on this basis alone I would regard <i>Geerings</i> as distinguishable and article 6(2), albeit engaged here, to be satisfied.  The fact that the cannabis offence was not treated under domestic law as a criminal charge and did not lead to a criminal conviction is not in my judgment a sufficient basis for holding it not to be a charge within the autonomous Convention meaning. A possible alternative view is that, even supposing the cannabis allegation was not to be regarded as a criminal charge for article 6 purposes, it nevertheless needed to be proved to the criminal standard to satisfy the basic article 6 requirement of a fair hearing in this particular context - see, for example  <i>Bochan v Ukraine </i>(Application No 7577/02, judgment 3 August 2007) at para 78:</p>
<p class="para">“the provisions of article 6(2) and (3) have a certain relevance outside the strict confines of criminal law in that these principles are enshrined in the general notion of a fair trial as embodied in article 6(1) of the Convention.”</p>
<p class="para">I accordingly agree with my noble and learned friend Lord Rodger of Earlsferry that section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998 should be invoked here to read section 2(8)(a) of the 1994 Act in the manner he indicates at  para 79 of his opinion.</p>
<p class="para">96.&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain of your Lordships suggest that it would be strange if the Crown could rely on statutory assumptions and the reverse burden of proof to establish benefit by reference to demonstrable property held or expenditure incurred and yet not be entitled to prove drug trafficking and its likely benefits.  I agree, but I agree only on the basis that, unless the possession of property or expenditure can otherwise be established, the Crown must indeed prove the offending, even if not formally charged, to the criminal standard, as in this very case.  As I understand it, some at least of your Lordships would have regarded it as sufficient for the Crown to have proved the cannabis offence on the balance of probabilities (as, indeed, section 2(8) of the 1994 Act stipulates).  And certainly that view would be implicit in the suggestion that (consistently perhaps with <i>Van Offeren</i> although not, of course, with <i>Geerings</i>) confiscation can be ordered even in respect of benefits derived from offences of which the defendant had been acquitted provided only that the judge nevertheless decides that the defendant was probably guilty.</p>
<p class="para">97.&nbsp;&nbsp;At one stage in the preparation of this opinion I wondered whether, assuming for Convention purposes the appellant was indeed to be regarded as charged with a criminal offence, he can properly be said to have been “proved guilty according to law", not least having regard to the terms of section 2(8).  Given, however, the obvious overall fairness of the confiscation proceedings here—see, for example, para 42 of Lord Phillips’ opinion and para 74 of Lord Rodger’s opinion—I cannot think that Strasbourg would regard the procedure in fact adopted as unlawful.  Having swallowed the camel of accepting that our confiscation proceedings generally are compliant with article 6, the European Court of Human Rights is in my opinion unlikely to strain at this gnat.</p>
<p class="para">98.&nbsp;&nbsp;I too, therefore, if for rather different reasons than the other members of the Committee, would dismiss this appeal.</p>
<p class="lawlord">LORD MANCE</p>
<p class="para">My Lords,</p>
<p class="para">99.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would dismiss this appeal. Two issues arise: first, the interpretation of Part I of the Drug Trafficking Act 1994, construed without reference to s.3 of the Human Rights Act 1998 and, second, the impact, if any, on such interpretation of the Convention rights incorporated into domestic law by that Act. The appellant submits that articles 6(1) and (2) are potentially infringed and that, if Part I is otherwise inconsistent with them, it needs to be read down or alternatively declared incompatible.</p>
<p class="para">100.&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the first issue, the scheme of Part I is clear. It aims, so far as current realisable assets allow, to deprive a defendant convicted of a drug trafficking offence of the proceeds of any drug trafficking carried on by him or another person and from which he has benefited in the past (ss.2(2) and (3)). In this connection, a person has benefited from drug trafficking if he has “at any time …..received any payment or other reward in connection with drug trafficking carried on by him or another person” (s.2(3)) - and in that regard it was common ground in argument before the House that <i>mens rea </i>consisting of some form of knowledge is required before a person could be said to have received any such payment or other reward “in connection with drug trafficking carried on by …. another person"; further, the aggregate value of any such payments or other rewards constitutes “the value of the proceeds of drug trafficking” (s.4(1)); and the court is required to make a confiscation order in the amount assessed (that is, under s.4(1)) to be the value of such proceeds (s.5(1)) - subject to the important qualification that if the amount realisable is less than the amount so assessed, the confiscation order is to be the amount so realisable (or, if that is nil, a nominal amount) (s.5(3)).</p>
<p class="para">101.&nbsp;&nbsp;This scheme is reinforced by assumptions which the court is required to make in circumstances not falling within specified exceptions: s.4(2) to (5) ,which read:</p>
<p class="qt">“The required assumptions are— </p>
<p class="qt">(a) that any property appearing to the court— </p>
<p class="para">(i) to have been held by the defendant at any time since his conviction, or </p>
<p class="para">(ii) to have been transferred to him at any time since the beginning of the period of six years ending when the proceedings were instituted against him, </p>
<p class="para">was received by him, at the earliest time at which he appears to the court to have held it, as a payment or reward in connection with drug trafficking carried on by him;</p>
<p class="para">(b) that any expenditure of his since the beginning of that period was met out of payments received by him in connection with drug trafficking carried on by him; and </p>
<p class="para">(c) that, for the purpose of valuing any property received or assumed to have been received by him at any time as such a reward, he received the property free of any other interests in it. </p>
<p class="para">(4) The court shall not make any required assumption in relation to any particular property or expenditure if— </p>
<p class="para">(a) that assumption is shown to be incorrect in the defendant’s case; or </p>
<p class="para">(b) the court is satisfied that there would be a serious risk of injustice in the defendant’s case if the assumption were to be made; </p>
<p class="para">and where, by virtue of this subsection, the court does not make one or more of the required assumptions, it shall state its reasons.</p>
<p class="para">(5) Subsection (2) above does not apply if the only drug trafficking offence in respect of which the defendant appears before the court to be sentenced is an offence under section 49, 50 or 51 of this Act <i>[that is, various moneylaundering offences, now to be found replaced under the Proceeds of Crime Act]</i>.”</p>
<p class="para">102.&nbsp;&nbsp;Drug trafficking is defined in wide terms which include not only specified offences under the law of England and Wales and offences under corresponding laws elsewhere (s.1(1)) but also entering into or being otherwise concerned in England and Wales or elsewhere “in an arrangement whereby (a) the retention or control by or on behalf of another person of the other person’s proceeds of drug trafficking is facilitated; or (b) the proceeds of drug trafficking by another person are used to secure that funds are placed at the other person’s disposal or are used for the other person’s benefit to acquire property by way of investment” (s.1(2)).</p>
<p class="para">103.&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows from these provisions that a person convicted of a drug trafficking offence may be subject to a confiscation order by benefiting by and receiving proceeds from (a) the drug trafficking offence of which he is convicted, (b) other drug trafficking offences which he has committed here or under corresponding foreign laws, (c) other drug trafficking offences which other people have committed here or under corresponding foreign laws, (d) drug trafficking in which he has been involved here or abroad not amounting to any such drug trafficking offence here or abroad and (e) drug trafficking in which another person has been involved not amounting to any such drug trafficking offence here or abroad. The scheme of the Act does not distinguish in any essential respect between any of these possibilities, but embraces them all. There is nothing to support Mr Owen’s submission that in case (a) the Crown is free to prove any actual benefit made and proceeds received in any way it can, whereas in all or any of the other cases the only way the Crown can proceed is by invoking the assumptions. There is nothing in the statutory language to make the assumptions the only or exclusive means of proving benefit made or proceeds received in any circumstances. </p>
<p class="para">104.&nbsp;&nbsp;The assumptions required under s.4(2) et seq. are simply one aspect of one and the same overall scheme. The scheme operates by reference to the benefit made from drug trafficking and the value of the proceeds of drug trafficking. The assumptions, where they apply, do no more than assist to prove these matters. It is a fallacy to describe them as some form of separate assets-based recovery. They are means of proving the receipt of proceeds from drug trafficking by pointing to particular property or expenditure and requiring an explanation for its origin. The defendant is entitled to rebut the assumptions in relation to any particular property or expenditure, by showing them to be incorrect in its case. S.4(3)(b) caters for cases where there may be a serious risk of injustice if the assumptions are made - take a defendant suffering from some mental infirmity or whose records have all been destroyed in a fire and s.4(5) specifies cases where the assumptions can never be made. </p>
<p class="para">105.&nbsp;&nbsp;The assumptions are for the Crown’s and so the community’s benefit. Parliament’s resolve is underlined by the requirement to make them under the 1994 Act, in contrast with the predecessor legislation where they were discretionary (Criminal Justice Act 1988, s.72AA(3)). But the assumptions are no more than one way of proving that a defendant has benefited by drug trafficking and the value of his proceeds of drug trafficking for the  purposes of s.2(4), 5(1) and 4(1). That the Crown is entirely free to prove such benefit in other ways or at a time preceding the six year period covered by the assumptions is clear from the general structure of Part I. If the assumptions were to be the only way of proving benefit by or the proceeds from drug trafficking, there would be no point in much of s.2. Yet s.2(3) and s4(1) both deliberately emphasise that a defendant may benefit by and receive proceeds of drug trafficking “at any time", in obvious contrast with the assumptions under s.4(3) which are limited to “at any time since the beginning of the period of six years". Further, in cases where the assumptions are not permitted to be made either under the statutory provisions or in the interests of justice by the court, the Crown must be able to prove the benefits and proceeds by other means. And, since the assumptions only assist to prove proceeds “in connection with drug trafficking carried on by him” (see s.4(3)(a) and (b)), it would never be relevant or possible to establish the proceeds consisting of payments or other rewards received by him “in connection with drug trafficking carried on by …. another person” to which s.2(3) and 4(1) refer, unless it were open to the Crown to do this without relying on the assumptions. </p>
<p class="para">106.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore clear, almost beyond sensible argument, that Part I involves a single overall scheme, in which the assumptions play a potential evidential role. But the assumptions are no more than one way of proving certain aspects of the benefit and proceeds at which the scheme aims. They apply only in relation to property held or acquired or expenditure made since a date six years before the institution of proceedings. To the extent that they do not apply, the Crown has to make its case without their assistance. But the essential enquiry is the same: what if any benefit was made and proceeds received? And the ultimate order is always limited to the lesser of the proceeds received and the amount realisable at the date of the order.</p>
<p class="para">107.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there anything in this scheme which limits it in any way to benefit made or proceeds received in connection with the offence of which the defendant is convicted? Obviously not: see paragraph 5 above. To introduce any such limit would involve rewriting Parliament’s scheme, legislating rather than interpreting. The scheme is broad and thorough. Mr Owen QC for the appellant shakes the spectre of confiscation orders made on the basis of evidence of past drug trafficking called for the first time at the sentencing stage and having nothing to do with the issues or evidence at trial. That is not how the real world operates; and it has nothing to do with the present case, where the evidence of past cannabis dealings was admitted, without objection, as relevant and appropriate under English law in relation to the heroin importation charge (and was, one might add, evidence which, although not strictly essential to the jury’s verdict, left the judge in no doubt about its truthfulness). A criminal judge always has a power, and duty, to restrain abusive conduct by the prosecution, and, if Mr Owen’s spectre were ever to emerge from a cupboard, the trial judge would know how to exorcise it. </p>
<p class="para">108.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, I share the feeling that it is undesirable that a defendant should be charged only with an offence of conspiring to import heroin, that the Crown should in order to prove that offence adduce extensive evidence (in the form of covertly taped admissions) of  the defendant having a pre-existing distribution network for the transportation and distribution of cannabis, in order to show why the defendant was approached to import heroin, and that the judge should then be invited to make a confiscation order on the basis of the benefit made and proceeds received from the cannabis dealings proved to his satisfaction by such evidence. I understand that, in the absence of any charge relating to the cannabis dealings, the evidence of the appellant’s admissions of such dealings would not have been admissible in Scotland. But criminal law and procedure vary widely among European countries, and, within the parameters of the European Convention on Human Rights and of the common principles governing proper prosecutorial conduct (neither of which it has been suggested were exceeded in this particular respect), it is not for us to proceed on the basis of some instinctive preference for an approach different from that here actually adopted.  If there was any objection to the course taken at trial or at the stage when the confiscation order was sought, it was open to the defence to apply to stay or limit further proceedings or to exclude the proposed evidence accordingly. This was done, but the trial judge held that the evidence that the defendant had a pre-existing cannabis distribution network was relevant and had, though prejudicial, considerable probative value and should be admitted, and went on to give directions in his summing up which accurately explained the nature and potential significance of the evidence, and which made clear that it was for the jury to decide whether there was in fact such a network. The judge’s ruling was challenged unsuccessfully on appeal to the Court of Appeal. The correctness of what the Court of Appeal described as the judge’s “very clear ruling” and “careful summing-up” are no longer in issue before your Lordships’ House. In these circumstances, there was nothing irregular or abusive in what was done during the confiscation proceedings if it fell within the statutory provisions, as in my opinion it clearly did.</p>
<p class="para">109.&nbsp;&nbsp;The statutory assumptions were not made in this case. They were not made because the appellant objected that a case based upon them “would involve extremely difficult accountancy issues and would be lengthy and expensive". The Crown “therefore decided to restrict the confiscation claim to assessing the benefit derived from the provable cannabis trafficking". Thus, the confiscation proceedings were conducted “on the agreed basis that the ….. assumptions regime ought not to be applied to the Appellant’s known assets/expenditure” (appellant’s case, par. 4.1).  The appellant was a wealthy man, with interests including a hotel and other income-yielding properties, and Mr Owen argued in the Court of Appeal that the Crown must be taken to have recognised either under s.4(4)(a) that the assumptions were entirely incorrect in his case or under s.4(4)(b) that there would be a serious risk of injustice if they were to be made. The latter proposition fails to recognise that this would at once open the door to precisely what the Crown in fact did, namely accept the onus of proof and positively establish the benefit from and proceeds of drug trafficking, without reliance on any assumptions. For present purposes what matters is that the Court of Appeal rejected both aspects of Mr Owen’s argument, and accepted that it was for “purely pragmatic reasons” that the assumptions were not relied upon. Richards LJ in his clearly reasoned judgment went on: “Whether it was permissible to deal with the matter in this way by agreement and without considering whether the statutory conditions for dis-applying the assumptions were fulfilled, is doubtful, but is not the question before us". It is to be noted that in this regard also no ground of appeal, based on procedural irregularity or unfairness, has ever been advanced - I think for good reason. </p>
<p class="para">110.&nbsp;&nbsp;The assumptions are not some form of procedural safeguard for defendants. They are intended to assist the Crown and the public in the task of stripping convicted drug traffickers of the proceeds of drug trafficking, and they were only made compulsory (subject to the statutory exceptions) in order to ensure that the Crown and public received this assistance from the courts. A defendant who seeks and obtains agreement that the assumptions should not be applied cannot plausibly claim to have suffered prejudice, still less unfairness. He has obtained a benefit, which the Crown was in my view able to waive. The contrary view means that the judge should have insisted on making assumptions against the defendant which neither the defendant nor the Crown wished to make or should at least have insisted in considering whether either of the reasons available under s.4(4) for not making assumptions applied and have given its reasons for so concluding if it concluded that they did. If that is what the law requires, then the only person with any cause for complaint that the judge did not do so this is the public. There was and is on no view any basis for complaint by the defendant, for whom the application of the assumptions could only be prejudicial. It remained open to the defendant on the way the Crown chose to put its case to adduce any evidence he wanted to establish his wealth, the legitimacy of his business dealings or (more materially in this case) the absence of any prior cannabis dealings or of any benefit or proceeds deriving from them. This he singularly failed to do, declining to give evidence at the confiscation stage.</p>
<p class="para">111.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not surprisingly in these circumstances, Mr Owen’s emphasis was on the supposed effect and consequences of European Court of Justice case-law which, he submits, requires the court, through the prism of s.3 of the Human Rights Act, to put some different interpretation on the scheme of the Drug Trafficking Act (or, possibly, simply to declare it incompatible, although he did not stress this aspect, since it would not have any immediate domestic effect on the order made against his client). </p>
<p class="para">112.&nbsp;&nbsp;The relevant case-law starts with <i>Engel v. The Netherlands (No. 1) </i>(1976) 1 EHRR 647 in which the European Court of Human Rights ruled that article 6(2) of the Convention (“Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law”) “deals only with the proof of guilt and not with the kind or level of punishment” and that a court was “for the sole purpose of determining their punishment [i.e. the punishment of the two convicted applicants] in the light of their character and previous record” entitled to take into consideration “certain similar, established facts the truth of which they did not challenge".   </p>
<p class="para">113.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Welch v. United Kingdom</i> (Application 17440/90) (1995) 20 EHRR 247, the issue was whether a confiscation order made retrospectively under the 1986 Act amounted to a penalty within article 7 of the Convention.<i> </i>The Court identified several aspects of the regime as in keeping with the idea of a penalty, including “the sweeping statutory assumptions ….., the fact that the confiscation order is directed to the proceeds involved in drug dealing and is not limited to actual enrichment or profit ….., the discretion of the trial judge in fixing the amount of the order, to take into account the degree of culpability of the accused …… [I note in parenthesis that this so-called “discretion” was explained in par. 13 of the judgment as a reference to the possibility that the judge might conclude that different defendants had played unequal roles and had as a result profited to different extents]; and the possibility of imprisonment in default of payment by the offender. The Court was however careful to stress that its conclusion that a penalty had been imposed in breach of article 7(1) “concerns only the retrospective application of the relevant legislation and does not call into question in any respect the powers of confiscation conferred on the courts as a weapon in the fight against the scourge of drug trafficking” (par. 36). </p>
<p class="para">114.&nbsp;&nbsp;Next is <i>McIntosh v. Lord Advocate </i>[2001] UKPC D1, a devolution case decided on 5th February 2001, after a hearing on 24-25th January 2001. Assumptions had been made against a convicted defendant under s.3 of the Scottish Proceeds of Crime Act 1995 which was in similar terms to s.4 of the English and Welsh 1994 Act, with the important difference that the making of assumptions was discretionary. It was argued that in relation to an application for a confiscation order a convicted defendant was a person “charged with a criminal offence” and so entitled to rely on the presumption of innocence under article 6(2) of the Convention. Allowing an appeal from the Appeal Court of the High Court of Justiciary, Lord Bingham of Cornhill, giving the leading speech with which all other members of the Privy Council agreed, rejected the argument, listing “compelling reasons” why this would not be the correct analysis under Scottish law, and finding nothing in Strasbourg jurisprudence, including <i>Engels </i>and <i>Welch</i>, pointing towards a different result. </p>
<p class="para">115.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Bingham’s compelling reasons merit quotation in full:</p>
<p class="qt">“(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;The application is not initiated by complaint or indictment and is not governed by the ordinary rules of criminal procedure.</p>
<p class="para">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;The application may only be made if the accused is convicted, and cannot be pursued if he is acquitted. </p>
<p class="para">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;The application forms part of the sentencing procedure.</p>
<p class="para">(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused is at no time accused of committing any crime other than that which permits the application to be made.</p>
<p class="para">(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;When, as is standard procedure in anything other than the simplest case, the prosecutor lodges an application under section 9, that application (usually supported by detailed schedules) is an accounting record and not an accusation.</p>
<p class="para">(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum ordered to be confiscated need not be the profit made from the drug trafficking offence of which the accused has been convicted, or any other drug trafficking offence.</p>
<p class="para">(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;If the accused fails to pay the sum he is ordered to pay under the order, the term of imprisonment which he will be ordered to serve in default is imposed not for the commission of any drug trafficking offence but on his failure to pay the sum ordered and to procure compliance.</p>
<p class="para">(8)&nbsp;&nbsp;The transactions of which account is taken in the confiscation proceedings may be the subject of a later prosecution, which would be repugnant to the rule against double jeopardy if the accused were charged with a criminal offence in the confiscation proceedings.</p>
<p class="para">(9)&nbsp;&nbsp;The proceedings do not culminate in a verdict, which would (in proceedings on indictment) be a matter for the jury if the accused were charged with a criminal offence.”</p>
<p class="para">Lord Bingham continued:</p>
<p class="qt">“It is of course true that if, following conviction of the accused and application by the prosecutor for a confiscation order, the court chooses to make the assumptions specified in section 3(2) of the 1995 Act or either of them, an assumption is made (unless displaced) that the accused has been engaged in drug trafficking which, as defined in section 49(2), (3) and (4), may (but need not) have been criminal.  But there is no assumption that he has been guilty of drug trafficking offences as defined in section 49(5).  The process involves no inquiry into the commission of drug trafficking offences.  Unless Strasbourg jurisprudence points towards a different result, I would not conclude that a person against whom application for a confiscation order is made is, by virtue of that application, a person charged with a criminal offence.”</p>
<p class="para">It is clear that Lord Bingham regarded a domestic scheme like the present as a composite unity, with the assumptions, where made, as only one element, and nothing turning on whether or not they were made. Lord Hope of Craighead in a brief judgment added the observation that, by the time the judge was concerned with confiscation, the article 6(2) stage was “passed” and “The court is concerned only with confiscation of the kind which the law prescribes where the conviction is for a drug trafficking offence. The respondent is not now being charged with another offence, nor is he at risk in these proceedings of being sentenced again for the offence of which he has been convicted” (par.43).  </p>
