<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;71. In most cases, how far the responsibility of the defendant ought fairly to extend evokes an immediate intuitive response.  This is informed common sense by another name.  Usually, there is no difficulty in selecting, from the sequence of events leading to the plaintiff's loss, the happening which should be regarded as the cause of the loss for the purpose of allocating responsibility. In other cases, when the outcome of the second inquiry is not obvious, it is of crucial importance to identify the purpose of the relevant cause of action and the nature and scope of the defendant's obligation in the particular circumstances.  What was the ambit of the defendant's duty?  In respect of what risks or damage does the law seek to afford protection by means of the particular tort?  Recent decisions of this House have highlighted the point.  When evaluating the extent of the losses for which a negligent valuer should be responsible the scope of the valuer's duty must first be identified: see <i>Banque Bruxelles Lambert SA v Eagle Star Insurance Co Ltd</i> [1997]  AC 191.  In<i> Reeves v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis</i> [2000]  1 AC 360 the free, deliberate and informed act of a human being, there committing suicide, did not negative responsibility to his dependants when the defendant's duty was to guard against that very act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72. The need to have in mind the purpose of the relevant cause of action is not confined to the second, evaluative stage of the twofold inquiry.  It may also arise at the earlier stage of the 'but for' test, to which I now return.  This guideline principle is concerned to identify and exclude losses lacking a causal connection with the wrongful conduct.  Expressed in its simplest form, the principle poses the question whether the plaintiff would have suffered the loss without ('but for') the defendant's wrongdoing.  If he would not, the wrongful conduct was <i>a</i> cause of the loss.  If the loss would have arisen even without the defendant's wrongdoing, normally it does not give rise to legal liability. In <i>Barnett v Chelsea and Kensington Hospital Management Committee</i> [1969]  1 QB 428 the night watchman's death did not pass this test.  He would have died from arsenic poisoning even if the hospital casualty department had treated him properly.  Of course, even if the plaintiff's loss passes this exclusionary threshold test, it by no means follows that the defendant should be legally responsible for the loss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73. This threshold 'but for' test is based on the presence or absence of one particular type of causal connection: whether the wrongful conduct was a necessary condition of the occurrence of the harm or loss.  In the <i>Barnett</i> case the hospital's negligence was not a necessary element in the conditions which led to the watchman's death.  He would have died anyway.  In very many cases this test operates satisfactorily, but it is not always a reliable guide.  Academic writers have drawn attention to its limitations: see, for example, the late Professor Fleming's <i>The Law of Torts</i>, 9th ed (1998), pp 222-230, and Markesinis &amp; Deacon <i>Tort Law</i>, 4th ed (1999), pp 178-191.  Torts cover a wide field and may be committed in an infinite variety of situations.  Even the sophisticated variants of the 'but for' test cannot be expected to set out a formula whose mechanical application will provide infallible threshold guidance on causal connection for every tort in every circumstance.  In particular, the 'but for' test can be over-exclusionary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74. This may occur where more than one wrongdoer is involved.  The classic example is where two persons independently search for the source of a gas leak with the aid of lighted candles.  According to the simple 'but for' test, neither would be liable for damage caused by the resultant explosion.  In this type of case, involving multiple wrongdoers, the court may treat wrongful conduct as having sufficient causal connection with the loss for the purpose of attracting responsibility even though the simple 'but for' test is not satisfied.  In so deciding the court is primarily making a value judgment on responsibility.  In making this judgment the court will have regard to the purpose sought to be achieved by the relevant tort, as applied to the particular circumstances. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75. One situation where the courts have had to grapple with the multiple wrongdoers' conundrum concerns  how far the liability of one wrongdoer should be diminished by loss flowing from the conduct of another wrongdoer.  This has arisen particularly in the context of personal injuries, where the plaintiff was first injured by one wrongdoer and later by another, and in the context of a ship suffering successive collisions at sea.  Another situation is where the defendant's wrongful act caused damage to the plaintiff, but even if he had acted lawfully the same or similar damage would have been produced by the wrongful act of someone else. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76. Elements of both these situations are present in the instant case.  The government of Iraq had already seized KAC's aircraft before IAC wrongfully converted them.  And even if IAC had not converted them in autumn 1990, presumably the government of Iraq or some other emanation of the state would have wrongfully retained possession of the aircraft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77. I turn therefore to consider the purpose sought to be achieved by the tort of conversion.  Conversion is the principal means whereby English law protects the ownership of goods.  Misappropriation of another's goods constitutes conversion.  Committing this tort gives rise to an obligation to pay damages.  Payment of damages may have proprietary consequences.  Payment of damages assessed on the footing that the plaintiff is being compensated for the whole of his interest in the goods extinguishes his title: see section 5 of the Torts (Interference with Goods) Act 1977.  Further, when the defendant is in possession of the plaintiff's goods the remedies available to the plaintiff include a court order that the goods be delivered up: see section 3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78. Consistently with its purpose of providing a remedy for the misappropriation of goods, liability is strict.  As Diplock LJ said in <i>Marfani &amp; Co Ltd v Midland Bank Ltd</i> [1968]  1 WLR 956, 970-971, one's duty to one's neighbour is to refrain from doing any voluntary act in relation to his goods which is a usurpation of his property or possessory rights in them.  Whether the defendant still has the goods or their proceeds matters not.  Nor does it matter whether the defendant was a thief or acted in the genuine and reasonable belief the goods were his.  Baron Cleasby's aphorism, uttered in 1872 in <i>Fowler v Hollins</i> LR 7 QB 616, 639, still represents the law: 'persons deal with the property in chattels or exercise acts of ownership over them at their peril'.  This, he observed, was regarded as a salutary rule for the protection of property.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79. Some aspects of this rule have attracted criticism.  Vindication of a plaintiff's proprietary interests requires that, in general, all those who convert his goods should be accountable for <i>benefits</i> they receive.  They must make restitution to the extent they are unjustly enriched.  The goods are his, and he is entitled to reclaim them and any benefits others have derived from them.  Liability in this regard should be strict subject to defences available to restitutionary claims such as change of position: see <i>Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd</i> [1991]  2 AC 548.  Additionally, those who act dishonestly should be liable to make good any <i>losses</i> caused by their wrongful conduct.  Whether those who act innocently should also be liable to make good the plaintiff's losses is a different matter.  A radical re-appraisal of the tort of conversion along these lines was not pursued on these appeals.  So I shall say nothing more about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80. The existing principle of strict liability as described above is deeply ingrained in the common law.  It has survived at least since the days of Lord Mansfield in <i>Cooper v Chitty</i> (1756)  1 Burr 20.  The hardship it may cause to those who deal innocently with a person in possession of goods has long been recognised.  Blackburn J noted this in the leading case of <i>Hollins v Fowler</i> (1875) LR 7 HL 757, 764.  The hardship arises especially for innocent persons who no longer have the goods.  There has been some statutory amelioration of the principle, in the Factors Acts and elsewhere, but in general the principle endures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81. Consistently with this principle, every person through whose hands goods pass in a series of conversions is himself guilty of conversion and liable to the owner for the loss caused by his misappropriation of the owner's goods.  His liability is not diminished by reason, for instance, of his having acquired the goods from a thief as distinct from the owner himself.  In such a case, it may be said, looking at the successive conversions overall, the owner is no worse off as a result of the acts of the person who acquired the goods from the thief.  Such a person has not 'caused' the owner any additional loss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82. In one sense this is undoubtedly correct.  The owner had already lost his goods.  But that is really nothing to the point for the purposes of assessing damages for conversion.  By definition, each person in a series of conversions wrongfully excludes the owner from possession of his goods.  This is the basis on which each is liable to the owner.  That is the nature of the tort of conversion.  The wrongful acts of a previous possessor do not therefore diminish the plaintiff's claim in respect of the wrongful acts of a later possessor.  Nor, for a different reason, is it anything to the point that, absent the defendant's conversion, someone else would wrongfully have converted the goods.  The likelihood that, had the defendant not wronged the plaintiff, somebody would have done so is no reason for diminishing the defendant's liability and responsibility for the loss he brought upon the plaintiff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83. Where, then, does this leave the simple 'but for' test in cases of successive conversion?  I suggest that, if the test is to be applied at all, the answer lies in keeping in mind, as I have said, that each person in a series of conversions wrongfully excludes the owner from possession of his goods.  The exclusionary threshold test is to be applied on this footing.  Thus the test calls for consideration of whether the plaintiff would have suffered the loss in question had he retained his goods and not been unlawfully deprived of them by the defendant.  The test calls for a comparison between the owner's position had he retained his goods and his position having been deprived of his goods by the defendant.  Loss which the owner would have suffered even if he had retained the goods is not loss 'caused' by the conversion.  The defendant is not liable for such loss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84. The Court of Appeal decision in <i>Hiort v London and North Western Railway Co</i> (1879)  4 Exch Div 188, mentioned above, can be analysed in this way.  Hiort would equally have received no payment for his goods if, instead of misdelivering the goods, the railway company had delivered them in accordance with his instructions.  <i>Hiort's </i>case was not a case of successive conversions.  But the like comparison can  equally be made in such a case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85. For these reasons I consider KAC's claims in respect of the Iran six do not fail at the threshold stage.  Had KAC not been unlawfully deprived of its goods by IAC KAC would not have suffered any of the heads of loss it is now claiming.  Had KAC retained possession of the Iran six, the aircraft would not have been evacuated to Iran.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86. Furthermore, contrary to IAC's submission, it would not be right to award damages by reference to the (insignificant) losses caused to KAC by the individual acts evidencing conversion, such as overpainting and using one aircraft for commercial flights.  The wrongful conduct lay in unlawfully depriving KAC of its aircraft.</p>
<i><p>The Iran six: 'user damages'</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87. I have noted that the fundamental object of an award of damages for conversion is to award just compensation for loss suffered.  Sometimes, when the goods or their equivalent are returned, the owner suffers no financial loss.  But the wrongdoer may well have benefited from his temporary use of the owner's goods.  It would not be right that he should be able to keep this benefit.  The court may order him to pay damages assessed by reference to the value of the benefit he derived from his wrongdoing.  I considered this principle in <i>Attorney General v Blake</i> [2001]  1 AC 268, 278-280.  In an appropriate case the court may award damages on this 'user principle' in addition to compensation for loss suffered.  For instance, if the goods are returned damaged, the court may award damages assessed by reference to the benefit obtained by the wrongdoer as well as the cost of repair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88. Recognition that damages may be awarded on this principle may assist in making some awards of damages in conversion cases more coherent.  For example, I respectfully think this is the preferable basis for the award of damages in <i>Solloway v McLaughlin</i> [1938]  AC 247 in respect of Solloway's misappropriation of the 14,000 shares deposited with him by McLaughlin.  McLaughlin suffered no financial loss from the misappropriation, because equivalent shares were returned to McLaughlin when he closed his account.  But Solloway profited by the fall in the value of the shares by selling them when they were deposited with him and repurchasing them at the lower market price obtaining when McLaughlin closed his account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89. A similar observation may be made regarding the outcome in <i>BBMB Finance (Hong Kong) Ltd v Eda Holdings Ltd</i> [1990]  1 WLR 409.  The owner recovered all his shares or their equivalent.  The wrongdoer's misuse of the shares caused the owner no financial loss.  But, on the face of the transactions (the facts relating to the unpresented cheque are obscure), the defendant benefited by selling the owner's shares at a high price and replacing them with shares bought at a lower price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90. In the present case no claim for an award of 'user damages' has ever been pleaded or formally formulated.  Mr Vos sought to advance such a claim before your Lordships' House regarding the Iran six.  I consider it is much too late in these protracted proceedings for KAC now to advance this new claim for the first time.</p>
<i><p>The Iran six: intervening acts, and the costs of recovery and repair</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91. The Iran six were sent to Iran on the orders of the government of Iraq.  They were impounded there by the government of Iran until their eventual return.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92. These facts do not excuse IAC from liability for the adverse financial consequences of the detention of the aircraft in Iran.  A person who misappropriates another's goods does so at his own risk.  That is the nature of the wrong.  He takes upon himself the risk of being unable to return the goods to their rightful owner.  It matters not that he may be prevented from returning the goods due to unforeseen circumstances beyond his control.  The reason for his non-return of the goods, or his delay in returning the goods, is neither here nor there so far as his liability to the owner is concerned.  If the goods are eventually returned, thereby diminishing the financial loss suffered by the owner, this must be taken into account.  But the wrongdoer's liability ought fairly to extend to compensating the owner for the loss he sustains by virtue of his temporary loss of his goods, regardless of the impact any unforeseen circumstances may have had on the wrongdoer.  The loss flowing from the unforeseen circumstances should be borne by the wrongdoer, not the innocent owner of the goods.  Additionally, provided the amount is not out of proportion to the value of the goods, the wrongdoer ought to reimburse the owner for any money spent on recovering the goods or carrying out necessary repairs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93. Here, after much negotiation, in July 1992 the Iranian government notified the Kuwaiti government of its willingness to release the Iran six.  The aircraft were flown back to Kuwait in July and August 1992 on the understanding that payment would be agreed subsequently.  In March 1994 KAC agreed to pay $20 million to the government of Iran for the costs and expenses of keeping, sheltering and maintaining the Iran six.  The payment was made in four tranches and was completed by the end of September 1994.  Had the Iranian government insisted on this payment being made before releasing the aircraft, there could be no room for doubt that KAC was fairly entitled to recover this expenditure from IAC.  It was the cost incurred by KAC in regaining its aircraft.  I do not think the precise sequence of events which occurred, with the aircraft released before the amount payable was agreed or the payment was made, alters the position.  If KAC had not adhered to the arrangements made at the time of the release it would have placed itself in an impossible position for the future, if only in terms of over-flying and landing rights in relation to Iran.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94. Nor is there any room for doubt that, in principle, IAC is responsible for the reasonable costs incurred by KAC in overhauling and repairing the aircraft when they were returned.</p>
<i><p>The Iran six: consequential losses</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95. KAC was an operating airline.  The ten aircraft seized in the invasion were the major part of its fleet.  When the hostilities ended KAC found itself without most of its aircraft  It was eminently to be expected that until the missing aircraft were replaced, KAC would need to hire substitute aircraft capacity, both for passengers and cargo.  Furthermore, it was eminently to be expected that until substitute capacity was obtained KAC would suffer losses of business and might suffer loss of profits.  I see no reason to question that IAC's liability to KAC ought to extend to meeting the reasonable costs of chartering substitute aircraft and making good any loss of profits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96. The other head of consequential loss claimed by KAC comprises finance costs associated with buying replacement aircraft.  This claim is more difficult.  The basis of this claim is as follows.  Faced with the destruction of the Mosul four and the detention of the Iran six, KAC decided to buy new rather than second hand replacements.  As Kuwait's flag carrier, KAC customarily bought new aircraft rather than used aircraft.  In the normal course KAC replaced its aircraft on a 15-year cycle. Its practice was to accumulate funds needed to buy replacement aircraft over this 15-year cycle.  Since KAC's aircraft were seized broadly in the middle of their 15-year life cycles, KAC had to borrow money to buy replacement aircraft between 1991 and 1995.  KAC calculated that the additional cost of replacing the ten aircraft in the middle rather than at the end of their 15-year cycles was about $290 million.  KAC gives credit for the sale prices obtained for the Iran six and for the scrap value of the Mosul four.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97. Had the matter rested there KAC's claim might have been supportable, due allowance being made for the betterment resulting from the early replacement of the fleet.  But there is more to the story.  The new aircraft bought by KAC were not mere replacements for the ten aircraft misappropriated by IAC.  Having lost most of its fleet, KAC used the occasion to carry out a fundamental reappraisal of its aircraft requirements in the light of changing market conditions.  These requirements dictated that the composition of KAC's fleet should be significantly different from its existing fleet.  Different aircraft, with different specifications, were called for.  Accordingly, in the early 1990s KAC did not seek to restore the airline to the position which would have existed if the Mosul four had survived intact and the Iran six had not become temporarily unavailable.  KAC did not set out to replace the aircraft it had lost with the same models, or the closest available.  It did not just buy new for old.  The ten aircraft seized included five Airbus A310-200s.  New aircraft of this model were still available for purchase from Airbus, but KAC chose to buy different aircraft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98. This was not an unreasonable course for KAC to take.  Indeed, it would have made no commercial sense for KAC to replace the ten aircraft without regard to its current and anticipated aircraft requirements.  KAC was forced to review its aircraft requirements, and it seized the opportunity to make significant changes in the composition of its fleet.  This may well have been a commercially wise decision.  But I do not think it would be right to saddle IAC with the finance costs associated with this substantial restructuring of KAC's fleet.  In agreement with the Court of Appeal and with the view expressed by Aikens J on this point, although not for precisely the same reasons, I would not allow this head of claim.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99. The parties presented to the House extensive written and oral arguments on whether the test for liability for consequential loss in cases of conversion is reasonable foreseeability as distinct from whether the loss arises naturally and directly from the wrong.  By consequential loss I mean loss beyond that represented by the value of the goods.  The route I have followed in reaching my conclusions on KAC's claims under this head makes it strictly unnecessary to express any opinion on this point.  Nevertheless, in the absence of clear authority, I ought to state my view briefly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100. Expressed in terms of the traditional guideline principles, the choice is between confining liability for consequential loss to damage which is 'foreseeable', as distinct from damage flowing 'directly and naturally' from the wrongful conduct.  In practice, these two tests usually yield the same result.  Where they do not, the foreseeability test is likely to be the more restrictive.  The prevalent view is that the more restrictive test of foreseeability is applicable to the torts of negligence, nuisance and <i>Rylands v Fletcher</i>: see the two <i>Waggon Mound</i> cases ([1961]  AC 388 and [1967] 1 AC 617) and <i>Cambridge Water Co v Eastern Counties Leather Plc</i> [1994]  2 AC 264.  The Court of Appeal recently applied this test to the tort of conversion, apparently without any contrary argument, in <i>Saleslease Ltd v Davis</i> [1999]  1 WLR 1664, although the members of the court differed in the application of the principle to the facts of the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101. In contrast, the less restrictive test is applicable in deceit.  The more culpable the defendant the wider the area of loss for which he can fairly be held responsible: see the discussion by my noble and learned friend Lord Steyn in <i>Smith New Court Securities Ltd v Scrimgeour Vickers (Asset Management) Ltd </i>[1997]  AC 254, 279-285.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102. This bifurcation causes difficulty with the tort of conversion.  Dishonesty is not an essential ingredient of this wrong.  The defendant may be a thief, or he may have acted wholly innocently.  Both are strictly liable.  But it seems to me inappropriate they should be treated alike when determining their liability for consequential loss.  Parliament, indeed, has recognised that for some purposes different considerations should apply to persons who steal goods, or knowingly receive stolen goods, and persons who can show they bought the goods in good faith.  In respect of the tort of conversion the Limitation Act 1980 prescribes different limitation provisions for these two types of cases: see sections 3 and 4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103. I have already mentioned that, as the law now stands, the tort of conversion may cause hardship for innocent persons.  This suggests that foreseeability, as the more restrictive test, is appropriate for those who act in good faith.  Liability remains strict, but liability for consequential loss is confined to types of damage which can be expected to arise from the wrongful conduct.  You deal with goods at the risk of discovering later that, unbeknown to you, you have not acquired a good title.  That is the strict common law principle.  The risk is that, should you not have acquired title, you will be liable to the owner for the losses he can expect to have suffered as a result of your misappropriation of his goods.  That seems the preferable approach, in the case of a person who can prove he acted in the genuine belief the goods were his.  A person in possession of goods knows where and how he acquired them.  It is up to him to establish he was innocent of any knowing wrongdoing.  This is the approach Parliament has taken in section 4 of the Limitation Act 1980.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104. Persons who knowingly convert another's goods stand differently.  Such persons are acting dishonestly.  I can see no good reason why the remoteness test of 'directly and naturally' applied in cases of deceit should not apply in cases of conversion where the defendant acted dishonestly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105. I would dismiss both appeals, and pay tribute to the meticulous care and thoroughness of Mance J, Aikens J and the Court of Appeal in their treatment of the factual and legal complexities in these proceedings.</p>
<p><b>LORD STEYN</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106. The subject-matter of this action was 10 commercial passenger aircraft belonging to Kuwait Airways Corporation ("KAC") which were at Kuwait International Airport on 2 August 1990 when Iraq invaded Kuwait.  Iraq completed its occupation of Kuwait within three days and proclaimed the integration of Kuwait into Iraq.  Iraq systematically set about plundering the assets of Kuwait.  On 9 September 1990 the Government of Iraq (called the Revolutionary Command Council) promulgated Resolution 369.  It read as follows:</p>
<p></p><ul>"I.(1)  That the Kuwait Airways Corporation be dissolved and all its fixed and liquid assets, rights and liabilities be transferred to the Iraqi Airways Co, who will register all assets in accordance with domestic and international laws. (2)  All assets belonging to Kuwait Airways are to be transferred to the Iraqi Airways Co, as soon as this resolution comes into effect."<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"II.  All activities of Kuwait Airways offices abroad must cease and all their assets are to be transferred to the Iraqi Airways Co, in accordance with clause I of this resolution.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"III.  The board of Iraqi Airways is to conduct a complete survey of all Kuwait Airways personnel and determine the level of the workforce in the light of current needs and central directives.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>IV.  All withdrawal authorisations granted to Kuwait Airways employees are cancelled from the date this resolution comes into effect . . ."<p></p></ul>
<p>On 17 September 1990 Resolution 369 came into effect.  On the same day Iraq Airways Co ("IAC") implemented Resolution 369.  Previously, and on various dates in August 1990, IAC pilots had flown the 10 aircraft to Iraq.  At the time of the promulgation and coming into effect of Resolution 369 the 10 aircraft were in Iraq.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107. The international response to Iraq's flagrant breach of international law was prompt and comprehensive.  On 2 August 1990 the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 660 which condemned the invasion of Kuwait as a breach of international peace and security.  This was followed by a series of supplementary Security Council Resolutions which decreed that the annexation of Kuwait was null and void; called on member states to give no recognition directly or indirectly to any aspect of the annexation; and required all states to impose sanctions on Iraq.  These measures were duly taken under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter.</p>
