<p align="right"><a href="obg-4.htm">(back to preceding text)</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there any conceptual problem about the fact that the obligation of confidence was imposed only in respect of a particular form of information, namely, photographic images?  I do not see why there should be.  If <i>OK!</i> was willing to pay for the right to be the only source of that particular form of information and did not mind that others were free to communicate other forms of information about the wedding, then I think the Douglases should be able to impose a suitably limited obligation of confidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120.&nbsp;&nbsp;My noble and learned friends, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead and Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe, are troubled by the fact that the information in the photographic images was not intended to be kept secret but to be published to the world by <i>OK!</i> and was so published at much the same time as the unauthorised photographs in <i>Hello!</i>.  But I see no reason why there should not be an obligation of confidence for the purpose of enabling someone to be the only source of publication if that is something worth paying for. Why should a newspaper not be entitled to impose confidentiality on its journalists, sub-editors and so forth to whom it communicates information about some scoop which it intends to publish next day?  That does not of course prevent publication by someone who receives the information otherwise than under an obligation of confidence. And I say nothing about cases in which there is a public interest in communicating the information to others or the public at large.   But otherwise it is simply information of commercial value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121.&nbsp;&nbsp;My noble and learned friend, Lord Nicholls, is also of opinion that once the approved photographs were published, the publication of the unauthorised photographs was not a breach of confidence.  I cannot understand this.  Mr Thorpe was subject to an obligation of confidence in respect of the pictures which he took.  <i>Hello!</i>, by reason of the circumstances in which they acquired the pictures, were subject to the same obligation.  How could it be destroyed by <i>OK!'s</i> publication of other photographs a few hours earlier?  He says that the differences between the photographs were "insufficiently significant to call for legal protection"; "the unapproved pictures contained nothing not included in the approved pictures".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, it is certainly the case that once information gets into the public domain, it can no longer be the subject of confidence.  Whatever the circumstances in which it was obtained, there is no point in the law providing protection.  But whether this is the case or not depends on the nature of the information.  Whether there is still a point in enforcing the obligation of confidence depends on the facts.  If the purpose of publishing the pictures was simply to convey the information that the Douglases had married, the bride wore a wedding dress and so forth, then the publication of any photographs would have put that information in the public domain.  So would a description of the event.  In this case, however, the point of the transaction was that each picture would be treated as a separate piece of information which <i>OK!</i> would have the exclusive right to publish.  The pictures published by <i>OK!</i> were put into the public domain and it would have had to rely on the law of copyright,  not the law of confidence, to prevent their reproduction.  But no other pictures were in the public domain and they did not enter the public domain merely because they resembled other pictures which had.  Why was <i>Hello!</i> willing to pay Mr Thorpe so much money for information which was already in the public domain?  Why did the judge find that the publication of information which did not, in Lord Nicholls's words, "call for legal protection", had caused substantial financial loss to <i>OK!</i>?  My Lords, this seems to me a point on which theory is in danger of losing touch with reality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal's analysis, which treats the obligation of confidence as having been imposed in favour of <i>OK!</i> only in respect of the photographs with which it was supplied by the Douglases, also seems to me to make no commercial sense. The essential purpose of the security arrangements and the prohibition of unauthorised photography were to impose an obligation of confidence in respect of <i>any</i> pictures of the wedding.  Only in that way could the commercial interests of <i>OK!</i> be protected. And it was clear to everyone, Mr Thorpe and Senor Sanchez Junco in particular, that this obligation was imposed for the benefit of <i>OK!</i> as well as the Douglases.  As the Court of Appeal put it when stating OK's argument, ([2006] QB at para 138) "the photographs published by <i>Hello!</i> fell within a generic class of commercially confidential information…which <i>OK!</i> were entitled to protect".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;124.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there any reason of public policy why the law of confidence should not protect information of this form and subject-matter?  There is in my opinion no question of creating an "image right" or any other unorthodox form of intellectual property.  The information in this case was capable of being protected, not because it concerned the Douglases' image any more than because it concerned their private life, but simply because it was information of commercial value over which the Douglases had sufficient control to enable them to impose an obligation of confidence.  Some may view with distaste a world in which information about the events of a wedding, which Warren and Brandeis in their famous article on privacy in (1890) 4 Harvard LR 193 regarded as a paradigm private occasion, should be sold in the market in the same way as information about how to make a better mousetrap.  But being a celebrity or publishing a celebrity magazine are lawful trades and I see no reason why they should be outlawed from such protection as the law of confidence may offer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125.&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore think that the Court of Appeal was wrong to reverse the judge on this point. Mr Price QC, who appeared for <i>Hello!</i>, also relied upon two other arguments.  First, he said that to hold that participants in a "celebrity event" can impose a duty of confidence upon those who attend would give rise to inconsistency with the "carefully constructed" scheme of statutory performing rights in Part II of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988.  I cannot see how there can be a conflict between such statutory rights and any additional rights which may exist under the common law. One might as well say that the law of contract is inconsistent because it allows for the possibility of a performer bargaining for greater rights than he would have under the statute.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;126.&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Mr Price submitted that under the law of New York Mr Thorpe owed no obligation to keep the information confidential. The Statement of Facts and Issues records that under New York law "there would have been no inhibition upon Mr Thorpe publishing the photographs which he had taken". We are not told the basis of this statement. The judge found that Mr Thorpe must have been "at least a trespasser" by the law of New York.  It may be that, under the First Amendment, he was entitled to publish in New York notwithstanding the circumstances in which the photographs were obtained. But that does not mean that he or anyone deriving title from him is entitled to publish in England. There is nothing to suggest that an obligation of confidence cannot be imposed in New York, even though it may be overridden by a constitutional right to freedom of expression. But the question of whether that obligation of confidence can entitle the beneficiary to restrain publication in England is a matter of English law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;127.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore allow the appeal of <i>OK!</i> and restore the order of the judge. Mr Price submitted that the award of damages should not be allowed in full because, on the evidence, a substantial part of the loss was caused by the publication of the unauthorized photographs in national daily newspapers rather than in <i>Hello!</i>  But the judge considered this point in his supplemental judgment on damages and came to the conclusion that the full losses were "sufficiently consequential upon the breach and sufficiently foreseeable as to make <i>Hello!</i> liable for them in the ordinary way" (paragraph 48). Further, in paragraph 53 he said that —</p>
<p></p><ul>"I do not regard the newspaper publications of the pictures as so remote a consequence of Hello!'s publication as not to be laid at Hello!'s door and plainly the newspaper publications would not have occurred as they did but for Hello!'s publication of the unauthorized photographs."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;128.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of these findings of fact I would not disturb the judge's award.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;129.&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of my conclusion that <i>OK!</i> was entitled to sue for breach of an obligation of confidentiality to itself, it is a little artificial to discuss the alternative claim on the footing that the obligation was owed solely to the Douglases.  I would have considerable difficulty in reconciling such a hypothetical claim with <i>RCA Corporation v Pollard</i> [1983]  Ch 135 and <i>Isaac Oren v Red Box Toy Factory Ltd</i> [1999]  FSR 785.  Neither Mr Thorpe nor <i>Hello!</i> did anything to interfere with the liberty of the Douglases to deal with <i>OK!</i> or perform their obligations under their contract. All they did was to make <i>OK!'s</i> contractual rights less profitable than they would otherwise have been.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;130.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I should make it clear that in my opinion such a claim should not have failed for the reasons given by the judge and the Court of Appeal, namely that <i>Hello!</i> did not intend to cause loss to <i>OK!</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;131.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their conclusion was based upon the evidence of Senor Sanchez Junor, the controlling shareholder of <i>Hello!'s</i> Spanish holding company, who had made the decision to publish.  The judge set out this evidence at paragraphs 245-249 of his judgment, from which I shall quote extracts.  First, there was his written evidence:</p>
<p></p><ul>"I want to state categorically that there was never an intention to cause damage to any of the claimants…because we have always treated them in Hello! with deference and sympathy, in accordance with the magazine style. In our 60-year history we have never tried to damage anyone. Therefore, we would not want to do it to people whom we have always treated fairly and objectively in our reports portraying them in the best possible light. With respect to OK! we took it for granted that, without a doubt, they would have a great editorial success, as they had a great exclusive and consequently, the magazine would be sold under excellent conditions as was the case. Our main purpose was to inform our readers about an event which had been publicised all over the media for weeks before the wedding, which shows that this wedding was of interest for the United Kingdom. We did not wish to disappoint our readers. It was never our aim or intention to damage the third claimant, our prime motivation was only to give our readers information on the wedding of two celebrities, about whom, without doubt, our readers expected to read in Hello!..."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;132.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was his oral evidence, summarized by the judge:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Senor Sanchez Junco disavowed having acted in revenge against the Douglases for his not getting the exclusive he so wished; rather he wanted, despite losing the exclusive, to publish an edition that would interest his readers, the event being one which had captured the imagination of the public. His act, he said, was not of revenge but of salvage. He denied having the intention of spoiling OK!'s sales adding … 'my motive was never to spoil the exclusive of OK!. I repeat, I wanted to defend as far as I could my publication … My priority was to save my publication after having, in the light of a very important big loss, and that is that of the exclusive, and I didn't think of the possible damage that I could inflict on Hello! or the Douglases…'"<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;133.&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge concluded:</p>
<p></p><ul>"I…accept the evidence [Senor Sanchez Junco gave on this subject.] Whilst I recognise that for a defendant to act out of self-interest does not, of itself, disprove that he had no intent to injure another, here I find on the evidence that there was no intent to injure by unlawful means because there was no intent to injure at all."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;134.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the position of Senor Sanchez Junco was that he wished to defend his publication against the damage it might suffer on account of having lost the exclusive.  But that, it seems to me, is precisely the position of every competitor who steps over the line and uses unlawful means. The injury which he inflicted on <i>OK!</i> in order to achieve the end of keeping up his sales was simply the other side of the same coin. His position was no different from Mr Gye saying that he had no wish to injure Mr Lumley and had the greatest respect for Her Majesty's Theatre but his intention was to improve attendance at his own theatre, or the master of the <i>Othello</i> saying that his intention was to buy more palm oil. Lord Sumner made this point pungently in <i>Sorrell v Smith</i> [1925]  AC 700, 742: </p>
<p></p><ul>"How any definite line is to be drawn between acts, whose real purpose is to advance the defendants' interests, and acts, whose real purpose is to injure the plaintiff in his trade, is a thing which I feel at present beyond my power. When the whole object of the defendants' action is to capture the plaintiff's business, their gain must be his loss. How stands the matter then? The difference disappears."<p></p></ul>
<p>The injury to <i>OK!</i> was the means of attaining Senor Sanchez Junor's desired end and not merely a foreseeable consequence of having done so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;135.&nbsp;&nbsp;The analysis of intention by the Court of Appeal in my opinion illustrates the danger of giving a wide meaning to the concept of unlawful means and then attempting to restrict the ambit of the tort by giving a narrow meaning to the concept of intention.  The effect is to enable virtually anyone who really has used unlawful means against a third party in order to injure the plaintiff to say that he intended only to enrich himself, or protect himself from loss.  The way to keep the tort within reasonable bounds is not to extend the concept of unlawful means beyond what was contemplated in <i>Allen v Flood</i>, rather than to give an artificially narrow meaning to the concept of intention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;136.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore have held that <i>Hello!</i> had the necessary intention to cause loss but not that they interfered by unlawful means with the actions of the Douglases. </p>
<p><b>LORD NICHOLLS OF BIRKENHEAD</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;137.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before your Lordships' House are three appeals.  They were heard consecutively because the legal issues overlap.  The first appeal, <i>OBG Ltd v Allan </i>[2005] QB 762,<i> </i>concerns a claim by a company in liquidation for damages in respect of losses sustained by the company through acts done by administrative receivers whose appointment was later held to be invalid.  The causes of action relied upon are conversion and wrongful interference with contractual relations.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;138.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second appeal, <i>Douglas v Hello! Ltd </i>[2006] QB 125, concerns the publication of photographs taken surreptitiously at a celebrity wedding held in private.  The causes of action relied upon are breach of confidence and unlawful interference with economic interests.  In the third appeal, <i>Mainstream Properties Ltd v Young </i>[2005] IRLR 964, the cause of action is wrongful interference with contractual relations.  The context is breaches by directors of their obligations to their company. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;139.&nbsp;&nbsp;Counsel's submissions were wide-ranging.  In particular the House is called upon to consider the ingredients of the tort of interference with a business by unlawful means and the tort of inducing breach of contract.  These are much vexed subjects.  Nearly 350 reported decisions and academic writings were placed before the House.  There are many areas of uncertainty.  Judicial observations are not always consistent, and academic consensus is noticeably absent.  In the words of one commentator, the law is in a 'terrible mess'.  So the House faces a daunting task.  For good measure your Lordships have also to review the scope of the tort of conversion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;140.&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall consider first the ingredients of the relevant economic torts. </p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interference with the claimant's business by unlawful means</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;141.&nbsp;&nbsp;I start with the tort comprising interference with a trade or business by unlawful means or, more shortly, the tort of unlawful interference.  The gist of this tort is intentionally damaging another's business by unlawful means.  Intention is an essential ingredient.  The tort is not one of strict liability for harm inflicted on another's business, nor is it a tort based on negligence.  The defendant must have intended to inflict the harm of which complaint is made.  That is the starting point.  I shall have to return to this point later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;142.&nbsp;&nbsp;But intent to harm is not enough. Intentional harm of another's business is not of itself tortious.  Competition between businesses regularly involves each business taking steps to promote itself at the expense of the other.  One retail business may reduce its prices to customers with a view to diverting trade to itself and away from a competitor shop.  Far from prohibiting such conduct, the common law seeks to encourage and protect it.  The common law recognises the economic advantages of competition.  </p>
<i>Unlawful means
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;143.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not to say that in this field of economic rivalry anything goes.  Business people are not free to promote their own businesses at the expense of others by whatever means they may choose.  There are limits.  The common law has long recognised that some forms of conduct, intentionally damaging other traders, are not acceptable.  A well-known passage from the judgment of Bowen LJ in the Court of Appeal in <i>Mogul Steamship Co Ltd v McGregor, Gow, &amp; Co</i> (1889) 23 QBD 598, 614, merits repetition: </p>
<p></p><ul>'What, then, are the limitations which the law imposes on a trader in the conduct of his business as between himself and other traders?  There seem to be no burdens or restrictions in law upon a trader which arise merely from the fact that he is a trader, and which are not equally laid on all other subjects of the Crown.  His right to trade freely is a right which the law recognises and encourages, but it is one which places him at no special disadvantage as compared with others.  No man, whether trader or not, can, however, justify damaging another in his commercial business by fraud or misrepresentation.  Intimidation, obstruction, and molestation are forbidden; so is the intentional procurement of a violation of individual rights, contractual or other, assuming always that there is no just cause for it.  …  But the defendants have been guilty of none of these acts.  They have done nothing more against the plaintiffs than pursue to the bitter end a war of competition waged in the interest of their own trade.  To the argument that a competition so pursued ceases to have a just cause or excuse when there is ill-will or a personal intention to harm, it is sufficient to reply  …  that there was here no personal intention to do any other or greater harm to the plaintiffs than such as was necessarily involved in the desire to attract to the defendants' ships the entire tea freights of the ports, a portion of which would otherwise have fallen to the plaintiffs' share.'<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;144.&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar approach has been adopted in cases involving labour disputes.  In <i>Allen v Flood</i> [1898] AC 1, 164, Lord Shand likened the labour dispute in that case to one of 'competition in labour', which he said 'is in all essentials analogous to competition in trade, and to which the same principles must apply'.  Lord Lindley adopted the same stance in another trade union case, <i>Quinn v Leathem</i> [1901] AC 495, 532-535.  Lord Lindley approved Bowen LJ's observations quoted above.  He said the underlying principles are that an act 'otherwise lawful', although harmful, does not become actionable because it is done simply with intent to annoy or harm.  But 'all wrongful acts' done intentionally to damage a particular individual and actually damaging him are remediable. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;145.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then the common law of England has adhered to the view that 'unlawful' conduct is a prerequisite of liability under the tort of unlawful interference with trade.  In the American case of <i>Tuttle v Buck</i> 119 NW 946 (1909) the court held a rich banker liable for spitefully driving the claimant barber out of business by opening a rival barber's shop and undercutting him.  That is not the law in England.  In this country intentionally causing damage without using unlawful means is not of itself actionable.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;146.&nbsp;&nbsp;The English approach has not lacked critics.  On the 'unlawful conduct' approach the tort is parasitic on conduct defined as unlawful otherwise than because it amounts to a wrong to the claimant.  This, it is said, is inherently unsatisfactory.  It is inherently unsatisfactory because it means that a tort concerned with the regulation of trade is geared to commission of illegalities which were created for altogether different reasons: see J D Heydon, 'Economic Torts', 2nd ed, (1978), page 124.  A wrong designed for some other purpose is being used as the criterion for deciding whether an act done with an intention to harm is acceptable.  This ingredient 'imposes an arbitrary and illogical limit on the development of a rational principle to explain this part of the law': Salmond &amp; Heuston, 'Law of Torts', 21st ed (1996), page 346.  It 'can produce capricious results in which the distinction between permissible and impermissible…comes to turn on fictitious and, from a practical viewpoint, even irrelevant factors': Professor Fleming, 'The Law of Torts', 9th ed, (1998), page 761. In <i>J T Stratford &amp; Son Ltd v Lindley</i> [1965] AC 269, 330, Viscount Radcliffe expressed unhappiness about this aspect of English law.  He said the trade dispute in that case should be resolved 'according to its substance, without the comparatively accidental issue whether breaches of contract are looked for and involved.'</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;147.&nbsp;&nbsp;These criticisms have force.  The contrary, pragmatic view is that in this difficult and uncertain area of the law there is perhaps something to be said for having an objective element of unlawfulness as the boundary of liability.  A defendant is not liable under this tort unless he has resorted to 'unlawful' means to achieve his end.  Tony Weir, a staunch supporter of this approach, says this requirement is 'entirely correct, sensible and practical': 'Economic Torts', (1997), page 3. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;148.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not propose to enter upon the pros and cons of this particular debate.  Your Lordships are not writing on a clean slate.  English courts have long recognised they are not best equipped to regulate competitive practices at large.  Parliament is better placed to decide what interests need protection and by what means.  Fry LJ said that 'to draw a line between fair and unfair competition, between what is reasonable and unreasonable, passes the powers of the courts': <i>Mogul Steamship Co Ltd v McGregor</i> (1889) 23 QBD 598, 625-626.  Since then Parliament has intervened on many occasions. The courts have taken, as their foothold, conduct which is unlawful.  In English law it is now well established that 'unlawful means' is an essential ingredient of this tort.  This goes back to the decision in <i>Allen v Flood</i> [1898] AC 1.  I shall proceed on this footing. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;149.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the need for 'unlawful means' is well established, the same cannot be said about the content of this expression.  There is some controversy about the scope of this expression in this context.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;150.&nbsp;&nbsp;One view is that this concept comprises, quite simply, all acts which a person is not permitted to do.  The distinction is between 'doing what you have a legal right to do and doing what you have no legal right to do': Lord Reid in <i>Rookes v Barnard</i> [1964] AC 1129, 1168-1169.  So understood, the concept of 'unlawful means' stretches far and wide.  It covers common law torts, statutory torts, crimes, breaches of contract, breaches of trust and equitable obligations, breaches of confidence, and so on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;151.&nbsp;&nbsp;Another view is that in this context 'unlawful means' comprise only civil wrongs.  Thus in <i>Allen v Flood</i> itself Lord Watson described illegal means as 'means which in themselves are in the nature of civil wrongs': [1898] AC 1, 97-98.  A variant on this view is even more restricted in its scope: 'unlawful means' are limited to torts and breaches of contract. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;152.&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal criticism of the first, wider view is that it 'tortifies' criminal conduct.  The principal criticism of the second, narrower view is that it would be surprising if criminal conduct were excluded from the category of 'unlawful' means in this context.  In the classical 'three-party' form of this tort the defendant seeks to injure the claimant's business through the instrumentality of a third party.  By this means, as Lord Lindley said, the claimant is 'wrongfully and intentionally struck at through others, and is thereby damnified': <i>Quinn v Leathem</i> [1901] AC 495, 535.  It would be very odd if in such a case the law were to afford the claimant a remedy where the defendant committed or threatened to commit a tort or breach of contract against the third party but not if he committed or threatened to commit a crime against him.  In seeking to distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable conduct it would be passing strange that a breach of contract should be proscribed but not a crime.  In <i>Rookes v Barnard</i> [1964] AC 1129, 1206-7, Lord Devlin noted it was 'of course' accepted that a threat to commit a crime was an unlawful threat and continued:  </p>
<p></p><ul>'It cannot be said that every form of coercion is wrong.  A dividing line must be drawn and the natural line runs between what is lawful and unlawful as against the party threatened.'<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;153.&nbsp;&nbsp;These different views are founded on different perceptions of the rationale underlying the unlawful interference tort.  On the wider interpretation of 'unlawful means' the rationale is that by this tort the law seeks to curb clearly excessive conduct.  The law seeks to provide a remedy for intentional economic harm caused by unacceptable means.  The law regards all unlawful means as unacceptable in this context.  </p>
