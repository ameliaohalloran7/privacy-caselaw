<p class="para">110.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the House counsel for RB and U submitted that it was irrational and unlawful for SIAC to rely on assurances for two independent reasons: first because Algeria had not been prepared to agree to independent monitoring of the manner in which the appellants would be treated; secondly because, on their true construction, the assurances did not promise that the appellants would not be subjected to inhuman treatment. Counsel for Mr Othman submitted that, as a matter of principle, assurances could not be relied upon where there was a pattern of human rights violations in the receiving State coupled with a culture of impunity for the State agents in the security service and the persons who perpetrated these violations. It was further submitted that in all the circumstances SIAC’s reliance on the assurances that had been given was irrational. </p>
<p class="para">111.&nbsp;&nbsp;These submissions were supported by all three interveners. They advanced a further argument of principle. They submitted that once it was accepted that there was a continuing risk of inhuman treatment in a country, assurances could not be relied upon unless their effect was to remove all risk of ill-treatment. I propose to deal at the outset with the submissions that there are principles of law that govern whether reliance can be placed on assurances in relation to safety on return. </p>
<p class="para">112.&nbsp;&nbsp;The starting point is <i>Chahal. </i>In that case the ECtHR referred to the relevant test for ascertaining whether expulsion will violate article 3, namely whether there are substantial grounds for believing that the person in question, if expelled, will face a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to article 3. In contending that there was no such risk the United Kingdom had relied on the fact that they had sought and received assurances from the Indian Government. The court referred to the fact that despite the efforts of the Government and the courts the violation of human rights by the security forces remained prevalent and commented that it was not persuaded that the assurances “would provide Mr Chahal with an adequate guarantee of safety". The court did not specify what it meant by an “<i>adequate</i> guarantee". Counsel for the appellants equated the phrase to an absolute guarantee. Counsel for the Secretary of State submitted that it was enough if the guarantee removed the substantial grounds that might otherwise exist for believing that there was a real risk of inhuman treatment. In <i>Mamatkulov v Turkey</i> (2005) 41 EHRR 494 the ECtHR was not satisfied that Turkey had violated article 3 in permitting the extradition of the applicant to Uzbekistan and, in reaching that conclusion, had regard to the fact that the Government of Uzbekistan had given assurances against ill-treatment. In this case the existence of assurances was treated by the court as part of the matrix that had to be considered when deciding whether there were substantial grounds for believing in the existence of a real risk of inhuman treatment. The ECtHR applied a similar approach in <i>Shamayev v Georgia and Russia (</i>application 36378/02 judgment of 12 April 2005 ) as did the United Nations Committee Against Torture in <i>Hanan Attia v Sweden </i>(17 November 2003, Communication No. 199/2002). </p>
<p class="para">113.&nbsp;&nbsp;Counsel for RB and U relied on <i>Saadi v Italy, </i>where at para 129 the ECtHR spoke of the requirement of the deporting Government to “dispel any doubts” about the safety of the deportee. They also referred to two recent claims against Russia where the court spoke of the need for diplomatic assurances to “ensure adequate protection against the risk of ill-treatment where reliable sources had reported practices resorted to or tolerated by the authorities which were manifestly contrary to the principles of the Convention” -<i>Ismoilov and others v Russia </i>(application no 2947/06) paragraph 127 and <i>Ryabikin v Russia </i>(application no 8320/04) paragraph 119.  </p>
<p class="para">114.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not consider that these decisions establish a principle that assurances must eliminate all risk of inhuman treatment before they can be relied upon. It is obvious that if a State seeks to rely on assurances that are given by a country with a record for disregarding fundamental human rights it will need to show that there is good reason to treat the assurances as providing a reliable guarantee that the deportee will not be subjected to such treatment. If, however, after consideration of all the relevant circumstances of which assurances form part, there are no substantial grounds for believing that a deportee will be at real risk of inhuman treatment, there will be no basis for holding that deportation will violate article 3. </p>
<p class="para">115.&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, there is an abundance of material that supports the proposition that assurances should be treated with scepticism if they are given by a country where inhuman treatment by State agents is endemic. This comes close to the ‘Catch 22’ proposition that if you need to ask for assurances you cannot rely on them. If a State is unwilling or unable to comply with the obligations of international law in relation to the avoidance and prevention of inhuman treatment, how can it be trusted to be willing or able to give effect to an undertaking that an individual deportee will not be subject to such treatment?    </p>
<p class="para">116.&nbsp;&nbsp;Much of the material to which I have referred is summarised in the decision of de Montigny J, sitting in the Federal Court of Canada, in <i>Sing v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) </i>2007 FC 361. He referred to the joint report of Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the International Commission of Jurists of December 2 2005; Tribunal Record, vol 1, pages 179-223, which stated that diplomatic assurances were not an effective safeguard against torture, and to the report to the UN General Assembly of September 1 2004 of the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture (UN Document A/59/324). The latter urged the importance of verification of assurances, including effective monitoring, something that is particularly difficult as a person in detention may be understandably reluctant to complain to a monitor of torture or inhuman treatment. These are matters that counsel for the appellants urged before your Lordships. </p>
<p class="para">117.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Sing </i>was a claim for judicial review and, when considering the standard of review, Montigny J remarked that the evaluation of the reliability of a diplomatic assurance was a question of fact reviewable on the standard of patent unreasonableness. He referred to the following passage in the judgment of the Supreme Court in <i>Suresh v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) </i>[2002] 1 SCR 3 at paragraph 39:</p>
<p class="qt">“As mentioned earlier, whether there is a substantial risk of torture if Suresh is deported is a threshold question. The threshold question here is in large part a fact-driven inquiry. It requires consideration of the human rights record of the home state, the personal risk faced by the claimant, any assurances that the claimant will not be tortured and their worth and, in that respect, the ability of the home state to control its own security forces, and more. It may also involve a reassessment of the refugee’s initial claim and a determination of whether a third country is willing to accept the refugee. Such issues are largely outside the realm of expertise of reviewing courts and possess a negligible legal dimension.” </p>
<p class="para">This passage expresses my reaction to the suggestion that SIAC’s conclusions in relation to assurances give rise to issues of law. The only ground upon which those conclusions can be attacked on an appeal restricted to questions of law is irrationality.</p>
<i><p class="para">Was SIAC’s decision in relation to RB and U irrational?</p></i>
<p class="para">118.&nbsp;&nbsp;In considering this question it is right to bear in mind the material to which I have referred that emphasises the reasons why assurances are unlikely to be reliable. With article 3 rights in issue SIAC could be expected to scrutinise with great care the Secretary of State’s contention that assurances from the Algerian Government sufficed to remove the substantial grounds that would otherwise exist for believing that the appellants would be at real risk of inhuman treatment if sent back to Algeria. It is also right, however, to bear in mind the following comments of Baroness Hale in relation to an appeal on questions of law from an expert Tribunal - in that case the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  - in <i>AH (Sudan) v Secretary of State for the Home Department (UNHCR intervening) </i>[2007] UKHL 49; [2008] 1 AC 678:</p>
<p class="qt">“This is an expert tribunal charged with administering a complex area of law in challenging circumstances. To paraphrase a view I have expressed about such expert tribunals in another context, the ordinary courts should approach appeals from them with an appropriate degree of caution; it is probable that in understanding and applying the law in their specialised field the tribunal will have got it right: see <i>Cooke v Secretary of State for Social Security</i> [2002] 3 All ER 279, para 16. They and they alone are the judges of the facts. It is not enough that their decision on those facts may seem harsh to people who have not heard and read the evidence and arguments which they have heard and read. Their decisions should be respected unless it is quite clear that they have misdirected themselves in law. Appellate courts should not rush to find such misdirections simply because they might have reached a different conclusion on the facts or expressed themselves differently.” </p>
<p class="para">119.&nbsp;&nbsp;That passage was cited by the Court of Appeal when rejecting an appeal by the Secretary of State from the decision of SIAC in <i>AS and DD (Libya) v Secretary of State for the Home Department (Liberty intervening) </i>[2008] EWCA Civ 289. SIAC had allowed appeals by AS and DD against deportation to Libya for reasons of national security. The ground of appeal that succeeded was that there were substantial grounds for believing that they faced a real risk of inhuman treatment if sent back to Libya. The Secretary of State had sought, unsuccessfully, to rely upon assurances in a memorandum of understanding concluded between the United Kingdom and Libya. A witness, whose experience and integrity SIAC commended, had given evidence that it was “well nigh unthinkable” that Libya would break that undertaking. Notwithstanding this SIAC concluded that the memorandum of understanding was not sufficiently reliable. Applying the approach of the ECtHR in <i>Saadi </i>the Court of Appeal held that:</p>
<p class="qt">“Consistently with that approach, it was for SIAC to examine whether the assurances given by Libya, in their practical application, were a sufficient guarantee that the respondents would be protected against torture. The weight to be given to the assurances depended upon the facts of this particular case. It can thus be seen that the exercise upon which SIAC was embarking was an investigation of fact, leading to a conclusion of fact. In our judgment, if SIAC made any error (and we do not divine one), it was an error of fact and not an error of law.”</p>
<p class="para">120.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>AS and DD </i>SIAC applied with care the test originally laid down in <i>Chahal. </i>Are RB and U correct to contend that the results that SIAC reached in their cases were irrational? The weight to be attached to assurances was a question that different divisions of SIAC had to consider four times in relation to Algeria, once in respect of Y, once in respect of RB, once in respect of G and once in respect of U. The later decisions built on the earlier ones and in the final case of U SIAC had regard to the experience of four Algerians who had been repatriated to Algeria. </p>
<p class="para">121.&nbsp;&nbsp;When considering RB and U’s appeals the Court of Appeal considered the individual attacks that had been made on SIAC’s findings of fact and found them without merit. I have none the less considered SIAC’s decisions to see whether, having regard to the obligation on the Secretary of State to show good reason for treating Algeria’s assurances as reliable, SIAC’s conclusions are irrational.</p>
<p class="para">122.&nbsp;&nbsp;The foundation of SIAC’s decisions in relation to RB and U is to be found in their judgment, delivered by Ouseley J, in the case of Y on 24 August 2006 (Appeal No. SC/36/2005). This judgment extended to 416 paragraphs and it dealt in detail with the obtaining of assurances by the British Government. The context in which these were obtained was the desire of the Government to establish a means of returning terrorist suspects to their countries of origin without violation of the requirements of Article 3 of the Convention. In the case of Algeria this led to negotiations at the highest level, including discussions between the Prime Minister and President Bouteflika of Algeria. These negotiations ultimately resulted in assurances being given in relation to Y and also the assurances given in respect of RB and U that I set out earlier in this opinion. As I have already observed, the phrase ‘diplomatic assurances’ does not accurately reflect assurances obtained in such circumstances. That phrase more adequately describes routine assurances offered as a matter of course by State authorities seeking extradition, such as those considered by the ECtHR in <i>Ismoilov </i>and <i>Ryabikin.</i> </p>
<p class="para">123.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have described earlier in this opinion the consideration given by SIAC to the reliance that could be placed on the Algerian assurances. This had particular regard to the general conditions in Algeria at the time that the assurances were given, the attitude of the Algerian authorities to the observance of human rights, the degree of control exercised by the Algerian authorities over the DRS, the internal security service, and the manner in which the performance of the assurances could be verified. SIAC paid careful regard to all relevant matters and applied to them the proper test of whether they amounted to substantial grounds for believing that RB and U would be at real risk of inhuman treatment if returned to Algeria.</p>
<p class="para">124.&nbsp;&nbsp;SIAC gave consideration to the reasons why Algeria was not prepared to agree to monitoring and concluded that this was not indicative of bad faith and that there were alternative ways of ascertaining whether there was compliance with the assurances. These conclusions were not irrational. The contention that the assurances did not, on their true construction, protect against inhuman treatment was not well founded.     </p>
<p class="para">125.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons the irrationality challenge to SIAC’s conclusions does not succeed. I would reject the appeals brought by RB and U. </p>
<i><p class="para">Was SIAC’s decision in relation to Mr Othman’s article 3 challenge irrational?</p></i>
<p class="para">126.&nbsp;&nbsp;The attack made by counsel for Mr Othman on SIAC’s conclusions in relation to article 3 was essentially founded on the weight that SIAC had given to the assurances in the MOU. Just as in the case of Algeria, these assurances were agreed in principle at the highest level in discussions between the Prime Minister and the King of Jordan and between the Foreign Secretary and the Jordanian Foreign Minister. SIAC considered in depth the way that Mr Othman was likely to be treated before his trial, during the trial process and after it. The conclusion reached was that there were not substantial grounds for believing that there was a real risk that Mr Othman would be subjected to inhuman treatment. The MOU was not critical to this conclusion. SIAC commented that the political realities in Jordan and the bilateral diplomatic relationship mattered more than the terminology of the assurances. The former matters, and the fact that Mr Othman would have a high public profile, were the most significant factors in SIAC’s assessment of article 3 risk. Study of SIAC’s lengthy and detailed reasoning discloses no irrationality.  </p>
<p>The additional issues raised in the Othman appeal.</p>
<i><p>The ambit of article 1F(c) of the Refugee Convention</p></i>
<p class="para">127.&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 1F of the Refugee Convention provides:</p>
<p class="qt">“The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that:</p>
<p class="qt">(a) he has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes; </p>
<p class="qt">(b) he has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee; </p>
<p class="qt">(c) he has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.”</p>
<p class="para">The Secretary of State has determined that the provisions of the Convention ceased to apply to Mr Othman when, subsequent to his admission to this country as a refugee, he committed acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations. Mr Othman challenged this finding before SIAC on the ground that article 1F(c) of the Convention applied only to acts committed before his admission to this country. He relied upon the decision of the Canadian Supreme Court in <i>Pushpanathan v Canada</i> (MC1) [1998] 1 SCR 982, at para 58:</p>
<p class="qt">“…the general purpose of Article 1F is not the protection of the society of refuge from dangerous refugees, whether because of acts committed before or after the presentation of a refugee claim; that purpose is served by Article 33 of the Convention. Rather, it is to exclude ab initio those who are not bona fide refugees at the time of their claim for refugee status… The relevant criterion here is the time at which refugee status is obtained. In other words, Article 1F(c) being referable to the recognition of refugee status, any act performed before a person has obtained that status must be considered relevant pursuant to Article 1F(c).” </p>
<p class="para">128.&nbsp;&nbsp;SIAC dealt with this issue at paragraphs 94 to 103 of its judgment. They declined to follow <i>Pushpanathan.</i> SIAC held that the fact that the words “prior to his admission to that country", which qualify article 1F(b), were not included in article 1F(a) or (c) was deliberate and that there was no reason of policy for extending them to (a) or (c). In so holding they applied the decision of the Immigration and Appeal Tribunal in <i>KK (Turkey) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </i>[2004] UKIAT 00101. They held that Mr Othman’s conduct since coming to this country deprived him of the protection afforded by the Refugee Convention. </p>
<p class="para">129.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am persuaded by SIAC’s reasoning and, accordingly, find against Mr Othman on this point. The point is, however, academic. As SIAC went on to find, had Mr Othman been entitled to invoke the provisions of the Refugee Convention in general he would have been prevented from relying upon the prohibition of refoulement imposed by article 33(1) by reason of the proviso in article 33(2). </p>
<i><p class="para">Risk of violation of article 5</p></i>
<p class="para">130.&nbsp;&nbsp;In resisting deportation on the ground that his article 5 right will be threatened in Jordan Mr Othman, through Mr Fitzgerald QC, has accepted that he must establish that there are substantial grounds for believing that, if deported, he will face a real risk of a flagrant breach of that article. He argued that SIAC erred in law in not finding that there were substantial grounds for believing that such a real risk would exist. SIAC found at para 373 that although Jordanian law requires that the police notify the legal authorities of an arrest within 48 hours, and that formal charges be brought within 15 days of arrest, those time limits are regularly and lawfully extended by courts at the request of the prosecutor, in stages of up to 15 days, up to a maximum of 50 days. It would not be incompatible therefore with Jordanian law for the appellant to be held in detention for 50 days without being physically brought before a Court before being charged.  Mr Fitzgerald submitted that the risk of being detained without charge for 50 days constituted a real risk of a flagrant violation of article 5.</p>
<p class="para">131.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a short answer to this point.  SIAC found as a fact that it was unlikely that the Jordanian authorities would seek to exercise the power to detain Mr Othman for 50 days before charge. The likelihood was that he would be charged within 48 hours. On this finding there did not exist substantial grounds for believing that Mr Othman would, if deported, be held without charge for 50 days.</p>
<p class="para">132.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if there were substantial grounds for such a belief, 50 days detention would not constitute a “flagrant breach” of article 5 within the meaning of that phrase as used in foreign Convention rights cases. In that context a “flagrant breach” is a breach whose consequences are so severe that they override the right of a state to expel an alien from its territory. In describing such a breach of article 5 in <i>Ullah </i>at para 43 Lord Steyn gave by way of example arbitrary detention for many years. The risk of detention for 50 days falls far short of satisfying the “flagrant breach” test. Article 5 has, as I shall show, greater relevance in the context of the Secretary of State’s appeal against the Court of Appeal’s finding that SIAC erred in law in failing to hold that article 6 precluded Mr Othman’s deportation.</p>
<i><p class="para">“Flagrant breach of article 6” </p></i>
<p class="para">133.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have described earlier the origin of the phrase “flagrant breach” in relation to foreign Convention cases and expressed the view that, where article 5 is engaged, the potential consequence of a breach of that article must be severe before the breach can properly be described as flagrant. This approach to the meaning of “flagrant breach” should pose little difficulty where the right engaged is substantive. It is not so easy where the right arises under article 6, for that right is not substantive but procedural. As there is no reported foreign case where article 6 has successfully been invoked, there is a lack of authoritative guidance as to what will amount to a “flagrant breach” of that article. In <i>Mamatkulov </i>a minority of the Grand Chamber consisting of judges Bratza, Bonello and Hedigan dissented from the majority on the question of whether the extradition of the applicants had violated article 6(1). The majority found that the test, namely “the risk of a flagrant denial of justice in the country of destination", had not been satisfied. The minority considered that it had and, without dissenting as to the test, formulated it in somewhat greater detail at para O-III 14:</p>
<p class="qt">“While the court has not to date found that the expulsion or extradition of an individual violated, or would if carried out violate, article 6 of the Convention, it has on frequent occasions held that such a possibility cannot be excluded where the person being expelled has suffered or risks suffering a flagrant denial of a fair trial in the receiving country. What constitutes a ‘flagrant’ denial of justice has not been fully explained in the court’s jurisprudence but the use of the adjective is clearly intended to impose a stringent test of unfairness going beyond mere irregularities or lack of safeguards in the trial procedures such as might result in a breach of article 6 if occurring within the Contracting State itself. As the court has emphasised, article 1 cannot be read as justifying a general principle to the effect that a Contracting State may not surrender an individual unless satisfied that the conditions awaiting him in the country of destination are in full accord with each of the safeguards of the Convention.  In our view, what the word ‘flagrant’ is intended to convey is a breach of the principles of fair trial guaranteed by article 6 which is so fundamental as to amount to a nullification, or destruction of the very essence, of the right guaranteed by that article.” </p>
<p class="para">134.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>EM </i>at para 34 Lord Bingham of Cornhill referred to this passage with approval in the context of a claim founded on article 8. He went on in para 35 to commend the way that the Attorney General for the Secretary of State had put the test in argument in <i>Ullah </i>at p. 337D:</p>
<p class="qt">“If other articles can be engaged the threshold test will require a flagrant breach of the relevant right, such as will completely deny or nullify the right in the destination country: see <i>Devaseelan v Secretary of State for the Home Department</i> [2003] Imm AR 1.  A serious or discriminatory interference with the right protected would be insufficient.” </p>
<p class="para">135.&nbsp;&nbsp;SIAC adopted this test when considering Mr Othman’s case. They held that to succeed under article 6 he needed to establish “a real risk of a total denial of the right to a fair trial” para 451. The Court of Appeal also held at paragraphs 15 to 19 of the judgment in Mr Othman’s appeal that the test was whether there had been a “complete denial or nullification of the Convention right.”</p>
<p class="para">136.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is neither an easy nor an adequate test of whether article 6 should bar the deportation of an alien. In the first place it is not easy to postulate what amounts to “a complete denial or nullification of the right to a fair trial” That phrase cannot require that every aspect of the trial process should be unfair. A trial that is fair in part may be no more acceptable than the curate’s egg. What is required is that the deficiency or deficiencies in the trial process should be such as fundamentally to destroy the fairness of the prospective trial.  </p>
