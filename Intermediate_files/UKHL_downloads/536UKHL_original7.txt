<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;153. Reasons can readily be adduced to support the imposition of the burden of proof on the accused in the present context.  Firstly, the question whether the accused was ignorant or had no reason to suspect that what he possessed was a controlled drug is a matter very much within his own knowledge.  There are sound practical reasons for imposing the burden on him to prove his ignorance.  Secondly, the proof may be relatively easy for him, as I have already noted.  Thirdly, there is a serious consideration of the public interest in the discouragement of what is well recognised as a grave social evil, the unlawful distribution of controlled drugs.  Fourthly the knowledge of the defendant of the nature of what he possessed is brought in as a defence, not as an ingredient of the offence.  In some cases it may never arise.  It can be strongly argued that a transfer of a persuasive burden of proof onto the defendant under section 28 could be compatible with Article 6(2).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;154. But while it might seem reasonable for such considerations to let the accused bear the burden of proof I do not consider that such a result can be justified when one weighs the considerations of what is, or at least may be, at stake for the accused and the interests of the public.  As I have already noted, in order to be acceptable a presumption must fall within limits which "take into account the importance of what is at stake and maintain the rights of the defence".  If the matter is approached as one of generality one can make no useful distinction here between the various classes of drugs which may be involved.  In the most serious cases the accused may face a sentence of life imprisonment.  A strict responsibility may be acceptable in the case of statutory offences which are concerned to regulate the conduct of some particular activity in the public interest.  The requirement to have a licence in order to carry on certain kinds of activity is an obvious example.  The promotion of health and safety and the avoidance of pollution are among the purposes to be served by such controls.  These kinds of cases may properly be seen as not truly criminal.  Many may be relatively trivial and only involve a monetary penalty. Many may carry with them no real social disgrace or infamy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;155. In <i>Sweet v Parsley</i> (1970) AC 132 at 148 Lord Reid observed that "there has for centuries been a presumption that Parliament did not intend to make criminals of persons who were in no way blameworthy in what they did".  The advent of the Human Rights Act 1998 has certainly sharpened a consciousness of the human right which is embodied in the presumption of innocence and invites a closer scrutiny of what Ashworth and Blake (<i>The Presumption of Innocence in English</i> <i>Criminal Law</i>, (1996) CLR 314) have described as a large-scale derogation from basic principle  They quote the advice of the Eleventh Report of the Criminal Law Revision Committee that "both on principle and for the sake of clarity and convenience in practice, burdens on the defence should be evidential only".  The 1998 Act should encourage a reconsideration of a trend which has for over a decade been exposed to powerful criticism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;156. While it may be that offences under section 5 of the Misuse of Drugs Act may be described as regulatory they can lead to the most serious of consequences for the accused.  Of course trafficking in controlled drugs is a notorious social evil, but if any error is to be made in the weighing of the scales of justice it should be to the effect that the guilty should go free rather than that an innocent person should be wrongly convicted.  By imposing a persuasive burden on the accused it would be possible for an accused person to be convicted where the jury believed he might well be innocent but have not been persuaded that he probably did not know the nature of what he possessed.  The jury may have a reasonable doubt as to his guilt in respect of his knowledge of the nature of what he possessed but still be required to convict.  Looking to the potentially serious consequences of a conviction at least in respect of class  A drugs it does not seem to me that such a burden is acceptable. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;157. But I have no difficulty in finding the solution by an application of section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998.  It requires no straining of the language of section 28 to construe the references to proof as intending an evidential burden and not a persuasive one.  Indeed, as I have already stated, it would be a construction to which I would in any event have inclined, even without the added compulsion of the Human Rights Act.  The construction seems to me to be something which is well within the scope of what is "possible" for the purposes of section 3.  In rewriting the legislation as it did in the Act of 1971, Parliament must have recognised that in fairness to the accused provision must be made for the case where he was ignorant of the nature of the thing which he possessed and that the law as laid down by the majority of this House in <i>Warner</i> was unduly harsh.  It seems to me that the proper way by which that harshness should be alleviated is to recognise that the accused should have the opportunity to raise the issue of his knowledge but to leave the persuasive burden of proof throughout on the prosecution. Respect for the "golden thread" of the presumption of innocence deserves no less. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;158. I am not persuaded that this approach gives rise to any practical problem.  In some cases no issue may arise at all about the accused's knowledge of the nature of thing which he is alleged to possess.  Section 28 then will not come into play and it would only distract a jury from the point in issue to give any direction, or certainly any detailed direction, about it.  When the matter of the accused's knowledge (including in that word for convenience the matters of suspicion and reason to suspect which are detailed in section 28) does arise, such burden as there is on the defence is discharged by the defence expressly raising knowledge as an issue.  Where that occurs the judge will require to explain the substance of section 28 to the jury but will also simply remind them that the burden of proving guilt is throughout on the prosecution.  If the jury are satisfied on the matter of possession but are left with a reasonable doubt on the matter of his knowledge or suspicion of the existence of a fact which the prosecution has to prove, such as, for example, the existence of the controlled drug, then they should acquit.  If the jury are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused possessed the substance or product in question but are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he knew that it was a controlled drug (or suspected or had reason to suspect that it was) then again they should acquit him.  They can only convict if they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prosecution has proved possession of the controlled drug and, if the issue is raised, that the lines of defence set out in section 28 are without foundation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;159. I do not consider that this understanding of the offences in question in the future should cause any serious problem for any past or current cases.  Ultimately what is in issue is the fairness of the trial.  No doubt in many cases an unfair trial in contravention of Article 6 will constitute an unsafe conviction (see for example <i>R v Togher </i> 9 Nov 2000 <i>R v Forbes</i> 14 Dec 2000).  But an unfairness is not always fatal to an conviction.  In particular in the present context a direction that there is a persuasive burden on the accused to establish a defence under section 28 will not necessarily lead to an unsafe conviction.  If there is doubt about guilt then the conviction must be held to be unsafe.  But if there is no doubt about guilt it is not every case where an unfairness can be identified that will necessarily and inevitably lead to a quashing of the conviction. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;160. The present appeal has been more concerned with generalities than with the particular facts and circumstances of the particular case which has been used as a vehicle for raising them.  If one turns to the facts here, which I need not repeat as they have been narrated by others of your Lordships, I am not persuaded that there is any ground for doubting that the verdict of the jury, who rejected the defence of duress, would also have rejected the defence under section 28 even had it been explained to them that the burden of proof remained throughout on the prosecution.  I see no room for quashing the conviction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;161. For the foregoing reasons I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p><b>LORD HUTTON</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;162. The appellant, Steven Lambert, was convicted on 9 April 1999 in the Crown Court at Warrington after a trial before Judge Hale and a jury of the offence of possession of a controlled class A drug with intent to supply, contrary to section 5(3) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 and was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;163. In summing up to the jury the trial judge succinctly summarised the facts relied on by the prosecution:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Members of the jury, it's half past 1 on the afternoon of the 25th November of last year when this defendant gets off the London train as it arrives in Runcorn on its way to Liverpool.  He gets off holding an envelope.  He crosses the bridge.  In the hallway on the other side by the ticket office in Runcorn Station a man comes up to him and says, 'Steve'.  They shake hands, they go out on to the car park.  Within a couple of minutes he's back in the reception area trying first to make a phone call on his mobile phone, then going into the phone kiosk.  He has now got in his hand a duffle bag which contains 2 kilos of cocaine worth over £140,000."<p></p></ul>
<p>The appellant's defence can be summarised as follows.  In the past a man named "John" had asked him to go to Liverpool to deliver money for him.  On this occasion John again asked him to go to Liverpool to deliver something for him and gave him an envelope which he thought contained money.  He took the train to Liverpool and during the journey John telephoned him and told him to get off at Runcorn.  He did so and met a man who gave him a bag which the man told him contained scrap gold to go back to John and the man then said it was scrap jewellery.  The appellant also advanced a defence of duress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;164. In the course of his summing up the trial judge directed the jury pursuant to section 28(2) and (3) of the 1971 Act that the burden of proof was on the appellant to prove on the balance of probabilities that he neither believed nor suspected nor had reason to suspect that the substance in the bag was a controlled drug.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;165. Article 6(2) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal against his conviction on the ground that the judge's direction to the jury that the burden of proof as to lack of knowledge rested on him violated the presumption of innocence given by Article 6(2).  The Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal on the ground that in respect of prosecutions for possession of drugs there was an objective justification for the relevant statutory provisions and they were not disproportionate, and accordingly there was no violation of Article 6(2).  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;166. However, the Court of Appeal accepted (though with reservations) that, as agreed by all counsel, the Human Rights Act 1998, which, apart from four sections, came into force on 2 October 2000, more than a year after the date of the appellant's conviction at the Crown Court, did have a retrospective effect so far as article 6 was concerned.  Therefore the first question which arises on this appeal is whether the 1998 Act has a retrospective effect.  If it does not, the applicant cannot rely on Article 6(2) in the English courts and his appeal must fail.</p>
<p align="left"><u></u></p>
<p align="left"><u>Retrospectivity</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;167. Section 6 of the 1998 Act provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection (1) does not apply to an act if—<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;as the result of one or more provisions of primary legislation, the authority could not have acted differently;  or<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;in the case of one or more provisions of, or made under, primary legislation which cannot be read or given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights, the authority was acting so as to give effect to or enforce those provisions.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;In this section 'public authority' includes—<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;a court or tribunal, and<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;any person certain of whose functions are functions of a public nature,<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>but does not include either House of Parliament or a person exercising functions in connection with proceedings in Parliament.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;In subsection (3) 'Parliament' does not include the House of Lords in its judicial capacity.<p></p></ul>
<p>Section 7 provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;A person who claims that a public authority has acted (or proposes to act) in a way which is made unlawful by section 6(1) may—<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;bring proceedings against the authority under this Act in the appropriate court or tribunal, or<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;rely on the Convention right or rights concerned in any legal proceedings,<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>but only if he is (or would be) a victim of the unlawful act. . . . .<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;In subsection (1)(b) 'legal proceedings' includes—<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;proceedings brought by or at the instigation of a public authority;  and<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;an appeal against the decision of a court or tribunal."<p></p></ul>
<p>Section 22 provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Sections 18, 20 and 21(5) and this section come into force on the passing of this Act.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;The other provisions of this Act come into force on such day as the Secretary of State may by order appoint;  and different days may be appointed for different purposes.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of section 7 applies to proceedings brought by or at the instigation of a public authority whenever the act in question took place;  but otherwise that subsection does not apply to an act taking place before the coming into force of that section…"<p></p></ul>
<p>Mr Starmer advanced two principal submissions in support of the argument that the appellant was entitled to rely on Article 6(2) notwithstanding that he was convicted before the Convention had been incorporated into the law of England by the 1998 Act.  His first submission concentrated on the effect of section 6 viewed in isolation from sections 7 and 22.  He submitted that the Appellate Committee of the House, sitting as a court, is a "public authority" within the meaning of section 6 and that section 6(1) forbids the Appellate Committee to act in a way which is incompatible with the right given to the appellant by Article 6(2).  If the statutory provisions, pursuant to which the trial judge had directed the jury as to the onus of proof, were in breach of Article 6(2), the Appellate Committee would be acting unlawfully under section 6(1) if it upheld the conviction obtained in breach of that Article, notwithstanding that the trial and conviction had taken place before the 1998 Act came into force.  Mr Starmer further submitted that the application of section 6 for which he contended did not mean that this section was given retrospective effect:  the right under Article 6(2) of the Convention existed at the time of the appellant's trial and conviction, although he was then unable to enforce it in the domestic courts.  Where there has been an infringement of the Article 6(2) right to a fair trial, this will result in the conviction being held to be unsafe when an appeal is heard by the Court of Appeal (or by the House of Lords) from 2 October 2000:  see per Lord Woolf CJ in <i>R v Togher</i> (9 November 2000, para 33, approved by this House in <i>R v Forbes </i>(14 December 2000, para 24).  Therefore the appellant's argument does not, in truth, seek to give a retrospective effect to section 6(1), it merely seeks to give effect to section 6(1), as it binds the Appellate Committee at the present time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;168. Mr Starmer further submitted that the Crown could not counter this argument by relying on section 6(2)(a) or (b) and contending that the House itself was bound to give effect to the provisions of section 28 of the 1971 Act, because under section 3 of the 1998 Act the House could read and give effect (as the Crown accepted) to section 28 in a way compatible with Article 6(2).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;169. The argument which Mr Starmer skilfully advanced is a powerful one, but I have come to the conclusion that it should not be accepted.  It is a well established principle that no statute should be construed so as to have a retrospective operation unless its language is such as plainly to require such a construction.  In addition, save as to the proceedings described in the first part of section 22(4), I consider that that subsection supports the view that the 1998 Act is not to have a retrospective effect.  In my opinion an Act has a retrospective effect if it  operates to make unlawful or unsafe a conviction which was lawful and safe at the time it was imposed.  This is the result for which the appellant contends.  Before the commencement of the 1998 Act he had been lawfully convicted and his conviction was safe.  But he submits that the effect of section 6 of the 1998 Act, coming into operation after his conviction, is to make the conviction unlawful and unsafe.  In my opinion it is no answer for the appellant to maintain that he is only concerned with the lawfulness of a decision taken by the Appellate Committee on a date after 2 October 2000.  I consider that this argument does not alter the reality that if the House were to quash the conviction it would be giving a retrospective effect to section 6.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;170. Nor do I think that the appellant can derive assistance from section 3 of the 1998 Act which provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as it is possible to do so, primary legislation and subordinate legislation must be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;This section—<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;applies to primary legislation and subordinate legislation whenever enacted;"<p></p></ul>
<p>In my opinion if the 1998 Act, including section 3, does not (apart from the effect of section 22(4)) have a retrospective effect, section 3 cannot give section 6(1) a retrospective operation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;171. Mr Starmer's second main submission relied on the combined effect of sections 6, 7 and 22.   Under section 7(1)(b) a person who claims that a court has acted in a way which is made unlawful by section 6(1) may rely on the Convention right concerned in any legal proceedings.  Section 22(4) provides that paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of section 7 applies to proceedings brought by or at the instigation of a public authority whenever the act in question took place.  Therefore the submission was that the appeal before the House was "legal proceedings" and that the appellant could rely on Article 6(2) because the prosecution ("proceedings") was brought against the appellant by the Director of Public Prosecutions, a public authority, notwithstanding that the conviction by the Crown Court took place before the 1998 Act came into force.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;172. In my opinion this argument fails because section 7(6) provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;In subsection (1)(b) 'legal proceedings' includes—<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;proceedings brought by or at the instigation of a public authority; and<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;an appeal against the decision of a court or tribunal."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subsection therefore distinguishes between "proceedings brought by or at the instigation of a public authority" and "an appeal against the decision of a court or tribunal".  Accordingly when section 22(4) refers, in identical words to the words of section 7(6)(a), to "proceedings brought by or at the instigation of a public authority", the retrospective operation permitted by that subsection does not apply to an appeal against the decision of the Crown Court in this case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;173. Although the 1998 Act was passed on 9 November 1998, its sections, with the exception of sections 18, 21(5) and 22, did not come into force until 2 October 2000, the day appointed by the Secretary of State pursuant to section 22(3).  I consider that this delayed commencement of the great majority of the sections in the Act suggests that it was the intent of Parliament that the Act, (save in the limited circumstances set out in section 22(4)), should not operate retrospectively, but that the sections were only to operate in respect of acts taking place subsequent to 2 October 2000 after public authorities in the United Kingdom had had the opportunity to ensure that their actions and procedures would not violate Convention rights.  I think that Parliament did not intend to bring about the situation which was a cause of concern to Rose LJ, the Vice-President of the Criminal Division, in <i>R v Kansal</i> [2001]  All ER (D) 311 (May) and which he described in paragraph 24 of the judgment of the Court of Appeal:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Leaving aside colourful historical examples such as Sir Thomas More, Guy Fawkes and Charles I, all of whom would have benefited from convention rights, until the Criminal Evidence Act 1898, no defendant was permitted to give evidence on his own behalf.  That is a clear breach of Article 6.  Many examples in the 20th century of other rules and procedures which, viewed with the wisdom of hindsight, were in breach of the Convention could be given.  But we resist that temptation lest, by succumbing, we exacerbate the problem to which we are drawing attention.  For over 20 years, this court has adopted a pragmatic approach, confirmed by successive Lord Chief Justices, whereby a refusal to extend time to apply for leave to appeal has filtered out those seeking to take advantage of a change in the law since they were convicted.  This, in our judgment, reflects the public interest that there be finality in litigation and it is an approach which has also helped this court to concentrate its limited resources on determining more meritorious appeals arising from more recent convictions." <p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;174. In reaching my conclusion on this difficult issue of retrospectivity I have taken into account the opinions in favour of retrospectivity expressed in <i>R v Director of Public Prosecutions Ex parte Kebilene</i>, by Lord Bingham of Cornhill CJ in the Divisional Court and by Lord Steyn in this House, and the opinions against retrospectivity expressed by Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough in <i>Ex parte Kebilene</i> and by Waller LJ in <i>Parker v Director of Public Prosecutions</i>.  I have also taken into account the judgment of the Court of Appeal in <i>Wilson v The First County Trust Ltd</i> (2nd May 2001). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;175. Mr Starmer relied on the following passage in the judgment of Sir Andrew Morritt V-C at paragraph 17:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Section 6(1)— in conjunction with section 6(3)(a)— requires a court to refrain from acting in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right.  If the court is to comply with that requirement it must ask itself— in any case which comes before it after 2 October 2000 — whether the order which it is about to make is or is not compatible with Convention rights.  The relevant event, in the present case, is not the making of the agreement on 22 January 1999;  the relevant event is the making of an order on this appeal."<p></p></ul>
<p>However I think that the Crown can derive greater support for its argument against retrospectivity from passages in paragraphs 20 and 21 of the Vice-Chancellor's judgment:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Nor, it seems, can a person who claims that a court or tribunal has acted in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right (contrary to section 6(1) of the Act) rely on that as a ground of appeal against the decision of that court or tribunal in a case where the decision complained of was made before 2 October 2000— see section 7(1)(b) and section 7(6)(b) of the Act.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"Nor should the decisions of courts and tribunals made before those sections had come into force be impugned on the ground that the court or tribunal was said to have acted in a way which was incompatible with Convention rights."<p></p></ul>
<p>The House has now had the benefit of full and careful argument on the part of Mr Starmer and of Mr Perry and I have reached the conclusion, for the reasons which I have given, that the 1998 Act does not have a retrospective effect in this case.</p>
<i>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;176. Therefore I consider that this appeal should be dismissed on the grounds that the appellant's conviction was safe prior to 2 October 2000 and the provisions of the 1998 Act do not require an appellate court giving its decision after 2 October 2000 to declare it unsafe.  However, as detailed submissions were advanced to the House on the basis that the appellant could rely on sections 6, 7 and 22(4) of the 1998 Act, I propose to state my opinion on those submissions.</p>
<i><p>The essential ingredients of the offence</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;177. Section 5 of the 1971 Act provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to any regulations under section 7 of this Act for the time being in force, it shall not be lawful for a person to have a controlled drug in his possession.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to section 28 of this Act and to subsection (4) below, it is an offence for a person to have a controlled drug in his possession in contravention of subsection (1) above.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to section 28 of this Act, it is an offence for a person to have a controlled drug in his possession, whether lawfully or not, with intent to supply it to another in contravention of section 4(1) of this Act."<p></p></ul>
<p>Section 28 provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"28&nbsp;&nbsp;Proof of lack of knowledge etc to be a defence in proceedings for certain offences<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;This section applies to offences under any of the following provisions of this Act, that is to say section 4(2) and (3), section 5(2) and (3), section 6(2) and section 9.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to subsection (3) below, in any proceedings for an offence to which this section applies it shall be a defence for the accused to prove that he neither knew of nor suspected nor had reason to suspect the existence of some fact alleged by the prosecution which it is necessary for the prosecution to prove if he is to be convicted of the offence charged.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;Where in any proceedings for an offence to which this section applies it is necessary, if the accused is to be convicted of the offence charged, for the prosecution to prove that some substance or product involved in the alleged offence was the controlled drug which the prosecution alleges it to have been, and it is proved that the substance or product in question was that controlled drug, the accused—<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;shall not be acquitted of the offence charged by reason only of proving that he neither knew nor suspected nor had reason to suspect that the substance or product in question was the particular controlled drug alleged;  but<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be acquitted thereof—<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;if he proves that he neither believed nor suspected nor had reason to suspect that the substance or product in question was a controlled drug; or<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;if he proves that he believed the substance or product in question to be a controlled drug, or a controlled drug of a description, such that, if it had in fact been that controlled drug or a controlled drug of that description, he would not at the material time have been committing any offence to which this section applies.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in this section shall prejudice any defence which it is open to a person charged with an offence to which this section applies to raise apart from this section."<p></p></ul>
