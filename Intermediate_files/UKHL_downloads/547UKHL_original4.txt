<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81. In the following passage at pp 37-38 of his third judgment Clarke J explained his general approach to the Bingham report before he embarked upon a detailed consideration of the various stages in the history:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Mr Stadlen submits that there is no support anywhere in the Bingham report for the conclusion that the Bank acted dishonestly, or that it knew that it was acting unlawfully or that it suspected that its acts or omission would probably cause loss to depositors or potential depositors.  For the reasons already stated I shall focus only on the last of these, but I accept the submission that there is no statement in the report which gives any support for the conclusion that at any stage the Bank suspected that depositors and potential depositors would probably suffer loss as a result of the Bank's action or inaction.  Yet, as stated on page iii of the covering letter to which I have already referred, it is clear that Bingham LJ was considering the Bank's state of mind at every stage.  In my judgment, if Bingham LJ had formed the view that at any stage the Bank suspected that its action or inaction would probably injure depositors or potential depositors he would have said so.  Thus, if he had thought that the Bank suspected that BCCI would probably collapse so that new depositors would probably lose their money at any stage of the story from 1979 to 1991 he would have said so.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"Yet, not only did he not say so, but his observations on the evidence are inconsistent with any such conclusion."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82. Thereafter during his examination of the history he made frequent reference to findings or conclusions, or to the absence of conclusions and findings, in the Bingham report.  His purpose in doing so was to explain why he was of the opinion that there was nothing in the material he had seen which gave reasonable grounds for supposing that other evidence might become available to throw light on the state of mind of the Bank during the relevant period: see the conclusion, already quoted, which he expressed at pp 167-168.  The following passage, in which he dealt with the claimants' submission that the Bank must have known when it granted the licence that the principal place of business of BCCI was in the United Kingdom and not in Luxembourg, at p 43, illustrates this point:</p>
<p></p><ul>"However, the difficulty with the plaintiffs' submission is that Bingham LJ held in paragraph 2.23 that the Bank never addressed the question what was meant by principal place of business.  It assumed wrongly that the principal place of business was in the country of incorporation.  Further Bingham LJ says in paragraph 2.24 that the Bank never inquired where the principal place of business was, in the sense of where the mind and management of the company and its central direction resided.  The Bank thus treated section 3(5) of the Act as applicable and applied it.  In paragraph 2.25 Bingham LJ says that he read nothing sinister in that approach.  Moreover, on the footing that the principal place of business was in the United Kingdom, under section 36 BCCI was not entitled to describe itself as a bank, but Bingham LJ says in paragraph 2.33 that it was not until after the licence had been granted that the Bank recognised that fact.  There is, in my judgment, no material available to the plaintiffs or to the court to lead to any different conclusion."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83. Among the other passages that might be quoted are those at p 89, where the judge referred to a conclusion in paragraph 2.66 of the report in support of the view that there was no evidence that the Bank suspected in June 1986 following the central treasury losses that BCCI would probably collapse, let alone that it would probably collapse because of an absence of remedial steps; at p 110, where he referred to a conclusion in paragraph 2.154 of the report to the same effect as to the Bank's state of mind in December 1989; and at pp 153 -154, where he referred to paragraphs 2.333 and 2.337 of the report as to the Bank's state of mind in March 1991 when it commissioned PW to investigate and report on malpractice within the group under section 41 of the 1987 Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84. In their written submissions to the Court of Appeal (paragraph 61) the claimants said that they did not object to the court having regard to the report.  But they pointed out that its contents would not be admissible in any trial and that it was odd that the judge considered it permissible or appropriate to determine factual issues by reference to it and to strike out the action in reliance upon it.  Nevertheless it is clear that the majority in that court followed Clarke J's approach, and that to a material extent their decision to dismiss the appeal was based on the same view as that which the judge had formed in the light of the findings and conclusions that Bingham LJ expressed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85. That there was a fundamental difference of view in the Court of Appeal on this point is clear from Auld LJ's dissenting judgment.  He noted the fact that Clarke J relied heavily on the Bingham report as a justification for taking the exceptional course of striking out the claim as doomed to fail [2000] 2 WLR 15, 179C.  After pointing out the different functions of that inquiry from those involved in this litigation and the disadvantages that were inherent in that procedure, he said at p 180D-F:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In the circumstances, I am of the view that Clarke J was not entitled to treat Bingham LJ's report effectively as conclusive on the questions he, the judge, had to answer in this litigation or to conclude, as he did, that all the available material evidence on those questions had been gathered in.  Given the greater generality of the questions in the Bingham inquiry, the limitations of it as a fact-finding exercise when compared with litigation, his acknowledgement of a number of challenges to some of his factual conclusions and the emergence of additional material since the inquiry indicating the Bank's state of knowledge as to the Gokal unrecorded loans, I can see no basis for Clarke J's confidence in this extraordinary and complex case for concluding that Bingham LJ had seen and fully tested all the material evidence available or likely to become available on the issues confronting the court in this case."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86. I respectfully agree with and would endorse these observations.  In my judgment the extent to which the opinions expressed by both Clarke J and the majority in the Court of Appeal were dependent upon passages in the Bingham report which are irrelevant to the issue of strike out provides a further reason for taking a fresh look at this critical issue.  For the same reasons I consider that the claimants' motion for leave to re-re-amend the statement of claim is open to re-consideration by your Lordships.  The draft re-re-amended statement of claim has now been superseded by the draft new particulars, and it is to that document that I shall direct my remarks on the question whether leave should now be given.</p>
<i><p>(5) The test for summary judgment under CPR rule 24.2 </p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87. Clarke J ordered that the action should be struck out under RSC, Ord 18, r 19 on the grounds that the re-amended statement of claim disclosed no reasonable cause of action and that it would be an abuse of process or vexatious or oppressive to give leave to re-re-amend.  The parties are agreed that if the question whether the claim should be struck out is to be reconsidered it must now be determined under the Civil Procedure Rules 1998: see the general principle stated in <i>Practice Direction - Transitional Arrangements</i>, 51PD-011.  The power which is given to the court to strike out under CPR Part 3, which is concerned with the court's case management powers, is expressed in rule 3.4(2) in these terms:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The court may strike out a statement of case if it appears to the court -<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a) that the statement of case discloses no reasonable grounds for bringing or defending the claim;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b) that the statement of case is an abuse of the court's process or is otherwise likely to obstruct the just disposal of the proceedings; or<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(c) that there has been a failure to comply with a rule, practice direction or court order."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88. The parties also agree that, if Clarke J were to be held to have applied the wrong test when he ordered the action to be struck out, the relevant rules under the CPR are not confined to the provision for striking out in CPR rule 3.4.  In <i>Margulies v Margulies</i> (unreported) 16 March 2000 the judge's decision to strike out was given pursuant to RSC Ord 18, r 19 before the coming into effect of the Civil Procedure Rules.  Nourse LJ said at paragraph 63 that, if the judge wrongly applied the test, the Court of Appeal would have to determine the matter pursuant to CPR Part 24.2.  I would not go so far as to say that your Lordships are obliged to treat the Bank's motion to strike out as an application for summary judgment under rule 24.2.  It would, I think, be more accurate to say that your Lordships have power to do so, and that the question is whether your Lordships should exercise that power: see <i>Taylor v Midland Bank Trust Co Ltd (No 2) </i>(unreported) 21 July<i> </i>1999: Court of Appeal (Civil Division) Transcript No 1200 of 1999 Civil Procedure 2000, 3.4.6.  CPR Part 24 sets out various procedural requirements which do not apply to rule 3.4  But the claimants do not object to the application of rule 24.2 on procedural grounds.  So I would accept Mr Stadlen's submission that it is appropriate for the Bank's application for the claim to be struck out to be treated as if it were an application for summary judgment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89. CPR rule 24.2 provides: </p>
<p></p><ul>"The court may give summary judgment against a claimant or defendant on the whole of a claim or on a particular issue if - <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a) it considers that - <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul><ul>(i) that claimant has no real prospect of succeeding on the claim or issue; or<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(ii) that defendant has no real prospect of successfully defending the claim or issue; and <p></p></ul></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b) there is no other reason why the case or issue should be disposed of at a trial."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90. The test which Clarke J applied, when he was considering whether the claim should be struck out under RSC Ord 18, r 19, was whether it was bound to fail: see p 171 of the third judgment.  Mr Stadlen submitted that the court had a wider power to dispose summarily of issues under CPR Part 24 than it did under RSC Ord 18, r 19, and that critical issue was now whether, in terms of CPR rule 24.2(a)(i), the claimants had a real prospect of succeeding on the claim. As to what these words mean, in <i>Swain v Hillman</i> [2001] 1 All ER 91, 92, Lord Woolf MR said<i>:</i></p>
<p></p><ul>"Under r 24.2, the court now has a very salutary power, both to be exercised in a claimant's favour or, where appropriate, in a defendant's favour.  It enables the court to dispose summarily of both claims or defences which have no real prospect of being successful.  The words 'no real prospect of being successful or succeeding' do not need any amplification, they speak for themselves.  The word 'real' distinguishes fanciful prospects of success or, as Mr Bidder QC submits, they direct the court to the need to see whether there is a 'realistic' as opposed to a 'fanciful' prospect of success."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91. The difference between a test which asks the question "is the claim bound to fail?" and one which asks "does the claim have a real prospect of success?" is not easy to determine.  In <i>Swain v Hillman</i> at p 4 Lord Woolf explained that the reason for the contrast in language between rule 3.4 and rule 24.2 is that under rule 3.4, unlike rule 24.2, the court generally is only concerned with the statement of case which it is alleged discloses no reasonable grounds for bringing or defending the claim.  In <i>Monsanto plc v Tilly, </i>The Times, 30 November 1999; Court of Appeal (Civil Division) Transcript No 1924 of 1999; Stuart Smith LJ said that rule 24.2 gives somewhat wider scope for dismissing an action or defence.  In <i>Taylor v Midland Bank Trust Co Ltd</i> he said that, particularly in the light of the CPR, the court should look to see what will happen at the trial and that, if the case is so weak that it had no reasonable prospect of success, it should be stopped before great expense is incurred.<i></i></p><i>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92. The overriding objective of the CPR is to enable the court to deal with cases justly: rule 1.1.  To adopt the language of article 6.1 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms with which this aim is consistent, the court must ensure that there is a fair trial.  It must seek to give effect to the overriding objective when it exercises any power given to it by the Rules or interprets any rule: rule 1.2.  While the difference between the two tests is elusive, in many cases the practical effect will be the same.  In more difficult and complex cases such as this one, attention to the overriding objective of dealing with the case justly is likely to be more important than a search for the precise meaning of the rule.  As May LJ said in <i>Purdy v Cambran </i>(unreported) 17 December 1999: Court of Appeal (Civil Division) Transcript No 2290 of 1999:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The court has to seek to give effect to the overriding objective when it exercises any powers given to it by the rules.  This applies to applications to strike out a claim.  When the court is considering, in a case to be decided under the Civil Procedure Rules, whether or not it is just in accordance with the overriding objective to strike out a claim, it is not necessary to analyse that question by reference to the rigid and overloaded structure which a large body of decisions under the former rules had constructed."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93. In <i>Swain v</i>. <i>Hillman</i> Lord Woolf gave this further guidance at pp 94 and 95:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is important that a judge in appropriate cases should make use of the powers contained in Part 24.  In doing so he or she gives effect to the overriding objectives contained in Part 1.  It saves expense; it achieves expedition; it avoids the court's resources being used up on cases where this serves no purpose, and, I would add, generally, that it is in the interests of justice.  If a claimant has a case which is bound to fail, then it is in the claimant's interests to know as soon as possible that that is the position.  Likewise, if a claim is bound to succeed, a claimant should know this as soon as possible….<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"Useful though the power is under Part 24, it is important that it is kept to its proper role.  It is not meant to dispense with the need for a trial where there are issues which should be investigated at the trial.  As Mr Bidder put it in his submissions, the proper disposal of an issue under Part 24 does not involve the judge conducting a mini trial, that is not the object of the provisions; it is to enable cases, where there is no real prospect of success either way, to be disposed of summarily."<p></p></ul>
<i><p align="center"><i>(6) Whether the claim should be summarily struck out </i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94. For the reasons which I have just given, I think that the question is whether the claim has no real prospect of succeeding at trial and that it has to be answered having regard to the overriding objective of dealing with the case justly.  But the point which is of crucial importance lies in the answer to the further question that then needs to be asked, which is - what is to be the scope of that inquiry?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95. I would approach that further question in this way.  The method by which issues of fact are tried in our courts is well settled.  After the normal processes of discovery and interrogatories have been completed, the parties are allowed to lead their evidence so that the trial judge can determine where the truth lies in the light of that evidence.  To that rule there are some well-recognised exceptions.  For example, it may be clear as a matter of law at the outset that even if a party were to succeed in proving all the facts that he offers to prove he will not be entitled to the remedy that he seeks.  In that event a trial of the facts would be a waste of time and money, and it is proper that the action should be taken out of court as soon as possible.  In other cases it may be possible to say with confidence before trial that the factual basis for the claim is fanciful because it is entirely without substance.  It may be clear beyond question that the statement of facts is contradicted by all the documents or other material on which it is based.  The simpler the case the easier it is likely to be take that view and resort to what is properly called summary judgment.  But more complex cases are unlikely to be capable of being resolved in that way without conducting a mini-trial on the documents without discovery and without oral evidence.  As Lord Woolf said in <i>Swain v Hillman, </i>at p 95, that is not the object of the rule.  It is designed to deal with cases that are not fit for trial at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96. In <i>Wenlock v Moloney</i> [1965]  1 WLR 1238 <i> </i>the plaintiff's claim of damages for conspiracy was struck out after a four day hearing on affidavits and documents<i>.  </i>Danckwerts LJ said of the inherent power of the court to strike out, at p 1244B-C:</p>
<p></p><ul>"this summary jurisdiction of the court was never intended to be exercised by a minute and protracted examination of the documents and facts of the case, in order to see whether the plaintiff really has a cause of action.  To do that is to usurp the position of the trial judge, and to produce a trial of the case in chambers, on affidavits only, without discovery and without oral evidence tested by cross-examination in the ordinary way.  This seems to me to be an abuse of the inherent power of the court and not a proper exercise of that power."<p></p></ul>
<p>Sellers LJ said, at p 1243C-D, that he had no doubt that the procedure adopted in that case had been wrong and that the plaintiff's case could not be stifled at that stage, and Diplock LJ agreed.</p>
<i>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97. In the Court of Appeal [2000] 2 WLR 15, 86F the majority said that "this somewhat rigid position" had been modified in<i> Williams and Humbert Ltd v W &amp; H Trade Marks (Jersey) Ltd </i>[1986] AC 368, where Lord Templeman said at pp 435H-436A that if an application to strike out involves a prolonged and serious argument the judge should, as a general rule, decline to proceed with the argument unless he not only harbours doubts about the soundness of the pleading but, in addition, is satisfied that striking out will obviate the necessity for a trial or will substantially reduce the burden of preparing for the trial or the burden of the trial itself: see also Lord Mackay of Clashfern at p 441E-F.  But they were satisfied that this case fell within the exceptional class for the same reasons as those explained in the <i>Williams and Humbert </i>case, and that Clarke J was right to embark upon the exercise.  I too would not criticise the judge for undertaking the exercise.  But I would also pay careful regard to what the Court of Appeal in <i>Wenlock v Moloney </i>regarded as objectionable.  In <i>Morris v Bank of America National Trust</i> [2000]  1 All ER 954, 966B Morritt LJ said that <i>Wenlock's</i> case illustrated a salutary principle.  He then said at p 966B-C:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In the <i>Three Rivers DC</i> case the Court of Appeal upheld the decision of Clarke J to strike out a complicated claim for damages for misfeasance in a public office made against the Bank of England for authorising BCCI to carry on the business of banking.  In that case all the evidence then available to the plaintiff was before the court because all the facts had been investigated by Bingham LJ as he then was… Obviously the fact of a recent inquiry is a material distinction."<p></p></ul>
<p>For reasons already explained (in section (4)), I do not think that the investigation that was conducted by Bingham LJ justifies a departure from the principle. I consider that both Clarke J and the majority in the Court of Appeal were wrong to approach this case on the basis that all the facts that are relevant to the claim that is being made in this case had been investigated.</p>
<i>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98. The present case is, as everyone concerned with it has recognised, one of a quite exceptional character.  The issues of fact which the claimants seek to raise are highly complex.  They relate to matters in which they were not directly involved, as they were third parties to the system of regulation which was set up to protect them.  They involve meetings and discussions between many parties at which they were not represented and they extend, through no fault of theirs, over a very long period.  The issues of law are also complex, as the claim depends on an assessment of the state of mind of the Bank's officials at each of the various stages in the history.  Much of what was passing through their minds can be discovered by examining the documents.  But the court is normally reluctant to draw inferences of the kind that need to be drawn in this case without seeing and hearing the witnesses.  Bingham LJ had that advantage.  The court, so far, has not.<i></i></p><i>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99. My approach to this issue can therefore be summarised against this background as follows.  For the reasons which I have already given (in section (3)), I consider that the claimants' pleadings give sufficient notice to the Bank of the case which they wish to present and that the facts pleaded are capable of satisfying the requirements of the tort.  That being so, I would be inclined to hold that this highly complex case should not be decided on the documents without hearing oral evidence but should go to trial.  This view is reinforced by what I have said about the Bingham report.  I would leave out of account the findings and conclusions in that report which the parties are agreed would at any trial be inadmissible.  It is not just that, strictly speaking, they are irrelevant to any decision that might be made by the trial judge.  I also believe, for the reasons that I have just given, that it would be contrary to the overriding requirement of fairness for them to be taken into account in reaching a decision as to whether this case can be decided without hearing oral evidence.<i></i></p><i>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100. I would also examine the question whether the claim has no real prospect of succeeding at the outset from a totally neutral standpoint.  By that I mean that I would not make any assumptions either one way or the other about the competence or integrity of the Bank or its officials as a prelude to examining the available evidence.  I accept that conduct amounting to misfeasance in public office is not to be inferred lightly.  That is true as a general proposition, whatever may be the task or status of the impugned public officer.  But I think that it would be to risk pre-judging the case to attempt to evaluate the action's prospects of success by considering at this stage, before hearing evidence, whether the claimants' case against the Bank as regulator is inherently implausible or scarcely credible.  These factors, taken as a whole, seem to me to point clearly against giving a summary judgment in the Bank's favour under CPR rule 24.<i></i></p><i>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101. I turn then to the state of the evidence.  I shall deal with this matter briefly.  It is clear, as my noble and learned friend Lord Steyn has indicated, that the facts must be left to the trial judge if the case is to go to trial.  As I said in my introduction (section (1)(a)), the history can conveniently be divided up into four periods: (a) prior to the grant of the licence in June 1980, (b) June 1980 to December 1986, (c) December 1986 to April 1990 and (d) April 1990 to closure in July 1991.<i></i></p><i>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102. In regard to the period prior to the grant of the licence in June 1980 the majority in the Court of Appeal said that they agreed with Clarke J that there was material from which it could be said to be at least arguable that the Bank must have known that the Luxembourg regulators were not regulating BCCI SA properly and did not have the resources to do so.  They were against the claimants on the question<i> </i>whether there was an arguable case on foresight of loss during this<i> </i>period:<i> </i>[2000] 2 WLR 15, 92A-C<i>.  </i>Clarke J said, at p 40 of his third<i> </i>judgment, that it seemed to him to offend common sense to conclude that it actually knew, believed or suspected that if it licensed BCCI SA it would, or even might, collapse.  By April 1990 however the picture had, in their view, entirely changed.  The majority in the Court of Appeal said that the PW report to the board of BCCI Holdings of 18 April 1990 was highly significant, as it marked a date after which it would be impossible in their judgment to contend that there was no arguable case that the Bank was aware of a very serious and very immediate threat to depositors of BCCI SA: [2000] 2 WLR 15, 99H.  Clarke J said (at p 117) that it is plain that the Bank appreciated that in the absence of remedial steps BCCI would probably collapse.  His conclusion however was, at pp 164-165, that at no time between April 1990 and June 1991 did the Bank believe or suspect that the majority shareholders would probably not save the Bank.  At this point therefore, as the majority in the Court of Appeal observed, at p 99H, the prospect of a rescue operation being promoted by the Abu Dhabi government, and the Bank's perception of the various possible outcomes, assumes central importance.  The majority said, at p 101F, that they agreed with the judge that the claimants had no arguable case that the Bank dishonestly failed to revoke the authorisation of BCCI SA in circumstances when it knew, believed or suspected that the company would probably collapse without being rescued.<i></i></p><i>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103. These views were, as can be seen from the judgments, heavily influenced by passages in the Bingham report which I consider to be irrelevant to the question whether the claim should be struck out.  I have examined the available material from a different standpoint.  I have left those passages out of account.  I have asked myself whether, in regard to each of the four periods, the available material can be taken to have been fully examined and tested at this stage.  The limitations which are inherent in this exercise are obvious.  All we can do is read the material and compare it with the case that is being made in the new draft particulars.  In a simple case this may be all that needs to be done in order to reach a clear view that the claim has no real prospect of succeeding.  If one can reach that view, it follows as night follows day that all the usual fact-finding exercises of discovery, interrogation and cross-examination of witnesses will achieve no purpose and the claim should be struck out.  But I am not persuaded this exceptional case falls into that category.<i></i></p><i>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104. I agree that there is material in the documents that are already available to support the pleading in Schedule 2, of the new draft particulars that the Bank knew that before the grant of the full licence to BCCI SA that it was not entitled to rely on the Luxembourg regulator.  Given that starting point, I cannot say that the claimants have no real prospect of proving that the Bank knew that their initial act in licensing BCCI SA was unlawful, that its licence and authorisation remained unlawful throughout the remaining three periods and that all subsequent omissions to revoke the licence and authorisation were affected by the same illegality.  I have more difficulty with the question whether there is material to support the pleading in Schedule 3 that at the time of licensing the Bank knew that loss was probable or that it had the state of mind regarding loss to depositors and potential depositors that amounted to recklessness.  There is no direct evidence of this in the available documents, and I am not confident that they contain any material which suggests that contemporary documentary evidence to this effect is likely to become available.  At best for the claimants, it appears that is a matter which will have to be inferred from other evidence.<i></i></p><i>
