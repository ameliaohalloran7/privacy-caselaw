<p class="para">86.&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, from the perspective of Community law, I consider that the Commissioners’ solution to the problem fails on the very grounds that the problem exists, namely that it breaches the principles of effectiveness and legitimate expectation. One year of disapplication expiring in May 1998 would come to an end before, indeed years before, it was established that (a) the absence of a transitional provision meant that there had been a breach of Community law principles (<i>Marks &amp; Spencer II,</i> in July 2002), (b) there was nonetheless at least the possibility of a period of disapplication (<i>Grundig II</i>,<i> </i>in September 2002), and (c) contrary to the firmly expressed opinion of the Commissioners, the claims fell within regulation 29 (<i>University of Sussex v Customs and Excise Commissioners</i> [2004] STC 1, in October 2003). While the third point may not be significant, the first two points establish, at least to my satisfaction that accepting the submission of the Commissioners would involve hardly more than paying lip service to the important principles of effectiveness and legitimate expectation.</p>
<p class="para">87.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point about the Commissioners’ primary case. Even if the possibility of a period of disapplication had occurred to someone with an accrued right to claim input tax as at 1 May 1997, the length of that period would have been a matter of speculation. Despite the Commissioners’ arguments to the contrary, I do not accept that, even with wisdom of hindsight, and in particular with the benefit of the reasoning in <i>Grundig II</i>, it would have been possible, or is even now possible, to conclude that the length of the disapplication period would be six months. Although that was the period mentioned by the ECJ, it was, as I have indicated, (a) expressly identified in para 40 as a “minimum"(although I acknowledge that it was not so described, in specific terms, at the end of para 41), and (b) related in para 39 to the reduction in a limitation period to three years from five or ten years. The national court, even in <i>Grundig II </i>itself, could have gone for a longer period than six months, and, in this case, the reduction in the limitation period to three years was from the time that VAT was introduced, and so was from a potential period of 24 years. </p>
<p class="para">88.&nbsp;&nbsp;This point seems to me to represent a second reason for rejecting the Commissioners’ primary case. As I have mentioned, a valid limitation period, must, in order to satisfy Community law, be “fixed in advance” - see <i>Marks &amp; Spencer II </i>at para 39. In my judgment, the same principle must, as a matter of logic, apply to a transitional period which has to be included when a new retrospective time limit is introduced. After all, the transitional period serves the same function as a limitation period. If that is right, then, as I see it, the period of disapplication envisaged in the last sentence of para 41 of <i>Grundig II</i>, must also comply with the principle. Again, it serves precisely the same purpose as a limitation period, namely to enable people with a certain type of claim (in this case a claim based on an accrued right) to know within what period they have to bring their claims. Otherwise, where no transitional period has been provided for, persons with accrued claims will not know, or be able to find out, with any confidence by when they have to make their claims. In other words, the Community law requirement of legal certainty would not be met by the Commissioners’ primary contention. </p>
<p class="para">89.&nbsp;&nbsp;I ought to deal with the Commissioners’ argument that my reasoning so far is inconsistent with passages in two judgments of the ECJ. First, and most directly in point, it is said that, in the last sentence of para 41 in <i>Grundig II</i>, the ECJ effectively indicated that the period of disapplication, in a case where there was no adequate transitional provision, should be co-extensive with (i.e. equal in duration and commencement to) that of the requisite transitional provision. It seems to me that this argument ignores the fact that it is for the Member State, if necessary by reference to the national court, to decide on the appropriate period of disapplication: at best from the Commissioners’ point of view, the ECJ was saying that it might be permissible for a national court to adopt such an approach. </p>
<p class="para">90.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I cannot accept that the “adequate transitional period” referred to in that sentence was intended to be one identified on an ad hoc<i> </i>basis, to be applied retrospectively from the date the new limitation period came into force, let alone to start, and even end, in circumstances where the great majority of those who are intended to benefit from it would reasonably be unaware of its existence. Such an interpretation would be quite inconsistent with much of the thrust of the reasoning on the ECJ on the issue actually before it. In my opinion, in the last sentence of para 41 of its judgment in <i>Grundig II</i>, the ECJ was saying that legislation containing a retrospective limitation period without a transitional provision could be retrospectively effective, provided that what amounted to an effective transitional period (such as a period of disapplication) was accorded by the Member State, but that it was that Member State to determine how and when it accorded such a period, and what the period was, provided Community law principles, especially those of effectiveness, legitimate expectation, and certainty (as well as equivalence, which is not in issue here), were satisfied.</p>
<p class="para">91.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commissioners also relied on the reasoning of the ECJ (and of the Advocate General) in <i>Fantask A/S v Industriministeriet (Erhvervministeriet) </i>(Case C-188/95) [1997] ECR I-6783. In that case, the ECJ held, that a national five-year limitation period could be relied on by the Danish Government to defeat a taxpayer’s claim for repayment of money paid under a charge imposed on the basis of a wrongly transposed a Directive, even though time began to run before the Government corrected the error. This was justified, at least by the Advocate General in paras 68 to 71 and 82 to 84 of his powerful Opinion) on the basis of (a) the right of a Member State to organise its finances without the risk of facing very late unexpected and large claims, and (b) it being more appropriate to leave taxpayers in such cases with claims for damages in appropriate cases. The ECJ’s reasons were of a more general nature (in paras 47 to 52).</p>
<p class="para">92.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not consider that the reasoning in <i>Fantask </i>calls my conclusions so far into question. In the first place, the nature of the issue was very different. <i>Fantask</i> was a case where the limitation period, which did not offend Community law, had been in force from the inception of the Danish legislation which was intended, but failed fully, to transpose a Directive. The instant cases, however, concern the introduction of a new limitation period, in relation to a directly effective right, viz. to claim input tax, and the limitation period is the very item which does offend Community law. </p>
<p class="para">93.&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the charges in <i>Fantask </i>were, according to the Danish national court, “levied in pursuance of rules which had been in force for a long time and had been assumed by all concerned to be lawful” (para 53 of the Advocate-General’s Opinion). By contrast, regulation 29(1A) came into force in May 1997, and the possible unlawfulness of not having a transitional provision would have been clear to the Commissioners well before December 1999 (when the High Court made the reference in <i>Marks &amp; Spencer II </i>- see para 25 of the Opinion in that case). </p>
<p class="para">94.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the ECJ in <i>Fantask</i>, as in <i>Marks &amp; Spencer II </i>and <i>Grundig II, </i>emphasised that the determination of appropriate limitation periods (and, I add, it must follow, of appropriate periods of disapplication to ensure compliance with Community law) is primarily a matter “for the domestic legal system of each Member State” (para 47). In this case, unlike in <i>Fantask</i>, the limitation period in question undoubtedly infringes Community law, and it is therefore up to the UK courts, as the relevant arm of “the domestic legal system", to decide on the appropriate means of compliance. </p>
<p class="para">95.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the court in <i>Fantask </i>also stated that such periods must “not render [it] virtually impossible or excessively difficult” to make a claim in “exercise of rights conferred by Community law” (para 52). In my opinion, if the period of disapplication in the present case expired in May 1998, it would have been “virtually impossible or excessively difficult” for persons with accrued rights, as a class, to mount their claims in time. In the light of the wording of regulation 29(1A), both common sense and expert legal advice (at least before the High Court reference in <i>Marks &amp; Spencer II</i> in December 1999, at the very earliest) would have almost inevitably led to the clear conclusion that it would simply have been a waste of time money and effort to make the necessary investigations and compilations to mount any claim for input tax after May 1997 based on accrued rights to reclaim. </p>
<p class="para">96.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having rejected the Commissioners’ primary case (on the basis of much of the same reasoning as Lord Walker), it is necessary to consider a number of different possible periods of disapplication which have been identified. However, before considering the appropriate characterisation of the disapplication period in the present case, I must deal with another argument raised by the Commissioners. They contend that only those people who could and would have made claims during the transitional period which ought to have been, but was not, accorded in May 1997, should be entitled to raise claims during the period of disapplication, whatever it is determined to be. That appears to me to be both wrong in principle and inconvenient in practice. </p>
<p class="para">97.&nbsp;&nbsp;The “could have” point goes to whether the person concerned has an accrued right, and is therefore entitled to complain of the absence of a sufficient transitional provision. Accordingly, it appears to me to take matters no further. The “would have” point is in my view simply wrong. A period, whether of transition or disapplication, is intended to be for the benefit of anyone who could take advantage of it. If the legislation fails to accord an effective transitional period, then the Member State, through the legislature the executive or the courts, must do so. Quite apart from this, arguments and evidence as to the hypothetical question of whether a particular claim would have been made during a notional transitional period would very often be expensive and time-consuming and likely to lead to uncertainty. While not decisive, such a consideration is not irrelevant. Accordingly, again in agreement with Lord Walker, and also in agreement with the Court of Appeal in the <i>Conde Nast</i> case ([2006] STC 1721, para 48), I would reject the Commissioners’ contention that a person with an accrued right can only take advantage of a period of disapplication if he or she would have made a claim during the transitional period (if there had been one).</p>
<p class="para">98.&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of different possible dates were suggested as the start of the disapplication period (or, to be strictly accurate, the start of the end of the disapplication period) for the benefit of those with accrued rights as at 1 May 1997. It does not appear to me that it would accord with the principles I have been considering if the appropriate period ran from the publication of any of the decisions in <i>Marks &amp; Spencer II</i>,<i> Grundig II</i>,<i> </i>or, indeed, <i>University of Sussex</i>, (assuming in the Commissioners’ favour that it is possible for a court decision to operate as the beginning of a period of disapplication). This is for two main reasons. The first is essentially the same as that discussed in paragraphs [79](c), [87], and [88] above. In each case, it would be impossible for taxpayers with accrued claims to know the length of the period which the court would think it appropriate to determine as being the period of disapplication. As I have already mentioned, after <i>Grundig II</i> well-advised taxpayers might be pretty confident that it would be at least six months, but, crucially for present purposes, there was good reason to think that the period of disapplication could well have been longer. </p>
<p class="para">99.&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it seems to me unrealistic to conclude that taxpayers should have appreciated that time was running prospectively against them (in the form of a period of disapplication) from any one of the decisions in <i>Marks &amp; Spencer II</i>, <i>Grundig II</i>, and <i>University of Sussex</i>. While many large businesses no doubt had access to highly expert legal and accountancy advice, that would not have been true of the great majority of those who may have had accrued claims for input tax in 1997. To expect such people to appreciate the effect of those decisions of the ECJ or the Court of Appeal on their accrued rights to reclaim input tax is, in my opinion, unrealistic. </p>
<p class="para">100.&nbsp;&nbsp;This point is significantly reinforced by the fact that the Commissioners (or their statutory predecessors) were publicly announcing that they were only prepared to accord a concession to a very limited number persons with accrued claims, namely those who could and would have made claims during a specific period immediately after 1 May 1997. This was done through the publication of two Business Briefs, BB 22/02 issued some three weeks after <i>Marks &amp; Spencer II</i>,<i> </i>and BB27/02 issued about two weeks after <i>Grundig II</i>. Even at the time of the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>University of Sussex v Customs and Excise Comrs </i>[2004] STC1, taxpayers were still being led to believe that this was the view of the Commissioners, as indeed it was. It seems to me clear that these two Briefs proceeded under the misapprehension discussed earlier, namely that the disapplication period could only be relied on by those who could and would have made claims during a transitional period, if one had been included in the legislation. I do not consider that people with accrued rights can fairly be said to have enjoyed a reasonable period of transition or disapplication if, during that period, they were being told by the Commissioners, the relevant branch of the executive, that their claims would be rejected, because only a very limited category of claims would be paid.</p>
<p class="para">101.&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the Court of Appeal’s decision in <i>University of Sussex</i>, taxpayers with accrued claims for input tax were being told in BB4/02 by the Commissioners that regulation 29 did not apply to their claims as they fell within section 80 of the Value Added Tax Act 1994. I was at one time attracted to the notion that that was another reason for rejecting <i>Marks &amp; Spencer II </i>or <i>Grundig II</i> as starting the disapplication period. However, on reflection, I do not think that that is a good point. Whether an accrued claim fell under regulation 29 or section 80, it was, in each case, subject to a retrospectively imposed time limit without a transitional provision. </p>
<p class="para">102.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, while I agree with the views of Lord Walker, and with the conclusion of Arden LJ in the <i>Fleming </i>case (at [2006] STC 864, paras 51-2), that the reasoning of the ECJ requires the UK courts to impose a realistic period of disapplication in these two cases, I disagree with them that such a period should run from the ECJ’s decision in <i>Marks &amp; Spencer I</i>, or indeed the decisions in <i>Grundig II </i>or<i> University of Sussex.</i>.</p>
<p class="para">103.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also reject the notion that the period of disapplication should run from the issue of either of the two Business Briefs to which I have made reference. Although they each identified a specific period, and therefore did not suffer from want of certainty, and although, at least as presently advised, I consider that the latter of the two Briefs very probably gave a sufficient period (nearly nine months), they both limited the concession to a very narrow group of those with accrued rights at the date the time limit in regulation 29(1A) was introduced. As already indicated, it does not seem to me to be reasonable to hold, that a person who had an accrued right has fairly been given an opportunity of making a claim, when the Commissioners, the relevant organ of the executive arm of government, was officially announcing that, if such a claim were made, it would not be allowed. In any event, at least on the evidence available, I rather doubt whether the Business Briefs would have been sufficiently widely disseminated to make it right to conclude that all potential claimants should be treated as having had sufficient notice of the period of disapplication.</p>
<p class="para">104.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, the period of disapplication (or, to be strictly accurate, the beginning of the end of the period of disapplication) has not yet arisen. Subject to one point, I would have thought that it would be a matter for Parliament to legislate prospectively for a specific transitional period, or for the Commissioners to communicate in clear terms, a final period during which claims for input tax arising before 1 May 1997 could be made. The possibility of legislation speaks for itself. The possibility of the Commissioners giving what amounts to an extra-statutory concession was said on behalf of the respondents to be insufficient. I do not agree. Provided that the Commissioners allow a sufficiently long period, which is effectively communicated in sufficiently clear terms to those registered for VAT, that would suffice. </p>
<p class="para">105.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not see that this conclusion is inconsistent with what the ECJ said in para 25 of its judgment in <i>EC Commission v United Kingdom </i>(Case C-33/03) [2005] STC 582, about the insufficiency of “tax authority guarantees” and the need for conforming “national legislation". That was a case in which the Member State had not given effect to a Directive. This is a case where the Member State has to disapply otherwise conforming legislation so as to comply with Community procedural law requirements. Indeed, as the Commissioners argue, my view on this point is consistent with what the ECJ said in para 43 of <i>Stichtung Goed Wonen v Staatssecretaris von Financien </i>(Case C-376/02) [2006] STC 833, about taking into account “procedures for dissemination of information normally used by the member state” in a case involving legitimate expectation.</p>
<p class="para">106.&nbsp;&nbsp;The obligation to allow an appropriate period of disapplication in a case such as this lies with the Member State. In principle, provided that an appropriate period of disapplication is properly accorded and communicated, the requirements of Community law would be satisfied. Legislation, whether primary or secondary, must be deemed to be sufficiently communicated by its enactment. There was some discussion before your Lordships’ House as to the ambit of the doctrine that citizens are to be assumed to know the law. In my judgment, that principle would enable the Commissioners to contend that, if the legislature had accorded (either at the time regulation 29(1A) became law or thereafter) a specific and valid transitional or disapplication period, it would not be open to anyone to contend that he or she was unaware of it. </p>
<p class="para">107.&nbsp;&nbsp;If, however, a period of disapplication was accorded by way of concession by the Commissioners, it would, in my judgment, only be effective if it was properly communicated to those with accrued rights. In this connection, it seems to me that, as already mentioned, communication through the medium of Business Briefs alone may well not be sufficient, as they may come to the attention of only a limited number of taxpayers. However, that should not present problems for the Commissioners. Each quarter, every person registered for VAT receives a VAT form, which he or she is, of course, bound to complete and return; normally included with the form is a pamphlet with information about recent developments in the law and practice relating to VAT. It would, it seems to me, be only too easy for such a pamphlet to include information about any period of disapplication accorded by the Commissioners, and, provided the period was of a proper duration, that, in my opinion, would be quite sufficient. (I refer to <i>Goed Wonen </i>in this context). It may also (or, even conceivably, alternatively) be appropriate for the Commissioners to include this information on their website.</p>
<p class="para">108.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no detailed argument as to whether, and if so in what circumstances, a decision of a court in this country could or should operate to commence a period of disapplication of a retrospective time limit which is introduced without a sufficient transitional period. I am prepared to accept that, in an appropriate case, a decision of a United Kingdom court could have that effect. However, in circumstances such as the present, because of the difficulty of ensuring adequate communication (or to use the word in <i>Goed Wonen</i>, dissemination) of a decision of the court to those who might be affected, other than by the Commissioners, and the ease and speed with which the Commissioners can grant and communicate a concession, I would have thought it unnecessary and inappropriate for a court decision to start time running. The speed with which the concessions contained in the two Business Briefs were made and issued following <i>Marks &amp; Spencer II </i>and <i>Grundig II </i>speaks for itself (although, as I have said, I rather doubt that the Business Briefs alone represent a sufficient communication). </p>
<p class="para">109.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event, therefore, for these reasons, and for those given by Lord Hope, all of which are somewhat different from those of the Court of Appeal, I would dismiss these two appeals.   </p>
