<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;47.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it does not follow that the law as laid down in the <i>Norbury </i>line of cases was correct:  a statement of the law may be definite but wrong.  I am indeed satisfied that the law was misstated in those cases.  A core element of the crime of public nuisance is that the defendant's act should affect the community, a section of the public, rather than simply individuals.  Obvious examples would be the release of smoke or fumes which affect a village or neighbourhood or the emission of loud noises which disturb the neighbourhood.  In such cases the release or emission or - where it is repeated - each release or emission affects the public in the area.  Of course, if one were to break it down, the general effect on the community might well be seen to be made up of a collection of private nuisances occurring more or less simultaneously.  Romer LJ made this point in <i>Attorney General v PYA Quarries Ltd </i>[1957] 2 QB 169, where the court granted an injunction against the defendants carrying on their business in such a manner as to cause splinters to be projected from the confines of their quarry or to occasion a nuisance to Her Majesty's subjects by dust or vibration.  In the pleadings as originally framed the Attorney General had included various allegations about the damage caused to occupiers of the adjacent houses and land;  that the vibrations were a source of danger to the houses, and that the dust settled on them and made them dirty and uncomfortable to live in.  Counsel had later deleted these allegations on the ground that, in a public nuisance action, evidence of individual experiences should not be received, although such evidence would be highly relevant in cases of alleged private nuisance.  Romer LJ rejected this argument, at p 187:</p>
<p></p><ul>"I cannot for myself accept this contention.  Some public nuisances (for example, the pollution of rivers) can often be established without the necessity of calling a number of individual complainants as witnesses.  In general, however, a public nuisance is proved by the cumulative effect which it is shown to have had on the people living within its sphere of influence.  In other words, a normal and legitimate way of proving a public nuisance is to prove a sufficiently large collection of private nuisances."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the number of houses affected by the flying splinters of stone and by the dust and vibration presumably varied a bit from blast to blast, each blast tended to affect homes in the vicinity of the quarry and a picture of the overall effect of the blasting on the community could be built up from the evidence of individual residents about its effect on them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;48.&nbsp;&nbsp;As my noble and learned friend, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, points out, a telephone call or a letter, which is intended to be passed on and broadcast to the public, may be the means of effecting a public nuisance.  Suppose, however, that someone makes a series of obscene telephone calls to people living in a village or neighbourhood.  In that situation each call is heard, and is intended to be heard, only by the recipient.  Of course, as the calls mount up, more and more residents will be affected and the general peace of the neighbourhood may be disturbed.  But each telephone call affects only one individual, not the community in the village or neighbourhood.  Therefore, it does not have that quality which is the hallmark of the crime of public nuisance.  And no such individual call can become a criminal public nuisance merely by reason of the fact that it is one of a series.  Otherwise, acts which were not criminal when originally done would become criminal at some unspecified point when the defendant had made enough calls for it to be said that, taken together, they were affecting the public in the neighbourhood.  In my view, therefore, HH Judge Beezley set the law off down a wrong course in <i>R v Norbury </i>[1978] Crim LR 435, 435 - 436, when he ruled that a public nuisance was constituted by</p>
<p></p><ul>"a repetition over a long period and on a number of occasions of telephone calls of an obscene nature, intending to cause offence and alarm and resulting in such offence and alarm to a large number of Her Majesty's subjects, selected from a telephone directory or merely by chance dialling."<p></p></ul>
<p>In <i>R v Johnson (Anthony) </i>[1997] 1 WLR 367, the defendant was charged on an indictment containing one count of public nuisance, but the particulars referred to telephone calls made on hundreds of occasions to at least 13 women in the South Cumbria area.  The defendant was convicted and, on appeal, argued that his conduct did not amount to the crime of public nuisance.  The Court of Appeal rejected that argument.  Applying the same reasoning as in <i>Norbury</i>, Tucker J said, at p 438C-D, that it was permissible to have regard to the cumulative effect of the calls in determining whether the appellant's conduct constituted a public nuisance.  In the present case the Court of Appeal were, of course, bound by the decision in <i>Johnson </i>and duly applied it.  For the reasons which I have given, I am satisfied that this approach was mistaken and that these decisions should be overruled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;49.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the defendant in <i>Johnson</i>,<i> </i>Mr Rimmington was charged on an indictment containing one count of public nuisance.  In his case the particulars referred to him sending 538 separate postal packages between 20 May 1992 and 13 June 2001.  Details about the individual packages were set out in an extensive schedule.  The first package in that schedule was received on 1 June 1992 and the next package that could be dated was received in October 1993.  The recorded incidents are somewhat sparse until June 1995, after which there are many more packages, often apparently sent in batches posted about the same time but quite often in different areas.  The recipients come from a variety of organisations scattered over different parts of London and the South East.  Most of them would not know one another.  In these circumstances it would be highly problematical, for Mr Rimmington or for a court, to decide at what point, if any, the cumulative effect of the letters meant that his conduct was materially affecting the reasonable comfort and convenience of a class of Her Majesty's subjects - and so, ultimately, to make the initial incident in 1992, retrospectively, one component of a single crime of public nuisance committed over nine years.  A crime which was defined so as to apply in such an uncertain way would indeed be objectionable, both in terms of the well-recognised standards of English law and in terms of the Convention jurisprudence.  Both are conveniently summarised in the passage from the judgment of Judge LJ in <i>R v Misra and Srivastava </i>[2005] 1 Cr App R 21, paras 29 - 34, which Lord Bingham has quoted.  But, as I have explained, I am satisfied that the particulars in the indictment do not disclose a legally relevant charge of public nuisance.  I accordingly agree that Mr Rimmington's appeal must be allowed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50.&nbsp;&nbsp;The course of conduct which Mr Rimmington pursued in sending these letters was so depraved and offensive that it would be a matter of concern if the criminal law could not deal with it.  But that is not the case.  As his counsel noted, though with understandable diffidence, there are other offences which might cover the kind of conduct with which he was charged.  Section 1 of the Malicious Communications Act 1988, as amended, makes it an offence to send another person a letter, electronic communication or article of any description which conveys a message which is indecent or grossly offensive, or which conveys a threat or information which is false and known or believed to be false.  The offence is punishable on summary conviction with a maximum of six months' imprisonment and a fine on scale 5.  Similarly, by section 85(1) and (4) of the Postal Services Act 2000 it is an offence to send by post a packet enclosing any thing which is likely to injure a postal worker or which is indecent or obscene.  The offence is triable either way:  on summary conviction it is punishable by a fine, while on conviction on indictment it is punishable by imprisonment for up to 12 months and a fine.  Mr Perry accepted, on behalf of the Crown, that some, at least, of the incidents alleged against Mr Rimmington would have fallen within the scope of one or other of the statutory provisions.  So any decision by your Lordships that Mr Rimmington's conduct does not amount to public nuisance would leave it open to the Crown to deal with future offenders by charging them with the appropriate statutory offence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;51.&nbsp;&nbsp;Why then did the Crown not adopt that course in Mr Rimmington's case?  Mr Perry gave two reasons.  First, by the time that Mr Rimmington was unmasked as the writer of the letters, many of the incidents were so old that there was a bar on any prosecution under statute.  Secondly, even where the offences were not time-barred, the sentence available on conviction under statute was regarded as insufficient to mark the seriousness of the appellant's conduct.  And, if a number of separate offences were charged together in summary proceedings, the maximum sentence that could be imposed was limited to 12 months.  In order to avoid these difficulties, it had been decided to charge Mr Rimmington on indictment with the common law crime of public nuisance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;52.&nbsp;&nbsp;When Parliament enacted the statutory offences, it did not expressly abolish the corresponding aspect of the common law offence of public nuisance.  Therefore, if - contrary to my view - Mr Rimmington's conduct in writing the letters had amounted to a public nuisance, it would presumably have continued to do so even after the statutory offences were introduced.  So a charge could not have been regarded as bad simply because it was framed in terms of the common law rather than in terms of the statute.  To put the matter more generally, where Parliament has not abolished the relevant area of the common law when it enacts a statutory offence, it cannot be said that the Crown can never properly frame a common law charge to cover conduct which is covered by the statutory offence.  Where nothing would have prevented the Crown from charging the defendant under the statute and where the sentence imposed would also have been competent in proceedings under the statute, the defendant is not prejudiced by being prosecuted at common law and can have no legitimate complaint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;53.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, however, according to what Mr Perry told the House, the Crown had deliberately chosen the common law offence in order to avoid the time-bar which Parliament had enacted and to allow the judge, if he thought fit, to impose a heavier sentence than the one permitted under statute.  The issue bears some resemblance to the issue in <i>R v J </i>[2005] 1 AC 562.  There is no suggestion, of course, that the Crown acted in bad faith.  On the contrary, it is easy to understand why they did what they did.  In a particular case, such as this, a time-limit which prevents prosecution once a certain time has passed since the act was committed can appear to be arbitrary and to reward an offender for concealing his offences.  The sentence available under the statute may also seem inadequate to reflect the gravity of the defendant's conduct.  But Parliament has deliberately chosen to intervene and to prescribe a period within which conduct of this kind can be prosecuted summarily under statute.  This must be taken to reflect Parliament's judgment that, if the conduct has not been prosecuted within that time, the public interest is now against proceeding.  That judgment may be based on various factors.  Parliament may, for example, consider that after a certain period everyone should move on and prosecutors should turn their attention to other matters.  Police and prosecution resources, it may be thought, are better spent on detecting and prosecuting recent, rather than stale, offences of this kind or recent, rather than old, incidents in a course of conduct.  More serious matters should be given priority.  Similarly, in the matter of sentence, Parliament has reached a view that certain conduct is appropriately covered by an offence which can be tried only summarily and which should attract no more than a particular level of sentence.  Parliament has also fixed the maximum sentence to be imposed in summary proceedings, even where the defendant is convicted of more than one charge.  Again, in any particular case, the sentence available under statute may appear to the prosecutor to be inadequate.  But Parliament is entitled to place an offence in what it regards as the appropriate level in the hierarchy of offences and to limit the sentencing power of a court where the accused is not tried by jury.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;54.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not for the Crown to second-guess Parliament's judgment as to any of these matters by deliberately setting out to reject the applicable statutory offences and to charge the conduct in question under common law in order to avoid the time-limits or limits on sentence which Parliament has thought appropriate.  It may be that, in the light of experience, Parliament's judgment can be seen to have been flawed or to have been superseded by events.  Doubtless, the prosecuting authorities have channels through which they can - and perhaps should - draw any such perceived deficiencies to the attention of the Home Secretary.  It is then up to ministers and, ultimately, Parliament to decide whether the law should be changed.  But, unless and until it is changed, its provisions should be respected and the Crown should not devise a strategy to avoid them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;55.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Bingham has described the circumstances of Mr Goldstein's case.  It is plain that he put the salt in the envelope intending it to be a humorous message to his friend, Mr Ehrlich, who would have understood the joke.  He posted the letter in a period when, following events in the United States, there were fears about the possibility of anthrax germs being sent through the post.  It is therefore not surprising that when, just before 6 am, some of the salt spilled out of the torn envelope on to the hands of a sorter, Mr Owen, he raised the alarm.  Indeed, Mr Goldstein accepted that the escape of the salt could have terrified Mr Owen.  The Wembley sorting office was cleared and the police were called.  They soon saw that the powder was salt but the sorters could not return to work for over an hour.  For that reason, the first delivery of letters was somewhat later than usual.  The management then decided to cancel the second delivery since, by the time the first delivery had been completed, the postal workers had finished their shift and would have had to be paid overtime to do the second delivery.  The judge reminded the jury of evidence that over 35,000 businesses missed the second delivery and that some people had telephoned to complain.  He was therefore directing the jury that, in deciding whether Mr Goldstein was guilty of public nuisance, they could take account of the inconvenience to the public caused by the cancellation of the second delivery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;56.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>R v Shorrock </i>[1994] QB 279, 289, the Court of Appeal held that a defendant landowner was responsible for a public nuisance which he knew or ought to have known (in the sense that the means of knowledge were available to him) would be the consequence of activities carried on by him on his land.  In the present case the Court of Appeal held that a similar test should be applied to Mr Goldstein.  Mr Goldberg argued that the House should disapprove the decision in <i>Shorrock </i>and bring the <i>mens rea </i>for public nuisance into line with the approach adopted in <i>R v G </i>[2004] 1 AC 1034.  For my part, I was not persuaded by that submission.  In <i>R v G </i>the House was considering the proper interpretation of "reckless" in section 1(1) and (2) of the Criminal Damage Act 1971 and, in para 28 of the leading speech, Lord Bingham made it as plain as he could that he was not addressing the meaning of "reckless" in any other statutory or common law context. The decision is therefore not in point.  Particularly having regard to the essentially regulatory nature of much of the law of public nuisance, it seems to me that, even if it is unusual, the <i>mens rea </i>described in <i>Shorrock </i>is apt in situations where the offence truly applies.  I would accept the reasoning in <i>Shorrock.  </i>Applying the test in <i>Shorrock</i>, I am, however, satisfied that Mr Goldstein did not have the necessary <i>mens rea </i>to be convicted of public nuisance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;57.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not unlawful for Mr Goldstein to put salt into a packet to be sent through the post.  Nevertheless, if he had done so with the intention of provoking an anthrax scare and disrupting the post and if those events had come to pass, he might well have been guilty of public nuisance.  But, according to the evidence, he had no such intention and, he said, he had never for a moment foreseen that the salt would leak out.  Even if he had done so, however, it seems to me impossible to hold that he either knew or had the means of knowing that the events which happened in the Wembley sorting office and in the surrounding district would occur.  In the heightened atmosphere of the time, he might have been able to foresee that there would be some disruption in the sorting office, but he had no means of knowing at what time of day his letter would be sorted or that the second delivery of post would be cancelled and cause inconvenience to the businesses in the area.  Indeed, as the judge explained to the jury, the manager only decided to cancel it when he realised that they would have to pay overtime to the postal workers to do the work.  The disruption to the public, which the jury were invited to consider, was therefore not an immediate consequence of Mr Goldstein's act, but the consequence of an independent commercial decision of the post office management which he had no means of anticipating when he posted the letter.  To hold Mr Goldstein guilty of public nuisance on the basis of this (relatively minor) inconvenience to the public would be to stretch the offence beyond its legitimate limits.  I accordingly agree that his appeal should be allowed and his conviction quashed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BARONESS HALE OF RICHMOND</p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;58.&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree, for the reasons given by my noble and learned friend, Lord Bingham of Cornhill, that both these appeals should be allowed. It is not open to the courts, however tempted they might be by the history so attractively presented by John Spencer in his valuable article, "Public Nuisance - A Critical Assessment" [1989] CLJ 55, to abolish existing offences.  Nor it is open to the courts to "widen existing offences so as to make punishable conduct of a type hitherto not subject to punishment" (para 33, above). We are not, therefore, engaged in a law reform exercise. Our task is to define and re-establish the essential ingredients of the crime as they emerged after the publication of <i>Hawkins'</i> <i>Treatise of the Pleas of the Crown </i>in 1716. The essence of the crime which he and the later institutional writers identified was, as my noble and learned friend has shown, "the suffering of common injury by members of the public by interference with rights enjoyed by them as such" (para 6, above). It is not permissible to multiply separate instances of harm suffered by individual members of the public, however similar the harm or the conduct which produced it, and call them a common injury. Conduct which was not criminal when the first letter was sent would become criminal at some unknown future time when it was thought that enough such letters had been sent to constitute such a common injury. This must be wrong in principle. Nor can it be right to punish someone who had no reason to think that his letter would cause any harm to anyone, because he had no reason to think that the salt would leak out in circumstances where his joke would not be understood.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;59.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to be able to reach both conclusions, because I was a signatory to the Law Commission's <i>Report on Poison-Pen Letters</i> (Law Com No 147, 1985). This resulted in the Malicious Communications Act 1985, which seems tailor-made to identify any culpable conduct in both these situations. This arose from the Commission's examination of the common law offence of criminal libel, as part of its programme of codification of the Criminal Law. Neither in that Report, nor in the preceding Working Paper on <i>Criminal Libel</i> (LCWP No 84, 1982), was it suggested that public nuisance might be available to cover campaigns of multiple malicious communications such as that conducted by Mr Rimmington. This is all the more remarkable, as the Commission had briefly considered public nuisance in the context of its work on public order offences, which eventually resulted in the Public Order Act 1986. The Commission had originally intended to include public nuisance in that work,  as it had sometimes been used in public order situations, such as 'sit-down' demonstrations in central London: see<i> R v Moule</i> [1964] Crim LR 303; <i>R v Adler </i>[1964] Crim LR 304; cf <i>R v Clark (No 2)</i> [1964] 2 QB 315. In its Working Paper on <i>Offences against Public Order</i> (LCWP 82, 1982, at paras 1.9 to 1.12), however, the Commission announced that reviewing the offence, either as a whole or insofar as it penalised highway obstructions, would take the project far outside the realms of public order. The "best practicable approach" would be a separate review of the whole offence (para 1.12). Unfortunately, however, this has not been done. The Commission did remark (at para 1.10) that the offence had been used in a wide variety of situations, and referred to the then relatively recent cases of <i>R v Norbury</i> [1978] Crim LR 435 (making a large number of obscene telephone calls) and <i>R v Soul</i> (1980) 70 Cr App R 295 (assisting in effecting the escape of a patient from Broadmoor). So the offence of public nuisance, as recently employed in the courts, was certainly in the minds of the criminal law team at the Commission in 1982 when they were working on poison pen letters. Yet nowhere was it suggested that public nuisance might be the appropriate response to the more serious and prolonged 'poison pen' campaigns, although these are by no means uncommon. I am relieved to be able to conclude that the Commission was right to ignore it. It is of interest to note, however, that in its <i>Report on Offences relating to Public Order</i> (Law Com No 123, 1983, at para 1.8) the Commission did say that if the recommended offences were enacted "it will be preferable for public nuisance not to be charged in situations where there are disturbances to public order", thus foreshadowing the observations of my noble and learned friend at paragraph 30, above.</p>
LORD BROWN OF EATON-UNDER-HEYWOOD
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the advantage of reading in draft the speech of my noble and learned friend, Lord Bingham of Cornhill.  I respectfully agree with all that he says and for the reasons he gives, I too would allow both these appeals.</p>
