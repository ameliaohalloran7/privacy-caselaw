<p class="para">92.&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows that a refugee makes a claim for asylum, if he asks the authorities in a country not to throw him out or return him to the country of persecution, even though he simultaneously tells them that he does not wish to settle in their country, but wants to go on to another country.  He is asking for temporary asylum until he can continue on his way.  Indeed, any other interpretation of article 31 would be absurd, since it would force refugees to make a claim to settle in the country as a precondition to obtaining impunity for their illegal entry or presence.  Yet, a major concern of those negotiating the 1951 Convention was that their governments would find themselves having to take more refugees than they could handle.</p>
<p class="para">93.&nbsp;&nbsp;Commentators are agreed that the delegates who inserted the requirement for refugees to present themselves without delay to the authorities regarded it as important.  Its purpose was to encourage refugees to come forward and regularise their position, rather than eking out an existence in an unlawful twilight world on the fringes of society.</p>
<p class="para">94.&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the spirit behind the Convention is one of treating refugees humanely, as people having a recognised place in the legitimate world, not as beings who can exist only on the margins and by committing crimes which Contracting States must then ignore.  That is why the Convention deals with a whole range of topics which relate to the position of refugees in society:  for example, freedom to practise their religion (article 4), personal status (article 12), property rights (article 13), artistic rights and industrial property (article 14), right of association (article 15), access to the courts (article 16), employment (articles 17 and 18), liberal professions (article 19), housing (article 21), public education (article 22), public relief and assistance (article 23) and social security (article 24).  The aim behind including these provisions is to ensure that refugees enjoy a measure of dignity.</p>
<p class="para">95.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is wholly consistent with this scheme that Contracting States need only overlook the initial offence of entering and being present illegally.  After they arrive in a safe country, the refugees are to present themselves to the authorities who must then treat them in accordance with the Convention.  In that situation the refugees have no justification for committing further offences to escape persecution and are bound by the criminal law, just like anyone else in the country concerned.  That is made clear by article 2:</p>
<p class="qt">“Every refugee has duties to the country in which he finds himself, which require in particular that he conform to its laws and regulations as well as to measures taken for the maintenance of public order.”</p>
<p class="paraleft">Section 31(5) of the 1999 Act is consistent with article 2.  As Ms Montgomery put it, the Convention was not designed to create an Alsatia where refugees could commit crimes with impunity.  So they cannot avoid punishment if they steal food on the pretext that they need it to feed themselves or their children, or if they break into a house to provide themselves or their children with accommodation, or if they use a forged ticket to travel by bus or train to the docks in order to get a ship to another country, or if, to catch a flight, they take a taxi to the airport and run off without paying the fare.  In each and all of these situations, article 31 is quite deliberately silent and article 2 applies.</p>
<p class="para">96.&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally deliberately, article 31 is silent and article 2 applies if refugees reach the departure gate in the Contracting State and present false documents with the intention of travelling to another country in order to claim asylum and settle there.  If they present false passports or visas in order to persuade the airline to carry them, they are practising a deception on the airline which could result in it being subject to severe penalties in the destination country, under the equivalent of section 40 of the 1999 Act.  Not only would it require clear language to oblige Contracting States to grant refugees immunity from an offence that could have such potential consequences for a third party, but it would be contrary to the philosophy of the Convention.  Refugees who are in a safe country and who want to travel on to another country have no more right than anyone else to use criminal means to do so.  To suggest otherwise is to treat them as a breed apart, not as legitimate members of society.</p>
<p class="para">97.&nbsp;&nbsp;The argument at the hearing tended to focus almost exclusively on article 31 - which is actually a relatively minor, if very worthwhile, provision.  Far more significant are articles 27 and 28.  Article 27 is headed “Identity Papers” and obliges a Contracting State to issue identity papers to any refugee in their territory who does not possess a valid travel document.  This article deals with travel within the State in question and amounts to an obligation to provide an identity card where people in that State require one.  Article 28(1) deals with documents for travel outside the State and so is more immediately relevant for present purposes:</p>
<p class="qt">“The Contracting States shall issue to refugees lawfully staying in their territory travel documents for the purpose of travel outside their territory, unless compelling reasons of national security or public order otherwise require, and the provisions of the Schedule to this Convention shall apply with respect to such documents.  The Contracting States may issue such a travel document to any other refugee in their territory; they shall in particular give sympathetic consideration to the issue of such a travel document to refugees in their territory who are unable to obtain a travel document from the country of their lawful residence.”</p>
<p class="paraleft">Under para 7 of the Schedule to the Convention, the Contracting States undertake to recognise the validity of the documents issued in accordance with the provisions of article 28.  The Annex to the Convention sets out, in great detail, the terms of the Specimen Travel Document, which must, in particular, include a provision authorising the holder to return to the issuing country within a certain period.</p>
<p class="para">98.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>A Study of Statelessness </i>was published by the United Nations in 1949.  Despite being directed at the specific problems of stateless persons, the study did much to prompt the adoption of the 1951 Convention and to determine the range of subjects which it covered.  Even a quick glance at the study is enough to show the importance which was attached to travel documents at the time.  I refer, for instance, to Part One, Section I, Chapter 1 (International Movement, Sojourn and Settlement), Section II, Chapter 2 (Travel Documents), and Section III, Chapter 1(1) (Travel, Right of Entry and Sojourn).  As the study explained, experience in the years between the World Wars had proved that, unless a refugee had a travel document which not only authorised him to travel to another country but also authorised him to return to the country which issued the document, countries would be reluctant to admit the refugee.  They would do so only if they could be confident that, when appropriate, the refugee would be able to return to the country from which he had come and would, therefore, not be stuck in their territory.  Article 28 and para 7 of the Schedule were designed to provide just that kind of travel document.</p>
<p class="para">99.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>The Rights of Refugees under International Law </i>(2005), p 846, Professor Hathaway aptly summarises the situation produced by article 28:</p>
<p class="qt">“The net result is to establish a unified regime for international freedom of movement that exists in parallel to the more general passport-based system.”</p>
<p class="paraleft">Refugees who do not have a passport are rescued from the need to resort forgery and deception:  they are to be issued with a Convention travel document which allows them to move from country to country.  One of the most particular functions of the travel document is to allow refugees “to seek out opportunities for resettlement in a preferred country of asylum":  Hathaway, <i>The Rights of Refugees</i>, p 851.</p>
<p class="para">100.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unnecessary for present purposes to enquire who, precisely, count as refugees “lawfully staying” in the territory of a Contracting State and who are therefore entitled to a travel document under article 28.  What matters is that, under article 28, by contrast with the equivalent provision in earlier conventions, Contracting States may issue these travel documents even to refugees who are not lawfully in their territory.  And the travaux préparatoires show that article 28 was drafted in this way precisely to deal with refugees who had just arrived clandestinely in the initial reception country.  Hathaway, <i>The Rights of Refugees</i>, p 848, quotes the Danish representative, Mr Larsen, as saying at a meeting in January 1950:</p>
<p class="qt">“He took as an example the hypothetical case of a German refugee arriving clandestinely in Denmark, without identity papers, and anxious to travel to the United States for family or other reasons.  In accordance with paragraph 1 of article [28] as adopted, Denmark would not issue him travel documents, because he did not reside regularly in that country.  If, therefore, the real objective was to protect the interests of refugees effectively, it seemed expedient to make some provision whereby Denmark would be able to grant such a refugee a travel document….</p>
<p class="qt">He therefore proposed that article [28] should be so amended that the High Contracting Parties would be able to grant travel documents to all refugees in their territory, whatever their status in the eyes of the law, with the sole stipulation that they should not be regularly resident in another country.”</p>
<p class="paraleft">Mr Larsen continued:</p>
<p class="qt">“A refugee who arrived in Denmark, for example, and was immediately granted a travel document, could go for a certain period of time to the country where he intended to settle;  while there, he could obtain authorisation to reside there regularly.  On the other hand, if such a refugee had no freedom of movement but was confined to Denmark owing to the lack of a travel document, it would be very difficult for him to study the possibility of settling elsewhere.”</p>
<p class="paraleft">Mr Larsen’s initiative was warmly supported by the representative of the International Refugee Organisation:  Hathaway, <i>The Rights of Refugees</i>, p 849 n 601.</p>
<p class="para">101.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, accordingly, as plain as it is unsurprising that those who drafted the Convention did not overlook the plight of refugees who found themselves in a safe state but wanted to settle in another safe state.  On the contrary, they designed a system that would allow refugees to continue their journey lawfully, even though they had no passport.  The very last thing that the representatives would have contemplated was undermining this noble and humanitarian initiative by extending the provisions of article 31 to refugees who ignored the system and resorted to criminal means to achieve the same objective.  As would be expected, therefore, none of the legislation of countries implementing article 31, which is set out in E Feller, V Türk and F Nicholson, <i>Refugee Protection in International Law:  UNHCR’s Global Consultations on International Protection </i>(2003), pp 234-252, covers anything other than offences relating to entering and being present in the country in question.</p>
<p class="para">102.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only authority from any jurisdiction which supports the appellant’s proposed interpretation of article 31 as extending to offences committed by refugees when attempting to move on from a safe country is the decision of the Divisional Court in <i>R v Uxbridge Magistrates’ Court, Ex p Adimi </i>[2001] QB 667.</p>
<p class="para">103.&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the applicants in that case, Mr Sorani, had fled from the Kurdish safe haven in Iraq to Turkey in 1997.  Since it was not safe for him to remain there, he had flown from Istanbul to Heathrow on a false Greek passport and, while in transit there, an agent had supplied him with a false Dutch passport and an airline ticket.  While checking-in, the same day, for an onward flight to Canada where he had family, Mr Sorani was stopped.  When his documents were found to be false, he was arrested and charged.  It is unclear whether or not he applied for asylum.  He pleaded guilty to the same offences as those on the indictment against the present appellant.  Mr Sorani’s predicament was essentially the same as the present appellant’s, except that the 1999 Act, including section 31, had not yet been enacted and the appellant did apply for asylum.</p>
<p class="para">104.&nbsp;&nbsp;Another of the applicants was Mr Kaziu, an Albanian who, along with his wife, fled to Greece on  false Greek passports in 1998.  Three days later, they flew to Gatwick, with the intention of travelling on to Canada where they would claim asylum.  They successfully gained entry to the United Kingdom at Gatwick.  But, the following day, they were discovered to be holding false passports when they attempted to board the ‘plane for Canada at Heathrow.  Mr Kaziu did not ask for asylum.  He and his wife pleaded guilty to the same charges as Mr Sorani.  Again, Mr Kaziu’s case was essentially the same as the present appellant’s, except that section 31 of the 1999 Act had not been enacted and the appellant did apply for asylum.</p>
<p class="para">105.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the 1999 Act had not been enacted at the relevant time, the applicants had to try to rely on article 31 of the Convention itself.  Much of Simon Brown LJ’s judgment was therefore devoted to deciding whether article 31 could provide them with a defence to an offence under English domestic law and, if so, what form that defence might take.  But, in the cases of Mr Sorani and Mr Kaziu, the Divisional Court had also to decide whether article 31 applied to refugees who, having entered the United Kingdom, used false passports in order to travel on to Canada where they wished to claim asylum.  The court held that it did.</p>
<p class="para">106.&nbsp;&nbsp;The court focused on the requirement that, for article 31 to apply, the refugee must have come “directly” from the country where he was in danger.  Referring, in general terms, to the travaux, and to “the writings of well respected academics and commentators", Simon Brown LJ held, [2001] QB 667, 678E-F, that:</p>
<p class="qt">“any merely short term stopover en route to such intended sanctuary cannot forfeit the protection of the article, and that the main touchstones by which exclusion from protection should be judged are the length of stay in the intermediate country, the reasons for delaying there (even a substantial delay in an unsafe third country would be reasonable were the time spent trying to acquire the means of travelling on), and whether or not the refugee sought or found there protection de jure or de facto from the persecution they were fleeing.”</p>
<p class="paraleft">He pointed out that the UNHCR <i>Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for determining Refugee Status </i>(1992) commented that “It is understood that this term ['coming directly'] also covers a person who transits an intermediate country for a short period of time without having applied for, or received, asylum there.”  The basis and scope of that understanding are not explained.</p>
<p class="para">107.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Adimi </i>the respondents argued that refugees like Mr Sorani and Mr Kaziu did not fall within the scope of article 31 for two reasons.  First, since such refugees had entered the United Kingdom with the intention of leaving it again within a short time, they never intended to present themselves to the United Kingdom authorities, least of all “without delay".  Secondly, having chosen not to claim asylum here, despite the United Kingdom being a safe country, they would be unable to satisfy the “coming directly” requirement in article 31.</p>
<p class="para">108.&nbsp;&nbsp;Simon Brown LJ rejected both of the respondents’ arguments, at p 687E-H:</p>
<p class="qt">“Neither of these arguments are in my judgment sustainable.  If I am right in saying that refugees are ordinarily entitled to choose where to claim asylum, and that a short term stopover en route in a country where the traveller’s status is in no way regularised will not break the requisite directness of flight, then it must follow that these applicants would have been entitled to the benefit of article 31 had they reached Canada and made their asylum claims there.  If article 31 would have availed them in Canada, then logically its protection cannot be denied to them here merely because they have been apprehended en route.</p>
<p class="qt">I recognise, of course, that even when arrested, Mr Kaziu did not claim refugee status, and that there is a dispute in Mr Sorani’s case as to whether he did either.  Both, however, were clearly identifiable as passengers who might be eligible for asylum….  It is not suggested, moreover, that the making of a claim would have made any difference to the course of events.  In my judgment both should have been recognised as refugees within the meaning of article 31 and both should have been exempt from penalty under it.”</p>
<p class="para">I am respectfully unable to agree with the reasoning in this passage.</p>
<p class="para">109.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in the Convention gives refugees the right to choose where to claim asylum.  Mr Fordham emphasised that point on behalf of the High Commissioner.  Indeed, the Dublin Convention of 1990 only works because that is the position.  It contains an elaborate system for deciding which member state of the European Community should examine the application of an alien for asylum.  With a minor exception in article 9, that Convention treats the wishes of the applicant as irrelevant.  So, here, Ms Asfaw had no right to choose to claim asylum in America or to try to exercise such a right by committing offences in the United Kingdom in breach of her duty under article 2 of the Refugee Convention.</p>
<p class="para">110.&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I have no doubt that a refugee can spend time en route in an unsafe third country and still be regarded as “coming directly” to the receiving country for the purposes of article 31.  In 1944 Mr van Heuven Goedhart - who was later the United Nations High Commissioner when the Convention was being negotiated - left the Netherlands on account of persecution, hid in Belgium for five days where he was still under threat, was helped by the Resistance to cross France, went on to Spain and finally reached Gibraltar.  When article 31 was being debated, he rightly considered that it would be very unfortunate if a refugee in similar circumstances were penalised for not having proceeded directly to the country of asylum:  P Weis, <i>The Refugee Convention 1951 </i>(1995), p 297.  Those agreeing the final terms of the article must have had such cases well in mind.  So, in all probability, Mr Sorani’s stop in Turkey would not have affected his position under article 31.</p>
<p class="para">111.&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not follow, however, that the same applies where a refugee stops in a country where he is safe.  In such a situation the refugee is no longer in danger of persecution.  Rather, he is in a position to take the necessary steps to regularise his position by presenting himself without delay to the authorities.  If he intends to do so, but is caught before he can, then he will not be deprived of the benefit of article 31.  But where, as in the case of Mr Sorani, Mr Kaziu and Ms Asfaw, the refugee does not present himself to the authorities and has no intention of doing so, the very terms of article 31 show that it does not apply so as to entitle him to immunity from punishment, even for entering and being present in the country illegally.</p>
<p class="para">112.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, in terms of article 31, what the refugee has to do when he presents himself to the authorities is to advance a good reason to explain why he entered or was in their territory illegally.  Suppose that Mr Sorani or Mr Kaziu had reached Canada, had entered using the false passport, but had subsequently presented himself to the appropriate authorities without delay.  Although the points are interrelated, assume for the sake of the argument that he could be said to have gone “directly” to Canada.  Nevertheless, in order to be entitled to the protection of article 31 against prosecution for his illegal entry and presence in Canada, he would have had to explain why he had good reason to enter or be present illegally.  One relevant question which the Canadian authorities might have asked is:  why did you not present yourself to the British authorities and, in due course, ask them for a travel document which would have allowed you to enter Canada lawfully?  In other words, even if the Canadian authorities had decided to grant them refugee status, Mr Sorani and Mr Kaziu might still not have fallen within the scope of article 31.  Entitlement to refugee status and entitlement to impunity under article 31 are different matters and the relevant criteria are different.  In these circumstances it cannot be assumed that Mr Sorani and Mr Kaziu would necessarily have been entitled to rely on article 31 in Canada.  So the initial premise of Simon Brown LJ’s argument - that they could have invoked article 31 in Canada - is not well founded.  The conclusion - that they must therefore have been able to invoke article 31 to cover their offences en route in this country - is accordingly not well founded, either.</p>
<p class="para">113.&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the requirement for a refugee to present himself to the relevant authorities without delay is quite specifically designed to ensure that refugees regularise their position and obtain official assistance rather than proceeding by illegal stratagems and using the illegal services of shady agents.  So a failure to comply with the requirement cannot be brushed aside on the basis that the refugees would have been eligible for asylum in any event.</p>
<p class="para">114.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would accordingly overrule this aspect of the decision in <i>Adimi</i>.  I would further hold that article 31 of the Convention has no application to a refugee, such as Ms Asfaw, who has entered the United Kingdom unlawfully and who then, very shortly afterwards, uses a forged passport to try to leave, in order to travel to another country where she would like to claim asylum and settle.  According to the scheme of the Convention, having entered a safe country which is a party to the Convention, she had to obey the laws of that country.  If she wanted to travel on to the United States, she had to ask the British authorities for a travel document and had to try to persuade the United States immigration authorities to admit her.  If that approach is regarded as unrealistic or as otherwise inappropriate for the world of today, then the necessary change can only be made by the Contracting States agreeing to amend the Convention and, in particular, article 2 - in a way that would profoundly affect its basic philosophy and have a significant impact on the integrity of the criminal law of the States.</p>
<p class="para">115.&nbsp;&nbsp;That being the position, in my view, section 31(1), (3) and (4) of the 1999 Act are to be interpreted according to the ordinary meaning of the words in their context.  Moreover, there is no reason why section 31(3) should have listed the offence under section 1(1) of the Criminal Attempts Act 1981.  On the other hand, as I mentioned in para 77 above, I find it hard to understand why the basic offence, of knowingly entering the United Kingdom without leave, under section 24(1)(a) of the Immigration Act 1971, is not listed in section 31(3) or (4).  Since the point does not arise in this appeal and it was not fully argued, I simply draw attention to the question.</p>
<p class="para">116.&nbsp;&nbsp;The criticism which the Court of Appeal made of the approach of the prosecuting authorities was based on the arguments presented to it.  I consider that, when the effect of article 31 of the Convention is properly understood, the basis of those criticisms falls away.  It is for the prosecuting authorities, in consultation with the immigration authorities, to decide, in the usual way, whether it is in the public interest to prosecute a person in the position of the appellant and, if so, what the counts should be.  Similarly, if the refugee pleads guilty or is convicted after trial, it is for the judge to decide what sentence is appropriate.  The Court of Appeal’s disposal by way of an absolute discharge in the appellant’s case was based on a misunderstanding of the legal position and cannot therefore be used as a guide in future cases.</p>
<p class="para">117.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons I would dismiss the appeal.  I need not deal with the various other points argued by counsel, since they would arise only if, contrary to my view article 31 applied. Since preparing this speech, I have had the advantage of considering the speech prepared by Lord Mance.  I agree with it and am particularly grateful for his compelling analysis of the travaux préparatoires.</p>

<p class="mylords">My Lords,</p>
<p class="para">118.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the advantage of reading in draft the opinions prepared by my noble and learned friends Lord Bingham of Cornhill and Lord Hope of Craighead.  For the reasons which they give, with which I agree, I would allow the appeal and quash the appellant’s conviction on count 2 in the indictment.</p>
<p class="lawlord">LORD MANCE</p>
<p class="mylords">My Lords,</p>
<p class="para">119.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the benefit of reading in draft the speeches of my noble and learned friends, Lord Bingham of Cornhill, Lord Hope of Craighead and Lord Rodger of Earlsferry. I need not repeat their account of the factual and legislative background, but can go straight to the central issue raised before the House. This is whether the appellant was entitled to the protection of article 31(1) of the Geneva Convention and Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees in respect of her attempt, in order to leave the United Kingdom, to obtain services by deception contrary to section 1(1) of the Criminal Attempts Act 1981. On this, I have reached the same conclusion as Lord Rodger, with whose reasoning I also agree. </p>
