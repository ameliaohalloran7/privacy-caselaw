<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86. By contrast, in <i>Murray v Nicholls</i> the pursuers averred no more than that Strathclyde had failed to exercise their power to repaint the lines in circumstances where it was foreseeable that vehicles would collide.  In effect they had failed to warn drivers to take care when driving out of Devon View Street into Victoria Place.  The mere fact that Strathclyde had the public law power to paint white lines on the road did not mean that they came under a common law duty to take care to exercise that power wherever it was foreseeable that, otherwise, accidents were liable to happen.  As Lord Stott pointed out, it is not for the courts but for Parliament to create such a far-reaching duty, after considering all the implications.  Parliament has so far chosen not to do so, leaving it to drivers to take proper care for the safety of themselves, their passengers and other road users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87. By deciding to paint the lines at the junction  - presumably because of the perceived risk of collisions - Strathclyde would have come under a duty to do so carefully and not in a way that would aggravate any dangers at the junction.  But they had not somehow imposed on themselves, retrospectively, a common law duty to paint the lines or, prospectively, to paint them back if they were obliterated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88. In exactly the same way, in the present case, the mere fact that the defendants had once painted the Slow sign on the road does not mean that they had been under a common law duty to do so, or that they were under such a duty to repaint the sign when it came to be obliterated.  When that happened, the situation returned to what it had been before the defendants decided to exercise their statutory powers by painting it in the first place.  They were not under any common law duty to exercise their power to repaint it and are not liable because, for whatever reason, they did not do so.  Of course, if they had done so, it might have helped motorists.  And after the appellant's accident, they did indeed repaint the marking and make a number of other changes.  But this was something that they decided to do in the exercise of their statutory powers, not something that they were under a common law duty to do.  This is simply an application of what was said by Mason J in <i>Sutherland Shire Council v Heyman </i>(1985) 157 CLR 424, 465:</p>
<p></p><ul>"although a public authority may be under a public duty, enforceable by mandamus, to give proper consideration to the question whether it should exercise a power, this duty cannot be equated with, or regarded as a foundation for imposing, a duty of care on the public authority in relation to the exercise of the power.  Mandamus will compel proper consideration of the authority of its discretion, but that is all."</ul><p></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89. As I said at the outset, Mr Wingate-Saul accepts that this would be the position if it were not for section 39 of the Road Traffic Act 1988.  Sections 38 and 39 are grouped under the cross heading "Promotion of Road Safety".  Section 38 deals with the Highway Code, while section 39 has the broad heading "Powers of Secretary of State and local authorities as to giving road safety information and training".  Section 39(2) and (3) derive from section 38(2) and (2A) of the Road Traffic Act 1972 as amended by section 8(1) of the Road Traffic Act 1974.  Subsection (2) imposes on local authorities the duty to carry out a programme of measures designed to promote road safety.  In particular, under subsection (3) the local authority must carry out studies of vehicle accidents in their area and, in the light of those studies, take appropriate measures to prevent such accidents, including the construction, improvement, maintenance or repair of roads for which they are the highway authority and other measures in the exercise of their powers for controlling, protecting or assisting the movement of traffic on the roads.  One purpose, at least, is to ensure that local authorities take road safety considerations into account in carrying out their highway functions.  This is to be achieved by placing a wide public law duty, in the nature of a target duty, on the authorities concerned.  A duty of that kind is not enforceable by means of a private law action for its breach.  While accepting this, Mr Wingate-Saul submitted that the enactment of this public law duty had created a new (private) common law duty of care on the part of the authorities for the safety of those using the roads in their area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90. My Lords, I am unable to accept that submission.  Section 39 involves the kind of target duty that gives rise to no right to damages for its breach at the suit of an individual, even where the breach of duty has consisted in the negligent failure of the local authority to take the appropriate measures to prevent accidents.  As Lord Hoffmann pointed out on behalf of the majority in <i>Stovin v Wise</i> [1996] AC 923, 952H, and as he has pointed out again in his speech today, if such a duty does not give rise to a private right to sue for breach, it would be unusual if it nevertheless gave rise to a duty of care at common law which made the public authority liable to pay compensation for foreseeable loss caused by the duty not being performed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91. The position would be different if the statutory duty in section 39 had been superimposed on a situation where there was an existing duty of care on traffic authorities to warn motorists of prospective risks.  Then various questions about the interplay of the two duties would arise.  For example, as Lord Wilberforce pointed out in <i>Anns v Merton London Borough Council </i>[1978] AC 728, 755, where Parliament imposes a duty but gives the authority a discretion in performing the duty, a plaintiff cannot rely upon a common law duty of care, unless the action taken was not within the limits of the bona fide exercise of that discretion.  So it would only be where the local authority's actings were not within those limits that there would be a claim for damages for breach of the underlying duty of care.  It might also be that the factors to be taken into account in exercising a pre-existing common law duty of care would be affected by the content of the statutory duty.  But that is very different from saying that the imposition of this statutory duty has called into existence a common law duty where none existed before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92. In <i>Larner v Solihull Metropolitan Borough Council </i>[2001] RTR 469 the Court of Appeal had to consider the effect of section 39.  The claimant was injured when she failed to observe two "Give way" signs, drove across a junction and collided with another vehicle.  She sued the council for damages on the ground that they had failed to provide additional advance warning signs.  On the facts of the case the claimant failed.  In delivering the judgment of the court, however, the Lord Chief Justice accepted, at p 475, para 15, that in the case of section 39 an authority could be liable at common law if they acted wholly unreasonably in failing to provide a sign and their default thus fell outside the ambit of discretion given to them by the section.  In doing so, he adopted the approach of the minority in <i>Stovin v Wise</i>.  Liability presupposes duty, however - and, on the reasoning of the majority in <i>Stovin v Wise</i>, there is nothing to show that the enactment of section 39 prompted the emergence of a common law duty of care on councils to place warning signs.  So the mere fact that, in a given case, a reasonable council would have exercised its powers by providing an additional sign does not alter the fact that they would have been under no common law duty to do so.  Conversely, even if it would have been wholly unreasonable for the council not to provide an additional sign, this does not mean that they were in breach of a common law duty to do so.  I therefore agree that this aspect of the reasoning of the Court of Appeal should be disapproved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93. If traffic authorities carry out their duties under section 39, this should help to make the roads safer by informing their decisions as to the repairs and modifications, including the placing of warning signs, that should be carried out.  In the exercise of their public law powers and duties, highway authorities do often, or even usually, warn of prospective dangers at junctions or crests in the road, but drivers cannot rely on them always having done so.  Drivers must take care for themselves and drive at an appropriate speed, irrespective of whether or not there is a warning sign.  By insisting that drivers always look out for dangers themselves and not rely on others, the common law supports the overall policy of promoting road safety.  If drivers fail to drive carefully and others are injured, the others can recover compensation from the drivers' insurers or from the Motor Insurers' Bureau.  Neither the drivers nor their passengers, nor indeed their insurers, can recover damages from the highway authorities for not having placed a warning sign.  If that settled pattern is to be changed, it is for Parliament to make the change and to approve the additional funding needed by the authorities to handle and meet the claims.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94. In the circumstances I am satisfied that the Council did not owe Mrs Gorringe a duty of care to paint a marking on the road or to set up a sign, warning her to slow down as she approached the crest in the road where the accident occurred.  For these reasons, as well as for those given by Lord Hoffmann, Lord Scott of Foscote and Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood, the appeal must be dismissed.</p>
LORD BROWN OF EATON-UNDER-HEYWOOD
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95. On 15 July 1996 Mrs Gorringe suffered very severe injuries in a collision on a B road in West Yorkshire when, just short of a crest in the road, she braked sharply and, with locked wheels, skidded into a double-decker bus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96. Section 39 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 imposes upon local authorities certain statutory duties, couched in the broadest of terms, designed to promote road safety and to prevent road accidents.  It is Mrs Gorringe's case that in the discharge of those duties the respondent local authority (Calderdale) ought properly to have warned her of the dangers of the road ahead, in particular by painting a "slow" sign on the road surface. Although acquitted of all blame by the trial judge, Mrs Gorringe now accepts that she herself must be regarded as having approached the crest at a negligently fast speed.  Assume, however, that a "slow" sign on the road would have protected her against her own negligence.   Was Calderdale duty-bound to put it there and, if so, is a breach of such duty actionable in private law?   These are the issues raised before your Lordships' House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97. It is not suggested that Calderdale's section 39 duty is actionable as such in private law.  In other words it is accepted that no claim could arise here for breach of statutory duty.  What is suggested, however, is that a common law duty of care arises out of Calderdale's statutory duty, and that Calderdale would be liable in a private law claim for damages for breach of that duty. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98. The argument is founded principally on <i>Larner v Solihull Metropolitan Borough Council</i> [2001]  RTR 469, in which the Court of Appeal, although rejecting the claim on the facts, contemplated that damages for breach of a common law duty of care would be recoverable for a local authority's failure to paint warning signs on the road, based upon a breach of its section 39 duty, provided always that the default complained of was not within the ambit of the authority's discretion (paras 13 and 15); provided, in other words, that the Council could be shown to have acted irrationally, that being the suggested touchstone by which the breach of a public law duty gives rise to common law liability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99. In deciding that a common law duty of care could arise, the Court  adopted the reasoning in favour of such a duty given by the minority of the House in <i>Stovin v Wise</i> [1996]  AC 923,—and in addition relied on a trilogy of decisions in your Lordships' House—<i>X (Minors) v Bedfordshire County Council</i> [1995]  2 AC 633, <i>Barrett v Enfield London Borough Council</i> [2001]  2 AC 550 and <i>Phelps v Hillingdon London Borough Council</i> [2001]  2 AC 619—in each of which a duty of care was held (at least arguably) to have arisen. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100. I agree with the reasons given in the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann for distinguishing that line of authority —essentially because the common law duty of care in those cases was found or suggested to have arisen not by reference to the existence of the respective authorities' statutory powers and duties but rather from the relationships in fact created between those authorities and the children for whom in differing ways they had assumed responsibility.  I would add, moreover, this further distinction.  Unless in those cases the Court were to find the authority's various responsibilities capable of giving rise to a common law duty of care, those wronged children, themselves wholly blameless, would go uncompensated, however inadequately their interests had been safeguarded. In the highway context, by contrast, the claimant (or some other road user involved in the accident) will almost inevitably himself have been at fault.  In these circumstances it seems to me entirely reasonable that the policy of the law should be to leave the liability for the accident on the road user who negligently caused it rather than look to the highway authority to protect him against his own wrong.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101. With regard to the physical state of the highway itself, of course, the legislation has since 1961 placed the responsibility for its maintenance upon the Highway Authority, a duty now found in section 41 of the Highways Act 1980, as amended by section 111 of the Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003 to reverse the effect of this House's decision in <i>Goodes v East Sussex County Council</i> [2000]  1 WLR 1356.  This duty, moreover, is actionable as such so as to give rise to a private law claim for damages.  Road users, therefore, are entitled to rely upon the state of the road's surface and accordingly the primary liability for any loss resulting from a breach of the section 41 duty rests on the authority.  Road users are not, however, entitled to rely upon the Highway Authority with regard to the various other hazards of road use.  They are not entitled to suppose that their journeys will be free from these or that the need for care will generally be highlighted so as to protect them from their own negligence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102. What I have said thus far is in the context of road accidents involving negligence on the part of at least one of the road users involved.  But that is because I find it difficult to contemplate a case in which a road accident could occur without such negligence unless either a) it results from the physical state of the road (in which case, as already explained, liability will in any event rest upon the Highway Authority), or b) the Highway Authority will, irrespective of any particular statutory power or duty, be liable in a conventional common law negligence action for having enticed the motorist to his fate by some positive act.  Assuming that the road user is not to be regarded as negligent, he must inevitably have been misled into ignoring whatever danger precipitated his accident.  Although motorists are not entitled to be forewarned of the ordinary hazards of highway use, plainly they must not be trapped into danger.  If, for example, an authority were to signal a one-way street but omit to put No Entry signs at the other end, it might well be found liable, not because of any statutory power or duty to erect such signs but rather because it induced a perfectly careful motorist into the path of danger.  Or assume road markings indicating where it is safe to overtake and where it is not and that by some crass mistake in the painting of these a motorist were to be ensnared into the path of an oncoming vehicle previously hidden in a blind spot ahead.  That too would suggest to me misfeasance of the kind traditionally attracting tortious liability without the need to look for some statutory power or duty as its foundation.  Such cases, however, may be expected to be few and far between and I would certainly not regard <i>Bird v Pearce</i> [1979]  RTR 369 as one of them:  the suggestion there that the highway authority itself created the danger appears to me irreconcilable with the conclusion that one of the drivers was himself two-thirds to blame for the collision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103. There seems to me, therefore, no good reason for superimposing upon such general powers and duties as are conferred upon highway authorities a common law duty of care in respect of their exercise.  Nor does it seem to me that Parliament can have intended a private law liability in damages to flow from a public law failure in the exercise of the authority's powers or the discharge of its duties.  Where with regard to highways Parliament does intend users to have a remedy for damages it says so, as initially it did in 1961 and then again, by extending the section 41 duty to encompass the removal of ice and snow, in 2003.  A maintenance obligation of this nature, moreover, lends itself to enforcement by way of private law action altogether more readily than a more general duty of care.  Section 41 imposes comparatively well defined obligations upon authorities and, although resort to the section 58 statutory defence may complicate the litigation, that is as nothing compared to the problems, exemplified by this very case, of determining just what warnings at any particular point in the highway system are required, in effect as a matter of law, to be given.  One cannot over-maintain the fabric of the public highway.  Warning overload, however, is all too easily imaginable.  As it is, road users tend to discount such warnings as are implicit in the various speed limits and other cautionary signs to which they are subject.  The currency would be debased still further were highway authorities, anxious to avoid lengthy and expensive litigation of the kind Calderdale has been subjected to here, to feel obliged to multiply its street signing still further.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104. It follows from all this that, sympathetic though inevitably one must feel towards someone as severely injured as Mrs Gorringe, she cannot look to Calderdale for any part of her loss.  Its only duty towards her was to maintain the physical condition of the highway as it did and not to ensnare her into unforeseeable danger.  On the trial judge's finding that she herself was blameless, one could have understood a further conclusion that she must necessarily therefore have been trapped into her fate by Calderdale's negligence.  Once it is recognised, however, that the danger of driving as she did should have been obvious to her, as is now accepted, her claim must fail.  Even if, contrary to the conclusions arrived at by the majority of the Court of Appeal, Calderdale failed in its public law duty under section 39, that gave rise to no corresponding breach of a duty of care actionable in private law. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105. For these reasons and those of my noble and learned friends Lord Hoffmann, Lord Scott of Foscote and Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, I too would dismiss this appeal.</p>
