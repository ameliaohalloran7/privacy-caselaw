<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;130. Section 28(2) uses the words "it shall be a defence for the accused to prove…".  It is tempting to hold that this implies merely what is referred to as an "evidential" burden, that is to say, the adducing of evidence sufficient to put the matter in issue.  That course is recognised in the case of a variety of common law defences.  Here we are dealing with a statutory offence.  But even there it may sometimes be possible to preserve the whole burden upon the prosecution, although whether that can be done or not depends on a construction of the particular language used in the statute.  In <i>Reg v John</i> [1974]  1 WLR 624 for example in relation to a statutory offence of a failure to provide a specimen "without reasonable excuse", it was recognised that while it was for the defendant to state the excuse it was for the prosecution to negative it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;131. In the ordinary case, where the presumption of innocence has been recognised at common law long before its embodiment in the Convention, I should be slow to construe a criminal provision so as to impose a persuasive burden upon him.  While the Act uses the word "prove" it is perfectly possible to construe that as implying an evidential burden rather than a persuasive one. Section 5(2), the offence of simple possession, is qualified by section 5(4).  The essential ingredients for a conviction under section 5(2), as I have already mentioned, are that the accused should have had control of the drug, knew that he had control of it, and that it was in fact a controlled drug, even although he did not know that the thing he possessed was a controlled drug.  Section 5(4) applies where "it is proved that the accused had a controlled drug in his possession".  It applies then where there was control and knowledge of the existence of the thing, even although the accused did not know that the thing was a controlled drug which in fact it was. Section 5(4) continues that "it shall be a defence for him to prove (a) that, knowing or suspecting it to be a controlled drug" he took possession of it to prevent another from committing an offence.  I did not understand it to be contended that that provision imposed a persuasive burden on the accused.  But if that provision does not do so it is not immediately easy to see why section 28 should do so, when it also only comes into operation when the ingredients of the offence have all been proved.  In neither case is one dealing with the essential ingredients of the statutory offence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;132. But this approach appears to run counter to what has become generally recognised as the proper construction in England.  That approach is fortified by the language of section 28(2) that "it shall be a defence for the accused to prove…".  The ordinary meaning of those words imply a persuasive burden of proof even although the accused has only to establish his defence to the standard of a balance of probabilities. There is some force in the argument that the word "prove" is not apt to describe an evidential burden in which the accused is not required to prove anything but simply raise an issue.  The legislation may well have been inspired by the observations of Lord Reid in <i>Warner</i> and in <i>Sweet v Parsley</i>.  In the former case he observed (p 280:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In a case like this Parliament, if consulted, might think it right to transfer the onus of proof so that an accused would have to prove that he neither knew or has any reason to suspect that he had a prohibited drug in his possession."<p></p></ul>
<p>The reference in <i>Sweet v Parsley</i> is at p 150B-D.  It is likely that his Lordship had in mind a persuasive burden of proof.  In <i>Reg v Boyesen</i> [1982]  AC 768 which concerned a conviction under section 5(1) and (2), Lord Scarman stated (p 773):</p>
<p></p><ul>"The statutory offence may be described as an absolute one in the sense that the prosecution establish it by proving possession without authority: section 5(1) and section 5(2) of the Act. Section 28 provides for certain defences which, if they are to succeed, the defendant must prove on a balance of probabilities." <p></p></ul>
<p>In <i>Champ</i> [1982]  Crim LR 108 it was a matter of express decision that once the prosecution had proved the elements of an offence under section 6 of the Act, namely that the defendant was cultivating a plant of the genus cannabis, it was for her to prove that she did not know that the plant was cannabis.  It was held that the judge had correctly directed the jury that it was not necessary for the prosecution to prove that she knew the nature of the drug she was cultivating.  The defendant failed to establish that defence under section 28. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;133. I proceed accordingly on the basis that section 28(2) imposes a persuasive burden of proof on the accused.  But it is to be noted that the practical effect of the burden on the defendant may not be very significant.  I agree with the observations of the Lord Justice-General in <i>Salmon v HM Advocate </i>1999<i> </i>JC 67, that section 28 does not require that the accused gives evidence.  There may, for example, only be evidence of surprise on the part of the defendant on the discovery of the presence of the controlled drug.  Or there may only be the exculpatory part of a mixed statement which he gave to the police at some stage.  On the other hand, if the burden is a persuasive one the defendant may be ill advised in practice to rest his defence at trial on such a single slender piece of evidence alone.  To be persuaded even on a balance of probabilities a jury might well require fortification of such an isolated indication of the defence.</p>
<i><p>The Human Rights Act 1998</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;134. It is only at this stage in the argument in the present case that considerations of the Convention, and in particular of Article 6(2) of the Convention, arise.  The appellant contends that the offence contained in section 5(3) involves the imposition on the accused of a burden of proof such as would be contrary to the provisions of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and in particular Article 6(2) which states that "everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law".  The route adopted by the appellant involves a direct invocation of the Human Rights Act 1998.  But a problem immediately arises.  The Human Rights Act 1998 only came into full effect on 2 October 2000.  The appellant's trial and conviction took place before that date. Indeed the determination of his appeal occurred before that date. So he has to show that nevertheless he can invoke the provisions of the Act. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;135. In approaching the problem of the retrospectivity of the Human Rights Act 1998 it is to be remembered at the outset that the Act did not incorporate the rights set out in the Convention into the domestic laws of the United Kingdom.  The purpose of the Act, as set out in its preamble, was "to give further effect to rights and freedoms" guaranteed under that Convention.  The Convention rights have not become part of the constitution so as to obtain any superiority over the powers of Parliament or the validity of primary legislation.  The Act requires in section 3 that the language which Parliament has used be construed so as to secure that it is compatible with the Convention rights, so far as it is possible to do so. Section 4 of the Act, which enables the courts to pronounce a declaration of incompatibility, expressly provides in subsection (6) that such a declaration does not affect the validity, continuing operation or enforcement of the legislation declared to be incompatible.  But it is left to the discretion of a minister to make a remedial order under section 10 when an incompatibility is identified.  One principle achievement of the Act is to enable the Convention rights to be directly invoked in the domestic courts.  In that respect the Act is important as a procedural measure which has opened a further means of access to justice for the citizen, more immediate and more familiar than a recourse to the Court in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;136. The questions then arise: when did Parliament intend that this new procedure should be available, and in respect of what acts should it operate?  Parliament had to resolve a question of procedural importance in which considerations of practicality and convenience should be significant.  The substance of the Convention rights remained unchanged.  For many years they had been directly accessible in Strasbourg.  It was considered desirable to allow a period of time to elapse after the passing of the Act and its full effectiveness.  One reason for that was no doubt the practical reason of enabling all those concerned with the application of the Act to prepare for the responsibility of that work.  Parliament also had to consider how far, if at all, acts done prior to the Act coming into full effect ought to fall within the scope of the new domestic jurisdiction.  The line had to be drawn at some point and Parliament had to decide where the line should be drawn for the purposes of the jurisdiction of the courts after the Act came into effect.  How Parliament decided to do that is a question of construction of the Act.  But in approaching that question it is in my view proper to keep in mind the essentially procedural nature of the question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;137. Two routes were suggested by the appellant by which he might invoke the provisions of the Act even although his trial, conviction and appeal had all occurred before the Act came fully into effect.  One route is by section 22(4).  That section applies to the right provided by section 7(1)(<i>b</i>) of someone who claims that a public authority has acted in a way incompatible with a Convention right (and so under section 6(1) has acted unlawfully) to rely on the Convention right concerned in any legal proceedings provided that he is the victim of the unlawful act. Section 22(4) extends the application of section 7(1)(<i>b</i>) to proceedings brought by or at the instigation of a public authority whenever the act in question took place.  So an act contrary to the Convention done by a public authority before 2 October 2000 may be relied upon by the victim in legal proceedings brought by or at the instigation of a public authority from 2 October 2000.  If the appellant is seeking to found on section 7(1)(<i>b</i>) he must qualify as, to quote the opening words of section 7, "a person who claims that a public authority has acted (or proposes to act) in a way which is made unlawful by section 6(1)". </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;138. The first question is to identify that public authority.  Plainly the public authority here cannot be this House, because the House has not yet acted at the stage of the hearing and it will at that stage be far from certain whether the House is proposing to act in an unlawful way.  The prosecutor may qualify as a public authority.  But the act complained of is not the bringing of the prosecution but the act of the trial judge in directing that a persuasive burden of proof lay on the appellant to establish a defence under section 28(2) or of the Court of Appeal in refusing his appeal.  The public authority here must presumably be the trial judge or the Court of Appeal.  So the proposed application of these provisions here is to the effect that since the present proceedings are an appeal arising out of a criminal prosecution brought by a public authority (the public prosecutor), the appellant is claiming that a public authority (the trial judge or the Court of Appeal) has acted in a way which is incompatible with his Article 6(2) right, and that he may rely on that right in these proceedings. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;139. I do not find it necessary to determine the question whether the public authority referred to in section 7(1) and in section 7(6) and in section 22(4) requires to be the same public authority.  It may be that the public authority referred to in section 7(1) can be a different public authority from that in sections 7(6) and 22(4).  I would proceed upon two other considerations.  First, section 22(4) relates only to section 7(1)(<i>b</i>). So section 7(1)(<i>a</i>) does not apply to an act taking place prior to 2 October 2000.  In so far as the act for the purposes of section 7(1)(a) is a judicial act, the proceedings must be one or other of those set out in section 9(1).  The first of those is the exercising of a right of appeal.  So it would appear that a remedy by way of appeal under section 7(1)(<i>a</i>) is not to apply to acts prior to 2 October 2000.  It does not appear likely that there should be a retrospectivity under section 7(1)(<i>b</i>) in respect of an appeal heard from 2 October 2000 against a decision given prior to that date, if there is none under section 7(I)(a). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;140. Secondly, in terms of section 22(4) the only acts contravening the Convention prior to 2 October 2000 which can be considered are acts on which reliance may be placed in terms of section 7(1)(<i>b</i>).  Section 22(4) states expressly that "otherwise that subsection does not apply to an act taking place before the coming into force of that section".  That subsection applies to "legal proceedings" as defined in section 7(6), that is both "proceedings brought by or at the instigation of a public authority" and an appeal.  But the provision admitting reliance on earlier acts in section 22(4) is limited to "proceedings brought by or at the instigation of a public authority".  The use of the same language as was used in section 7(6) is significant.  In my view the intention is that section 22(4) should not extend to the other kind of "legal proceedings" mentioned in section 7(6), namely an appeal.  I am not persuaded that section 22(4) can avail the appellant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;141. The second route which is suggested by the appellant is by a simple application of section 6(1).  Here the House in its judicial capacity is to be seen as the public authority.  The argument runs that it is bound to apply the Convention in the present appeal.  Its decision must be compatible with the Convention.  This is not strictly a point of retroactivity at all.  The argument focuses upon an act taking place from 2 October 2000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;142. The usual understanding of the appeal process is that the correctness of the decision appealed against should be determined in accordance with the law as it stood when the case was decided by the lower court.  But on the appellant's approach it would seem that any case either of a civil or a criminal nature, decided according to the law as construed in the ordinary way prior to 2 October 2000, if an appeal was brought so as to be heard after 2 October 2000, would require to be decided by the application of a rule of construction, namely section 3 of the 1998 Act, which was not obligatory on the lower court.  But that involves giving an undue extension to the effect of section 3.  In my view section 3 only became obligatory on courts on 2 October 2000. The rule of construction which it expresses applies to all legislation whenever enacted.  But there is nothing to show that it was intended by section 3 that the meaning given to a statutory provision by a court prior to 2 October 2000 should be changed in the event of an appeal against that decision being heard on or after that date.  It is suggested that the Human Rights Act 1998 should itself be subject to the interpretative regime contained in section 3.  But I am not persuaded that there is any "Convention right" which requires appeals to be determined in that way. It is to be remembered that Article 13 of the Convention is not included within the "Convention rights" for the purposes of the 1998 Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;143. The appellant sought to confine the scope of his argument to criminal cases only, but I am not persuaded that there is justification for making that distinction in the Act.  Even if one looks only to criminal proceedings it does not seem to me likely that Parliament intended to disturb the usual understanding of the appeal process and allow matters of alleged incompatibility with the Convention rights, which could always have been raised in Strasbourg, to be opened up by the taking of an appeal to a higher court on or after the date on which the Act came into effect.  In general Acts of Parliament should not be read as operating so as to affect things done prior to their coming into effect.  I see no reason why that principle should not apply to the Human Rights Act 1998.  If a departure from the usual course was intended I would expect that to have been clearly stated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;144. Furthermore, if section 6(1) is to be construed as requiring courts of appeal to apply the Convention to acts which occurred prior to 2 October 1998, that would not seem to me to be consistent with the careful and precise provision which Parliament did make for the extent to which acts prior to 2 October 1998 could be relied upon.  Section 22(4) is expressly limited to one situation.  It relates only to section 7(1)(b), it applies only to proceedings brought by or on behalf of a public authority, and it applies to acts "whenever the act in question took place", that is to say whether before or after the coming into force of the Act. Section 22(4) then expressly states with regard to section 7(1)(<i>b</i>) that "otherwise that subsection does not apply to an act taking place before the coming into force of that section".  As I have already decided, section 7(1)(<i>b</i>) does not allow a person to rely on a Convention right allegedly breached prior to 2 October 2000 in an appeal heard on or after that date.  So the argument reaches the result that under section 6(1) the appeal court is bound to take account of that Convention right, although the appellant may not rely upon it.  That does not seem to me to be a likely interpretation of the intention of Parliament in passing section 6(1) and it does not seem to fit comfortably with the express provision made in section 22(4).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;145. I accept that section 6(1) imposes an obligation on a court, including, to use the language of section 6(4), this House in its judicial capacity, to act in conformity with the Convention.  But  section 6(1) does not provide any remedy.  It simply explains that, where a public authority acts in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right, that act is unlawful.  That word might mean that the act might be the basis for an offence.  But that is obviously not the meaning to be given to it here. Indeed section 7(8) states that "Nothing in this Act creates a criminal offence".  Another meaning which may be ascribed to the word "unlawful" is that it is to be unenforceable.  But if one breaks off at that point one is left without any means of obtaining any remedy.  It seems to me that section 6 cannot be taken in isolation but has to be read and understood along with the rest of the Act and in particular with the sections which immediately follow it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;146. As I have already noted section 7(1) makes provision for the proceedings which may be used by a victim.  Para (<i>a</i>) enables him to bring proceedings against the authority in the appropriate court or tribunal.  Para (<i>b</i>) enables him to rely on the Convention right in any legal proceedings, and those include (subsection (6)), proceedings brought by or at the instigation of a public authority and an appeal  But we are here dealing with a judicial act.  The Act specifically provides in section 9 that there are only three ways in which proceedings under section 7(1)(<i>a</i>) may be brought.  These are "(a) by exercising a right of appeal; (b) on appeal, an application for judicial review, or (c) in such other forum as may be prescribed by rules". I have some difficulty in applying section 9 to a decision of this House but if there is a difficulty there it would not justify the construction of section 6 which is sought by the appellant in the present case.  In my view section 6 is part of the series of sections on public authorities and cannot be isolated so as to be independent of them.  The better view to my mind is that the only way in which an act prior to 2 October 2000 can come within the scope of the Act is by section 22(4). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;147. The construction of the 1998 Act which I have preferred is given some support by reference to the corresponding situation which arose in New Zealand in <i>Minto and Cuthbert v Police</i> ((1990-92)  NZBORR 208).  In that case appeals were taken against convictions for offences of breach of the peace committed by people staging a demonstration.  The offences and the convictions occurred prior to the coming into force of the Bill of Rights Act 1990.  The appeals were heard after that Act came into force and the appellants sought to found on the right to freedom of peaceful assembly guaranteed by section 16 of that Act.  It was held that section 16 should not be given such a retrospective effect.  Robertson J said in reference to the appellant's counsel (p 214):</p>
<p></p><ul>"He argued that the 'beneficial' effect of such a retrospective interpretation should overwhelm the presumption against the retrospective effect of statutes. Certainly it would be beneficial from his clients' point of view to have their misdemeanour undone in this fashion. But I do not accept that it would be 'beneficial' for the law or society at large if a Court were to declare invalid that which was valid at the time it was done." <p></p></ul>
<p>Robertson J also referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R v Stevens</i> (1988)  41 CCC(3rd) 193, 51 DLR (4th) 394 which concerned a conviction for unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of 14 under section 146(1) of the criminal code.  The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms came into effect after the commission of the offence and it was argued that under section 7 of that Charter, guaranteeing the life, liberty and security of the person, section 146(1) was invalid so far as it denied the accused a defence of honest mistake of fact.  But the Court held that section 7 should not have retrospective effect so as to change the substantive law at the time of the offence.  So also in the present context I would hold that the appellant cannot invoke the provisions of the 1998 Act for the purposes of overturning a conviction which was not unlawful for the purposes of section 6(1) at the time it was obtained, being a time prior to the coming into effect of that section. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;148. In my view accordingly it is not open to the appellants to invoke the provisions of the Human Rights Act in the present appeal.  But it is nevertheless appropriate to consider for the future whether the provisions of section 28 are compatible with Article 6(2) of the Convention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;149. It may be noted at the outset that cases may well occur under section 5 of the Misuse of Drugs Act where no problem of compliance with Article 6(2) will arise.  In the case of the possession of controlled drugs Parliament has provided for the mental element of the offence in two respects.  First, there is a mental element built into the offence itself in the matter of possession.  An ingredient of that element, as I have already stated, is knowledge of the existence of the thing in issue  In the simplest case the only mental element which may arise is knowledge of the existence of the thing which is in fact a controlled drug.  That is an essential of possession and the prosecution is required to prove that the accused had that knowledge.  In some cases the inquiry may not have to go any further.  Any consideration of the knowledge or ignorance of the accused about the nature of the thing which he is proved to have possessed may not arise.  Indeed in some cases it may be indisputable that if there was possession the accused must have known the nature of what he possessed.  In such a case no question of that kind of knowledge requires to be explored.  If the inquiry stops at that point, the offence will have been proved.  The onus of proof remained upon the prosecution and no onus has ever passed to the accused.  In such circumstances there can be no contravention of Article 6(2) of the Convention.  But the present case is one where the accused relied upon section 28(3)(<i>b</i>)(i) and since I am proceeding upon the basis that the burden was on him to prove his assertion of ignorance under that provision there is a real question whether the offence prescribed in section 5(3), subject as it is to the provisions of section 28, contravenes Article 6(2) of the Convention in cutting across the presumption of innocence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;150. It is necessary first to say a word about the application of that Article.  It states "Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law".  There is no doubt that it does apply to the present proceedings.  Article 6(2) applies to any person charged with a criminal offence.  So the appellant may invoke the benefit of the provision.  But the imposition of a burden on the defendant does not necessarily involve a contravention of the Convention.  Some guidance on the problem can be obtained from the jurisprudence of the ECHR.  First, one must look not only at the form of the legislation but also at its substance and effect (<i>X v UK </i> App No 5124/71, July 1972).  As regards the identification of the essentials of an offence the Privy Council have recognised that a similar approach should be taken.  What is decisive is "the substance and reality of the language creating the offence rather than its form" (<i>A-G of Hong Kong v Lee Kwong Kut</i> [1993]  AC 951, 969).  Secondly:</p>
<p></p><ul>"in principle the Contracting States remain free to apply the criminal law to an act where it is not carried out in the normal exercise of one of the rights protected under the Convention and, accordingly, to define the constituent elements of the resulting offence."<p></p></ul>
<p>(<i>Salabiaku v France</i> [1988]  13 EHRR 379, para 27).  Thirdly, in particular, "the Contracting States may, under certain conditions penalise a simple or objective fact as such, irrespective of whether it results from criminal intent or from negligence"  (<i>Salabiaku</i>, para 27). Fourthly, presumptions of fact or of law exist in many legal systems and are not in principle contrary to the Convention (<i>Salabiaku</i>, para 28). Fifthly, the words "according to law" in Article 6(2) do not merely refer to domestic law, but also to the rule of law, and accordingly certain limits must be observed in the extent to which presumptions of fact or law are acceptable.  Those limits must be reasonable limits "which take into account the importance of what is at stake and maintain the rights of the defence" (<i>Salabiaku</i> para 28, <i>Pham Hoang v France</i> [1992]  16 EHRR 53, <i>Hardy v Ireland,</i> App 23456/94).  Sixthly, where the persuasive burden of proof remains on the prosecution but an evidential burden is transferred to the accused in a saving or excusatory context, so that the maximum obligation on the accused it merely to raise a doubt of substance in relation to the prosecution's case, that may not involve a contravention of article 6(2) (<i>Hardy)</i>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;151. Where a rebuttable presumption is placed on the accused that may still not breach the Convention right.  In <i>AG v Malta (App 16641/90)</i> the statutory provision made a director of a company guilty of an offence committed by the company "unless he proves that the offence was committed without his knowledge…."  That was held by the domestic court not to be unreasonable since otherwise it would be impossible in the majority of cases to prove its case against a company. The Commission declared the application inadmissible.  They proceeded on the consideration that the presumption created by the provision was rebuttable, that the Maltese courts enjoyed a genuine freedom of assessment and that there was no indication that the provision was applied to the applicant in a manner incompatible with the presumption of innocence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;152. But the decision may have to turn upon the particular circumstances.  The focus of attention paid by the European Court of Human Rights tends to be directed at the particular circumstances of the case before them.  Considerations which have weighed with the Court in deciding that in particular cases that there was no infringement have included a consideration of the whole evidence and such matters as these: that while the accused was deemed liable for the offence, he had the opportunity to put extenuating circumstances before the court and was entitled to be acquitted if he succeeded in establishing a case of <i>force</i> <i>majeure, </i>unavoidable mistake, or necessity (<i>Salbiaku</i>, and <i>Pham Hoang</i>), that the domestic courts had also identified in the case an element of intent, even although they were under no legal obligation to do so (<i>Salabiaku</i>), and that the courts had also made a careful discrimination between the two charges originally brought against the accused and acquitted him of one of them while convicting him on the other (<i>Salabiaku</i>).  But it would be of little assistance for the future to decide the present case simply on its own particular facts. Some more general opinion ought to be possible. </p>
