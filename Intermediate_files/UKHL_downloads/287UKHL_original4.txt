<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laws LJ agreed fully with Wilson J's approach.  Like the judge he declined to be drawn into any sort of detailed debate on the appropriate demarcation age.  Such a debate would be appropriate in Parliament but not in the court.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89.&nbsp;&nbsp;In his final written submissions to your Lordships Mr Gill challenged the approach of the lower courts to this question of intensity of scrutiny.  He referred to the passage from the speech of Lord Nicholls in <i>Ghaidan v Godin-Mendoza</i> [2004]  2 AC 557, 568, para 19, which I have already cited.  But in that passage Lord Nicholls was referring to the most highly "suspect" grounds of discrimination (Lord Nicholls instanced race, sex and sexual orientation).  Mr Gill also referred to <i>Asmundsson v Iceland,</i> App. No. 60669/00, 12 October 2004, para 43, in which the European Court of Human Rights (in the course of considering a complaint under article 1 of the First Protocol) made a passing reference to differential treatment of a pensioner suggesting that the impugned measure was unjustified for the purposes of article 14 (though the Court refrained from deciding any separate issue under article 14).  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Asmundsson</i> was a very unusual case.  A seaman aged 30 had a serious accident at work, as a result of which he had to stop working as a seaman, with his disability assessed at 100%.  This made him eligible for a disability pension from the Seamen's Pension Fund, a statutory contributory social security fund.  However, he found work in the office of a transport company, and seems to have risen to a senior position.  In 1992, about 14 years after his accident, the pension fund was seriously insolvent and it adopted new rules which applied to existing pensioners as well as future pensioners.  Mr Asmundsson's disability was reassessed at 25%, which was below the threshold for any pension entitlement under the new rules.  The court held this to be a breach of article 1 of the first Protocol, because (para 44) although the claimant was still classified as 25% incapacitated, he had been deprived of the entirety of his disability pension.  I do not think that case is relevant to the determination of this appeal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the contrary, in my opinion the courts below were entirely correct in their approach to the appropriate intensity of scrutiny.  Demarcation lines of this sort have to be reasonably bright lines, and the task of drawing them is (as the United States Supreme Court said in <i>Murgia</i>):  ". . . peculiarly a legislative task and an unavoidable one." I would dismiss Ms Reynolds' appeal.</p>

LORD CARSWELL
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the advantage of reading in draft the opinion prepared by my noble and learned friends, Lord Hoffmann and Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe.  I agree with much of their reasoning and with their conclusions in respect of Miss Reynolds.  I have, however, reached a different conclusion in the appeal of Mrs Carson and I shall therefore set out my views on her case as shortly as I can.  The facts relating to her case have been outlined by Lord Hoffmann and Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe and the legislative provisions have been fully set out in the judgment of Laws LJ in the Court of Appeal [2003] 3 All ER 577.  It is accordingly unnecessary for me to repeat these and I shall turn immediately to the issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93.&nbsp;&nbsp;The essence of the complaint of Mrs Carson and those other pensioners living abroad who are in like case was summarised in paragraph 6 of the judgment of Stanley Burnton J at first instance [2002] 3 All ER 994, 997:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Very many of the expatriate United Kingdom pensioners who do not receive uprated pensions have a strong and understandable sense of grievance.  They paid their contributions calculated in the same way as pensioners now living here and in, say, the United States, yet they do not receive the same pension.  They feel that they have been deprived of an increasingly substantial part of the fruit of their contributions.  The real value, at least in the United Kingdom, of their pensions is declining from year to year.<p></p></ul>
<p>It is clear from Laws LJ's exposition of the legislation that as far as domestic law is concerned that difference of treatment is in accordance with the law and has to be endured by Mrs Carson and other pensioners similarly affected, who can only hope that their appeals to logic and a sense of fair play will eventually prevail, contrary to their experience to date.  The issue in this appeal, however, is whether the impact of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms ("the Convention"), as brought into play by the Human Rights Act 1998, has made it unlawful for the Government to operate legislation which has such an effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94.&nbsp;&nbsp;The claim was originally advanced on behalf of Mrs Carson that the failure to pay her an uprated pension constituted a direct breach of article 1 of the First Protocol to the Convention.  This claim was rejected by the judge and by the Court of Appeal.  Before your Lordships' House her counsel Mr Blake QC, while not abandoning the submission that there had been a breach of article 1 of the First Protocol standing alone, did not present any arguments on it, founding his case on the claim that there was a breach of article 14 of the Convention taken with article 1 of the First Protocol.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was accepted by counsel for the respondent Secretary of State that Mrs Carson's case fell within the ambit of article 1 of the First Protocol for the purpose of triggering the operation of article 14 of the Convention.  Nor was any argument presented that her residence abroad could not constitute a "status" within the meaning of the term in article 14.  The matters in issue between the parties were (i) whether the difference in treatment of pensioners residing in different countries amounted to discrimination, and (ii) if so, whether it was objectively justifiable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96.&nbsp;&nbsp;It might be supposed, if one were innocently unacquainted with the arcane subtleties of discrimination law, that the first question answered itself in the appellant's favour without the need for serious argument.  Yet those who have such acquaintance will hardly be surprised to be told that there was a substantial dispute on this question and that it was stoutly maintained on behalf of the respondent that Mrs Carson's case could not be sufficiently equated with that of others put forward as comparators, so that she fell at the hurdle of establishing that she had been discriminated against.  I do not wish to denigrate the arguments presented, which found favour with the majority of your Lordships, as well as with Stanley Burnton J and the Court of Appeal, but I have to say that they seem to me misdirected.  They are founded upon the premise that the appellant's financial circumstances cannot be directly compared with those of pensioners either in the United Kingdom or in other countries, since exchange rates, inflation rates and the cost of living vary between these countries.  It was submitted that for that reason her case could not be directly compared with theirs and that accordingly she had not been discriminated against.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many discrimination cases resolve themselves into a dispute, which can often seem more than a little arid, about comparisons and identifying comparators, where a broader approach might more readily yield a serviceable answer which corresponds with one's instincts for justice.  The appeals which came before the House in <i>Shamoon v Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary </i> [2003] ICR 337 and <i>Ghaidan v Godin-Mendoza </i> [2004] 2 AC 557 are good examples.  Much of the problem stems from focusing too closely on finding comparisons, an approach which may tend to place too much emphasis on finding answers to the four questions posed by Brooke LJ in paragraph 20 of his judgment in <i>Wandsworth London Borough Council v Michalak </i> [2003] 1 WLR 617, 625.  The questions have been set out in paragraph 61 of the opinion of Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe in the present appeal and I need not repeat them.  These questions can supply an admirable analysis for some cases, but can form a Procustean bed if others are forced into their framework.  Question (i) will be a constant in every consideration of article 14, but is not in issue in the present appeal.  Question (ii) requires to be answered in some form, for the essence of discrimination is in the different treatment of persons who ought to be treated in the same or a similar fashion.  Laws LJ substituted a compendious question in place of Brooke LJ's questions (iii) and (iv), which he described as a possible approach, for he recognised, as Baroness Hale of Richmond pointed out in <i>Ghaidan v Godin-Mendoza </i>[2004] 2 AC 557, 605, para 134, as did Mance LJ in <i>Nasser v United Bank of Kuwait </i>[2002] 1 WLR 1868, 1883, para 56, that there is a considerable overlap in the content of the questions.  This may again be helpful in some cases, but fail to assist in finding the proper answer in others.  There is also the fifth question propounded by the judge in the present case, whether the different treatment of the complainant was on a prohibited ground.  That again is not in issue in this case.  I accordingly am in agreement with the views expressed by my noble and learned friends Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, Lord Hoffmann and Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe that a broader and simpler approach to discrimination is required, certainly in cases in which resort is had to the Convention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion the comparison in this case should be a simple one, between the appellant Mrs Carson and other contributing pensioners who reside in the United Kingdom or in countries where their pensions are uprated by our government.  She and other pensioners who reside in countries in which their pensions are not uprated are unquestionably treated differently, to their disadvantage, by reason of their residence in those countries.  I consider it fallacious to argue that because the exchange rates may vary and the cost of living in those countries may differ from the United Kingdom, the appellant and pensioners in like condition cannot be compared with pensioners residing in the United Kingdom or in countries where pensions are uprated.  That makes as little sense as arguing that pensioners in the United Kingdom could not be compared with each other because some are better off through possession of other income or because some live frugally and others spend their money in a different way.  How persons spend their income and where they do so are matters for their own choice.  Some may choose to live in a country where the cost of living is low or the exchange rate favourable, a course not uncommon in previous generations, which may or may not carry with it disadvantages, but that is a matter for their personal choice.  The common factor for purposes of comparison is that all of the pensioners, in whichever country they may reside, have duly paid the contributions required to qualify for their pensions.  If some of them are not paid pensions at the same rate as others, that in my opinion constitutes discrimination for the purposes of article 14.  It is not a matter of comparing the economic state of third countries, as the European Commission on Human Rights stated in <i>Corner v United Kingdom </i>(unreported), 17 May 1985, (App No 11271/84) which is set out in paragraph 74 of Laws LJ's judgment [2003] 3 All ER 577, 609.  It is a matter of simple justice between groups of people who have paid the same contributions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99.&nbsp;&nbsp;I regard this appeal as turning on the question whether the difference made between the two classes, uprated and not uprated, is justified, an issue which was discussed in detail in the judgments of Stanley Burnton J and Laws LJ.  I of course accept that the courts should be slow to intervene in matters of macro-economic policy which are the province of the executive and legislative branches of government.  If the government had put forward sufficient reasons of economic or state policy to justify the difference in treatment, I should have been properly ready to yield to its decision-making power in those fields.  It has not done so.  On the contrary, it is clearly apparent from the terms of the Department of Social Security memorandum on the uprating of state retirement pensions payable to people resident abroad, furnished by the DSS to the House of Commons Social Security Committee in the session 1996-7, that the reasons for the policy lie wholly in the cost of uprating.  It is stated in paragraph 11 of the memorandum:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Agreeing to additional expenditure on pensions paid overseas would be incompatible with the government's policy of containing the long term cost of the social security system to ensure that it remains affordable."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, pensions were becoming too expensive to pay at the full rate to all those who had contributed, so the government had to find some means of keeping down the cost, and the chosen means of doing so was to deprive one class of uprating.  Inclusion of individual pensioners in this class depended on the adventitious matter of whether this country had in the past entered into a reciprocal agreement with the particular states in which they reside.  I do not find it possible to regard the selection of this class for less favourable treatment as a matter of high state policy or an exercise in macro-economics.  It has the appearance rather of the selection of a convenient target for saving money.  This in my view is a very different matter from the clutch of policy reasons for differential rates of payment of jobseeker's allowance in Miss Reynolds' case, which are set out in paragraphs 85 and 86 of the opinion of Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Howell QC argued on behalf of the respondent that since the government has no legal obligation to pay any pensions at all to persons resident abroad they cannot complain when they receive some part but not all of the pensions payable to pensioners resident in the United Kingdom.  The government has, however, paid to pensioners resident abroad the amount of their pensions, with or without uprating, depending on their place of residence.  It was accepted by Mr Howell that the ground for its doing so was the fact that the pensioners had paid pension contributions.  Once it is accepted that pensions should be paid to contributing pensioners resident abroad, then no justification remains for paying some less than others and less than UK residents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Howell then argued that if the appellant has any entitlement it is only to the amount of the standard pension payable at the time when she became eligible to receive it.  That amount itself contains a number of increases added to the basic pension when the statutory figure was first fixed.  I see no logical ground for the submission that the appellant should be entitled to receive those increases but not any subsequent ones.  It was also argued that uprating is discretionary and is done to meet the needs of pensioners in the United Kingdom, being fixed by reference to increases in the cost of living in this country.  If the uprating were done purely on the basis of need, one might expect that these pensions would be means-tested or that there might be regional variations in the rates of pension payable, to reflect variations in the cost of living throughout the country.  This is manifestly not the case, which disproves the thesis that uprating is purely discretionary to meet financial need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor do I think that the respondent can derive assistance from the fact that the Social Charter and Code of Social Security adopted by the Council of Europe, the body which produced the Convention, envisage that payment of benefits may be suspended when the recipient is resident abroad.  Counsel argued from this that the Council cannot have considered that article 14 was an obstacle to suspension of payment.  It is not clear whether it had in mind contributory pensions as distinct from welfare benefits payable on the basis of need.  Whatever opinion the Council may have entertained, I do not think that it can determine the decision of the House on the issue before it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103.&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore do not consider that the case for justifying the difference in treatment has been made out.  The government may have been entitled under domestic law to take this course if it so chose, but for the reasons which I have indicated I consider that article 14 of the Convention operates to prevent such discrimination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore allow the appeal and declare that regulation 3 of the Social Security Benefits Up-rating Regulations 2001 (SI 2001/910) is unlawful and of no effect as being incompatible with Mrs Carson's Convention rights contained in article 14 of the Convention taken together with article 1 of the First Protocol.  I would see considerable merit in making the invalidity prospective only, but since the majority of your Lordships do not agree with my conclusion concerning the unlawful nature of the regulation I do not feel it necessary to discuss the point.</p>
