<p class="para">120.&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 31, headed “REFUGEES UNLAWFULLY IN THE COUNTRY OF REFUGE", provides:</p>
<p class="qt">“(1) The Contracting States shall not impose penalties, on account of their illegal entry or presence, on refugees who, coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened in the sense of article 1, enter or are present in their territory without authorisation, provided they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence.</p>
<p class="qt">(2) The Contracting States shall not apply to the movements of such refugees restrictions other than those which are necessary and such restrictions shall only be applied until their status in the country is regularised or they obtain admission into another country. The Contracting States shall allow such refugees a reasonable period and all the necessary facilities to obtain admission into another country.”</p>
<p class="para">121.&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 31 therefore gives refugees freedom from penalties on account of their illegal entry or presence, together with freedom to move within and to leave the country of refuge, in each case within limits. The coupling of these two subjects is significant. The drafters of the Convention contemplated that refugees who unlawfully entered a country where they could claim asylum would do so without delay and would then have their situation regularised. Articles 26 and 28 had addressed the position of refugees lawfully within the territory of a Contracting State - article 26 providing that each Contracting State shall accord to such refugees the right to choose their place of residence and move freely within its territory, and article 28 (set out by Lord Rodger in his para 97) providing for the issue to refugees lawfully staying in such territory of travel documents for the purpose of travel abroad, and further providing that “The Contracting States may issue such a travel document to any other refugee in their territory” and “shall in particular give sympathetic consideration to the issue of such a document to refugees in their territory who are unable to obtain a travel document from the country of their lawful residence". Article 27 also provides that “The Contracting States shall issue travel documents to any refugee in their territory who does not possess a valid travel document".</p>
<p class="para">122.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under article 31, refugees are only free from penalties “on account of their illegal entry or presence” within the relevant Contracting State’s territory, and then only provided three conditions are satisfied: (i) they must have come “directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened in the sense of article 1", (ii) they must have presented themselves without delay to the authorities and (iii) they must show good cause for their illegal entry or presence. </p>
<p class="para">123.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, the appellant, Ms Fregenet Asfaw, according to her account, left Ethiopia to avoid further persecution there, flew to London airport Heathrow on an aeroplane which stopped briefly in an unknown Middle Eastern country and, having entered the United Kingdom at Heathrow on one false passport, intended to leave immediately on another false passport and to fly to and enter the United States (presumably illegally on her second false passport) and there claim asylum. Had she achieved that aim, the questions arising in the United States would have been (i) whether she had come directly from a country where her life or freedom was threatened, (ii) whether she had presented herself without delay to the authorities and (iii) whether she had good cause for her illegal entry or presence.  One can assume that she would have satisfied condition (ii), but conditions (i) and (ii), which potentially overlap, raise questions of interpretation as well as application. </p>
<p class="para">124.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assume that, in Ms Asfaw’s case, an affirmative answer could have been given to all three questions in the United States after she had entered and passed through at least one intermediate state, the United Kingdom. It remains the case that article 31 is not addressing freedom from penalties in that intermediate state. It does not need to do so. The refugee has, by definition, arrived at his or her final destination. The intermediate state and any question of penalties are irrelevant. The issue which is before the House only arises under article 31 if a refugee detected when seeking illegally to pass through an intermediate transit state is entitled there to invoke the freedom from penalties provided by article 31. Again, any such entitlement would necessarily depend on his or her being able to satisfy conditions (i), (ii) and (iii) (coming directly, presenting without delay and good cause); conditions (ii) and (iii) would present particular problems for a refugee whose aim was to transit the state without claiming asylum and who did not therefore claim asylum until detected trying to leave that state. But, even if those problems could be overcome (as the jury must in the present case have thought that they could be), the refugee would have also to show that any penalty was being imposed “on account of their illegal entry or presence” in the United Kingdom.  Where the charge is one of illegal entry or presence,  that will be possible; and in the case of some transit passengers in some states that may be the only charge that could lie.  But if, in order to leave an intermediate state, a refugee commits a separate offence such as deceiving or attempting to deceive an airline, the question is whether article 31 offers any immunity.  There is nothing on the face of article 31 to suggest that it was addressing this situation at all. The issue is whether it is nonetheless implicit in its aims, scope and language that such conduct should be covered by immunity.</p>
<p class="para">125.&nbsp;&nbsp;The starting point for the interpretation of an international treaty such as the Geneva Convention is the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969. Section  3, Interpretation of Treaties, of Part III contains these relevant provisions:</p>
<p class="qt">“<i>Article 31</i></p>
<i><p>General rule of interpretation</p>
</i>
<p>1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.</p>
<p>2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:</p>
<p>(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connexion with the conclusion of the treaty;</p>
<p>(b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connexion with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.</p>
<p>3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:</p>
<p>(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the</p>
<p>interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;</p>
<p>(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;</p>
<p>(c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.</p>
<p>4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.</p>
<i><p>Article 32</p>
<p>Supplementary means of interpretation</p>
</i>
<p>Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31:</p>
<p>(a) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or</p>
<p>(b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.”</p>
<p class="para">126.&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary canon is thus interpretation in accordance with the ordinary meaning in context and in the light of the Convention’s object and purpose. There is no suggestion in this case of any relevant agreement of other instrument made between any of the Contracting States in connection with or subsequent to the conclusion of the Convention.  Nor was there made to the House any explicit suggestion of subsequent state practice establishing the meaning of the parties regarding the Convention’s interpretation, although reference was made to views expressed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and by certain commentators which mention inter alia the practice of “some states".  In many cases these views follow or are joined with a summary of, or a selection of citations from, the negotiations at the Conference of Plenipotentiaries in 1951 leading to the Convention. Details of these negotiations are available on the High Commissioner’s website from which the House was given an extract of the final discussions relating to article 31, which took place at the Plenipotentiaries’ 35th meeting. Earlier discussions at the 13th and 14th meetings are also of interest. I set out an analysis of the course and effect of the three meetings in an appendix to this judgment. My noble and learned friends, Lord Bingham and Lord Hope, refer to certain aspects. The discussions are potentially relevant under article 32 of the Vienna Convention as supplementary means of interpretation “in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31 [of the Vienna Convention], or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31: (a) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure …..".  </p>
<p class="para">127.&nbsp;&nbsp;The analysis in the appendix shows that the final text was drawn in order to cater for a particular category of refugees stopping in an intermediate country, identified by the then High Commissioner for Refugees: that is refugees, moving from a country of origin (country A) where they were at risk of persecution as a result of events occurring before 1 January 1951, reaching another intermediate country (country B) where they also found themselves at risk of persecution as a result of events occurring before 1 January 1951 and proceeding as a result to a final destination (country C) where they claimed asylum. Stoppage in intermediate country B was catered for in such circumstances by replacing the original insertion proposed by France (“coming direct from his country of origin”) with the final text “coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened in the sense of article 1". </p>
<p class="para">128.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the refugee passes through intermediate country B, the “territory” referred to in the final version is thus that of the intermediate country B, not that of the country of origin A. However, the High Commissioner also identified a second category who he would have wished to see catered for: refugees not at risk of persecution in country B, but nevertheless (and, in the case of a country party to the Geneva Convention, wrongly) refused asylum there. During the 14th meeting, all present including the French representative, M Colemar, were prepared to cater for both categories of refugee identified by the High Commissioner (those at risk of persecution in the intermediate state and those refused asylum there). During the final 35th meeting, the French representative, now M. Rochefort, was not, it seems, content that the text of article 31 should offer immunity to the High Commissioner’s second category. The United Kingdom’s representative, Mr (later Sir Samuel) Hoare believed that the amendment proposed but ultimately withdrawn by the United Kingdom (see appendix para 153) would offer additional flexibility in the case of refugees coming through intermediate countries. This was a flexibility that he also believed would be lost if the French amendment was instead accepted, as it was.  </p>
<p class="para">129.&nbsp;&nbsp;Had the United Kingdom’s version been accepted, Mr Hoare clearly thought that the phrase “coming directly from the country of his nationality or of former habitual residence” could be interpreted widely enough to cover movement via intermediate countries in a wide variety of circumstances. But the course of negotiations shows that the actual final phrase “coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened in the sense of article 1” was chosen with reference only to the first category, that is refugees arriving via an intermediate country B provided that their life or freedom had been there threatened; and under the Convention as originally enacted its application was subject, furthermore, to the condition that any such threat arose from events occurring before 1 January 1951. Since the coming into force of the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees of 31 January 1967, any restriction by reference to “events occurring before 1 January 1951” has gone. But there is some difficulty, in the light of the discussions at the 35th meeting, about treating the word “territory", in the final phrase “coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened in the sense of article 1", as apt to refer <i>both</i> to any intermediate country for the purpose of assessing whether life or freedom was there threatened <i>and</i>, if no such threat could be shown to exist, to the country of origin (country A) for the purpose of considering whether the stay in the intermediate country was a “short” transit period which should be ignored. The difficulty may, however, be capable of being surmounted by treating the refugee as “coming directly” from the original country of persecution in at least some circumstances where there is no more than a transitory stopover in an intermediate country, making it then irrelevant to consider whether there was a risk of persecution in that intermediate country. Some of the flexibility that Mr Hoare believed would be offered by the United Kingdom proposal would then be transposed to the final text as proposed by France, despite Mr Hoare’s (and M Rochefort’s) belief that it would not be. Such a solution would appear linguistically possible; it is also one that the delegates at the 14th meeting would, it seems, have been content to take, even though at least some of the delegates at the final 35th meeting appear to have thought that the language that they eventually chose marked a retreat.</p>
<p class="para">130.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1951 the position of refugees travelling via intermediate countries has continued to occupy the attention of Contracting States and commentators. A valuable description of the early position is contained in Atle Grahl-Madsen’s work <i>The Status of Refugees in International Law</i>, vol I (1966) p 301, para 108 and vol II (1972), at pp  206-207, cited by my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham in para 12. Grahl-Madsen observes that “it is important to note that the practice of States in respect of a refugee “who only passes through the first country of refuge [where they are not threatened with persecution] without any delay or with only a minimum of delay” is more lenient than would be expected on the background of Mr Rochefort’s ….. statements” at the 35th meeting of Plenipotentiaries. Germany, he says, does not penalise refugees travelling via Austria (presumably originating at that date in a country behind the Iron Curtain or from Yugoslavia). Belgium treats a refugee as coming directly if he arrives within a fortnight of leaving his country of origin. In France each case is treated on its merits, according to whether the refugee can show good cause. The United Nations High Commissioner advocates a test looking at whether the refugee has established residence in an intermediate country. A number of countries also concluded <i>refoulement </i>agreements in the 1950 and 1960s prohibiting return to an intermediate country unless the refugee had spent at least a fortnight there. Grahl-Madsen’s opinion was thus that a refugee “who only passes through the first country of refuge without any delay or with only a minimum of delay” may normally claim the benefit of article 31 in the country where he finally arrives, that this applies “so that a person may actually travel through several countries until he eventually applies for asylum” and that “The implication is that if the refugee had ended his journey in any of the transit countries, he would have been able to invoke article 31(1) there, too".</p>
<p class="para">131.&nbsp;&nbsp;In Chapter 3.1 of <i>Refugee Protection in International Law</i> edited by Feller, Türk &amp; Nicholson, Professor Goodwin-Gill records (at pp 214-215) two occasions on which the UN High Commission for Refugees considered the phenomenon of “irregular” movements by refugees moving from a country in which they had already found protection. He noted that participating States had, while expressing concern, acknowledged that refugees might have justifiable reasons for such action. However, on the first occasion, Executive Committee Conclusion No 15 (XXX) 1979 said only that the authorities of the second country should “give favourable consideration” to an asylum request made in such circumstances where the refugee has left “his present asylum country due to fear of persecution or because his physical safety or freedom are endangered"; and on the second occasion Executive Committee Conclusion No 58 (XL) 1989, after repeating the same statement, added only that:</p>
<p class="qt">“It is recognised that circumstances may compel a refugee or asylum-seeker to have recourse to fraudulent documentation when leaving a country in which his physical safety or freedom are endangered. Where no such compelling circumstances exist, the use of fraudulent documentation is unjustified …..”</p>
<p class="para">Neither Conclusion therefore supports the claim to immunity in the present case; on the contrary, the terms of each suggest that no such immunity was then conceived as existing.</p>
<p class="para">132.&nbsp;&nbsp;The High Commissioner for Refugees has continued to support a generous approach to asylum claims made in a final destination by a refugee who has transited an intermediate country, as mentioned by Lord Bingham in para 13. The Guidelines issued by the High Commissioner’s Office in 1992 and revised in 1999 state that “It is understood that this term ['coming directly'] also covers a person who transits an intermediate country for a short period of time without having applied for, or received, asylum there. No strict time limit can be applied to the concept ‘coming directly’ and each case must be judged on its merits". As Lord Rodger observes, the basis and scope of this understanding are not explained. Similarly, in a summary and commentary on the Travaux Préparatoires prepared in the 1990s by Dr Paul Weis who played an active role in the work leading to the preparation of the 1951 conference and served as head of the legal division of the Office of UNHCR until retirement in 1967, Dr Weis stated that “The term ‘coming directly’ refers, of course, to persons who have come directly from their country of origin or a country where their life or freedom was threatened, but also the persons who have been in an intermediate country for a short time without having received asylum there". Again, no specific basis for this last statement is given. In the light of what is said by Grahl-Madsen, state practice, relevant under article 31(3)(c) of the Vienna Convention, might have been argued to have a potential role. However, neither Grahl-Madsen nor the High Commissioner’s Guidelines nor Dr Weis consider to what if any extent the feasibility of claiming asylum in an intermediate country has any role to play.  </p>
<p class="para">133.&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 3.1 in <i>Refugee Protection in International Law </i>represents the revised final text of what was originally a background paper on article 31 written by Professor Goodwin-Gill for a UNHCR round-table conference in 2001. At  p 194 in the revised text appears this passage:</p>
<p class="qt">“Refugees are not required to have come ‘directly’ from their country of origin. The intention, reflected in the practice of some states, appears to be that, for article 31(1) to apply, other countries or territories passed through should also have constituted actual or potential threats to life or freedom, or that onward flight may have been dictated by the refusal of other countries to grant protection or asylum, or by the operation of exclusionary provisions, such as those on safe third country, safe country of origin, or time limits. The criterion of ‘good cause’ for illegal entry is clearly flexible enough to allow the elements of individual cases to be taken into account.”</p>
<p class="para">This passage refers only to the practice of “some states” and the intention which it asserts is hard to reconcile with the course of discussions and the ultimate agreement reached at the Plenipotentiaries’ conference. It is clear that the Plenipotentiaries did not intend to leave the treatment of passage via intermediate countries to the criterion of ‘good cause'. The phrase which they inserted and which begins “coming directly …. “ was intended as a further limitation; and the limitation was focused on the first situation identified by Professor Goodwin-Gill, that is passage via a country or territory where the refugee was also subject to an actual or potential threat to life or freedom.  However, even Professor Goodwin-Gill’s wider approach concentrates attention on onward flight “dictated” by a risk of persecution in the intermediate country, by the refusal by intermediate countries to grant protection or asylum, or by the operation of exclusionary provisions. To that extent, his approach also requires more than a mere voluntary preference or choice to proceed to another destination.</p>
<p class="para">134.&nbsp;&nbsp;The round-table conference led to conclusions set out at p 255 of <i>Refugee Protection in International law</i> and quoted by Lord Bingham in para 19.  The reference to persons “who are unable to find effective protection in the first country or countries to which they flee” covers those at risk of persecution in the intermediate country (though may have been intended also to invoke the second category of refugee of concern to the High Commissioner at the Plenipotentiaries’ conference). The further statements that “The drafters only intended that immunity from penalty should not apply to refugees who found asylum, or were settled, temporarily or permanently, in another country” and that “The intention of the asylum seeker to reach a particular country of destination, for instance for family reunification purposes, is a factor to be taken into account when assessing whether s/he transited through or stayed in another country” seem to me to have been aspirational rather than founded on any actual intention on the part of the drafting conference.</p>
<p class="para">135.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in <i>The Rights of Refugees under International Law </i>(2005) by James Hathaway, the author at pp 397-398 footnote 535 cites Dr Weis’s statement quoted above, but identifies a decision of an American court (<i>Singh v  Nelson</i> 623 F Supp 545 (1985)) where, he says, “a misreading of the drafting history led an American court to precisely the opposite conclusion” and an Austrian Administrative Court decision (VwGH 91/19/0187, Nov 25, 1991) which he describes as “equally inattentive to the contextualised meaning of ‘coming directly'". In each decision the court rejected the application of article 31 where the refugee had transited an intermediate state where he was not at risk of persecution. During the course of the hearing before the House, I suggested that there must be jurisprudence on article 31 in other European jurisdictions. I regret that this area was not investigated, even to the extent of producing the Austrian decision mentioned by Hathaway.  The commentary <i>Ausländerrecht </i>(2005) by Professor Dr Kay Hailbronner pp 28-29 indicates that German jurisprudence has understood the effect of article 31(1) to be that a refugee using an intermediate third country for transit without breaking his journey there (that is without any unjustifiably delayed stay there) would be regarded as “coming directly” from the persecuting state.  But the commentary also states that the language and history of article 31(1) speak for an interpretation according to which a person is not to be treated as “coming directly” from a safe third state where the possibility existed of claiming protection from persecution, and that even a temporary factual transit stop in a safe third state in which there existed that possibility, and the possibility if necessary of seeking a visa for onward transit, would exclude the application of article 31(1). </p>
<p class="para">136.&nbsp;&nbsp;Against this background, I turn to the only authority directly in point put before the House from any jurisdiction. That is the English Divisional Court decision in <i>R v Uxbridge Magistrates’ Court, Ex p Adimi </i>[2001] QB 667 (Simon Brown LJ and Newman J).  In oral submissions in that case, the Secretary of State (and it would seem the Director of Public Prosecutions) accepted that “whether a person who has come to the UK via another country has come directly is a question of fact and degree” (p 673C-D), and Simon Brown LJ recited further submissions that this would not be the case if the refugee could reasonably have been expected to claim asylum in the intermediate country or, still more restrictively, that “only considerations of continuing safety would justify impunity for further travel” beyond the intermediate country. Simon Brown LJ and Newman J rejected these submissions on the basis that refugees have an element of choice as to where to seek asylum, that this entitles them to move via an intermediate safe country to a preferred final destination, and that “where the illegal entry or use of false documents or delay can be attributed to a bona fide desire to seek asylum whether here [ ie in an intermediate safe country] or elsewhere, that conduct should be covered by article 31” (p 677G-H).</p>
<p class="para">137.&nbsp;&nbsp;That a refugee may have some element of choice is undoubtedly true. There may be a range of countries of refuge to which he or she can travel directly from the country of persecution. But that does not mean that a refugee has any entitlement to travel indirectly via an intermediate safe country to a final country of refuge, and still less, to my mind, does it mean that a refugee has any immunity in the event that she or he seeks to achieve this by breaking the law of the intermediate country in order to leave it. The broad aim of article 31(1), with its requirement of “coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened in the sense of article 1", was, as pointed out above, to counter any suggestion that refugees have a right to move voluntarily from one safe intermediate country to another and then claim asylum in the latter. </p>
