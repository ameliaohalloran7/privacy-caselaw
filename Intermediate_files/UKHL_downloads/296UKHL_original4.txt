<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;52.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rules are made under Part 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 ("the 1991 Act") (now repealed by the Criminal Justice Act 2003).  Section 32 of the 1991 Act deals with the Parole Board.  The section provides so far as relevant;</p>
<p></p><ul>"(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board shall deal with cases as respects which it makes recommendations under this Part or Chapter II on consideration of -<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;any documents given to it by the Secretary of State; and<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;any other oral or written information obtained by it,<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>and if in any particular case the Board thinks it necessary to interview the person to whom the case relates before reaching a decision, the Board may authorise one of its members to interview him and shall consider the report of the interview made by that member.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board shall deal with cases as respects which it gives directions under this Part or Chapter II on consideration of all such evidence as may be adduced before it. <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;Without prejudice to subsections (3) and (4) above,  the Secretary of State may make rules with respect to the proceedings of the Board, including provision authorising cases to be dealt with by a prescribed number of its members or requiring cases to be dealt with at prescribed times.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary of State may also give to the Board directions as to the matters to be taken into account by it in discharging any functions under this Part or Chapter II; and in giving any such directions the Secretary of State shall in particular have regard to - <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;the need to protect the public from serious harm from offenders; and<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;the desirability of preventing the commission by them of further offences and of securing their rehabilitation…."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;53.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only other relevant provision of the 1991 Act is paragraph 1(2)(b) of Schedule 5. This is the commonly found "sweep up" jurisdictional provision. It gives the Board power to do "such things and enter into such transactions as are incidental to or conducive to the discharge of …its functions…".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;54.&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been three sets of rules made under the 1991 Act, the Parole Board Rules 1992, the Parole Board Rules 1997 and the Parole Board Rules 2004.  As the 2004 Rules are now in force, we should concentrate primarily on those Rules.  However, it is to be noted that the 1992 Rules already required relevant information to be served on the prisoner or his representative subject to the information being withheld from the prisoner if disclosure would affect adversely the health or welfare of the prisoner or others.  Then it is to be served on the prisoner's representative if the representative is a lawyer, a medical practitioner or a person that the chairman of the panel identifies as suitable.  The prisoner can be represented by any person whom he has authorised for this purpose, who is not ineligible because (a) he is liable to be detained under the Mental Health Act 1983 or (b) he is serving a sentence of imprisonment or is on licence or with a previous conviction that is not spent.  The Rules also require the hearing to be oral, unless both parties and the chairman agree otherwise.  As to procedure at the hearing, this is prescribed by the 1992 Rules in terms that give the panel considerable discretion.  The relevant provisions are:</p>
<p></p><ul>"9.(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to paragraph (3), the chairman of the panel may give, vary or revoke directions for the conduct of the case, including directions in respect of - <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;the timetable for the proceedings,<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;the varying of the time within which or by which an act is required, by these Rules, to be done, <p></p></ul>

<p></p><ul>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;the service of documents,<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;as regards any documents which have been received by the Board but which have been withheld from the prisoner in accordance with rule 5(2), whether the disclosure of such documents would adversely affect the health or welfare of the prisoner or others, and <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;the submission of evidence;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>and following his appointment under rule 3, the chairman of the panel shall consider whether such directions need to be given at any time.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Within 14 days of being notified of a direction under paragraph (1)(d), either party may appeal against it to the chairman, who shall notify the other party of the appeal; the other party may make representations on the appeal to the chairman whose decision shall be final.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;Directions under paragraph (1) may be given, varied or revoked either - <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;of the chairman of the panel's own motion, or<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;on the written application of a party to the Board which has been served on the other party and which specifies the direction which is sought;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>but in either case, both parties shall be given an opportunity to make written representations or, where the chairman of  the panel thinks it necessary, and subject to paragraph (6)(b), to make oral submissions at a preliminary hearing fixed in accordance with paragraph (4)…<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>13. (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to this rule, the panel shall conduct the hearing in such manner as it considers most suitable to the clarification of the issues before it and generally to the just handling of the proceedings; it shall so far as appears to it appropriate, seek to avoid formality in the proceedings…<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;The chairman of the panel may require any person present at the hearing who is, in his opinion, behaving in a disruptive manner to leave and may permit him to return, if at all, only on such conditions as he may specify.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;The panel may receive in evidence any document or information notwithstanding that such document or information would be inadmissible in a court of law but no person shall be compelled to give any evidence or produce any document which he could not be compelled to give or produce on the trial of an action.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;The chairman of the panel may require the prisoner, or any witness appearing for the prisoner, to leave the hearing where evidence is being examined which the chairman of the panel, in accordance with rule 9(1)(d) (subject to any successful appeal under rule 9(2)), previously directed should be withheld from the prisoner as being injurious to the health or welfare of the prisoner or another person.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;After all the evidence has been given, the prisoner shall be given a further opportunity to address the panel. "<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;55.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1997 Rules and the 2004 Rules are in similar terms.  There is, however, a significant difference between rule 6 of the 2004 Rules and its predecessor.  Rule 6 provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"6. (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Within 8 weeks of the case being listed, the Secretary of State shall serve on the Board and, subject to paragraph (2), the prisoner or his representative - <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;the information specified in Part A of Schedule 1 to these Rules,<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;the reports specified in Part B of  that Schedule, and <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;such further information as the Secretary of State considers to be relevant to the case.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Any part of the information or reports referred to in paragraph (1) which, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, should be withheld from the prisoner on the grounds that its disclosure would adversely affect national security, the prevention of disorder or crime or the health or welfare of the prisoner or others (such withholding being a necessary and proportionate measure in all the circumstances of the case), shall be recorded in a separate document and served only on the Board together with the reasons for believing that its disclosure would have that effect.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a document is withheld from the prisoner in accordance with paragraph (2), it shall, <i>unless the chair of the panel directs otherwise</i>, nevertheless be served as soon as practicable on the prisoner's representatives if he is -<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;a barrister or solicitor,<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;a registered medical practitioner, or<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;a person whom the chair of the panel directs is suitable by virtue of his experience or professional qualification;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>provided that no information disclosed in accordance with this paragraph shall be disclosed either directly or indirectly to the prisoner or to any other person without the consent/authority of the chair of the panel." &nbsp;&nbsp;(Emphasis added)<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;56.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the earlier Rules did not contain the qualification that is now contained in rule 6(3) as to the chair of the panel being able to direct otherwise, if there was power to make rule 6 of the 2004 Rules, I would regard the wide unqualified power to give directions contained in the earlier Rules (for example rule 9 of the 1992 Rules) as creating a similar power. That is a power of the Board to direct non-disclosure if the Board is satisfied, in an exceptional situation, that there is no alternative, if the public interest is to be protected.  It would be extraordinary if there should be no such power bearing in mind that it should have been obvious that such a power could be necessary on hearings before the Board as it is, and has been, in criminal proceedings.  Even if the position were otherwise, such a power would have to be implied as a matter of necessity to enable the Board to perform its statutory duty to protect the public. It is to be noted that there is no <i>express</i> statutory obligation for the Board to hold an oral hearing. The procedural requirements are a product of the Rules. None the less section 28 implicitly requires the Board to act fairly and as part of that fundamental requirement of fairness the Board normally would be required to hold a hearing. In relation to such a right to a hearing, the approach which Lord Bingham identified as being applicable in <i>R v H</i> as to the Strasbourg approach could equally be applied to our approach in this jurisdiction to the responsibilities of an administrative body that is required to exercise a decision of the nature entrusted to the Board by section 28.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specially Appointed Advocates</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;57.&nbsp;&nbsp;Understandably, the use of SAAs has attracted adverse criticism.  This adverse criticism is particularly linked with their use before bodies such as the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC), in conjunction with the detention or other restrictions that may be imposed on those whom it is suspected may commit terrorist offences.  However, if, in the present context, the use of a SAA is confined to situations where the SAA can provide additional protection for the prisoner, this is surely a safeguard for the prisoner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;58.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was in relation to such a situation that the use of a SAA was encouraged by the ECtHR in <i>Chahal v United Kingdom</i> (1996) 23 EHRR 413.  It was this initiative by the ECtHR that resulted in their use in this jurisdiction.  <i>Chahal</i> was a case where a Sikh separatist leader had been detained in custody pending deportation for a substantial period after the Home Secretary had decided that he was a threat to national security.  The ECtHR decided <i>inter alia</i>, that there had been violation of article 5 (4) of the Convention.  Mr Chahal had not been informed of the sources of the evidence relied on by the Home Office in support of its allegations which were put to an advisory panel.  The ECtHR recognised that the use of confidential material could be unavoidable where national security is at stake (para 131).  The ECtHR went on to point out that in Canada, a more effective form of judicial control had been developed, referring to the use of SAAs.  As the ECtHR said in <i>Chahal</i>: "this example illustrates that there are techniques which can be employed which both accommodate legitimate security concerns about the nature and sources of intelligence information and yet accord the individual a substantial measure of procedural justice".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;59.&nbsp;&nbsp;This was no more than a suggestion.  However, the reasoning of the ECtHR is to be supported as long as the use of SAAs is confined to situations where their involvement is not used to justify a reduction in the protection available to the person affected by the non disclosure.  For example, the use of a SAA would not be justified if, in the absence of a SAA, the material would have been disclosed.  The protection provided by the SAA may be limited but, in some situations, it may make the critical difference.  This is illustrated by <i>M v Secretary of State for the Home Department</i> [2004] 2 All ER 863.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60.&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of a SAA is, however, never a panacea for the grave disadvantages of a person affected not being aware of the case against him.  The use of a SAA can be, however, a way of mitigating those disadvantages.  For example, the SAA can persuade the tribunal that there could perfectly properly be disclosure subject to no restrictions or less stringent restrictions than the tribunal was minded to impose.  The SAA may be able to destroy the credibility of a witness whose evidence is not disclosed.  Although, the SAA may not be allowed to communicate with the person affected, in appropriate circumstances the SAA can be authorised to communicate with those who do represent the person affected or the SAA may, before he has been instructed, receive useful information.  In addition, as this case illustrates, the SAA can ensure that the decision as to non disclosure is challenged on judicial review.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;61.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appellant relies on the fact that there is no statutory authority, whether in primary legislation or rules, that authorises the use of a SAA for hearings before the Board.  This is in contrast with the position in relation to some other bodies.  However, this is not in my view surprising. Other bodies such as the SIAC can be expected to have to consider the use of a SAA on a regular basis, whereas the use of a SAA before the Board is wholly exceptional, as is illustrated by this being one of the only two cases where a SAA has been instructed to appear before the Board.  In many tribunals there may be no rules that deal expressly with PII, but the tribunal would require a residual discretion to prevent the disclosure of information, if its disclosure would damage the public interest.  It is of interest that the "Guide to drafting Tribunal rules" published by the Council on Tribunals in November 2003 which contains their model rules makes no mention of SAAs or procedures for witness protection.  However, rule 22(2) provides that, if any document on which a party intends to rely contains any matter which… "Consists of information communicated or obtained in confidence, or concerns national security, and for that reason a party seeks to restrict its disclosure", the Registrar must send copies of that evidence to the parties only in accordance with the directions of the tribunal.  This implies that the tribunal has the power to give directions in such cases.  Rule 27A gives the tribunal power to give directions regarding disclosure of information and requires the tribunal to take account of factors, including the fact that the information was obtained in confidence or concerned national security (27A(3)).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;62.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the absence of rules may not be a disadvantage.  It enables the use of SAAs to be totally flexible.  There should, however, be two principles applied to their use.  The first I have already identified: namely, that they should only be appointed to assist the prisoner by providing a degree of protection that would otherwise be unavailable.  The second principle is that their role in any particular dispute should be tailored so that their use is no more than that which is necessary in that case to mitigate the adverse position of the prisoner who is affected.  In addition it is critical to recognise that the use of a SAA does not affect the overriding obligation for a hearing to meet the requirements of article 5(4) and of appropriate standards of fairness required by domestic law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;63.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before turning to the specific arguments advanced by Mr Owen as to why the SAA cannot be used before the Board, irrespective of the circumstances, it is right to stress that, if Mr Owen is correct in his contentions on behalf of the appellant, in the exceptional case where a SAA would otherwise be used to provide some protection, the prisoner may be deprived of very real assistance.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Appellant's Core Submissions</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;64.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of his argument Mr Owen helpfully identified four core submissions.  I will deal with each in turn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;65.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The First Core Submission</i></p>
<p></p><ul>"As a matter of domestic law, the Parole Board is a statutory corporation, not a court of law possessed of an inherent jurisdiction, and as such it is limited and circumscribed by the statute which regulates it.  What the statute does not expressly or impliedly authorise is to be taken to be prohibited."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a submission of law, this is correct.  The issue here is whether there is an express or implied authorisation.  In my view, there is an express authorisation to withhold information contained in the current Rules but if this is wrong, the authorisation is to be implied from the duty of the Board to conduct hearings which will enable it to reconcile the triangulation of interests to which I have referred.  In the case of the appointment of a SAA, authorisation is implied from the undoubted implicit duty of the Board under section 28 of the 1997 Act to conduct its decision-making process in a manner which so far as is practical and appropriate in the circumstances ensures that the prisoner is fairly treated.  The appointment of the SAA should only be made in the circumstances I have already identified.  If this approach is adhered to and the  possible appointment of a SAA is not used as an excuse to lower the standards of fairness, the presence of the SAA can only mitigate the disadvantage to  which the prisoner would otherwise be subject.  In these circumstances, I cannot see any objection to a SAA being appointed.  The legislation and Rules should not be interpreted as preventing the use of a SAA.  This is despite the decision of the Administrative Court in <i>R (S) v Waltham Forest Youth Court</i> [2004] EWHC 715 (Admin); [2004] 2 Cr App R 335.  In <i>R (D) v Camberwell Green Youth Court</i> [2005] 1 WLR 393, Baroness Hale of Richmond expressed reservations about that decision with which I would respectfully agree.  Courts should be slow to restrict the implied power of an administrative body to enhance the fairness available to a person who otherwise would be adversely affected by the lack of that power. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Second Submission</i></p>
<p></p><ul>"Merely because the Board satisfies the requirements of the 'court' for the purposes of article 5(4) ECHR does not alter its domestic law status or the controlling principles of administrative law which apply to limit the Board's procedural vires."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I have no quarrel with the legal accuracy of this submission.  But the submission does not advance the appellant's case.  Bodies such as the Board have an implied power under domestic administrative law to control their own procedure so as to deal with a person in the position of the appellant as fairly as the circumstances permit.  The use of a SAA, in an exceptional case, can assist the achievement of this.  The SAA was able to advance his contentions in favour of the appellant before the Administrative Court and Maurice Kay J was able to evaluate the appellant's arguments taking into account the "closed facts" and give a "closed judgment" on those facts to which we have not been invited to refer.  The result may have been adverse to the appellant, but the fact that this action could be taken confirms that the process is of value.  In another case the result could be different and the prisoner could establish that evidence is unjustifiably being withheld from him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;67.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Third Submission</i></p>
<p></p><ul>"Whether approached as a straightforward question of vires or via the principle of legality, the Parole Board has no power to create and apply, to the detriment of a life sentence prisoner's legal right to an adversarial hearing, a special advocate procedure absent express legislative authority.  This is because the use of the special advocate indefinitely to determine a prisoner's liberty is not a necessary implication of the Board's statutory functions."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On what I regard as being the proper approach, this submission fails to advance the appellant's case because the appointment of a SAA is not detrimental to any legal right of the prisoner.  This is because, as I have already explained above, the appointment of a SAA should not be used as a justification for reducing the rights that the prisoner would otherwise have but only as a way of mitigating the disadvantage he would otherwise suffer if his rights were going to be reduced with or without a SAA.  The submission refers to a special advocate "procedure" but I here refer, as does the issue, to the appointment of a SAA.  A SAA can be used in a variety of situations.  It can only enhance the rights of a life sentence prisoner.  Any complaint of the appellant should not be directed at the SAA but at the non-disclosure to the prisoner.  If there is no right not to make disclosure to the prisoner or his legal representative, then the SAA procedure cannot correct the failure to make disclosure.  It is only if there can be non-disclosure in the appropriate circumstances that the special advocate can have any role. That the SAA can have a role in appropriate circumstances is inherent in the flexible nature of the requirement that the prisoner is treated with fairness that is the source of the right to an oral hearing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;68.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Fourth Submission</i></p>
<p></p><ul>"Both at common law and article 5(4) ECHR, there is a core, irreducible, minimum entitlement for any life sentence prisoner to be able effectively to test/challenge any evidence which decisively bears on the legality of his detention.  By proceeding to determine the appellant's parole review by use of a special advocate, the Board is proposing to act unlawfully (section 6, Human Rights Act 1998)."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I accept the contention that there is, as contended, "a core, irreducible, minimum entitlement".  But what the Board does, if the need exists, to protect the safety of the public interest in, for example, a life threatening situation, is not necessarily inconsistent with achieving the minimum in question.  There is an issue as to what is that minimum.  The difficulty here is that we are only able to approach this case as a matter of principle.  We cannot approach it upon the facts because we do not know the facts.  There is a balancing exercise to be performed in order to determine whether the minimum is crossed.  We are just not in a position to perform that balancing exercise.  In order, therefore, to determine the agreed issue in the appellant's favour, we would first have to decide that there are no circumstances in which there can be no disclosure of "any evidence which decisively bears on the legality of his detention" which would then justify the appointment of a SAA.  We do not know, for example, whether the inhibition on disclosure is temporary or likely to be permanent.  We cannot even properly hazard a guess as to the scale of the danger to the public interest which the decision of the Board is intended to protect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;69.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this situation, the facts are critical and the only safe guide that we have as to those facts is that the decision of the Board was by a former High Court Judge who is a Vice-President of the Board, and it has been upheld by the Administrative Court.  The decision of the Board was in respect of three agreed issues:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;whether material to be relied on by the Secretary of State… should be disclosed;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;the form of disclosure of any such material; and</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;whether some other process should be applied in relation to any such material..."</p>
<p></p><ul>It was agreed these three issues should be decided by the Board.  It was further agreed:<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"In the event that the Parole Board considers that disclosure should not be made to [Mr Roberts'] legal representative but should be made to a special advocate acting in the interests of [Mr Roberts] in a similar manner to special advocates appearing before the Special Immigration Appeals Commission, the Secretary of State will fund the costs of the appointment of and representation by the special advocate."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what precisely has happened, but this does not affect the appellant's right to appeal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70.&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature of the panel who makes the decision, as illustrated by this case, perhaps provides the greatest protection for the prisoner because of the need to balance carefully the conflicting interests involved before deciding whether non disclosure is justified.  An experienced judge is able to make some appropriate allowance for the fact that evidence or information is not tested as well as would normally be the case in an adversarial hearing.  In addition there are usually steps which the judge can take which will minimise the scale of non disclosure and its effect.  It is here that the SAA can assist.  However, this is not to suggest that the prisoner will not remain at a significant disadvantage if he is not in a position to instruct his representative on the matters relied on against him in the usual manner.  It is because of this that non disclosure is a last resort and the question can still arise as to whether in the particular case there has been a breach of the irreducible minimum standard of fairness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;71.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the position as to disclosure is not static.  The balance can change and, therefore, it is possible that the balance can move in favour of the prisoner.  (See <i>R v Davis, Rowe and Johnson</i> [1993] 1 WLR 613, in which Lord Taylor CJ set out the procedure to be adopted in the case of a claim for PII in the absence of any formal rules).  If the position does change, the prisoner should be informed and provided with any information that was previously concealed from him. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72.&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerns have been expressed about the manner in which SAAs are used.  No doubt it is possible to improve upon the manner in which they are used.  In the case of SIAC there have been expressions of concern by the special advocates themselves.  However, the Attorney General has indicated that positive responses can be made to those concerns.  In any event, the Board who decides that a SAA should be used can impose conditions as to how they should be used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Owen submits that the situations involving national security come in a separate category.  However, the need for protection is not limited to situations involving national security though national security concerns are likely to be especially compelling.  The situations which can give rise to issues as to whether there should be non disclosure are illustrated by the categories of case that have resulted in claims for public interest immunity which are not confined to national security.</p>
