<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the great majority of cases about registration of town or village greens to which your Lordships have been referred the case has come before the court on an application for judicial review of a decision on registration already taken by the registration authority (see eg the <i>Sunningwell</i> case [2000] 1 AC 335, the <i>Beresford</i> case [2004] 1 AC 889, <i>Ex p Steed</i> 70 P &amp; CR 487, the <i>Alfred McAlpine Homes</i> case [2002] 2 PLR 1, the <i>Laing Homes</i> case [2004] 1 P &amp; CR 573 and the <i>Cheltenham Builders</i> case [2004] JPL 975). The only town or village green registration case previous to the present case that came before the court for a ruling before any decision had been taken by the registration authority that I have been able to discover is <i>Caerphilly County Borough Council v. Gwinnutt</i> (unreported), a case in 2002 decided by Judge Moseley. The applicant borough council was the registration authority but had an interest in the land in question being developed as an industrial estate. The council took the view, very understandably, that this interest made it inappropriate for it to discharge the quasi-judicial function of deciding whether to accede to the application to register the land as a town or village green. So it made an application asking the court to determine the issue as to registration. Judge Moseley commented in his judgment that the procedure adopted had "received the implicit endorsement" of this House in <i>Hampshire County Council v Milburn</i> [1991] 1 AC 325, but he was plainly puzzled about the legitimacy of asking the court to decide an issue that the applicant council had a statutory duty to decide. He said this, in paragraph 8 of his judgment:</p>

<p></p><ul>"In those circumstances what is the function of the court? In my judgment it can (1) determine any issue of law or construction submitted to it. Its determination on that issue must necessarily be final because there is only one correct answer to any such question, being the answer which the court provides and (2) provide guidance to the council as registration authority on the basis of the facts presented to it for its consideration. That guidance however in my view cannot possibly be final because after judgment the council may take into account other information available to it when it finally disposes of the application."<p></p></ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95.&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me likely that the County Council's procedure in the present case, asking for various rulings on points of law and for guidance as to the approach it should take to some of the facts, was borrowed from the cited passage from Judge Moseley's judgment. Be that as it may, I do not think the <i>Caerphilly</i> case, where the council had, in effect, recused themselves and had no alternative but to ask the court to decide the registration issue, should be regarded as a precedent of general application.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightman J in the present case, referring to the procedure the County Council had adopted, drew comfort, as Judge Moseley had done, from <i>Milburn's</i> case. In <i>Milburn's</i> case the owner of two parcels of land which, with other land, had been registered as common land, had applied for the land to be removed from the register. The issue was whether certain conveyancing transactions had had the result in law that the two parcels had ceased to be common land. The county council, as registration authority, asked the court to determine whether they should accede to the deregistration application. Millett J, at first instance, made a declaration that they should. In a leap-frog appeal this House allowed the appeal and held that they should not. There was no attention paid, either in the arguments of counsel or in the opinion delivered by Lord Templeman, concurred in by the other members of the Appellate Committee, to the propriety of the procedure that had been adopted. Nor, in my opinion, need there have been, for the sole issue in the case was the legal effect of the conveyancing transactions which were said to have deprived the parcels of land of their character as common land.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would accept that if there is an issue of law that needs to be decided before a decision can be made on a registration, or deregistration, application, the registration authority can refer the issue of law to the court for a ruling. And the court may, if in its discretion it thinks it right to do so, make a declaration accordingly. But the propriety of a registration authority asking the court to give a ruling on an issue of law in which it has no interest as registration authority or in any commercial respect and that does not need to be decided in order for a decision to be reached on a pending registration, or deregistration, application seems to me to be highly dubious. Each of the first five of the declaratory rulings sought by the County Council in the present case raises an issue of substantive law. The propriety of the County Council asking the court to give these rulings depends, in my opinion, on the rulings being necessary for a decision to be taken by the County Council on Miss Robinson's registration application. The rulings sought by paragraphs (i) and (ii) cannot, in my opinion, pass this test. (At the end of para 35 above Lord Hoffmann has explained the circumstances in which those rulings came to be added to the County Council's original list.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98.&nbsp;&nbsp;The criteria for registration of land as a class (c) town or village green, as set out in the 1965 Act in its original form and as amended, direct attention to the user of the land. The criteria do not require any investigation into what rights of user the inhabitants of the relevant neighbourhood or locality will have after registration. There is no present issue regarding the post-registration rights and such future issue as may arise, if and when registration takes place, will be an issue between the relevant inhabitants, of whom Miss Robinson will be one, and the City Council. The County Council would not be a necessary party to litigation instituted to resolve the issue.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99.&nbsp;&nbsp;The same point applies, even more strongly, to the ruling sought by paragraph (ii). Whether the Victorian statutes, to which I have already referred, apply to a class (c) town or village green has no conceivable relevance to the registration issue. It was, in my respectful opinion, impermissible for the County Council to ask the court to give what is, in effect, an advisory opinion on an issue that has not yet arisen and, if and when it does arise, will not concern the County Council in its registration authority role or in any other capacity.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100.&nbsp;&nbsp;The rulings sought in paragraphs (iii), (iv) and (v), on the other hand, do relate to issues of law that can be represented as necessary to be resolved on Miss Robinson's registration application.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101.&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraphs (vi), (vii) and (viii) relate to procedural issues that have arisen and that the County Council, as registration authority, needs to deal with before reaching a decision on the registration application.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102.&nbsp;&nbsp;As to paragraphs (ix) and (x), which seek the court's guidance as to how the County Council should deal with certain factual matters, it seems to me quite inappropriate for the County Council to seek, or for the court to give, "guidance" of this sort. The County Council, as registration authority, must make up its mind how to deal with the facts thrown up by Mr Chapman's report. They have a quasi-judicial role under the 1965 Act and must discharge it to the best of their ability. Trustees, if they do not know what to do, can ask the court to tell them or, alternatively, they can surrender their discretion to the court and ask the court to exercise it for them. The County Council's procedure in the present case in seeking the paragraphs (ix) and (x) guidance, and Lightman J's response, seem to me, if I may respectfully say so, to be assimilating the County Council's role as registration authority to that of trustees. I would, for my part, deprecate this.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reasons I have endeavoured to explain Lightman J should, in my opinion, have declined to entertain the County Council's requests made in paragraphs (i), (ii), (ix) and (x) and, for the same reasons, the Court of Appeal should, in my opinion, have set aside the declaratory relief granted by the judge under these paragraphs.  What should your Lordships now do?  My noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann has said, in paragraph 45 of his opinion, that because the City Council want to build houses on the Trap Grounds, or to sell the land for housing development purposes, they (the City Council) have "a real and immediate interest" in obtaining answers to the questions raised in paragraphs (i) and (ii), namely, whether registration of the Trap Grounds as a class c town or village green would create rights to enable the local inhabitants to use the land for lawful sports and pastimes and would subject the land to the various prohibitions imposed by the Victorian statutes on town and village greens.  My noble and learned friend has concluded that in these circumstances it would be a proper exercise of the House's discretion to entertain the request for rulings under paragraphs (i) and (ii).  Moreover Lightman J at first instance and Carnwath LJ in the Court of Appeal have supported their respective rulings with careful argument and the correctness of them has been debated before your Lordships.  My Lords, there seems to me, if I may respectfully say so, a good deal of force in the view that in these circumstances the House should give answers to the questions raised by these two paragraphs.  But, having regard to the cogent arguments put forward by my noble and learned friend Baroness Hale of Richmond, whose opinion I have had the advantage of reading in draft, and having regard also to the opinion of this House expressed by Lord Diplock in <i>Gouriet </i>[1978] AC 435, 501(cited in paragraph 93 above), the answers should be limited to those that are strictly necessary and that are not in any way dependent on facts not yet known or not in evidence.  On that footing I must now deal with the 10 paragraphs of relief sought under the County Council's re-amended Part 8 claim form.</p>

<i></i><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 10 Issues</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104.&nbsp;&nbsp;Issue (i).  Paragraph (i) asks whether the "relevant inhabitants had rights to indulge in lawful sports and pastimes on land which had become a class c town or village green".  The point of this question is that it has been contended that a class c registration simply settles the status of the land (see section 10 of the 1965 Act) and that the local inhabitants do not thereby obtain any rights of recreation over the land.  The obtaining of these rights, it was contended, was intended by Parliament when enacting the 1965 Act to await further legislation which would confer the requisite rights, legislation that is still being awaited.  If these contentions are right, the registration of the Trap Grounds as a class c town and village green would confer no rights on Miss Robinson and the other local inhabitants.  The development of the Trap Grounds for housing purposes would interfere with no rights that Miss Robinson and the others can claim.  My Lords I am in full agreement with what Lord Hoffmann has said about these contentions in paragraphs 47, 48 and 49 of his opinion.  I agree that the effect of registration under the 1965 Act of a class c town or village green is to confer on the local inhabitants rights of recreation over the land and I agree that a declaration so stating could, in the particular circumstances of this litigation, properly be made, or upheld, by your Lordships.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I do not agree that registration can authorise local inhabitants to enjoy recreative user of the land that is different in kind from the 20 years user that has satisfied the statutory criteria for registration or that would diminish the ability of the landowner to continue to use the land in the manner in which he has been able to use the land during that 20 year period.  I do not accept that a tolerant landowner who has allowed the local inhabitants to use his grass field for an annual 5 November bonfire for upwards of 20 years must, after registration, suffer his field to be used throughout the year for all or any lawful sports and pastimes with the consequential loss of any meaningful residual use that he could continue to make of the field.  I do not understand how anyone can suppose that that is what Parliament had in mind in 1965.  And if registration of land as a class c town and village green were to bring about a diminution of the landowner's property rights, not simply by establishing the local inhabitants' right to go on doing what they had been doing for the last 20 years but by depriving the landowner of the right to go on doing what he had been doing for the last 20 years, there would, in my opinion, be a very real question as to the compatibility of such a legal regime with the landowner's rights under article 1 of the First Protocol to the Convention.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106.&nbsp;&nbsp;While, therefore, I agree with Lord Hoffmann that registration of the Trap Grounds as a class c town or village green would entitle the local inhabitants to recreative rights of user over it, those rights would, in my opinion, be commensurate with the nature of the user that had led to that result and would not necessarily extend to the right to use the land for all or any lawful sports or pastimes.  For instance, clay pigeon shooting is a popular lawful sport or pastime.  Would clay pigeon shooting be permissible on the Trap Grounds if registration took place?  It presumably would be if clay pigeon shooting had taken place reasonably regularly over the 20 year period.  Or what about archery contests?  Those walking their dogs would have to be warned to keep out of the way.  In my opinion any sort of declaration that went beyond the very limited form of declaration to which I have referred at the end of paragraph 104 above would be a misuse of the discretionary power to give declaratory relief.  It would not settle any current issue.  If, after registration, some recreative activity were to take place on the land to which the City Council or some local inhabitants objected, there would be an issue for decision and a declaration settling the issue could be made.  These proceedings are not the proper occasion for settling issues that have not yet arisen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107.&nbsp;&nbsp;Issue (ii).  Paragraph (ii) asks whether land which has become a class c town or village green falls within the scope of section 12 of the Inclosure Act 1857 and section 29 of the Commons Act 1876.  The answer depends on which approach to construction of section 22(1) is right.  If the approach I have advocated were to be accepted, the meaning of "town or village green" in those Acts would be no different from the meaning of "town or village green" in the 1965 Act.  The only difference would be the additional, class c, means by which land might become a town or village green.  In that case a class c green would, in my opinion, fall within the scope of the two sections.  But, since a majority of your Lordships favour the literal construction of section 22(1), land is capable of becoming registered as a town or village green notwithstanding that it is not land to which either of the two sections has been or would have been at any time applied eg arable land over which customary recreative rights are enjoyed or the rocks at Llanbadrig, Ynys Mon, to which local inhabitants moor their boats (see Lord Hoffmann's opinion, paragraph 39).  An "always speaking" approach to the construction of statutory provisions is only permissible if there can be a reasonable certainty that the legislative intendment underlying the statutory provision would envelop the new situation that had developed (see <i>Victor Chandler International Ltd v Customs &amp; Excise Comrs </i> [2000]  1 WLR 1296, 1304, para 32).  How can that certainty be present in relation to class c if the literal approach to construction is adopted?  An arable field may become a town or village green and ploughing of the field by the landowner would then be barred by section 29 of the 1876 Act.  The manuring of the field, too, would be barred by section 12 of the 1857 Act.  The notion that this would have intended by the legislature cannot, I respectfully suggest, be maintained.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108.&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the propriety of your Lordships making a declaration on this issue, a declaration that the Trap Grounds would, on registration, become subject to the two Victorian statutes will not settle the question whether the City Council's housing development intentions for the land will be frustrated.  That question will not be answered until the scope of a local authority's statutory powers to appropriate open space land to housing purposes and its ability then to sell the land for housing development free from town or village green restraints has been judicially determined.  That being so, I can see no good reason why the House should, in relation to issue (ii), depart from the practice endorsed and recommended by Lord Diplock in <i>Gouriet </i>[1978] AC 435, 501<i>.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109.&nbsp;&nbsp;Issue (iii).  Paragraph (iii) seeks a ruling as to the meaning to be attributed to the words "continue to do so" in section 22 of the 1965 Act, as amended.  This issue is addressed by Lord Hoffmann in paragraph 44 of his opinion with which, with one slight qualification, I am in complete agreement.  I agree that the amendment introduced by the 2000 Act does not require that the user of the land for sports and pastimes continues until registration and, I agree that, prima facie, the user must continue up to the date when the registration application is made. If, however, 20 years appropriate user having passed and while the user is still continuing the landowner bars the user, a more or less immediate application to register the land in response to the landowner's action would, in my opinion, suffice. But if the barring of the user were not responded to reasonably promptly, the continuance criterion introduced by the 2000 Act would not be able to be satisfied. My reason for this slight qualification is that an applicant for registration is quite likely, before making the application, to attempt to stir up neighbourhood support or to obtain suitable evidence from local inhabitants. The landowner is quite likely to hear of this and a race to see who could act first, the landowner in barring the use of the land or the applicant in making the application, would not be satisfactory. The requirement of continuance needs, I think, to be approached in a commonsense fashion. Has the previous public user fallen into disuse is, in my opinion, the right question to be asked.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110.&nbsp;&nbsp;Issues (iv) and (v).  I agree with Lord Hoffmann for the reasons he has given in paragraph 43 of his opinion that the amended section 22 applies to all registration applications made after the 2000 Act came into effect and that the land in question becomes a town or village green on registration</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111.&nbsp;&nbsp;Issues (vi), (vii) and (viii).  These questions are dealt with by Lord Hoffmann in paragraphs 59, 60 and 61 of his opinion and I am in entire agreement with his answers to the questions raised and his reasons for them. I would like, particularly, to emphasise my agreement that a registration authority should be guided by the general principle of being fair to those whose interests may be affected by its decision.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112.&nbsp;&nbsp;And, finally, there is the guidance sought by issues (ix) and (x) in relation to the factual matters referred to. I would, for my part, for the reasons I have given, prefer to express no view at all on these factual matters. It is for the County Council to weigh the evidence, consider whether it satisfies the criteria for registration of the Trap Grounds as a town or village green prescribed by section 22(1) of the 1965 Act, correctly construed, and come to a decision accordingly. If the City Council or Miss Robinson wish to challenge the decision on any points of law, they may then do so.</p>

<i><p><i></i></p>

<p><i>Disposal</i></p>

</i>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reasons I have given:</p>

<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;On issue (i) I would allow Miss Robinson's appeal against the ruling of the Court of Appeal but set aside the declaration of Lightman J and make the limited declaration referred to in paragraph 104 above.</p>

<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;On issue (ii) I would allow the City Council's appeal against the ruling of Lightman J, concurred in by the Court of Appeal, and decline to answer the question posed.</p>

<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;On issue (iii) I would allow Miss Robinson's appeal against the ruling of the Court of Appeal and restore Lightman J's declaration but with the addition to the declaration of the words "and so that if an application is made or legal proceedings are commenced reasonably promptly after and in response to action taken by the landowner or others to obstruct the continued indulgence as of right by the relevant inhabitants in lawful sports and pastimes, the said indulgence shall be taken to have continued to the date of the application or the commencement of the legal proceedings".</p>

<p>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;On issues (iv) and (v) I would dismiss Miss Robinson's appeal against the Court of Appeal's ruling (allowing the City Council's appeal against Lightman J's ruling on these issues).</p>

<p>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;On issues (vi), (vii) and (viii) I would dismiss the County Council's appeal.</p>

<p>(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not answer issues (ix) and (x) and would set aside the "guidance" declarations made by Lightman J.</p>

<p><b>LORD RODGER OF EARLSFERRY</b></p>

<p>My Lords,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the advantage of considering the speeches of my noble and learned friends in draft.  For the reasons Lord Hoffmann gives, I would dispose of the appeal as he proposes.  I also have sympathy with the reservations about the nature of the relief sought which my noble and learned friends, Lord Scott of Foscote and Baroness Hale, have expressed, but, like Lord Hoffmann, I would answer questions (i) and (ii).  I simply wish to add a short comment on one particular aspect of the case.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before doing so, I should confess that, like Lord Walker, my feeling at the end of the hearing of the appeal was that it would be desirable, if reasonably possible, to interpret the definition of "town or village green" in section 22 of the Commons Registration Act 1965 ("section 22") in a manner that would confine its application in the case of village greens to areas which were, more recognisably, the kinds of area which readily come to mind when the expression is used - in other words to "traditional" village greens.  But the terms of the definition in section 22 present a formidable obstacle to such an approach, an obstacle which it would be legitimate to surmount only if the House could be satisfied that it was necessary to do so in order to give effect to the intention of Parliament.  Despite Lord Scott's arguments, having studied the speech of Lord Hoffmann, I cannot actually be sure that Parliament intended the provision to have this narrower scope.  Moreover, the potentially wide implications of the definition became apparent, at the latest, in the decision of the House in <i>R v Oxfordshire County Council, Ex p</i> <i>Sunningwell Parish Council </i>[2000] 1 AC 335 in June 1999.  It is striking that, when subsequently amending the definition by enacting section 98 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 ("section 98"), Parliament did not use the opportunity to restrict its scope in this way.  At present there is a Bill before Parliament dealing with some of the same subject matter.  Again, it contains no measure to narrow the definition in section 22 so as to limit it to more "traditional" village greens.  But if, having taken account of your Lordships' speeches in the present appeal, Parliament wished to change the definition in this way, a suitable amendment could doubtless be introduced.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, for the reasons given by Lord Hoffmann, I am satisfied that an area does not become a village green unless and until it is registered.  It follows that I would reject Mr Edwards' submission that, before section 22 was amended by section 98, an area of ground on which the inhabitants of a locality had indulged in sports and pastimes as of right for 20 years or more had ipso facto become a village green.  The position was, rather, that once that period had elapsed it was open to an interested party to apply to have the register of town and village greens amended to include an entry for the area in question.  The applicant would not have needed to show that the inhabitants were continuing to indulge in the sports and pastimes when the application was made.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 98 came into force on 30 January 2001, two months after the 2000 Act received the royal assent:  section 103(2).  As the House now holds, under the amended version of section 22, anyone applying to have the register amended had to show either (a) that the inhabitants continued to indulge in the sports and pastimes at the date of his application or (b) that they had ceased to do so for not more than a prescribed period.  Since no period has ever been prescribed for the purposes of para (b), the operative paragraph is (a).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118.&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Robinson lodged her application after 30 January 2001 but on the basis that the area had become a village green in 1990.  Her counsel, Mr Edwards, contended, however, that the amendment to section 22 did not apply "retrospectively" and so, where the period of 20 years had been completed before section 22 was amended, an applicant still did not need to prove that the inhabitants were continuing to indulge in the sports and pastimes at the date of the application.  An applicant such as Miss Robinson could rely on section 22 in its unamended form.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the issue was presented as one of the retrospective effect of section 98 of the 2000 Act, that is to ignore its true nature.  I refer to, without repeating, the lengthy observations on this topic in my speech in <i>Wilson v First County Trust Ltd (No 2) </i>[2004] 1 AC 816.  Put shortly, there is nothing in the 2000 Act to rebut the powerful presumption that section 98 ought not to be understood as affecting the substantive law in relation to events taking place before it came into force:  <i>Wainwright v Home Office </i>[2002] QB 1334, 1345, para 27 per Lord Woolf CJ.  In any event, despite the language he used, that was not really the point Mr Edwards was making.  The true question raised by his submission is whether section 98 applied generally or applied only to situations which arose after it came into force, with the result that the unamended version of section 22 continued to apply to other cases.  If section 98 applied generally, then the amended version of section 22 applied, for the future, to situations which were already underway when it came into force.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120.&nbsp;&nbsp;In effect, Mr Edwards was arguing that section 98 did not apply generally but applied only to situations where the relevant activities of the inhabitants occurred after 30 January 2001.  Accordingly, for an indefinite period of decades or more into the future, in making an application based on activities before that date, an interested party could rely on the unamended version of section 22.  Down all those decades, as he accepted, two different systems would operate in parallel, one which required the applicant to prove the continuation of the sports and pastimes and one which did not.  I would reject the submission.</p>
