<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85.&nbsp;&nbsp;It might have been better if the newspaper had delayed publication to give Mr Jameel an opportunity to comment in person.  But I do not think that their failure to do so is enough to deprive them of the defence that they were reporting on a matter of public interest.</p>
<i>Diplomatic relations
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86.&nbsp;&nbsp;The article, it will be recalled, said that "the US had agreed not to publish the names of Saudi institutions and individuals provided that Saudi authorities took appropriate action".  The judge rejected the newspaper's defence on the additional ground that it could not be in the public interest for the Wall Street Journal to publish information which the US government had agreed not to publish. In principle, I would be very reluctant to accept the proposition that it cannot be in the public interest for a newspaper to publish information which one's government had agreed not to publish.  But in any case, the position of the Wall Street Journal was that they had no wish to publish anything which might be damaging to the diplomatic interests of the United States or its attempts to secure Saudi co-operation in tracing terrorist funds. If the Treasury had indicated that the information should not be published, they probably would not have done so.  But the Treasury cleared the article and that was good enough for them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal rejected this argument on the ground that the judge had not been convinced that the Treasury was content that the information should be released. There seems to me, however, no ground on which the judge could reject Mr Simpson's evidence on this point.  If he was to be disbelieved, that should have been left to the jury.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disposal</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion there was no basis for rejecting the newspaper's <i>Reynolds</i> defence.  For the reasons I have given, no weight can be attached to the jury's rejection of the confirmation by sources in Saudi Arabia and they were asked no question about the confirmation in Washington.  The failure to delay publication and the effect on diplomatic relations are insufficient reasons. The question is then whether the case should be remitted for a new trial or whether the appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89.&nbsp;&nbsp;A new trial would in effect be to allow the jury to answer the question to which Mr Price objected, namely, whether Mr Simpson was telling the truth when he said that he had received confirmation in Washington. If this question had been answered in the newspaper's favour, it would have been bound to succeed.  Indeed, such an answer, and a correction of the misdirection on the presumption of innocence, would be likely also to have affected the jury's answers to the questions on confirmation in Saudi Arabia.  But Mr Simpson's evidence was, as I have said, essentially uncontradicted.  I think that it is now too late for the claimants to change their minds and have the question of his veracity put to the jury.  I would therefore allow the appeal and dismiss the action.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proof of damage</p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90.&nbsp;&nbsp;That leaves one point which was argued but in the event does not arise.  Mr Robertson submitted that a commercial company like the second claimant should not be able to sue for libel unless it can prove special damage.  That would involve overruling the contrary decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>South Hetton Coal Company Ltd v North Eastern News Association Ltd</i> [1894]  1 QB 133 and the statement of the law by Lord Keith of Kinkel in <i>Derbyshire County Council v Times Newspapers Ltd</i> [1993] AC 534, 547. For my part, I would accept Mr Robertson's submission but as I understand that a majority of your Lordships would reject it and I agree on this point with the opinion of my noble and learned friend Baroness Hale of Richmond, I shall not detain your Lordships long with my own reasons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of an individual, his reputation is a part of his personality, the "immortal part" of himself and it is right that he should be entitled to vindicate his reputation and receive compensation for a slur upon it without proof of financial loss.  But a commercial company has no soul and its reputation is no more than a commercial asset, something attached to its trading name which brings in customers. I see no reason why the rule which requires proof of damage to commercial assets in other torts, such as malicious falsehood, should not also apply to defamation. </p>
<p><b>LORD HOPE OF CRAIGHEAD</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the advantage of reading in draft the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill.  I agree with it, and for all the reasons that he gives I too would allow the appeal and set aside the order of the trial judge.  I wish to add only a few observations of my own.</p>
<i><p><i>Damage</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93.&nbsp;&nbsp;This issue has been referred to as "the presumption of damage" issue.  But to describe the award of damages for libel as based on a presumption is not wholly accurate.  The question in every case of libel is whether the statement complained of would tend to bring the claimant into contempt, hatred or ridicule, or to injure his character: <i>South Hetton Coal Company Ltd v North-Eastern News Association Ltd</i> [1894] 1 QB 133, 138, per Lord Esher MR. This is a question of fact.  It is the injury to the claimant's feelings or to his reputation that makes the false statement libellous.  The award flows from the fact that, in the case of an individual, an injury to feelings or to reputation will always sound in damages.  In the same case, at p 145, Kay LJ said one of the differences between libel and slander is that in an action for libel, generally speaking, damage is presumed and that special damage need not be proved or alleged.  But it is the fact that the statement was calculated to injure the claimant in his character or reputation that makes the action maintainable.  Proof that he has a reputation that is capable of being injured in this way is an essential element.  In the case of an individual it can be presumed that he has a reputation of that kind.  In all other cases this is something that must be proved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Robertson QC for the respondents invited the House to depart from the decision in <i>South Hetton</i> that proof of special damage is not needed in the case of a trading company.  It was on the decision in that case that in <i>Derbyshire County Council v Times Newspapers Ltd</i> [1993] AC 534, 547B-C Lord Keith of Kinkel based his observation that a trading corporation is entitled to sue in respect of defamatory matters which can be seen as having a tendency to damage it in the way of its business.  In <i>South Hetton</i> the libel complained of fell within this description as it was an attack on the business reputation of the company. But Mr Robertson's submission was that a trading company must always prove special damage.  If that submission is sound, it must follow that an action for libel will never lie at the instance of a trading company unless it is in a position to assert and prove that as a result of the statement complained of it has sustained special damage.  It will no longer be enough for the company to prove that, in the words of Kay LJ in <i>South Hetton </i>at p 145, it has a trading character which may be ruined or destroyed by a libel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obvious, of course, that a trading company has no feelings which are capable of being injured.  Trade is its business, and it is injury to its reputation in regard to its trade that is of the essence in its case.  Lord Reid's comment in <i>Lewis v Daily Telegraph</i> [1964] AC 234, 262 that it can only be injured in its pocket captures the way in which the principle of the law of libel applies in its case.  This does not mean, however, that it can only be injured in a way that gives rise to loss which, because it can be calculated, has the character of special damage.  What it means is that it must show that it is liable to be damaged in a way that affects its business as a trading company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96.&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle works in the same way in the case of a non-profit organisation such as a charity.  In its case it is not only its pocket, due to a loss of income, that is liable to be injured.  Injury to its reputation in the eyes of those with whom it must deal to achieve its charitable objects may be just as damaging to the purpose for which it exists.  The principle works in the same way too in the case of other bodies, such as trade unions or other organisations which exist not to trade but to deal with others in the interests of their members or those they represent.  Proof that the body has a reputation that has a tendency to be damaged is an essential element in the claim that the false statement was libellous.  As the law stands nothing more need be proved to entitle it to damages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not impossible to imagine cases where a trading company could show that it had sustained financial loss of a kind that would entitle it to an award of special damages.  But in <i>South Hetton</i> at pp 145-146 Kay LJ said that if such a proof were necessary in order to lay a foundation for the action it would in many cases put the plaintiff in a position of much difficulty.  The Report of the Faulks Committee on Defamation 1975 (Cmnd 5909), p 90, para 336 also recognised that it was very difficult for a plaintiff, whether corporate or personal, to prove actual financial damage specifically flowing from a defamation.  It recommended, at para 342, that a trading corporation should have to establish that it had suffered special damage or that the words used were likely to cause it pecuniary damage.  This recommendation was not adopted by Parliament.  Nevertheless Mr Robertson now invites your Lordships to go further and hold that proof of special damage is an essential requirement in every case where a trading company seeks to establish a cause of action for libel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that such a change in the law is either necessary or desirable.  The argument that the change is necessary because the law is incompatible with article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights is not sustainable.  This is demonstrated by the way the European Court dealt with the question in <i>Steel and Morris v United Kingdom</i> (2005) 41 EHRR 403.  In that case, after a very long trial during the bulk of which they had represented themselves, the applicants were found liable in damages to McDonalds, a very large multi-national company.  The Court said at p 435, para 97, that the award was disproportionate to the legitimate aim served by it.  But it took a different view on the question whether the interference with the applicants' rights to freedom of expression which the English law of defamation prescribes in its pursuit of the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation or rights of others was necessary in a democratic society.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having noted that large public companies knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny and that the limits of acceptable criticism are wider in their case, the Court said at p 435, para 94:</p>
<p></p><ul>"However, in addition to the public interest in open debate about business practices, there is a competing interest in protecting the commercial success and viability of companies, for the benefit of shareholders and employees, but also for the wider economic good.  The state therefore enjoys a margin of appreciation as to the means it provides under domestic law to enable a company to challenge the truth, and limit the damage, of allegations which risk harming its reputation."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The European Court, then, leaves it to domestic law to determine how the balance is to be struck between these two competing objectives.  In <i>Castells v Spain</i> (1992) 14 EHRR 445, 476, para 43 it reminded us that the pre-eminent role of the press in a state governed by the rule of law must never be forgotten.  But the change in the law for which Mr Robertson contends would apply to every case where a trading company wishes to bring an action for libel.  He did not suggest that there should be one law for the press and another law for everyone else in this respect.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100.&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the question whether the change in the law which Mr Robertson has urged on us would be desirable, I would make the following points.  First, as Lord Esher MR recognised in <i>South Hetton</i> at p 138, the law of libel is one and the same to all plaintiffs.  As he put it, it is the same by whomsoever the action is brought - whether by a person, a firm or a company.  To the examples on his list I would add the other bodies that Lord Keith referred to in <i>Derbyshire </i>at p 547D-E, such as trade unions and charities.  It would not be satisfactory to single out trading companies for special treatment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Robertson did not attempt to argue that the other bodies referred to by Lord Keith such as trade unions or charities, or any other business organisations apart from companies, should be treated in the same way.  This feature of his argument shows that it is not soundly based in principle.  In the case of those other bodies damages are at large, as Lord Esher put it at p 139.  This is because false statements which reflect on the way they conduct themselves affect the reputation on which they rely to perform their objects.  In that respect they are no different from trading companies.  In their case too reputation is something that in itself has a value which the current state of the law enables them to protect. What the law does not require them to do is to place a financial value on that reputation or to show, with the precision that this would require, that damage to it is likely to result in financial or pecuniary damage. There is no good reason why trading companies should be treated differently from the rest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102.&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is the difficulty that trading companies would be likely to encounter in proving that a defamatory statement has resulted, or will result, in special damages.  This point goes to the root of the matter.  As the European Court recognised in <i>Steel and Morris v United Kingdom</i> (2005) 41 EHRR 403, 435 para 94, one of the main functions which the right of action for libel seeks to serve is to enable the claimant to challenge the truth, and limit the damage, of allegations which risk harming its reputation.  It is to enable it to nail the lie, as it was put in argument.  A requirement that special damage had to be proved in every case would deprive the trading company of that opportunity.  It would have to wait until it was in a position to show that some damage had actually been done to its business which was capable of being proved.  In its case proof of a risk of harm to its reputation - of a tendency to damage it in the way if its business, as Lord Keith put it in <i>Derbyshire </i>at p 547B-C - would not be enough.  The effect would be to undermine the right of action and to leave trading companies whose reputation was put at risk without a means of averting the damage that might result from the libel.  This could be incalculable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103.&nbsp;&nbsp;At various points in his argument Mr Robertson referred to companies, or corporations, more generally - suggesting, as I understood him, that the change in the law should be extended to non-trading as well as to trading companies.  But a non-trading company would be likely to find it even more difficult to claim and prove special damage.  If the fact that it had a reputation which had a tendency to be damaged was not a sufficient basis for a right of action for libel, it would be likely to be left without a remedy.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons I consider that the proposition that an action of libel will lie at the suit of a trading company without proof of special damage as stated in<i> South Hetton Coal Company Ltd v North-Eastern News Association Ltd</i> [1894] 1 QB 133 remains sound law and that it ought not to be departed from.</p>
<i><p><i>Reynolds privilege</i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105.&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to emphasise at the outset that the only question on which there was a difference of view in the House in <i>Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd</i> [2001] 2 AC 127 on any matter of substance was whether the issues of justification and qualified privilege should be reconsidered at a new trial: see Lord Steyn at pp 216D-217A and my own speech at p 237F-G.   It has sometimes been suggested that <i>Reynolds </i>was a majority decision.  But the primary question raised by the case was whether there should be a new category of privileged subject matter - a generic qualified privilege of political speech, as Lord Steyn called it at p 209C-D.  On that question the House was unanimous.  Everyone accepted that the duty-interest test was an essential element in the structure of the law of qualified privilege.  There was no dissent from the analysis by Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead of the way in which the common law test should be adapted so as to strike a balance between the role of the media and the restrictions that are necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the reputation of the individual.  Nor was there any dissent from his observation at p 202E-F that the common law does not seek to set a higher standard than that of responsible journalism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Robertson submitted that the standard of responsible journalism provided an insufficiently precise test.  It was rejected by the trial judge, Eady J, who said at para 17 that the primary question was whether the particular circumstances gave rise to a duty to publish.  The Court of Appeal agreed with him that the phrase "responsible journalism" was insufficiently precise to constitute the sole test for <i>Reynolds </i>privilege: [2005] QB 904, para 87.  Mr Robertson said that a new test should be substituted.  This was whether what had been published was the product of high quality journalism of demonstrable value to the public.  If met, it would be defeated only by proof either of malice or of negligence.  In effect he was suggesting that journalists should be subjected to a higher, and certainly more elaborate, standard than that which Lord Nicholls has identified.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any test which seeks to set a general standard which must be achieved by all journalists is bound to involve a degree of uncertainty, as Lord Nicholls recognised in <i>Reynolds </i>at p 202D-E.  But, like him, I think that the extent of this uncertainty ought not to be exaggerated.  "Responsible journalism" is a standard which everyone in the media and elsewhere can recognise.  The duty-interest test based on the public's right to know, which lies at the heart of the matter, maintains the essential element of objectivity.  Was there an interest or duty to publish the information and a corresponding interest or duty to receive it, having regard to its particular subject matter?  This provides the context within which, in any given case, the issue will be assessed.  Context is important too when the standard is applied to each piece of information that the journalist wishes to publish.  The question whether it has been satisfied will be assessed by looking to the story as a whole, not to each piece of information separated from its context.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108.&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was examining the nature of privilege as shown by the cases in <i>Reynolds </i>Lord Nicholls said at p 195E-F that whether the public interest requires that publication to the world at large should be privileged depends on an evaluation of the particular information in the circumstances of its publication.  He then said that through the cases runs the strain that, when determining whether the public at large had a right to know the particular information, the court has regard to all the circumstances.  I do not believe that he was intending by those remarks to indicate that the public's right to know each piece of information in any given article should be assessed, piece by piece, without regard to the whole context.  On the contrary, each piece of information will take its colour and its informative value from the context in which it is placed.  A piece of information that, taken on its own, would be gratuitous can change its character entirely when its place in the article read as a whole is evaluated.   The standard of responsible journalism respects the fact that it is the article as a whole that the journalist presents to the public.  Weight will be given to the judgment of the editor in making the assessment, as it is the article as a whole that provides the context within which he performs his function as editor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would reject Mr Robertson's argument that a higher test is needed to distinguish between those stories that are in need of protection and those that are not.  The cardinal principle that must be observed is that any incursion into press freedom that the law lays down should go no further than is necessary to hold the balance between the right to freedom of expression and the need to protect the reputation of the individual.  It must not be excessive or disproportionate.  Mr Robertson's test which introduces the criterion of "high quality journalism", especially if it is applied to each particular piece of information that is published, would contravene that principle.  But he does not need to have the benefit of a higher standard to succeed in this appeal.</p>
<i><p><i>Conclusion</i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Lord Bingham, I have been troubled by the fact that the information about Mr Dorsey's sources is incomplete.  His evidence as noted by Eady J, para 11, was that it would not have been possible, responsibly, to publish the story on the basis of A's information alone.  This led to the judge's comment in para 13 that in the light of the jury's verdict, as A was only a lead and not a primary source, the four corners of the respondents' case on sources had been knocked away.  The jury's verdict on the other sources is tainted by a misdirection, so that conclusion cannot stand.  But we cannot assume that the other sources were proved.  Nor are we in a position to examine all the other evidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the question whether publication of the respondents' names was privileged has to be judged in the context of the article read as a whole.  Taken overall it has all the hallmarks of responsible journalism.  Its subject matter was of considerable interest to the public in general, and to readers of the Wall Street Journal Europe in particular.  It did not seek to sensationalise or to exaggerate.  The truth and accuracy of the references to the other Saudi institutions and individuals have not been challenged.  Nor have Mr Dorsey's experience and qualifications as a specialist reporter or of the senior staff who approved his article been called into question.  It was said that the publication of these names was needed to show how seriously the issue was being taken by the Saudi authorities as they were monitoring the leading, most prominent businessmen in the country.  The editorial judgment that the respondents' names should be included, with the comment that the Group could not be reached for comment, is not conclusive.  But much weight must be given to it, in light of the thrust of the whole article of which that particular information forms part.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112.&nbsp;&nbsp;On balance I am persuaded that no advantage would be gained by sending the case back for further consideration of the evidence.  There is a sufficient basis in the information which we have and which my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann has so carefully analysed for a finding that the appellants are entitled to claim that publication of the respondents' names was protected by qualified privilege. </p>
<p><b>LORD SCOTT OF FOSCOTE</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<i><p>Introduction</p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113.&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts which have given rise to these defamation proceedings have been fully set out by my noble and learned friends Lord Bingham of Cornhill (paras 2, 3, 4 and 6 of his opinion) and Lord Hoffmann (paras 39 to 42 of his opinion).  To avoid tedious and unnecessary repetition I propose to refer only to the essential background necessary to explain the conclusions I have come to on the issues before the House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114.&nbsp;&nbsp;On 11 September 2001 there occurred the horror of the destruction of the Twin Towers in New York, the attack on the Pentagon and the frustration (brought about by the bravery of some of the passengers on the fourth hijacked airliner) of the planned attack on the White House.  The loss of lives was huge.  The shock to and sense of outrage felt by the citizens of the United States, shared vicariously by most of the citizens of most of the countries of the world, was immeasurable.  The international repercussions of that shock and outrage were immediate, and are continuing and of a duration that none of us can foretell.  Investigations soon revealed that most of the hijackers who had seized control of the four airliners came from or had a connection with Saudi Arabia.  There was natural speculation about the sources of the finance that must have been available to those who had planned the 11 September atrocities.  Resolution 1373 passed by the Security Council required all states to prevent and suppress the financing of terrorist acts and the co-operation of the Saudi Arabian government and its central bank, SAMA, was sought by the US authorities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have mentioned these background matters (referred to also, and more fully, in para 39 of Lord Hoffmann's opinion) for the purpose of underlining the high degree of public interest, not only in the United States but also in this country and many other countries, in information indicating whether or to what extent the authorities in Saudi Arabia were taking steps to comply with Resolution 1373.  Saudi Arabia is not a democracy and, so far as I am aware, does not aspire to become one.  It is ruled by the sons and grandsons of Abdul Aziz ibn Saud.  An institution such as the central bank, SAMA, cannot be taken to be independent of government control.  And it would be foolish to suppose that either the Saudi government or SAMA would feel any obligation to be forthcoming with information to investigative journalists wishing to discover what steps were being taken to monitor bank accounts of Saudi individuals and companies with a view to identifying transfers of funds that might be going to terrorist organisations.  It has to be borne in mind, also, that the dominant religion in Saudi Arabia is Wahabiism, a fundamentalist version of Islam, and that the Saudi Arabian rulers preside over a population that is not uniformly sympathetic to the United States and western culture.  To the extent that Saudi Arabia may have been co-operating with the United States in trying to identify the sources of funding for terrorism by authorising, at the request of the US, the monitoring of bank accounts of particular individuals or companies, it is not necessarily to be expected that the Saudi authorities would publicly acknowledge that this was happening.</p>
