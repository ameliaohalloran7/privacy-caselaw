<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96.&nbsp;&nbsp;The basis for this argument is that the European Court, having in paragraph 36 of its judgment determined that the 'date of a transfer' in article 3(1) of Directive 77/187 must be understood as referring to the date on which responsibility as employer for carrying on the business of the unit in question moves from the transferor to the transferee", went on in paragraphs 37 and 38 to state that, where there is a transfer of an undertaking, "contracts of employment or employment relationships existing on the date of the transfer ….. between the transferor and the workers assigned to the undertaking transferred are automatically transferred from the transferor to the transferee by the mere fact of the transfer of the undertaking (see <i>d'Urso</i> (Case C-362/89); [1991] ECR I-4105], paragraph 20 and case <i>Rotsart de Hertaing</i> (C-305/94) [1997] ECR I-5927, paragraph 18)" - "with the sole reservation, as regards the workers themselves, that, following a decision freely taken by them, they are at liberty, after the transfer, not to continue the employment relationship with the new employer (see case 105/84 <i>Danmol Inventar </i>[1985] ECR 2639, paragraph 16, and <i>d'Urso</i>, cited above, paragraph 11)".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97.&nbsp;&nbsp;Relying on this passage, the respondents wish to submit that, whatever they thought or said from September 1990 until the European Court's judgment on 26 May 2005, there was in September 1990 an automatic transfer of their employment relationship. This occurred because, they say, they were not offered any employment relationship with Celtec and because, on their reading of the European Court's words, such an offer must be regarded as an essential pre-requisite to or element of any "decision freely taken …. not to continue the employment relationship with the new employer". The appellant resists the grant of leave to advance any such submission as well as challenging its basis and substance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98.&nbsp;&nbsp;I make some preliminary observations. First, the European Court was not purporting to make new law, but based itself, as appears from its own paragraphs 37-38, on its previous decisions. The respondents thus concede "with hindsight" that they should have argued at previous instances in this case that there was continuity of employment throughout, even if transfer of the undertaking occurred at a single point in time in 1990. That they should have done is highlighted by the course of the submissions in the Court of Appeal when Mr Bowers QC for the appellant explained that on the appellant's case there had been no automatic transfer of the employment relationship in September 1990, because the respondents had freely opted to remain civil servants with the Department by volunteering for secondment (cf the judgment of Schiemann LJ at paragraph 20). This elicited no contrary argument (late though any would have been even at that stage) from the respondents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99.&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the circumstances in which the respondents came to be seconded to, rather than employed by, Celtec have not been investigated or adjudicated upon at any previous instance in this case. Third, if the respondents became (unwittingly) employees of Celtec in September 1990 (so that their continuity of employment continued in 1993, which is when they <i>thought</i> that they were choosing to become Celtec's employees), the larger number of other Department of Employment employees who thought in 1990 that they were choosing to remain civil servants and volunteering to be seconded to Celtec or another training and enterprise council ("TEC") must in law have ceased to be civil servants in September 1990; and their continuity of employment was broken in 1993, when, on this analysis, they chose to revert to being civil servants independently on any view of the transfer of any undertaking. A decision favourable to the respondents in this case might thus, in another case, prove unfavourable to a body of employees who thought that they had at all times maintained their employment status (in this case as civil servants) with their former employers. Fourth, I do not consider that the analysis adopted by my noble and learned friend, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, is open, not only because it was not argued before the House, but also because, if the respondents freely chose to remain civil servants and to volunteer for secondment in September 1990, that seems to me the end of the matter, and to preclude any possibility of a later transfer of their employment relationship in connection with the transfer of the relevant TEC which on the European Court's analysis took place, once and for all, in September 1990. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is substantial Employment Appeal Tribunal and Court of Appeal authority to the effect that, even in the Employment Appeal Tribunal, new points may only in exceptional circumstances be raised (cf the cases cited in <i>Leicestershire County Council v Unison </i> [2005] IRLR 920, paragraph 37). Quite apart from that, there is the authority of your Lordships' House in <i>North Staffordshire Railway Co v Edge </i>[1920] AC 254 that leave to advance a new point should be refused in this House, if there are any further matters of fact by reference to which there is "reasonable ground for supposing" that one party "might have been able to strengthen his case" (per Lord Birkenhead LC at p 263) or which "would affect the argument" (per Lord Dunedin at p 266) or which "could possibly and properly influence the judgment to be formed" (per Lord Buckmaster at p 270).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101.&nbsp;&nbsp;The present cases were however selected by the employment tribunal as lead cases and have been pursued not simply in the interests of these particular respondents, but to enable other former Department of Employment employees, who were on the face of it seconded to training enterprises from September 1990 to dates in or after 1992, to know their position. If leave is not given to raise the new point, other employees will have to bring fresh proceedings, and the three respondents to this appeal will also potentially suffer from allowing their names to be used. In these circumstances, if the new point raises no new factual matters for investigation (as the respondents submit), then I consider that the respondents should have leave to raise it. Even if the new point raises new factual matters, I think that the House can and should, exceptionally, be prepared to contemplate both allowing it to be raised, on appropriate terms as to costs, and if appropriate remitting the matter to the employment tribunal to investigate and make findings regarding the relevant facts. I would not accept Mr Bowers' submission that the facts must by now be so obscure that even this would be unfair to the appellant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102.&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the new point raise new factual matters? The respondents submit not. They point to paragraphs 45-46 in the opinion of Advocate General Poiares Maduro, addressing Celtec's submission that there was a single specific date of transfer in September 1990 (a submission that the Advocate General actually rejected, but the European Court accepted). The Advocate General said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"45&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, Celtec's interpretation results in the date of transfer being set at September 1990. It follows that the applicant employees could have claimed protection of the rights arising from their contracts of employment at that time. However, according to Celtec, the Department of Employment employees implicitly refused to allow their contracts of employment to be transferred. Their decision to agree to be seconded to the TECs whilst remaining Department of Employment employees must be taken as a refusal to transfer their contracts of employment to the TECs.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>46&nbsp;&nbsp;Such an analysis cannot be accepted, since Celtec acknowledged at the hearing that the Department of Employment employees had not been offered a contract of employment with the TECs in September 1990. In any event, to accept that employees can tacitly refuse to transfer their contracts of employment would run counter to the spirit of Directive 77/187, which instead provides for the automatic transfer of contracts of employment as the consequence of the transfer of an undertaking.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>47&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, were Celtec's interpretation of the date of transfer for the purposes of article 3(1) of Directive 77/187 to be accepted, the necessary conclusion would be that the Department of Employment employees' contracts of employment would be transferred to the TECs with effect from September 1990. More generally, that interpretation would require the automatic transfer of the contracts of employment on a single date, unless the employees had made clear their refusal."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103.&nbsp;&nbsp;The European Court did not expressly endorse these paragraphs, but instead identified the general principles which I have quoted in paragraph 96 above. The Advocate General focused on the question whether the respondents could be said to have "refused to allow their contracts of employment to be transferred", while the European Court spoke of "a decision freely taken" by employees "not to continue the employment relationship with the new employer". Mr Millar QC submits that neither test could be met when or if the respondents were not positively offered the opportunity of employment by Celtec in September 1990.  Mr Bowers QC submits that the circumstances in which the respondents volunteered for secondment to Celtec call for evidential investigation, and that no conclusions can on present material safely be reached as to the voluntariness of the respondents' apparent choice to continue to be employed by the Department of Employment and to be seconded to Celtec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would accept Mr Bowers' submission. As a preliminary point, I note that - whatever may have been said at the (doubtless very) short hearing before the European Court of Justice on a point which was not in issue before that court - it is not even certain that the respondents could not have been employed by Celtec if they had wanted. The unchallenged evidence of Mr Tabor (which was before the employment tribunal and is quoted in paragraph 25 of the Employment Appeal Tribunal's decision) was that:</p>
<p></p><ul>"8&nbsp;&nbsp;As private companies TECs were entitled to recruit their own staff and most, if not all, did so the day they became operational. The Department of Employment wished to assist TECs to become operationally effective as quickly as possible. As TECs were new organisations, and the work to be undertaken required an understanding of the government policy that contracts were designed to deliver, the Department, with the agreement of TECs, issued an invitation to staff in its area offices and elsewhere seeking volunteers for secondment to TECs. This invitation was initially for a three year period. …"<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105.&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I note that there were considerable potential advantages for employees in keeping civil service status - particularly in retaining their membership of the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme (Mr Tabor's statement, paragraph 9), which they could not retain if they became employees of Newtec (cf. article 3(3) of the Directive). The documentation before the House shows that civil service trade unions supported secondment and resisted the decision eventually taken to phase it out. Mr Bowers informed the House that, although no evidence had been called on this aspect because it was not then material, the appellant's case would be that the original arrangements for secondment were the outcome of a long period of discussion, with trade unions representing the interests of the Department's employees resisting any suggestion that such employees should lose their civil service status.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106.&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, Mr Bowers pointed out that there had been no investigation of the basis on which the respondents were engaged as civil servants. Civil servants are traditionally engaged on a mobile basis, "to serve wherever the Crown directs", in the language of the Industrial Tribunal in the early decision of <i>Moloney v Hampshire Training &amp; Enterprise Council Ltd </i>(Case No 9172/96) paragraph 40. On this basis, the Department had the right to deploy the respondents in any other appropriate situation, and it is clear that, if the respondents had not volunteered for secondment to a TEC in September 1990, the Department would have arranged to deploy them elsewhere. Further, those respondents who wished to maintain their civil service status when the arrangements for secondment were gradually ended in and after 1992 were also offered alternative situations by the Department.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, neither the Advocate General nor the European Court can have had the potential implications of the third point in mind, since it was not raised by the questions put to them, was not in issue and was not even mentioned, at least until brief reference must have been made to it during the oral submissions before the court. On the respondents' submission, the European Court must nonetheless be taken to have laid it down as an absolute and inflexible rule of European law that an employee of the transferor of an undertaking can never retain his or her employment status with the transferor or elect to be seconded to the transferee unless he or she has been offered and refused an employment relationship with the relevant transferee - even if the transferor would otherwise have had and exercised the right to deploy the employee in another situation. But the concern of the Directive is to protect employees and to preserve continuity of employment on the same terms. It is not to give employees rights which they would not otherwise have, in particular a right to work in a particular situation, if he or she did not previously have this. These general propositions are supported by the reasoning in the previous European Court authorities to which I refer in paragraphs 108-113 below, and I do not find in the reasoning of the present European Court decision anything which suggests a different purpose. If an employer is entitled to and would otherwise deploy an employee in another post which would preserve continuity of employment, I can no see no reason why the Directive should prevent the employer from inviting the employee and the employee from agreeing, as an alternative, to stay in the same post and work on a seconded basis with the transferee of the undertaking. The civil servant employee had no previous right or obligation to work in that undertaking. His secondment, if he accepts the invitation, is freely undertaken, in circumstances where he would otherwise be employed elsewhere in accordance with his employer's contractual entitlement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, since the precise scope and application of the exception to the principle of automatic transfer of employment relationships on the transfer of an undertaking was never in issue or argued before the European Court, I do not consider that the European Court's formulation of its "sole reservation" can or should be read as providing any axiomatic or definitive answer to it. Nothing in the underlying authorities, the effect of which the European Court said that it was simply restating, supports so rigid or formulaic an interpretation. Indeed, in <i>Foreningen af Arbejdsledere i Danmark v A/S Danmols Inventar </i>(Case 105/84) [1985] ECR 2639, there was no suggestion that the question whether Mr Mickelson ceased to have continuity as an employee depended on whether or not he was offered employment with the transferee company. Advocate General Slynn said that there would be no transfer of employment:</p>
<p></p><ul>"if an employee of one employer whose business is transferred genuinely and willingly agrees with that employer or the transferee of the business, that he will not be engaged under a contract of employment, or in an employment relationship with the transferee" (pp 2641-2)<p></p></ul>
<p>or, put another way, that the question was whether he had "genuinely agree[d] to accept a status with the transferee which is not that of an employee" under an agreement which was "genuine and not tainted by duress" (p.2642). These formulations would both embrace secondment by a transferor to a transferee. The European Court spoke of a case "where the employee in question terminates the employment contract or employment relationship of his own free will with effect from the date of the transfer, or where that contract or relationship is terminated with effect from the date of the transfer by virtue of an agreement voluntarily concluded between the worker and the transferor or the transferee of the undertaking" (paragraph 16).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109.&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is open to an employee who is not offered a contract of employment with the transferee to conclude a voluntary agreement for some different relationship with the transferor or transferee, no reason is apparent why it should be impossible for an employee, who is not offered such a contract and whose employment relationship with the transferor allows the transferor to deploy him or her otherwise than in the undertaking transferred, to conclude a voluntary agreement with the transferor that he will be seconded to the transferee. Civil servants were given the choice in September 1990 whether or not to be deployed elsewhere in the Department rather than to volunteer for secondment to a TEC. A civil servant who, without any offer of a contract of employment from a TEC, chose deployment elsewhere in the Department would not have his or her contract of employment transferred to the TEC.  The European Court's citation in paragraph 37 of the <i>Danmols Inventar </i>case shows that its reservation there regarding "a decision freely taken … not to continue the employment" covers those continuing to work in or be assigned to an undertaking, but in a different capacity to that of <i>employee</i> of the transferee. It is common ground that, were a contract of employment with a TEC to have been offered and refused by a civil servant, the reservation would cover the civil servant's continuing employment by the Department on secondment to the TEC. In these cases, European law pursues its aims of protecting freedom of contract and the interests of employees at the same time. Yet it is said that there is no freely taken decision within the European Court's reservation, in the situation where a civil servant volunteers to be seconded to a TEC, when the Department had the right and would otherwise have transferred the civil servant elsewhere within the Department, unless the civil servant has also formally been offered a new contract with the TEC which he or she almost certainly did not want and would have refused so as to retain civil service status. The enforced transfer of a contract of employment in this situation is inconsistent with both employee protection and ordinary contractual freedom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Bowers further submits, correctly in my view, that none of the other previous European Court decisions touches on a situation comparable with the present.  In <i>d'Urso v Ercole Marelli Elettromeccanica Generale SpA </i>(Case C-362/81); [1991] ECR I-4105, the 518 employees who were ostensibly not transferred to the transferee (but whose employment relationship the European Court held was in law nevertheless automatically transferred) had been laid off (p I-4108), their employment relationship had been "suspended" and a third party, the Cassa Integrazione Guadagni Straordinaria (CIGS), had assumed "responsibility for their pay" instead of the transferor. Quite clearly there was nothing welcome or voluntary about any of that, as far as those employees were concerned. (One might add that their employment relationship with the transferor would also appear, effectively, to have been determined.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Foreningen af Arbejdsledere i Danmark v Daddy's Dance Hall A/S</i> (Case 324/86) [1988] ECR 739 the European Court explained the rationale of the Directive as follows, at para 14:</p>
<p></p><ul>"14 .…. the purpose of Directive 77/187/EEC is to ensure that the rights resulting from a contract of employment or employment relationship of employees <i>affected</i> by the <i>transfer</i> of an undertaking are safeguarded. Since this protection is a matter of public policy, and therefore independent of the will of the parties to the contract of employment, the rules of the Directive, in particular those concerning the protection of workers against dismissal by reason of the transfer, must be considered to be mandatory, so that it is not possible to derogate from them in a manner unfavourable to employees."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Directive aims therefore to protect against dismissal by reason of the transfer of an undertaking. In the present case, the offer made to employees had the same purpose and effect of safeguarding the civil servants' rights arising from their employment relationship with the Department, and of protecting against dismissal by reason of the transfer. Employees were to be deployed elsewhere in the Department (as Celtec maintains was the Department's right) or, if they wished, they could choose to continue to work in training and be seconded to Celtec. On neither basis was there any question of cessation of their continuous employment or of dismissal. The European Court also held that, although "employees are not entitled to waive the rights conferred on them by the Directive" (paragraph 15), nevertheless "the Directive can be relied on only to ensure that the employee is protected in his relations with the transferee to the same extent as he was in his relations with the transferor under the legal rules of the Member State concerned" (paragraph 16). So, the court concluded, "the Directive does not preclude an agreement with the new employer to alter the employment relationship, in so far as such an alteration is permitted by the applicable national law in situations other than the transfer of an undertaking".  Nothing in the Directive was therefore aimed at removing or varying any right which the Department had under the terms of the relevant employment relationships to deploy civil servants in different situations outside the training and enterprise activities transferred to the TECs. That being so, it is again difficult to see why employees should not instead volunteer for secondment to a transferee of the undertaking constituted by such activities, without thereby forfeiting their civil service status - contrary almost certainly to what would have been their will at the time. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Berg v. Besselsen </i>(Joined Cases 144 and 145/87)<i> </i>[1988] ECR 2559, the European Court spoke in paragraph 12 of the Directive as:</p>
<p></p><ul>"intended to safeguard the rights of workers in the event of a change of employer by making it possible for them to continue to work for the transferee under the same conditions as those agreed with the transferor. Its purpose is not, however, to ensure that the contract of employment or the employment relationship with the transferor is continued where the undertaking's employees do not wish to remain in the transferee's employ."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In paragraph 13 it spoke also of the rules as "intended to safeguard, in the interests of the employees, the existing employment relationships which are part of the economic entity transferred".  Neither of these statements was addressing a situation where the transferor was both entitled and willing to offer continuing employment elsewhere in its organisation, and would have done so but for the employee's voluntary offer to continue to serve on secondment in the same area as the undertaking transferred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Katsikas v. Kostantinidis</i> (Joined Cases C-132/91, C-138/91 and C-139/91); [1992] ECR I-6577 concerned employees who had objected to becoming employees of the transferee, an attitude which the transferor (who then dismissed them) argued was not open to them in the light of the Directive. Not surprisingly, the European Court held that the Directive did not have the purpose or effect of compulsorily transferring an employee's employment contract or relationship against his or her will, but that, in such a case, it was for the law of the relevant Member State to determine whether the contract or relationship was to be regarded as terminated by the transferor or transferee or to be maintained with the transferor. The case may explain references evidently made before the European Court in the present case to situations of "refusal" to be employed by a transferee, but its facts were far removed from the present.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114.&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, I consider that the respondents should have leave to argue their new point, but that it raises potentially both factual matters which it would require further investigation to resolve and legal issues which would merit further argument, at least before there could be any question of dismissing this appeal. The situation is not, of course, at all a happy one in a case which is already old. But the problem about its resolution now arises from the respondents' own admitted failure to argue the case at any previous stage on the new basis which they now belatedly seek leave to raise. One option open to the House would be to refer the matter yet again to the European Court for determination of the question of law whether - on the hypothesis that the facts are as the Department, in answer to the respondents' new point, maintain - the employment relationship of civil servants who volunteered for secondment in September 1990 was, contrary to their evident intention and belief, transferred willy-nilly to the relevant TEC to which they thought they were being seconded. But even that would not necessarily resolve the case, in view of the first point made in paragraph 104 above; and anyway it is in my opinion preferable that the law should be reviewed and decided on a solid basis of findings regarding the actual facts. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, therefore, the appeal should be allowed and the Court of Appeal's decision set aside and the case should be remitted to the employment tribunal for the facts to be investigated and for appropriate findings to be made, on the basis of which the legal position should then be further considered. The parties should have 21 days in which to make submissions as to the appropriate costs order.</p>
