<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;199.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, he said that the delay in diagnosis and treatment had caused physical injury, in the shape of the spread of the cancer in late 1995 before his therapy began. The losses he had suffered were simply consequential on this physical damage, just as loss of earnings and loss of life expectancy are consequential on a broken leg. He accepts that issues of causation of damage must be decided on the balance of probabilities. But he argues that issues of quantification of future losses are conventionally decided on the evaluation of risks and chances: see the well known words of Lord Diplock in <i>Mallet v McMonagle</i> [1970] AC 166, 176, cited by my noble and learned friend Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead at para 12 earlier. Consequential loss or reduction of the chance of a cure should be evaluated in the same way as, say, an increased risk of arthritis from a broken leg or epilepsy from a broken head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;200.&nbsp;&nbsp;This argument was accepted by Latham LJ in the Court of Appeal and remained the primary case submitted before us. I was for a long time attracted by it. But I have concluded that it will not do, at least on the facts of this case. Consequential loss still has to be consequential upon, that is caused by, the injury that has been caused by the defendant's negligence. If I am injured in a road accident, I still have to prove that any earnings I have lost are caused by that injury and not by, for example, my own decision to give up work and go round the world. The claimant accepts that causation still has to be shown on the balance of probabilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;201.&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge did find (para 38) that, during that nine month period of delay from when treatment should have begun in around April 1995 to when it did begin in January 1996,</p>
<p></p><ul>". . . the Claimant's condition 'upstaged' significantly, so that he was less likely to achieve complete remission and had a poorer prognosis as a result. Specifically his chances of avoiding radical high dose chemotherapy, his chances of avoiding a relapse, and his chances of ultimate survival were all reduced."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;202.&nbsp;&nbsp;But this was all in terms of chances, not of probabilities. It was not a finding that the delay caused the upstaging. Then,</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is not possible to say that without the adverse prognostic factors caused by the delay the Claimant . . . would more probably than not have become a disease free survivor, or that he would have avoided relapse and relapse after high dose chemotherapy. He may have done, but it is not possible to say.<i> It is possible to say on the basis of Professor Goldstone's model that he would more probably than not have achieved complete remission with initial CHOP therapy and without high dose chemotherapy with stem cell harvesting."</i> (emphasis supplied)<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;203.&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctors do not cause the presenting disease. If they negligently fail to diagnose and treat it, it is not enough to show that a claimant's disease has got worse during the period of delay. It has to be shown that treating it earlier would have prevented that happening, at least for the time being. The italicised words do amount to a finding that the claimant would have achieved initial remission had he been treated earlier. But he would still have had to have the initial treatment and he would still, on the judge's later findings (see para 53), have given up work while it was going on. Had there been no later relapse, the judge thought that he should be taken as having begun work of some kind at the beginning of 1997, but there should be no loss of earnings claim before then. Similarly, there should be no claim for the costs of care before September 1996, anything before that not being attributable to the more radical treatment which became necessary (see para 59). Hence, the initial loss of earnings and cost of care were the result of the disease and the need to treat it, <i>not</i> the result of the negligence. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;204.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there was a further course of more radical treatment in August 1996, because the initial treatment had not been wholly effective. This appears to have been effective for a while. Then there was a relapse in early 1998, when the claimant underwent further radiotherapy which was intended only as palliative care because he was by then thought incurable, and a possible further relapse later that year, and further palliative chemotherapy. The prognosis at that stage was very poor. The effect upon the claimant's life has been devastating. But the judge could not find on the balance of probabilities that this would not all have happened to him anyway, with or without the initial delay in treatment (para 48):</p>
<p></p><ul>" . . . Although he might have suffered them at different times, Mr Gregg would on the balance of probabilities have gone through the same sequence of setbacks and treatments, and his outlook now is not shown to be different from what it would have been had there been no negligence."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;205.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that it cannot be said that the later pain, suffering and loss of amenity caused by the need for further treatment, and the associated loss of earnings and costs of care, were consequential on the injury caused by the negligence. Even if the initial treatment had led to remission, the need for further treatment and the relapses would have happened anyway because of the disease.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;206.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even on conventional principles, this does not necessarily mean that the claimant is not entitled to anything at all. The defendant is liable for any <i>extra</i> pain, suffering, loss of amenity, financial loss and loss of expectation of life which may have resulted from the delay. If, without the delay, the claimant would have achieved a longer gap before more radical treatment became necessary, then he should be entitled to damages to reflect the acceleration in his suffering. If the pain and suffering he would have suffered anyway was made worse by the anguish of knowing that his disease could have been detected earlier, then he should be compensated for that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;207.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the distinct possibility that the delay reduced his life expectancy in the following sense. It is possible that had he been treated when he should have been treated, his median life expectancy then would have been x years, whereas given the delay in treatment his median life expectancy from then is x minus y. This argument requires that the assessment of loss of life expectancy be based on median survival rates: ie those to be expected of half the relevant population at the particular time. If half the men with Mr Gregg's condition would have survived for x years or over with prompt treatment, and half would have survived for less than x years, then x is the median life expectancy of the group. If the same calculation of life expectancy from when he should have been treated is done in the light of the delay in treatment, the median life expectancy may have fallen. There might therefore be a modest claim in respect of the 'lost years'. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;208.&nbsp;&nbsp;But none of this appears to have been explored before the judge. This was presumably because the focus before him had been on establishing that the claimant would otherwise have achieved a complete 'cure'. Ignoring for the moment the particular definition of cure adopted in the medical evidence, this would have entitled the claimant to far more in the way of loss of earnings and cost of care than would a claim for a modest reduction in median life expectancy.</p>
<i><p>The loss of a chance argument</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;209.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second, and more radical, way of redefining the claimant's damage is in terms of the loss of a chance. Put this way, his claim is not for the loss of an outcome, in this case the cure of his disease, which he would have enjoyed but for the negligence. His claim is for the reduced chance of achieving that outcome. As Jane Stapleton explained (by reference to the argument accepted by the Court of Appeal in <i>Hotson v East Berkshire Area Health Authority</i> [1987] AC 750) in "The Gist of Negligence" (1988) 104 LQR 389, 391-2:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Clearly, if the gist of the complaint were traditionally formulated in terms of contraction of necrosis, the plaintiff would fail to establish the requisite causal link on the balance of probability. The novelty of the case was that the plaintiff attempted to circumvent this result by choosing to formulate the gist of his action, not in terms of the necrosis outcome, but in terms of the lost chance of avoiding that outcome. In other words, although the plaintiff fails to establish causation on the balance of probabilities to one formulation of the damage forming the gist, he seeks to succeed in doing so to an alternative formulation based on loss of a chance. Importantly, the <i>Hotson</i> argument retains the traditional form of the causation test . . ."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;210.&nbsp;&nbsp;In that case, the claimant had actually suffered the adverse outcome, avascular necrosis. The risk of suffering that outcome as a result of falling from the tree was 75%. The defendant's negligent failure to detect the injury to his hip took away the remaining 25% chance of avoiding it. Clearly he could not prove that the negligence had caused the outcome. It was more likely than not that it had made no difference. But might he have proved that it was more likely than not that the negligence had reduced his chance of avoiding that outcome?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;211.&nbsp;&nbsp;The House of Lords treated this as a case in which the die was already cast by the time the claimant got to the hospital (or at least the claimant could not prove otherwise). The defendant had not even caused the loss of the chance of saving the situation, because by the time the claimant got to them there was no chance. The coin had already been tossed, and had come down heads or tails. But there must be many cases in which that is not so. The coin is in the air. The claimant does have a chance of a favourable outcome which chance is wiped out or significantly reduced by the negligence. The coin is whipped out of the air before it has been able to land.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;212.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is, therefore, a new case, not covered precisely by previous authority. The appellant himself describes his argument as the 'policy approach'. He recognises that it is a question of legal policy whether the law should be developed as he argues it should be. The wide version of the argument would allow recovery for any reduction in the chance of a better physical outcome, or any increase in the chance of an adverse physical outcome, even if this cannot be linked to any physiological changes caused by the defendant. A defendant who has negligently increased the risk that the claimant will suffer harm in future (for example from exposure to asbestos or cigarette smoke) would be liable even though no harm had yet been suffered. This would be difficult to reconcile with our once and for all approach to establishing liability and assessing damage. Unless damages were limited to a modest sum for anxiety and distress about the future, sensible quantification would have to 'wait and see'. The narrower version of the argument would require that there be some physiological change caused by the defendant's negligence, bringing with it a reduced prospect of a favourable outcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;213.&nbsp;&nbsp;The attractions of adopting this reformulation of the gist of the action are many (see, for example, the discussion by Joseph H King, "Causation, Valuation, and Chance in Personal Injury Torts Involving Preexisting Conditions and Future Consequences" (1981) 90 Yale LJ 1353). First, the conventional approach to causation is, in theory at least, retained. The claimant still has to prove that it is more likely than not that the negligence led to the damage. But the damage is no longer defined in terms of the outcome - saving the leg or achieving disease free survival. It is defined in terms of the loss or diminution of the chance of saving the leg or achieving disease free survival.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;214.&nbsp;&nbsp;Against that, although the conventional approach to proof of causation may be retained in theory, in practice it will be far from straightforward to apply. It may be, as my noble and learned friend Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers has demonstrated on the facts of this case, difficult to show that the reduction in the prospects of survival is caused by the delay in treatment rather than the underlying disease. On the other hand, once a breach of duty has been shown, the recent decision of the New South Wales Court of Appeal in <i>Rufo v Hosking</i> [2004] NSWCA 391 illustrates how easy it may be to conclude that this has led to a reduction in the patient's prospects of a favourable outcome. A specialist paediatrician treating a patient with lupus had changed from one corticosteroid to another and had failed to introduce a steroid sparer when he should have done. The patient suffered microfractures in her spine. It could not be shown that she would not have suffered these in any event. The negligent treatment had not caused the fractures. But Campbell AJA, giving the leading judgment in the Court of Appeal, held (at para 405) that </p>
<p></p><ul>"adopting a robust and pragmatic approach to the primary facts of this case . . . it seems to me that more probably than not the excess of corticosteroid consumed after 10 June 1992 in the context of the osteoporotic and vulnerable state of the appellant's spine caused the loss of a chance that the appellant would have suffered less spinal damage than she in fact did." <p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;215.&nbsp;&nbsp;This conclusion comes after many paragraphs of dense and careful analysis of the evidence before the trial judge. But in the end the appeal is to common sense. And common sense will often suggest that the chances of a better outcome would have been better if the doctor had done what he should have done: for why else should he have done it but to improve the patient's chances? Reformulating the damage in this way could lead to some liability in almost every case. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;216.&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, however, many would argue that this is a good thing. One of the objects of the law of negligence is to maintain proper standards, in the workplace, on the roads, in professional conduct, or whatever. If an employer, or a driver, or a professional person can be shown to have taken less care than he should have taken, then he should have to pay damages of some sort. As Lord Hope of Craighead said in <i>Chester v Afshar</i>, para 87, "The function of the law is to enable rights to be vindicated and to provide remedies when duties have been breached." In a case such as this, if there is only ever a less than evens chance of a cure (or avoiding an adverse outcome) what incentive is there for the doctor to take proper care of his patient? </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;217.&nbsp;&nbsp;But of course doctors and other health care professionals are not solely, or even mainly, motivated by the fear of adverse legal consequences. They are motivated by their natural desire and their professional duty to do their best for their patients. Tort law is not criminal law. The criminal law is there to punish and deter those who do not behave as they should. Tort law is there to compensate those who have been wronged. Some wrongs are actionable whether or not the claimant has been damaged. But damage is the gist of negligence. So it can never be enough to show that the defendant has been negligent. The question is still whether his negligence has caused actionable damage. There was no doubt about the damage in <i>Chester v Afshar</i>; the only question was whether the doctor who had failed to warn the patient of a small risk of serious harm should have to pay for the consequences when that very risk eventuated. In this case we are back to square one: what is actionable damage? </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;218.&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, it can be argued that some kinds of negligence do result in liability for loss of a chance. It has long been established that a solicitor whose negligence deprives the client of a viable claim is liable for damages even though the chances of succeeding in the claim were never better than evens: see <i>Kitchen v Royal Air Force Association</i> [1958] 1 WLR 563. The court simply asks what his claim was worth, assesses his chances of success, and discounts the full value by reference to the degree to which those chances were less than 100%.  So why should my solicitor be liable for negligently depriving me of the chance of winning my action, even if I never had a better than evens chance of success, when my doctor is not liable for negligently depriving me of the chance of getting better, even if I never had a better than evens chance of getting better? Is this another example of the law being kinder to the medical profession than to other professionals?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;219.&nbsp;&nbsp;One counter-argument is that, in this as in many other respects, there is a real difference between personal injury and financial loss. As Tony Weir (at p 76) puts it:</p>
<p></p><ul>" . . . where the claimant is suing in respect of personal injury or property damage, he must persuade the judge that that injury or damage was probably due to the defendant's tort, whereas in cases of financial harm it is enough to show that the claimant had a chance of gain which the defendant has probably caused him to lose. There is nothing irrational in this, unless one supposes it is sensible to speak of 'loss of a chance' without saying what the chance is of. Losing a chance of gain is a loss like the loss of the gain itself, alike in quality, just less in quantity: losing a chance of not losing a leg is not at all the same kind of thing as losing the leg."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;220.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unfashionable these days to distinguish between financial loss and personal injury. Losing the money one has may not be so different from losing the leg one has. But many claims for financial loss do not relate to the money one has but to the money one expected to have - a prospective financial gain. There is not much difference between the money one expected to have and the money one expected to have a chance of having: it is all money. There is a difference between the leg one ought to have and the chance of keeping a leg which one ought to have. There is perhaps an even greater difference between the disease free state one ought to have and the chance of having a disease free state which one ought to have. (A further answer may lie in the subtle distinction between deterministic events in the natural world and indeterministic events involving the unfathomable actions of human agents, discussed by Helen Reece in "Losses of Chances in the Law" (1996) 59 MLR 188.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;221.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, it can be argued that an all or nothing approach to outcome based losses is unjust. If it is shown on the balance of probabilities that my doctor caused or failed to prevent my injury or disease, he has to pay 100% of what that injury or uncured disease is worth. But, as Joseph H King argues at (1981) 90 Yale LJ 1353, 1387,</p>
<p></p><ul>"by compensating the 95% chance as though it were 100%, courts overcompensate the plaintiff. Both types of chance should be valued in a way that reflects their probability of occurrence. Such an approach would also promote a more accurate loss allocation."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;222.&nbsp;&nbsp;The logic of this argument, however, is that personal injury law should transform itself. It should never be about outcomes but only about chances. It seems to me that this is the real problem we face in this case. How can the two live together?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;223.&nbsp;&nbsp;Until now, the gist of the action for personal injuries has been damage to the person. My negligence probably caused the loss of your leg: I pay you the full value of the loss of the leg (say £100,000). My negligence probably did not cause the loss of your leg. I do not pay you anything. Compare the loss of a chance approach: my negligence probably caused a reduction in the chance of your keeping that leg: I pay you the value of the loss of your leg, discounted by the chance that it would have happened anyway. If the chance of saving the leg was very good, say 90%, the claimant still gets only 90% of his damages, say £90,000. But if the chance of saving the leg was comparatively poor, say 20%, the claimant still gets £20,000. So the claimant ends up with less than full compensation even though his chances of a more favourable outcome were good. And the defendant ends up paying substantial sums even though the <i>outcome</i> is one for which by definition he cannot be shown to be responsible. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;224.&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost any claim for loss of an outcome could be reformulated as a claim for loss of a chance of that outcome. The implications of retaining them both as alternatives would be substantial. That is, the claimant still has the prospect of 100% recovery if he can show that it is more likely than not that the doctor's negligence caused the adverse outcome. But if he cannot show that, he also has the prospect of lesser recovery for loss of a chance. If (for the reasons given earlier) it would in practice always be tempting to conclude that the doctor's negligence had affected his chances to some extent, the claimant would almost always get something. It would be a 'heads you lose everything, tails I win something' situation. But why should the defendant not also be able to redefine the gist of the action if it suits him better? </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;225.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appellant in this case accepts that the proportionate recovery effect must cut both ways. If the claim is characterised as loss of a chance, those with a better than evens chance would still only get a proportion of the full value of their claim. But I do not think that he accepts that the same would apply in cases where the claim is characterised as loss of an outcome. In that case there is no basis for calculating the odds. If the two are alternatives available in every case, the defendant will almost always be liable for something. He will have lost the benefit of the 50% chance that causation cannot be proved. But if the two approaches cannot sensibly live together, the claimants who currently obtain full recovery on an adverse outcome basis might in future only achieve a proportionate recovery. This would surely be a case of two steps forward, three steps back for the great majority of straightforward personal injury cases.  In either event, the expert evidence would have to be far more complex than it is at present. Negotiations and trials would be a great deal more difficult. Recovery would be much less predictable both for claimants and for defendants' liability insurers. There is no reason in principle why the change in approach should be limited to medical negligence. Whether or not the policy choice is between retaining the present definition of personal injury in outcome terms and redefining it in loss of opportunity terms, introducing the latter would cause far more problems in the general run of personal injury claims than the policy benefits are worth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;226.&nbsp;&nbsp;Much of the discussion in the cases and literature has centred round cases where the adverse outcome has already happened. The patient has lost his leg. Did the doctor's negligence cause him to lose the leg? If not, did it reduce the chances of saving the leg? But in this case the most serious of the adverse outcomes has not yet happened, and (it is to be hoped) may never happen. The approach to causation should be the same for both past and future events. What, if anything, has the doctor's negligence caused in this case? We certainly do not know whether it has caused this outcome, because happily Mr Gregg has survived each of the significant milestones along the way. Can we even say that it reduced the chances of a successful outcome, given that Mr Gregg has turned out to be one of the successful minority at each milestone?  This is quite different from the situation in <i>Hotson</i>, where the avascular necrosis had already happened, or in <i>Rufo v Hosking</i>, where the fractures had already happened. Mr Gregg faced a risk of an adverse outcome which happily has not so far materialised, serious though the effects of his illness, treatment and prognosis have been. The complexities of attempting to introduce liability for the loss of a chance of a more favourable outcome in personal injury claims have driven me, not without regret, to conclude that it should not be done.</p>
