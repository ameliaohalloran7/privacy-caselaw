<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;307.&nbsp;&nbsp;Commercial confidentiality is a different matter. It is moving forward rather than drawing back. The law took a big leap forward with the <i>Spycatcher</i> case (<i>Attorney-General v Guardian Newspapers Ltd</i> [1990] 1 AC 109). It was, incidentally, a leap which would have been impossible had the Law Commission's Report on <i>Breach of Confidence</i> (1981, Law Com No 110) been implemented by statute. Rather as <i>Lumley v Gye</i> had expanded liability for breach of contract beyond the contract breaker to the person who persuaded him to break his contract, <i>Spycatcher </i>expanded liability for failing to keep a secret beyond the person to whom it had originally been confided to the person who knowingly took advantage of the secret. There are some secrets which the law will not protect. They may be so trivial or useless that the law should not concern itself with them. There may be a public interest in disclosure greater than the private interest in secrecy. But we have not been given any principled reason why photographic images of this wedding should not be protected. They were undoubtedly a secret unless and until <i>OK!</i> chose to publish the images authorised by the Douglases. <i>Hello!</i> did its best to break what it knew was a secret. There may not have been an entirely identical case before but it is consistent with existing principles to apply them to this case, as the judge did. I confess to having some difficulty in understanding what this has to do with the law of intellectual property. Parliament has devised ways in which an author, inventor or creator can continue to profit from his creativity long after the product has passed into the public domain. Although in both cases the subject matter can be called information, one set of remedies is about rewarding its creator, the other about keeping it quiet. Parliament has intervened in the former but not the latter. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;308.&nbsp;&nbsp;Conversion is another area of judge made law, of much greater antiquity than the other two, and hence it has undergone even more momentous developments than they have done. The common law, as is well known, lacked any general proprietary remedy equivalent to the Roman law <i>vindicatio</i>. It provided three separate remedies for wrongfully taking away, keeping, or disposing of another's goods: trespass, detinue and trover or conversion. Conversion had distinct procedural advantages over the other two and rapidly extended its boundaries to cover much the same ground as they did: see J W Salmond, "Observations on Trover and Conversion" (1905) 81 LQR 43, at 47. The contrivances used to achieve this desirable end led to many technicalities and controversies which continued to plague the law long after the reason for them had gone: <i>ibid</i>, at 43. But of one thing there could be no doubt: although nominally tortious, conversion had become the remedy to protect the ownership of goods: see <i>Kuwait Airways Corporation v Iraqi Airways Co (Nos 4 and 5) </i>[2002] 2 AC 883, per Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead at 1092, para 77.  It follows that fault is irrelevant: "An honest but mistaken claim of right on the part of the defendant is just as much a conversion as a fraudulent purpose to retain another's property is": Salmond, <i>loc cit</i>, at 49. The remedy is either the value of what has been lost or (following the Torts (Interference with Goods) Act 1977) the return of the goods. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;309.&nbsp;&nbsp;In a logical world, there would be such a proprietary remedy for the usurpation of all forms of property. The relevant question should be, not "is there a proprietary remedy?", but "is what has been usurped property?" Rights of action were not seen as property in the 15th and 16th centuries when the tort of conversion was first developing. The essential feature of property is that it has an existence independent of a particular person: it can be bought and sold, given and received, bequeathed and inherited, pledged or seized to secure debts, acquired (in the olden days) by a husband on marrying its owner. So great was the medieval fear of maintenance that the law took a very long time to recognise any right of action (even a reversionary right to tangible property) as having this quality: see W S Holdsworth, "The History of the Treatment of <i>Choses in Action</i> by the Common Law" (1920) 33 Harvard Law Review 997. But it is noteworthy that, when new forms of chose in action which could be assigned were developed during the 17th and 18th centuries, the remedy of conversion was adapted to accommodate them: it did so by pretending that the document or other token representing or evidencing the obligation had the same value as the obligation itself. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;310.&nbsp;&nbsp;The point was well made by Park CJ, in the Supreme Court of Errors in the State of Connecticut, in <i>Ayres v French</i> (1874) 41 Conn R 142, 150:</p>
<p></p><ul>"There is really no difference in any important respect between [a share of stock] and other kinds of personal property. A man purchases a share of stock and pays one hundred dollars for it. He afterwards purchases a horse, and pays the same price. The one was bought in the market as readily as the other and can be sold and delivered as readily. The one can be pledged as collateral security as easily as the other; as easily attached to secure a debt; and its value as easily estimated. The one enriches a man as much as the other, and fills as important a place in the inventory of his estate."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the law recognises something as property, the law should extend a proprietary remedy to protect it. Our law is prepared, according to Clerk &amp; Lindsell, to apply the remedy of conversion to "any document which is specially prepared in the ordinary course of business as evidence of a debt or obligation": see <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i>, 19th ed, (2006), para 17-35. The reliance on a document or some other tangible token of the existence of the obligation may be understandable as a relic of the history, but it is not principled. It is at once too wide and too narrow. There may be a document evidencing an obligation of a purely personal kind, which ought not to attract a proprietary remedy. On the other hand, there are many debts and some other obligations which can now be readily assigned, attached, form part of an insolvent estate, and enjoy all the other characteristics of property, but which are not represented by a specific document. It is not surprising that the law has not yet taken the logical step of applying the same principle to them, because it is much more difficult wrongly to deprive someone of his rights of action than it is to deprive him of his wallet or his coat. But, to my mind, it is no greater step for the law to do this than it is for the law to recognise that photographs of the Douglas wedding enjoy the same protection as more conventional trade secrets. It is not only entirely consistent with principle. It is inconsistent with principle not to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;311.&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts of the <i>OBG</i> case make the point more clearly than I could ever do. The defendants took control over all the company's assets. They entered the company's premises and changed the locks. They took charge of all its plant and machinery and other chattels. They had no right to do so. No-one disputes that they are strictly liable in trespass to land and conversion no matter how bona fide their belief that they were entitled to do this. They also took charge of the company's business and closed it down. The judge found that the company was doomed, so that there was no goodwill to be attached to disposing of it as a going concern. But among the company's assets were the debts and other contractual liabilities it was owed. The judge found that the defendants obtained less for these assets than would have been obtained in an orderly winding up.  This is not improbable. The receivers' obligations and priorities were different from those of the company, its other creditors and shareholders. They might well result in lower realisations than the company might have achieved for itself. Accepting, as we must, the judge's findings on this, it makes no sense that the defendants should be strictly liable for what was lost on the tangible assets but not for what was lost on the intangibles. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;312.&nbsp;&nbsp;There could, of course, be an objection to extending the scope of an invalidly appointed receiver's liability if Parliament had considered that receivers should be granted relief from liability in trespass to land or conversion of goods and had enacted that relief in terms which could not be applied to the conversion of contractual rights. But Parliament has not done so. Parliament's failure to act is not a reason to make the extension proposed: it merely negates a possible objection to doing so. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;313.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor do I see the Torts (Interference with Goods) Act 1977 as an obstacle. The Law Reform Committee, whose 18th Report (1971, Cmnd 4774) preceded the 1977 Act, were specifically asked to consider the torts relating to interference with chattels. It was in that context that they recommended a new tort of wrongful interference with chattels from which other forms of property, including land, money and choses in action would expressly be excluded (para 29). They were not asked to consider, and did not consider, whether the tort of conversion should be applied to intangible property. Indeed, they excluded from their consideration its application to the infringement of copyright by the Copyright Act 1956 (para 4). Furthermore, while recommending a new tort, the Committee deliberately did not recommend a complete codification of the common law of conversion; rather, they recommended that it should be retained save insofar as modified by their proposals (para 32). In the event, Parliament did not even enact a new tort. It merely enacted a new label identifying the torts, including "conversion of goods", to which the new rules would apply. Those new rules were of very limited scope. None of them is inconsistent with applying the common law tort to contractual choses in action (or indeed to other forms of intangible property, but we are not concerned with these).  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;314.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee did consider the measure of damages applicable to the conversion of "tokens". By this they meant "any article (usually, but not necessarily, a document) of small inherent value which constitutes or evidences some right in its possessor as respects property or other benefits" (para 90). There was some doubt about whether the rule applicable to negotiable and quasi-negotiable instruments applied to such things and the Committee were of the view that arguably it already did and certainly it should (consistently with the view now taken by <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell</i>, <i>op cit</i>, para 17-35). They recommended that the measure of damages in conversion should always be the true loss suffered by reason of the defendant's acts (para 91). That view was adopted in the decision of this House in <i>Kuwait Airways Corporation v Iraqi Airways Co (Nos 4 and 5) </i>[2002] 2 AC 883, 1090, para 68. In that case, the effect was to limit the damages which would otherwise be payable but the principle is the same. It means that the law of conversion has already been adapted by the courts in a significant respect which is consistent with its application to contractual rights of action: cf V D Ricks, "The Conversion of Intangible Property: Bursting the Ancient Trover Bottle with New Wine" [1991] Brigham Young University Law Review 1681, where this was seen as the major problem in the current US developments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;315.&nbsp;&nbsp;Reforming the common law by statute is not an easy task (the difficulties are vividly described in R Oerton, <i>A Lament for the Law Commission</i>, 1987, Countrywide Press). One of the difficulties is that the common law is constantly developing. The state of the law when the reforms are originally proposed may be different from the state of the law if and when they are eventually enacted. Indeed, the law may continue to move on even after the reforms have been enacted. The law reformer will rarely wish to preclude such organic development unless (unlike the 1977 Act) the reform is intended to be a complete codification. It is quite possible that a later development in the common law will take away the case for a reform which has been enacted on the basis of what the law was previously thought to be. A recent example of this is <i>Bakewell Management Ltd v Brandwood</i> [2004] UKHL 14; [2004] 2 AC 519. But that will not deter the courts from developing the law unless it is clearly inconsistent with what Parliament has enacted, which this is not. I do not, therefore, see the 1977 Act as any obstacle to the incremental development of the common law of conversion.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;316.&nbsp;&nbsp;If, however, a majority of your lordships would prefer to leave the matter to Parliament, then I very much hope that the Law Commission can be persuaded to include it in their 10th programme of law reform. The Commission would be bound to consider developments in other common law jurisdictions. There are Canadian authorities which look at it from the point of view of invalid receivership. They establish, at the very least, that where a receiver wrongfully takes control and a business fails as a result, then the value of the company's intangible assets is included in the measure of damages: <i>McLachlan v Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce</i> (1987) 13 BCLR (2d) 300; approved on appeal (1989) 57 DLR (4th) 687; <i>Bradshaw Construction Ltd v Bank of Nova Scotia </i>[1993] 1 WWR 596; and <i>Royal Bank of Canada v W Got &amp; Associates Electric Ltd </i>(1994) 150 AR 93, confirmed on appeal by the Alberta Court of Appeal (1997) 196 AR 241 and by the Supreme Court of Canada [1999] 3 SCR 408. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;317.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States, the Second Restatement of the Law (American Law Institute, 1965) merely refers to "documents in which intangible rights are merged", but the Commentary, at p 242, observes:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is at present the prevailing view that there can be no conversion of an ordinary debt not represented by a document, or of such intangible rights as the goodwill of a business or the names of customers. The process of extension has not, however, necessarily terminated; and nothing that is said in this Section is intended to indicate that in a proper case liability for intentional interference with some other kind of intangible rights may not be found."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even before then, some seeds of such a development had been sown: see "Conversion of Choses in Action" (1941) 10 Fordham Law Review 415. Since then a few States have extended the tort beyond contractual obligations to intangibles such as computer records and data: see most recently, <i>Thyroff v Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company et al</i>, New York State Court of Appeals, 22 March 2007. These raise far more formidable questions than the one with which we are concerned: it is questionable whether the subject matter has sufficient proprietary quality to attract a proprietary remedy. But they certainly point to a problem with our present reliance on tangible tokens: the reason why (if it be the case) an e-ticket cannot be converted is that it is non-assignable, not that it exists in cyber-space rather than on paper. We do not have to venture into these difficult issues to resolve the present case in favour of OBG. The Law Commission, however, would almost certainly have to do so. Such questions are already rearing their heads in Australia as well as the United States: see <i>Telecom Vanuatu Ltd v Optus Networks Pty Ltd </i>[2005] NSWSC 951; <i>Hoath and Another v Connect Internet Services Pty Ltd and Others </i>[2006] NSWSC 158. I would quite understand it if the Commission were to consider this a more suitable topic for the case by case development of the common law than for comprehensive statutory reform. I regret that by this decision we appear to be ruling that out. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;318.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, I would allow the appeals in the cases of OBG and OK! but, in agreement with all your lordships, I would dismiss the appeal in the Mainstream case. </p>
<p><b>LORD BROWN OF EATON-UNDER-HEYWOOD</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;319.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the privilege of reading in draft the opinions of my noble and learned friends, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, Lord Hoffman and Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe.  All three agree on many of the issues arising in these appeals and where that is so I too agree.  Where, however, they disagree—notably with regard to (i) the precise nature and ambit of the economic tort of causing loss by unlawful means, (ii) whether the tort of conversion should be extended to cover the appropriation of choses in action, and (iii) OK's claim based on confidentiality—I have come in the end to accept in each instance the reasoning and conclusions of Lord Hoffmann.  I add only the following brief observations.</p>
<i><p><i>Causing loss by unlawful means</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;320.&nbsp;&nbsp;As Lord Hoffmann explains, any liability for this tort is primary (unlike the accessory liability which arises under the principle in <i>Lumley v Gye</i> 2 E &amp; B 216 where the defendant induces a contracting party to commit an actionable wrong against the claimant) and it arises where the defendant, generally to advance his own purposes, intentionally injures the claimant's economic interests by unlawfully interfering with a third party's freedom to deal with him.  In this tort there is no question of the third party's conduct (which <i>ex hypothesi</i> will have been inhibited or obstructed by the defendant's actions) being unlawful vis-a-vis the claimant; if it were, the case would be one of <i>Lumley v Gye</i> secondary liability.  Rather the unlawfulness is that of the defendant towards the third party and the defendant's conduct must be such as would be actionable at the suit of the third party had he suffered loss.  To define and circumscribe the tort in this way seems to be not only faithful to its origins as described by Lord Lindley in <i>Quinn v Leatham</i> [1901]  AC 495, 535, and consistent with the great bulk of authority which has considered the tort over the ensuing century, but also to confine it to manageable and readily comprehensible limits.  This whole area of economic tort has been plagued by uncertainty for far too long.  Your Lordships now have the opportunity to give it a coherent shape.  This surely is an opportunity to be taken.</p>
<i><p><i>Conversion</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;321.&nbsp;&nbsp;In common with Lord Hoffmann and Lord Walker I too would regard the expansion of the tort of conversion to cover the appropriation of things in action, as proposed by Lord Nicholls, to involve too radical and fundamental a change in the hitherto accepted nature of this tort (see particularly the Torts (Interference with Goods) Act 1977) to be properly capable of achievement under the guise of a development of the common law.  Lord Nicholls suggests that this would represent merely "a modest but principled extension of the scope of the tort".  I see it rather differently—as no less than the proposed severance of any link whatever between the tort of conversion and the wrongful taking of physical possession of property (whether a chattel or document) having a real and ascertainable value.  Indeed, I respectfully question whether such a proposed development in the law ought in any event to be welcomed.  I recognise, of course, that the tort has long since been extended to encompass a variety of documents, not merely documents of title and negotiable instruments but also any business document which in fact evidences some debt or obligation.  But to my mind there remains a logical distinction between the wrongful taking of a document of this character and the wrongful assertion of a right to a chose in action which properly belongs to someone else.  One (the document) has a determinable value as at the date of its seizure.  The other, as so clearly demonstrated by this very case (OBG), does not.  It is one thing for the law to impose strict liability for the wrongful taking of a valuable document; quite a different thing now to create strict liability for, as here, wrongly (though not knowingly so) assuming the right to advance someone else's claim.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;322.&nbsp;&nbsp;As Lord Hoffmann points out, there is really no explanation in OBG's case for the trial judge's conclusion that causes of action in respect of the terminated North West Water contracts which were finally settled in November 1993 for £400,000 had in June 1992 been worth three and a half times that sum: £1,400,000.  Certainly there is no suggestion that the receivers here acted incompetently in negotiating the settlement, still less that the supposed value of these contracts in June 1992 was in fact then realisable in that sum.  As Lord Walker observes, this is "a singularly unsuitable case for a major change in the law".</p>
<i><p><i>Confidentiality</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;323.&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts giving rise to the claim by OK! against Hello! are sufficiently summarised by Lord Hoffmann at paras 108-109 and by Lord Nicholls at paras 242-246 (and are to be found in altogether greater detail in the judgments below).  Nobody disputes that the Douglases were perfectly entitled, quite irrespective of any right of privacy, to sell the exclusive right to publish photographs of their wedding, and nobody doubts that the right was worth the £1m which OK! paid for it.  Indeed Hello! had earlier made an unsuccessful bid for the same right in the same sum.  It is no less plain that in publishing as they did the rogue photographs deceitfully taken by an infiltrator at the wedding, Hello! not only lent themselves to this outwitting of the strenuous efforts made by the Douglases to safeguard OK!'s exclusive but intentionally destroyed the very right itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;324.&nbsp;&nbsp;The loss of their exclusive right cost OK! £1m; that was the judge's assessment of damages here and there are no good grounds for impugning it.  Hello!, however, contend that vis-à-vis OK! they committed no actionable wrong: all is fair in love and war and so too, they submit, between publishers of celebrity magazines.  Spike your competitor's exclusive if you can and use whatever means you must. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;325.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the law were indeed to sanction such an approach I for my part would regret it.  Having paid £1m for an exclusive right it seems to me that OK! ought to be in a position to protect that right and to look to the law for redress were a third party intentionally to destroy it.  Like Lord Hoffmann, I would uphold OK!'s claim, as Lindsay J did at first instance, on the ground of breach of confidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;326.&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the information to which the confidence here attached?  Plainly the information as to how the wedding looked—the photographic images which bring the event to life and make the viewer a virtual spectator at it.  How can one doubt that this was commercially confidential information or, if one prefers, a trade secret?  It was, after all, secret information for which OK! had been prepared to pay £1 million, in the expectation, obviously, that it was to remain secret until they chose to make use of it.  And that is certainly how it would also have been perceived by Hello! (who had themselves hoped to acquire and exploit the secret in the same way).  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;327.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Lord Hoffmann I find the Court of Appeal's criticism of the judge at para 136 of their judgment unpersuasive.  I cannot agree that OK!'s complaint, properly analysed, is not about Hello!'s breach of their exclusive right to publish authorised photographs but rather that Hello! published images which no one had a right to publish and about which only the Douglases had a right to complain.  This to my mind entirely overlooks that the Douglases had granted OK! the exclusive right to publish any photographic images of the wedding and had undertaken to do their best to ensure that no photographs were taken by anyone else so that nobody else would be in a position to defeat their exclusive right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;328.&nbsp;&nbsp;Assume, for example, that the Douglases were themselves magazine publishers and had wished to market the visual images of their wedding as an exclusive in their own magazine.  Could it then be suggested that they had no right to complain against Hello! for behaving as they did here?  Surely not.  Or assume that the contract had stipulated that if other photographs of the wedding came to be published, the £1m paid by OK! (or, say, £½m) would be repayable.  Would not the Douglases have been entitled to claim that loss against Hello! on the ground of breach of confidence?  Why then not OK! too?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;329.&nbsp;&nbsp;The one hesitation I must own to having had with regard to the claim for breach of confidence concerns the situation which arises upon publication by OK! of the authorised photographs in pursuance of their exclusive right.  At that moment, it may be suggested, the secret is out, the world now knows what the wedding looks like, and no commercial confidence remains to be protected.  The answer, however, I am persuaded is this.  The secret consists no less of each and every visual image of the wedding than of the wedding as a whole.  Assume, for example, that OK! had chosen to publish photographs of the bride and groom in one issue, the guests in the next, and the presents later still.  The confidence would, I think, continue throughout and I see no reason why at some point bootlegged photographs should suddenly become acceptable on the grounds that the look of the wedding was now in the public domain so that no confidentiality in its photographic image remained to be protected.</p>
<i><p><i>Conclusion</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;330.&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows from all this that I too would dismiss the appeals respectively by OBG and by Mainstream Properties but allow the appeal by OK! on the ground of breach of confidence, reinstating Lindsay J's damages award accordingly.</p>
