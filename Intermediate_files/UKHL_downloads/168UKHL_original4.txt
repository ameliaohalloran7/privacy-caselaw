<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89.&nbsp;&nbsp;A possible inference from this may be that in Lord Brandon's view entitlement to recover interest losses arising in the ordinary course of things would conflict with the statute but entitlement to recover other interest losses would not.  If this is the rationale I must respectfully disagree with Lord Brandon.  Clearly, conflict with section 35A of the Supreme Court Act 1981 is to be avoided.  But this important consideration does not necessitate or justify the use made in the <i>Pintada</i> case of the distinction between the first and second limbs of the rule in <i>Hadley v Baxendale</i>.  Section 35A is of general application.  It applies generally to proceedings for recovery of a debt or damages.  The court is empowered to award simple interest on a discretionary basis.  If, as the House held in <i>Pintada</i>, interest losses falling within the second limb of <i>Hadley v Baxendale</i> are recoverable at law despite the statute, the same must surely be true of interest losses falling within the first limb.  The policy considerations underlying this general statutory provision cannot apply differently to interest losses according to which limb of a remoteness rule they fall within.  </p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sempra's claim for damages</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have almost reached journey's end on this issue.  I pause to note one point which is clear beyond a peradventure.  In the present case Sempra is not claiming damages for interest losses caused by late payment of a debt.  Sempra is claiming interest losses as damages for breach of a statutory duty.  As such Sempra's claim does not fall within the exception to the general common law rules.  Accordingly Sempra's damages claim is subject to the same rules as apply generally to damages claims in tort.  Subject to satisfying those rules Sempra is entitled to recover damages in respect of the losses of interest, whether simple or compound, it sustained by reason of the wrongful levying of ACT.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91.&nbsp;&nbsp;This being so, no difficulty arises in English law from the fact that the ACT exacted unlawfully was mostly utilised by being set off against Sempra's mainstream corporation tax liability before Sempra commenced proceedings.  Sempra's cause of action arose when it suffered loss by having to provide the ACT.  The subsequent utilisation of the ACT by way of set off did not extinguish Sempra's existing claim for damages.  </p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restrictive common law exception today</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92.&nbsp;&nbsp;This conclusion suffices to dispose of the damages issue in the present case.  I go further, in view of the wide-ranging arguments presented to your Lordships.  The common law should sanction injustice no longer.  The House should recognise the remnant of the restrictive common law exception for what it is: the unprincipled remnant of an unprincipled rule.  The House should erase the remains of this blot on English common law jurisprudence.  The House should do so by taking to its logical conclusion the step initiated by the House in 1984 in the <i>Pintada</i> case.  This would accord with an observation of Lord Woolf in <i>Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington Borough Council</i> [1996] AC 669, 733.  Lord Woolf noted that, despite the lapse of time since the <i>London, Chatham and Dover Railway</i> case was decided in 1893, 'the courts will be prepared to limit the application of that decision where this can be done in accordance with principle and it is appropriate to do so.'</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the <i>Pintada</i> case the House made clear that, contrary to the general understanding of the effect of the <i>London, Chatham and Dover Railway </i>case, claims for damages for interest losses suffered as a result of the late payment of money are not taboo.  That is plainly right.  Those who default on a contractual obligation to pay money are not possessed of some special immunity in respect of losses caused thereby.  To be recoverable the losses suffered by a claimant must satisfy the usual remoteness tests.  The losses must have been reasonably foreseeable at the time of the contract as liable to result from the breach.  But, subject to satisfying the usual damages criteria, in principle these losses are recoverable as damages for breach of contract.  This is so even if the losses consist of a liability to pay borrowing costs incurred as a result of the late payment, as happened in <i>Wadsworth v Lydall</i> [1981] 1 WLR 598.  And this is so irrespective of whether the borrowing costs comprise simple interest or compound interest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94.&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, if your Lordships agree, the House should now hold that, in principle, it is always open to a claimant to plead and prove his actual interest losses caused by late payment of a debt.  These losses will be recoverable, subject to the principles governing all claims for damages for breach of contract, such as remoteness, failure to mitigate and so forth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the nature of things the proof required to establish a claimed interest loss will depend upon the nature of the loss and the circumstances of the case.  The loss may be the cost of borrowing money.  That cost may include an element of compound interest.  Or the loss may be loss of an opportunity to invest the promised money.  Here again, where the circumstances require, the investment loss may need to include a compound element if it is to be a fair measure of what the plaintiff lost by the late payment.  Or the loss flowing from the late payment may take some other form.  Whatever form the loss takes the court will, here as elsewhere, draw from the proved or admitted facts such inferences as are appropriate.  That is a matter for the trial judge.  There are no special rules for the proof of facts in this area of the law.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96.&nbsp;&nbsp;But an unparticularised and unproved claim simply for 'damages' will not suffice.  General damages are not recoverable.  The common law does not <i>assume</i> that delay in payment of a debt will of itself cause damage.  Loss must be proved.  To that extent the decision in the <i>London, Chatham and Dover Railway </i>case remains extant.  The decision in that<i> </i>case survives but is confined narrowly to claims of a similar nature to the simple claim for interest advanced in that case.  Thus, that decision is to be understood as applying only to claims at common law for unparticularised and unproven interest losses as damages for breach of a contract to pay a debt and, which today comes to the same, claims for payment of a debt with interest.  In the absence of agreement the restrictive exception to the general common law rules prevails in those cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97.&nbsp;&nbsp;The common law's unwillingness to presume interest losses where payment is delayed is, I readily accept, unrealistic.  This is especially so at times when inflation abounds and prevailing rates of interest are high.  To require proof of loss in each case may seem unduly formalistic.  The common law can bear this reproach.  If a party chooses not to prove his interest losses the remedy provided by the law is to be found in the statutory provisions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98.&nbsp;&nbsp;I must emphasise that limiting the scope of the restrictive common law exception in this way does not lead to a result which conflicts with the legislation, or with the underlying legislative policy, for two reasons.  First, section 35A of the 1981 Act is not an exhaustive code.  It is not intended to be an exhaustive code. Section 35A does not displace any jurisdiction the courts themselves have to award interest.  This is made plain by subsection (4).  Courts of equity, for instance, have long exercised a jurisdiction to award interest, including compound interest, in certain circumstances.  Likewise with the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998, now amended by the Late Payment of Commercial Debts Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No 1674).  This Act implies into certain types of contracts a term to the effect that a qualifying debt carries interest in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  But a debt does not carry interest under a term implied by the Act if, or to the extent that, a right to demand interest on it, which exists by virtue of any rule of law, is exercised: section 3(3).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99.&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, section 35A is concerned with interest on debts and damages.  The section says nothing about the principles to be applied by a court when assessing the amount of damages for which it gives judgment.  The section does not preclude a court from taking interest losses into account when awarding damages for breach of contract.  This has long been the general understanding.  This is shown by the string of reported cases where interest losses have been recovered as damages in claims for breach of contract or in respect of torts, or would have been so recovered if the losses had been proved.  These interest losses have included losses calculated on a compound basis where appropriate.  Among the cases are <i>Brandeis Goldschmidt &amp; Co Ltd v Western Transport Ltd </i>[1981] 1 QB 864, <i>Swingcastle Ltd v Gibson</i> [1991] 2 AC 223, <i>Nigerian National Shipping Lines Ltd v Mutual Ltd</i> [1998] 2 Lloyd's Rep 664, <i>Hartle v Laceys</i> [1999] 1 PN 315, and <i>Mortgage Corporation v Halifax (SW) Ltd</i> [1999] 1 PN 159.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons I consider the court has a common law jurisdiction to award interest, simple and compound, as damages on claims for non-payment of debts as well as on other claims for breach of contract and in tort.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest benefits and restitution</p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101.&nbsp;&nbsp;Against this background I turn to the two restitutionary causes of action asserted by Sempra.  Sempra's claim is that it paid ACT in response to an unlawful demand and under a mistake of law.  On both these bases the Inland Revenue's receipt of ACT comprised unjust enrichment at the expense of Sempra.  Of these two formulations Sempra much prefers the second because of the extended limitation period applicable under the Limitation Act 1980, section 32(1)(c).  Sempra's claim is that under both causes of action restitution requires the Inland Revenue to pay Sempra the value of the benefit the Inland Revenue obtained by having use of the money Sempra paid as ACT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102.&nbsp;&nbsp;In principle this claim is unanswerable.  The benefits transferred by Sempra to the Inland Revenue comprised, in short, (1) the amounts of tax paid to the Inland Revenue and, consequentially, (2) the opportunity for the Inland Revenue, or the Government of which the Inland Revenue is a department, to use this money for the period of prematurity.  The Inland Revenue was enriched by the latter head in addition to the former.  The payment of ACT was the equivalent of a massive interest free loan.  Restitution, if it is to be complete, must encompass both heads.  Restitution by the Revenue requires (1) repayment of the amounts of tax paid prematurely (this claim became spent once set off occurred) and (2) payment for having the use of the money for the period of prematurity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ordinary course the value of having the use of money, sometimes called the 'use value' or 'time value' of money, is best measured in this restitutionary context by the reasonable cost the defendant would have incurred in borrowing the amount in question for the relevant period.  That is the market value of the benefit the defendant acquired by having the use of the money.  This means the relevant measure in the present case is the cost the United Kingdom government would have incurred in borrowing the ACT for the period of prematurity.  Like all borrowings in the money market, interest charges calculated in this way would inevitably be calculated on a compound basis.  </p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present position in English law</p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104.&nbsp;&nbsp;The present state of English law does not accord with this analysis.  At present the court is considered to have no jurisdiction, that is, no power to make an award of compound interest on a personal claim for restitution of a sum of money paid by mistake or following an unlawful demand.  The court has power to make an award of simple interest under section 35A of the Supreme Court Act 1981.  But, as the authorities now stand, English law does not recognise that a restitutionary award at common law should include restoration to the claimant of the time value of the money he transferred to the defendant and which the defendant enjoyed by having the money in his possession. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105.&nbsp;&nbsp;How did this divergence from reality come about?  How is it that, to paraphrase Lord Goff's words in <i>Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London B C</i> [1996] 669, 691, English law is revealed as incapable of doing full justice?  Once more the answer lies in the historical origin of this area of the law.  The restitutionary cause of action relied upon by Sempra derives from a contrived extension of the indebitatus assumpsit form of action.  A plea of 'money had and received to the plaintiff's use' was regarded as apt where a defendant was under an obligation 'from the ties of natural justice' to refund money to the plaintiff.  This plea appears to have been in common use from the early 17th century.  The law implied a debt, and gave a cause of action, 'as it were upon a contract', in the well known words of Lord Mansfield CJ in <i>Moses v Macferlan </i>2 Burr 1005, 1008.  Lord Mansfield likened this to a claim 'quasi ex contractu, as the Roman law expresses it'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106.&nbsp;&nbsp;That was in 1760.  Heavily influenced by the fictitious nexus with a claim for breach of contract, the courts set themselves against awarding interest on a claim for money had and received: see <i>Walker v Constable</i> (1798) 1 Bos &amp; Pul 306, <i>De Havilland v Bowerbank </i>(1807) 1 Camp 50, per Lord Ellenborough, <i>De Bernales v</i> <i>Fuller </i>(1810) 2 Camp 426, <i>Depcke v Munn</i> (1828) 3 Car &amp; P 112, per Lord Tenterden CJ, and <i>Fruhling v Schroeder</i> (1835) 2 Bing (N C) 78.  This approach culminated in the Privy Council decision in <i>Johnson v The King</i> [1904] AC 817.  On a claim for repayment of money paid by mistake the Board considered an order for payment of interest would be inconsistent with the law as settled in <i>London, Chatham and Dover Railway Co v South Eastern Railway Co </i>[1893] AC 429.  In other words, in the <i>London, Chatham and Dover Railway</i> case your Lordships' House had decided that at common law a court had no jurisdiction to award interest on the late payment of a debt.  The position was the same regarding an award of interest on a claim for repayment of money paid by mistake because a claim for repayment of money paid by mistake is founded on an implied contract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107.&nbsp;&nbsp;This fiction of an implied contract lingered long in the law.  It continued to govern the ambit of the remedy for money had and received.  In 1914, for instance, in <i>Sinclair v Brougham</i> [1914] AC 398, 417, Viscount Haldane LC said the remedy was given only 'where the law could consistently impute to the defendant at least the fiction of a promise'.  This fetter on the principled development of the law of restitution was not finally removed until the celebrated decision of your Lordships' House in <i>Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd</i> [1991] 2 AC 548.  It is now accepted law that a claim for restitutionary relief is not founded on a fictitious implied contract or 'quasi-contract'.  This is a false and misleading characterisation of the nature of claims for restitution as a remedy for unjust enrichment.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>Lipkin Gorman</i> decision was in 1991.  Meanwhile the law on the courts' inability to award interest at common law on restitutionary claims remained as settled by Lord Mansfield CJ in 1760.  The common law regarding claims for interest as damages for non-payment of debt had developed to some extent.  The unsatisfactory rule established authoritatively in the <i>London, Chatham and Dover Railway</i> case was partly ameliorated by the decision in <i>President of India v La Pintada Compania Navigacion SA</i> [1985] 1 AC 104.  No such ameliorating development took place in the law of restitution.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109.&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is perhaps not surprising that as recently as ten years ago the law concerning interest in restitution cases was still generally understood to be as enunciated by Lord Mansfield, Lord Ellenborough and Lord Tenterden.  Hence it came about that in 1996, in <i>Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Borough Council</i> [1996] AC 669, counsel opened an appeal in your Lordships' House on a claim for compound interest on money paid under interest rate swaps held to be void with these words:</p>
<p></p><ul>'Both parties accept that compound, as opposed to simple, interest is payable only if the council received the money under the void interest rate swaps agreement as fiduciary …'<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court has jurisdiction to award simple interest under section 35A of the Supreme Court Act 1981, because 'debt or damages' in section 35A includes any sum of money recoverable by one party from another: see <i>BP Exploration Co (Libya) Ltd v Hunt (No 2) </i>[1983] 2 AC 352.  But no interest, whether compound or simple, is recoverable at common law.  Sometimes interest, compound as well as simple, is recoverable in equity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appeal in the <i>Westdeutsche</i> case proceeded on that footing.  Lord Goff of Chieveley recorded this, noting that the central issue was whether there is jurisdiction in equity to award compound interest in a case such as the instant case: pages 690-691.  The majority of the House, comprising Lord Browne-Wilkinson, Lord Slynn of Hadley and Lord Lloyd of Berwick, held there is no such jurisdiction.  Lord Goff and Lord Woolf dissented. They held an award of compound interest in equity is necessary to grant full restitution.  In exercise of its equitable jurisdiction the court has power to make such an award in personal claims in restitution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111.&nbsp;&nbsp;In these unusual circumstances I consider it is open to your Lordships' House on this appeal to re-examine the basic point of law conceded and not argued on the <i>Westdeutsche</i> appeal, namely, whether interest may be awarded by the courts in exercise of their common law jurisdiction to grant personal restitutionary relief.  Further, I consider your Lordships should undertake this task.  Having only recently been released from the shackles of implied contract and, hence, the restraints of the <i>London, Chatham and Dover Railway</i> case, the law of restitution should now have the opportunity to develop as a coherent body of principled law.  The decision of the House in a case where this point was conceded and assumed cannot properly stand in the way.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the House takes this opportunity I venture to repeat there can only be one answer on this important question of law.  Nobody has suggested a good reason why, in a case like the present, an award of compound interest should be denied to a claimant.  An award of compound interest is necessary to achieve full restitution and, hence, a just result.  I would hold that, in the exercise of its common law restitutionary jurisdiction, the court has power to make such an award.  I agree with the thrust of Mummery LJ's observations on this point in <i>NEC Semi-Conductors Ltd v Inland Revenue Commissioners </i>[2006] STC 606, 642-643, paras 172-175.  To that extent I would depart from the decision on the <i>Westdeutsche</i> appeal. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113.&nbsp;&nbsp;If this approach is adopted the unfortunate decision in the <i>London, Chatham and Dover Railway </i>case will be effectually buried in relation to the payment of interest for non-payment of a debt and in relation to the payment of interest for having the use of money in personal restitution cases.  The law will achieve a principled measure of consistency between contractual obligations and restitutionary obligations.  The common law in Australia has developed in this way.  The common law in England should do likewise. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114.&nbsp;&nbsp;I add that, as with awards of compound interest as damages for non-payment of a debt, so also with awards of compound interest as restitutionary relief in respect of a defendant's unjust enrichment: such awards do not conflict with section 35A of the Supreme Court Act 1981.  As already noted, section 35A is concerned with interest on 'a debt or damages'.  An amount of money recoverable as restitutionary relief falls within this phrase.  Section 35A bites on that amount.  But section 35A says nothing about the principles to be applied by the courts at the anterior stage when assessing the amount of money required to achieve full restitution.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, as with the damages claim in the present proceedings, so also with the two restitutionary claims, no difficulty arises from the fact that Sempra's ACT payments were mostly used before the inception of proceedings.  The Inland Revenue had the benefit of the use of each payment of ACT for at least eight months.  Setting off a payment of ACT against Sempra's mainstream corporation tax liability did not extinguish the Inland Revenue's restitutionary liability in respect of the interest benefits it had by then obtained from the ACT payments.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Measuring the value of the use of money</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned above that in cases of personal restitution the value of the use of money is prima facie the reasonable cost of borrowing the money in question.  I should elaborate a little on this, noting first that a comparable objective measure is well established in the analogous case of valuing the benefit derived by a defendant from unauthorised use of the claimant's land or goods.  In the modern terminology these are instances of restitution for wrongdoing as distinct from restitution for unjust enrichment.  The Earl of Halsbury's chair and Lord Shaw's horse are famous hypothetical examples of the application of this 'user' principle: see <i>The Mediana</i> [1900] AC 113, 117, and <i>Watson, Laidlaw &amp; Co Ltd v Pott, Cassels and Williamson</i> (1914) 31 RPC 104, 119.  If the unauthorised use causes injury, damages will be recoverable.  If the unauthorised use does not cause damage the defendant must still recompense the plaintiff for the benefit he unjustly received.  This distinction was drawn explicitly in cases such as <i>Whitwham v Westminster Brymbo Coal and Coke Co</i> [1896] 2 Ch 538 and <i>Penarth Dock Engineering Co Ltd v Pounds</i> [1963] 1 Lloyd's Rep 359.  In <i>Attorney General v Blake</i> [2001] 1 AC 268, 278, I summarised the ordinary measure of the benefit in this type of case as the price a reasonable person would pay for the right of user.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117.&nbsp;&nbsp;The time value of money, measured objectively in this way, is to be distinguished from the value of the benefits a defendant actually derived from the use of the money.  The latter value is not in point in the present case.  Sempra retained no proprietary interest in the money it paid to the Inland Revenue, and it has no interest in the 'fruits' of that money.  Sempra's claim is a personal claim against the Inland Revenue in respect of the benefits it transferred to the Revenue.  The value of those benefits should be measured as described above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case there can be nothing unjust in requiring the Inland Revenue to pay compound interest, by way of restitution, on the huge interest free loan constituted by Sempra's payment of ACT.  But this will not always be so.  For instance, a recipient of a payment made by a mistake shared by both parties might make no actual use of the money.  He might pay the money into a current account at a bank yielding little or no interest.  When the mistake comes to light he repays the money.  In such a case, depending on the circumstances, it might well be most unfair that he should be out of pocket by having to make an additional payment, whether as compound interest or even simple interest, in respect of the 'time value' of the money he received.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, as elsewhere, the law of restitution is sufficiently flexible to achieve a just result.  To avoid what would otherwise be an unjust outcome the court can, in an appropriate case, depart from the market value approach when assessing the time value of money or, indeed, when assessing the value of any other benefit gained by a defendant.  What is ultimately important in restitution is whether, and to what extent, the particular defendant has been benefited: see Professor Burrows, The Law of Restitution, 2nd ed, (2002), page 18.  A benefit is not always worth its market value to a particular defendant.  When it is not it may be unjust to treat the defendant as having received a benefit possessing the value it has to others.  In Professor Birks' language, a benefit received by a defendant may sometimes be subject to 'subjective devaluation': An Introduction to the Law of Restitution (1985), page 413.  An application of this approach is to be found in the Court of Appeal decision in <i>Ministry of Defence v Ashman </i>[1993] 2 EGLR 102.  Whether this is to be characterised as part of the 'change of position' defence available in restitution cases is not a matter I need pursue.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other submissions</p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Inland Revenue pointed out that the general position under the United Kingdom tax regime, both for direct and indirect taxes, is that taxpayers who pay tax late are required to pay simple interest, and taxpayers who overpay tax are entitled to repayment together with an amount based on simple interest.  Mr Glick QC submitted there is no compelling reason why the taxpayers in the present actions should receive more favourable interest treatment than taxpayers with other claims based on domestic law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121.&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is not without force.  But this is now water under the bridge.  In <i>Woolwich Equitable Building Society v Inland Revenue Commissioners</i> [1993] AC 70 a similar submission was made regarding the availability of interest under section 35A, as opposed to the statutory repayment supplements.  The point was upheld by Lord Keith of Kinkel and Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle.  The majority of the House, however, took a different view.  A restitutionary cause of action arose, with the usual consequences regarding interest, when the building society made the tax payments required by the ultra vires regulations.  This was so, even though in the result the building society received more favourable interest treatment than other overpaying taxpayers </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>Woolwich</i> case concerned a claim to simple interest under section 35A.  But on this point no sensible distinction can be drawn between an overpaying taxpayer's right to seek interest under section 35A and, as in the present case, an overpaying taxpayer's entitlement to an award of interest, simple or compound, as damages or as an element of substantive restitutionary relief.</p>
