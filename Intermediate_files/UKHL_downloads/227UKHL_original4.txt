<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus it is easy to understand why Parliament chose to ignore capital allowances in the original scheme. It is easy to see why Parliament would continue to ignore them when amending that original scheme. The 1999 amendments were not a wholesale rethink of the child support calculation such as took place in 2000. The declared intention was to make minor adjustments which would improve its administration. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75.&nbsp;&nbsp;The contrary interpretation depends upon reading the regulations alongside the Inland Revenue forms. Those forms are prescribed by the Inland Revenue under statutory powers but they are not prescribed by law. They could be redesigned tomorrow. At present, the tax return contains a box labelled "total taxable profits from this business" (<i>not</i>, incidentally, "total taxable profits from self-employment" which is the phrase we have to construe). But it could be labelled something else. Or something else could be labelled "total taxable profits". There would be nothing irrational in tax law terms if the form contained a box so labelled which produced the figure defined in (A) above. The present form is designed to be filled in directly from the trading profit and loss account, which will of course contain both allowable and disallowable expenses, to produce a net profit or loss figure. It then adds back in the disallowable expenses, but it happens not to include a box for the resulting figure. Then it takes off the sum, claimed in a completely different part of the form, for capital allowances. It would make complete sense to have an intervening box which represented the gross turnover less direct costs and allowable expenses only, making the net profit chargeable to tax. It might even be labelled 'taxable profits'. Indeed, the form would be a great deal easier to follow if it did. But there is nothing at all difficult about calculating the sum which that box would contain. A child support officer could be given a simple instruction about how to do it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a general proposition, one would not expect to interpret the regulations which Parliament has made by reference to a form produced by a Government Department. One would expect a Government Department to produce a form which reflected what Parliament required or expected. The same applies to the alternative argument based upon paragraph 2B and the contents of a tax calculation notice. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, which are simply a postscript to the reasons given by my noble and learned friend, Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe, with which I agree, I too would allow the appeal and restore the decision of the Child Support Commissioner. I would add one further postscript. In common with Lord Walker, I see considerable force in the argument that a state which prevents a parent with care from claiming child support through the ordinary court system has a positive obligation to provide an effective alternative system. The state has a positive obligation under article 8 of the European Convention to take steps which permit the child's integration in his own family: see <i>Marckx v Belgium</i> (1979) 2 EHRR 330. The child can scarcely benefit from family life if there is not enough to live on. But I accept that it is a considerable feat of interpretation to spell the "right to receive regular, reasonable maintenance" (for which Mr Mostyn QC so persuasively contends) out of the right to respect for family life in article 8. The European Court of Human Rights, however, also looks to other international human rights instruments when interpreting its own Convention. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child is quite specific on this topic. Article 27.2 provides for the basic parental responsibility:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The parent(s) or others responsible for the child have the primary responsibility to secure, within their abilities and financial capacities, the conditions of living necessary for the child's development."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 27.4 requires States Parties to back this up:</p>
<p></p><ul>"States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to secure the recovery of maintenance for the child from the parents or other persons having financial responsibility for the child . . ." <p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78.&nbsp;&nbsp;This father's turnover in the year 2000-2001 was £284,570. His net profit, taking into account allowable and non-allowable expenses such as depreciation, was £61,305. But after capital allowances were deducted the sum on which income tax was calculated came down to £20,892. This bore no relationship to his actual earnings that year. It bore no relationship to actual profitability of his business as reflected in his accounts. Taking it as the basis for a child support calculation meant that he had to pay a sum in child support which no-one could consider appropriate to secure the proper development of the children of a man in his station in life. Even if an international treaty has not been incorporated into domestic law, our domestic legislation has to be construed so far as possible so as to comply with the international obligations which we have undertaken. When two interpretations of these regulations are possible, the interpretation chosen should be that which better complies with the commitment to the welfare of children which this country has made by ratifying the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>
<p><b>LORD CARSWELL</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79.&nbsp;&nbsp;Statutory construction constitutes quite a sizeable proportion of the work of appellate judges.  The instances and topics on which they have to engage in this exercise are multifarious, but its object is always the same, to ascertain the intention of Parliament as expressed in the instrument which has to be construed.  In a judicial utopia every statute or statutory instrument would be expressed with such clarity and would cover every contingency so effectively that interpretation would be straightforward and the only task of the courts would be to apply their terms.  Utopia has not yet arrived, however, and judges facing the interpretation of ambiguous or obscure provisions must use the well-worn tools of statutory construction to arrive at a result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80.&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem facing the House and the issue which has to be resolved have been set out by my noble and learned friend Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe and I adopt his exposition with even more than the conventional gratitude.  Reduced to its barest bones, even barer than the Child Support Commissioner's admirably clear and succinct summary set out in paragraph 54 of Lord Walker's opinion, it is whether for the purpose of calculation of a self-employed earner's liability to pay child support maintenance the phrase "total taxable profits … as submitted to the Inland Revenue" is intended to be interpreted in such a way that any capital allowances which he can claim in the tax year can be deducted or whether such allowances should be left out of account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81.&nbsp;&nbsp;The phrase "total taxable profits" is not a term of art bearing a defined and ascertainable meaning in tax law or child support law.  It is on its face ambiguous and its meaning cannot be determined by applying the plain meaning test of statutory interpretation.  One must therefore have resort to such aids as the mischief which the legislation was intended to meet, the legislative history and the consequences which would ensue from either construction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82.&nbsp;&nbsp;The clearly apparent objective of the enactment of paragraph 2A of the Child Support (Maintenance Assessments and Special Cases) Regulations 1992 SI 1992/1815 ("MASC"), as added by the 1999 amending regulations, was the simplification of administrative arrangements, in the hope of speeding up the assessment of parents' liability for child support.  If support for this view is needed, it may be found in the introduction of the provision in Parliament by Baroness Hollis of Heigham, set out in paragraph 42 of Lord Walker's opinion, in which she described the old arrangements as cumbersome (one of the less pejorative descriptions which have been applied to them).  As Lord Walker says, the change was presented as an administrative improvement, not as a change of substance.  One may conclude with some confidence that Parliament did not start with the intention of effecting a potentially enormous reduction in liability for child support of a number of self-employed earners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also apparent from examination of the history of child support legislation and tax legislation that depreciation of capital assets was not historically an allowable set-off against profits (see Lord Walker's opinion at paragraph 51).  The rule against deducting an allowance for depreciation is one of very long standing.  It is based upon the distinction for tax purposes between property and earnings or profits.  That distinction appears to be predicated upon the thesis that capital assets (such as the mine in <i>Coltness Iron Co v Black </i>(1881) 6 App Cas 315) are enduring and will remain available into the future for the benefit of their owner.  On this reasoning an allowance fell to be made in <i>Coltness Iron Co v Black </i>for the cost of working the mine, but not for the cost of making it (per Lord Penzance at p 326).  The owner would, however, be entitled to deduct interest payments on any loan taken out for acquisition of the asset.  This might be regarded in economic terms as over-simplistic, for it cannot be doubted that some capital assets are wasting and their value will decline and even in some cases disappear with the passage of time.  It has long been appreciated, however, that if depreciation could be claimed as an allowance it would be open to a taxpayer to manipulate the amount of his profits to suit his own fiscal interests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of an allowance for depreciation, the taxpayer can claim the benefit of the capital allowances provided for in legislation.  As the Child Support Commissioner clearly appreciated (see paras 22-4 of his decision), these allowances, which are governed by formidably complicated provisions, are extremely variable between taxpayers, types of expenditure and regions.  They are, as he pointed out in para 29, part of the macro-economic management of the economy carried out by governments, leading to considerable fluctuations in their amount.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the inception of the child support legislation no allowance has been made for any capital expenditure or the depreciation of any capital asset: see paragraph 3(4)(b) of Schedule 1 to MASC as originally enacted.  By paragraph 2C that provision becomes applicable where it is not reasonably practicable for the earner to provide information relating to his total taxable profits in the Inland Revenue form.  Therein lies the anomaly resulting from the decision of the Court of Appeal whose unfairness is at the heart of the appellant's case.  The effect of that decision is that if paragraph 2A applies, the parent paying child support can deduct capital allowances in order to arrive at the figure of total taxable profits; whereas if circumstances are such that paragraph 3 applies, no such deduction can be made.  The difference between the figures produced by the two methods may be relatively huge, as the present case demonstrates, and the lower figure may result, as in the present case, in very serious under-provision by way of child support.  I find it impossible to suppose that Parliament intended to enact a provision that would bring about such anomalous and potentially unjust results.  That anomaly and injustice will not in my view be sufficiently remedied by resort to a departure direction, which influenced the Court of Appeal, in particular Wall LJ (at para 67 of his judgment).  The sad history of the present case, as related in Part II of the appellant's printed case, does not engender any feeling of confidence that departure directions will be a panacea.  Nor does the somewhat defensive reaction of the Secretary of State to criticisms of the legislation lead one confidently to expect the enactment of early amending legislation removing the anomaly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86.&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasoning which I have set out so far leads one ineluctably towards the conclusion that Parliament did not intend that capital allowances should be deductible in assessing a self-employed earner's total taxable profits for the purpose of child support payments.  But the Court of Appeal reached the opposite conclusion, by reason of the fact that the exact phrase "total taxable profits" is found in the standard form of self-assessment tax return submitted by self-employed persons to the Inland Revenue.  It is clear from the form, as Lord Walker has demonstrated in detail, that in arriving at the sum which is to be inserted in box 3.92 under the heading "Total taxable profits from this business" capital allowances will have been deducted.  Ward LJ expressed his conclusion from this in paragraph 40 of his judgment in the laconic syllogism:</p>
<p></p><ul>"One must, therefore, look to the tax return to see if that assists in ascertaining 'total taxable profits'.  It does assist.  We find the answer in box 3.92: 'Total taxable profits from this business'.  There it is.  QED."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87.&nbsp;&nbsp;My noble and learned friend Lord Rodger of Earlsferry has in paragraphs 13 and 14 of his opinion given trenchantly argued reasons why he is impelled to the view that it is most likely that the draftsman of the new paragraph 2A had a copy of the self-assessment tax return before him when preparing the amendment.  He draws the conclusion that he intended, and Parliament must be taken to have intended from the expressed words of the provision enacted, that the phrase "total taxable profits" in paragraph 2A should bear the same meaning as in box 3.92 in the form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88.&nbsp;&nbsp;I share his difficulty in supposing that the use of the same phrase was a mere coincidence.  But I am not satisfied that that is the end of the search.  The conclusion reached by Lord Rodger and the Court of Appeal was that the draftsman must have meant to point to the place in the self-assessment tax return form current at the time of drafting, viz box 3.92, and incorporated by reference the figure appearing in that place in each such return as the figure which was to determine conclusively the self-employed earner's liability for child support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a commonplace of statutory construction to inquire into the archaeology of a phrase appearing in a statutory provision.  If one's quest results in the discovery of the identical phrase in earlier legislation, one can usually assume that Parliament intended to use it in the same sense in the later enactment.  This reasoning is predicated upon the assumption that Parliament would have known of the earlier use of the phrase and intended for the sake of consistency to give it the same meaning in the later provision.  I can for my part accept that the draftsman in choosing the phrase "total taxable profits … as submitted to the Inland Revenue", and Parliament in enacting it in the amendments to MASC, were looking towards the appropriate figure as set out in the tax return, and that the intention of Parliament was to direct the process of assessment of child support in a simple and expeditious manner to that figure.  But in order to accept the respondents' contention in the present case one has to suppose that the legislature wished to make the process so simple and straightforward that an official of the Child Support Agency merely has metaphorically to tick a box and enter in a mechanistic fashion the figure contained in a certain entry in a tax return.  That supposition takes little account of the possibility that tax forms may change in layout and content, bearing in mind that the phrase "total taxable profits" is not a term of art in tax law or practice.  I cannot accept that Parliament wished to have matters of such consequence determined by the layout of an Inland Revenue form.  To link liability for child support with the content of box 3.92 is so contrary to all other indications of what Parliament intended in enacting paragraph 2A that I cannot suppose that Parliament intended to achieve a result whereby capital allowances could be deducted, with the grossly skewed consequences apparent in the present case.  This would allow the assessment of liability for child support to be determined by the way in which the compiler of the form required the components of the taxpayer's profits to be set out.  I am mindful of the principle that one must have regard to the expressed intention of Parliament as contained in the words which it has used.  I consider, however, that the proper conclusion to be drawn from its use of the phrase "total taxable profits … as submitted to the Inland Revenue" is that it wished to simplify and speed matters by adopting the figures in the tax return to reach the proper earnings figure.  Its object was to obviate the necessity for parents liable for payment of child support maintenance to furnish accounts, the source of much previous delay, but still to assess the correct and proper amounts which they were liable to pay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion one is entitled to place less emphasis on the coincidence in wording and return to the exercise of attempting by the use of the several recognised methods of statutory interpretation to ascertain the true intention of Parliament.  It might well be that in an ideal world it might be thought no less than fair to make some allowance for depreciation of capital assets in assessing profits for present purposes.  Especially in a case such as the present, they may represent wasting assets which decline in value, perhaps markedly in a fairly short time.  But no such provision was made in the legislation for child support prior to the enactment of paragraph 2A, and when an assessment is carried out in accordance with paragraph 3 no deduction may be made for either depreciation or capital allowances.  In taxation law no deduction for depreciation is allowable and the taxpayer is left to the shifting imperatives of the capital allowance system.  As between the stark alternatives, deducting the whole of the capital allowances payable to Mr Smith or leaving them out of account, I consider that the correct conclusion is that it was not intended that capital allowances should be deductible.</p>
