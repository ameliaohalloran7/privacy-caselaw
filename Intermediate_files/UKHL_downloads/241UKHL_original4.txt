<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appellant claims that the judge should have treated the reduced susceptibility to treatment and the reduced prospects of a complete recovery that was its consequence as the loss of a thing of value to him which was the result of a proven injury.  So he should have quantified this loss in accordance with ordinary principles.  Alternatively he should have compensated him for the extent that the delay reduced his prospect of a complete recovery measured by the statistical evidence.  The compensation that was sought was not just for general damages for the appellant's awareness that his life had been shortened and for his pain and mental suffering.  It included a substantial element of special damages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact has to be faced that the appellant was not able to prove on a balance of probabilities that had it not been for the enlargement of the tumour he would have made a complete recovery.  But his case differs from those such as <i>Kenyon v Bell</i> 1953  SC 125 and <i>Hotson v East Berkshire Area Health Authority</i> [1987]  AC 750.  In those cases, as Lord Mackay of Clashfern pointed out in <i>Hotson</i> at p 785, the fundamental question of fact to be answered related to a point in time before the negligent failure to treat began, and it was to be treated therefore as a matter of past fact.  He returned to this point at the end of his speech where, having examined the judgments in <i>Herskovits v Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound</i> (1983)  664 P2d 474, he said at pp 789-790:</p>
<p></p><ul>"I have selected references to the views expressed by the judges who took part in this decision to illustrate the variety of views open in this difficult area of the law.  These confirm me in the view that it would not be right in the present case to affirm the general proposition for which Mr Whitfield contended [that damages could not be awarded for loss of a chance: see p 783].  On the other hand, none of the views canvassed in <i>Herskovits' </i>case, 664 P2d 474, would lead to the plaintiff succeeding in the present case since the judge's findings in fact mean that the sole cause of the plaintiff's avascular necrosis was the injury he sustained in the original fall, and that implies, as I have said, that when he arrived at the authority's hospital for the first time he had no chance of avoiding it.  Accordingly, the subsequent negligence of the authority did not cause him the loss of such a chance."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109.&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge in this case said that the time for evaluating what would have happened in the past is the trial, and that that is the time when what would have happened has to be established on the balance of probability (para 42).  In my opinion he fell into error at this point.  The question is whether, given the state of facts which existed before the defendants' negligence, the loss could have been avoided if things had been done differently.  This case is different from <i>Hotson</i>, where the probable effect of the delay in treatment was determined by the state of facts existing when the plaintiff was admitted to hospital.  So, as Lord Mackay put it in the passage I have just quoted, he had no chance of avoiding the consequences of that delay.  Any suggestion that he was entitled to damages because his expectation of life had been reduced by the delay in treatment would, of course, have received the same answer.  In this case the enlargement of the tumour - the injury which affected the appellant's prospects of a successful recovery - still lay in the future when the appellant was seen by the doctor.  The entire case rests on the hypothesis that his illness might have taken a different course but for <i>this</i> injury which was caused by the delay in treatment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110.&nbsp;&nbsp;The case differs too from <i>Herskovits v Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound</i> (1983)  664 P2d 474, to which Lord Mackay referred in <i>Hotson</i>, where the claim was for damages in respect of Mr Herskovits' death.<i> </i> In our case the appellant is happily still alive.  In <i>Hotson</i>, p 782<i> </i>Lord Bridge of Harwich stated that while in some cases, perhaps particularly medical negligence cases, causation may be so shrouded in mystery that the court can only measure statistical chances, the general rule is that the issue as to the cause of a past event must be resolved on a balance of probabilities.  Those cases did not need to deal with the problem of how to prove hypothetical events that still lay in the future on the date of the alleged negligence - events which, as Lord Nicholls has pointed out, the defendant's wrongful conduct precluded from ever materialising.  In this case the effect of the judge's findings is that the probable sequence of setbacks and treatments and the prospects of a successful outcome were already determined by the state of facts when the doctor saw the appellant in November 1994.  But the enlargement of the tumour which was caused by the doctor's negligence still lay in the future, and it is on the enlargement of the tumour and its consequences for the prospects of recovery that the appellant's cause of action is based.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111.&nbsp;&nbsp;It hardly needs to be said that predicting someone's expectation of life from any given date is almost always an uncertain exercise.  Leaving aside those cases where death is imminent and inevitable, the exercise is beset with uncertainty.  The best one can do is identify the factors, good and bad, and assess their effect on the individual's prospects.  The same is true where the claim is for the reduced prospects of survival following illness or injury.  Nevertheless where a person claims that his expected date of death is earlier than it would have been if he had not sustained injury due to the defendant's negligence, the ordinary rule is that he must prove this fact and the extent of the diminution in his prospects on the balance of probabilities.  Statistics may act as a guide.  In some cases they may be the only guide that it is available.  But they are no more than a guide to that which must be proved.  This is because the claim is personal to the individual.  It is the effect of the injury on his own prospects of survival that sounds in damages, not the effect which injuries of that type may have on the population generally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112.&nbsp;&nbsp;The simple case is where the comparison is between the date of a person's expected date of death due to an injury and the date when he would have been expected to die if he was in good health and had not sustained that injury.  In cases of that kind actuarial tables are commonly used to identify the person's expectation life if he had not sustained the injury.  What then has to be proved on the balance of probabilities is that his expectation of life has been reduced by the injury and, if so, the amount of the reduction.  The comparison is between the product of an exercise of statistics on the one hand and an assessment of the effects of the injury on the individual's expectation of achieving it on the other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113.&nbsp;&nbsp;But that is not the position in this case.  The evidence was that the appellant was already suffering from cancer when he was seen by the doctor.  It had reduced his expectation of life in any event.  Even if there had been no delay, the cancer had reduced his expectation of life below that indicated by actuarial tables for a man of his age who was in good health.  To this extent the die was cast by facts out of the doctor's control before his involvement.  So the comparison on which the appellant's case depends is between two assessments - the effects of the tumour on his life expectancy when the doctor saw him, assuming there was no delay in its treatment thereafter, and the effects on his life expectancy of its enlargement during the period of delay due to the doctor's negligence.  It was proved on the balance of probabilities that there was indeed a difference between these two assessments as a matter of statistics, viewing the position across the population generally.  But it was not proved that this appellant had an expectation of a different outcome to his treatment, in the events which happened, from what his expectation would have been if there had been no negligence.  This was because his prospects of a complete recovery when the doctor saw him were assessed at less that 50% in any event.  Putting the matter another way, it was not proved that he would have survived the effects of his cancer if there had been no negligence.  But, in contrast to the situation in <i>Hotson</i>, the fundamental questions of fact relate to a point in time after the date of the doctor's negligence. The actionable injury in this case - the enlargement of the tumour - occurred after that date.  It was caused by the delay in diagnosis.  All the judges in the Court of Appeal were agreed on that point.  It was this injury which caused a significant reduction in the appellant's prospects of a successful outcome.</p>
<i><p><i>Discussion</i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is plain that the court was not in a position in this case to base its decision on the assumption that the appellant would have achieved a complete recovery but for the doctor's negligence.  It was not proved that prompt diagnosis and treatment would have made any difference to his life expectancy.  This was because it was not proved that the treatment would have been successful however prompt had been the diagnosis.  Must the conclusion then be that no damages are due for the proved and significant reduction in the prospects of a favourable outcome, notwithstanding the fact that this was caused by a delay in treatment which it was within the scope of the doctor's duty to prevent when he examined his patient?  I think that the law would be defective if that had to be the result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Kenyon</i> and <i>Hotson</i>, as I have said, the fundamental questions of fact as to whether or not the treatment would have been successful related to a point of time before the negligent failure in treatment.  On the facts of those cases the question whether the loss would have occurred if there had been no negligence had to be treated as a question of past fact.  The settled rule is that what has happened in the past must be proved on a balance of probabilities.  As the issue in these cases related to a point of time before the alleged negligence, they did not raise any hypothetical question as to what the position might have been had events turned out differently.  It can also be said that the loss of the opportunity that prompt treatment would have given for a different outcome was not the way the claim was presented in either case.   In <i>Kenyon's</i> case the claim was the loss of the eye.  In <i>Hotson's</i> case it was for the avascular necrosis.  Commenting on those decisions in <i>Kyle v P &amp; J Stormonth Darling WS,</i> 1992  SLT 264, 267A-B, Lord Prosser said that the loss of opportunity was part of the causal sequence which might or might not have led to the damnum or loss resulting from the injuria, but that the damnum lay not in the loss of opportunity but in the loss of the eye or the necrosis.  That approach does not fit with the facts of this case.  It is distinguishable on its facts from <i>Hotson</i> because at the date of the doctor's negligence the effect of the delay on the appellant's prospects of a successful outcome still lay in the future.  The question which would have been of compelling interest to the appellant, the answer to which could at best only be assessed and predicted at that date, was what his prospects were of a successful outcome assuming that the tumour was treated immediately.  The essence of his claim lies in the effect which the enlargement of the tumour caused by the doctor's negligence had on this contingency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116.&nbsp;&nbsp;What then was the nature of this contingency?  Some forms of cancer are notoriously difficult to treat.  But treatment is undertaken nevertheless, in the hope that the patient will survive at the end of it.  The earlier it is discovered, the better are the prospects of treating it successfully.  The patient values his prospects of survival, even if he is told that they are less than fifty-fifty.  It should make no difference whether his prospects are over fifty-fifty or less than that, so long as they were significant and not illusory.  If the prospects were speculative or illusory, the law will ignore them.  <i>De minimis non curat Praetor.</i>  But if they were significant the appellant is entitled to feel that he has lost something if something was done, or omitted to be done, which reduced those prospects.  It is not right to describe this simply as the loss of a chance.  It has been demonstrated that there was a significant reduction in his prospects of a successful outcome.  Irrespective of whether it is proved that in his case the cancer was capable of being treated successfully, the fact is that his prospects of a successful outcome were significantly less than they would have been but for the doctor's negligence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117.&nbsp;&nbsp;The key to the decision in this case lies, I think, in the way in which the appellant's cause of action is identified.  The description of it as a claim for the loss of a chance is invited by the approach which the pleader has taken to the issue of damages.  The description is apt in cases where the claim is for an economic loss or the loss of something to which the claimant has a right, such as in <i>Chaplin v Hicks</i> [1911]  2 KB 786 and <i>Kitchen v Royal Air Force Association</i> [1958]  1 WLR 563.  But that is not what this claim is about.  It is, in essence, a claim for the loss and damage caused by the enlargement of the tumour due to the delay in diagnosis.  It is for the loss and damage caused, in other words, by a physical injury which the appellant would not have suffered but for the doctor's negligence.  The fact that there was a physical injury has been proved on a balance of probabilities.  So too has the fact that, in addition to pain and suffering, it caused a reduction in the prospects of a successful outcome.  I would hold that, where these factors are present, the way is open for losses which are consequential on the physical injury to be claimed too.  I do not think that those consequences of the physical injury should be treated as if they were the product of a separate cause of action from the pain and suffering.  I see the reduction in the prospects of a successful outcome as one element among several in the claim for which there is a single cause - the enlargement of the tumour.  This was a physical injury, the avoidance or minimisation of which was within the scope of the doctor's duty of care when the appellant consulted him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would distinguish this case from those where a claim is made for compensation for a disease from which the claimant does not presently suffer and with which, perhaps more likely than not, he will not ever be afflicted.  In cases of that kind the claim that there is an increased risk of contracting the disease may be regarded as a speculative claim for future harm.  It will be dismissed if the claimant cannot prove on a balance of probabilities that he will suffer from the disease.  In this case the appellant was already suffering from the cancer from which he claims, as result of the doctor's negligence, to have a diminished prospect of a successful recovery.  I would distinguish it too from cases where the evidence shows that on a balance of probabilities the claimant would have suffered the damage in question anyway because of other factors not related to the wrongdoer's negligence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119.&nbsp;&nbsp;An analogy may be drawn with cases where it is proved that a person's employment prospects, or his prospects of promotion, have been adversely affected by a physical injury.  The claimant is not required, in a case of that kind, to prove on a balance of probabilities what his employment record would have been or that he would in fact have been promoted but for his injury.  It is enough for him to prove that there was a prospect immediately before he was injured which he has lost due to the wrongdoer's negligence.  The claim is for the loss of prospects assessed as at that date, not for the loss of a certainty.  Some evidence is, of course, needed to enable the court to assess those prospects.  Without that evidence the claim would be speculative, as any decision would be based on pure guesswork.  But the law does not insist on proof that events would in fact have taken the course that the prospects relied upon have indicated: see, for example, the approach which Griffiths LJ took to the claim for loss of earnings in the case of a very young child in <i>Croke v Wiseman</i> [1982]  1 WLR 71, 83; see also<i> Doyle v Wallace</i> [1998]  PIQR Q146, where there was a significant chance that the claimant would have qualified and become a drama teacher, and <i>Langford v Hebran</i>  [2001] PIQR, Q160 where the claimant's chances of achieving fame and fortune as a kick-boxer at various stages in his career were evaluated on a scale from 80% to 20% and damages for his loss of earnings awarded accordingly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120.&nbsp;&nbsp;Other examples of this approach to the part that loss of prospects plays in the assessment of awards of damages for a physical injury can be found in the awards made for the loss of prospects of marriage: see <i>Harris v Harris</i> [1973]  1 Lloyd's Rep 445, 447 per Lord Denning MR; <i>Hughes v McKeown</i> [1985]  1 WLR 963.  In <i>Girvan v Inverness Farmers Dairy</i>, 1996  SC 135, 137 Lord McCluskey noted that one of the heads of claim that were not in dispute in that case was that the pursuer's injuries had made it impossible for him to continue as a dedicated clay pigeon shot and had as a result lost the very real prospect of winning substantial cash prizes and other valuable trophies and prizes.  It seems to me that the appellant's claim for the diminution in his prospects of a successful outcome from his treatment for cancer falls into the same pattern.  That there was a diminution in his prospects is not just a matter of speculation or guesswork.  There was sufficient evidence to establish this as a fact.  He could not prove that he was denied a cure for his cancer.  His prospects of a successful outcome were already less than fifty-fifty.  But they were nevertheless significant.  And he proved that his chance of a cure was reduced as a result of the physical injury caused by doctor's negligence.  In my opinion he is entitled to receive recognition of that fact in an award of damages.</p>
<i><p><i>Conclusion</i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would hold therefore that the significant reduction in the prospects of a successful outcome which the negligence caused is a loss for which the appellant is entitled to be compensated.  If it is necessary to prove that this loss was caused by a physical injury, the enlargement of the tumour which the negligence caused was such an injury.  But I agree with Lord Nicholls that the fact that the appellant was already suffering from illness at the date of the doctor's negligence from which he had at that date significant prospects of recovery provides him with a cause of action for the reduction in those prospects that resulted from the negligence.  I also agree with him that what has to be valued is what the appellant has lost, and that the principle on which that loss must be calculated is the same irrespective of whether the prospects were better or less than 50%.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion the correct starting point for the award for the reduction in prospects is the judge's assessment of the prospects of a successful outcome if the doctor had not been negligent.  The loss which he would have suffered should be calculated in the first place on the assumption that what the appellant lost when he was seen by the doctor was the certainty of a complete recovery.  The result of that calculation will then need to be discounted to reflect the judge's findings as to the prospects of a complete recovery in view of the nature of the cancer from which the appellant was already suffering when the doctor was negligent.  For the reasons which he explained in para 51 of his judgment, the judge would have discounted the damages that he would have awarded for the loss of a certainty of a cure by 80%.  I would hold that the discounting exercise which he undertook was the right approach in principle, although the figures which led the judge to his conclusion are difficult to reconcile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reasons which I have given at the outset of this opinion, however, I had hoped that it was not too late for the pain and suffering which the appellant suffered due to the tumour's enlargement and the distress caused by his awareness that his condition had been misdiagnosed to be brought into account by way of an award of general damages.  Unless this is done the appellant will be left with no remedy at all for the consequences of the doctor's negligence.  Very properly, as the facts that are needed are already there in the evidence and the action remains alive until this appeal and any further proceedings which may flow from it have been disposed of, the respondent does not suggest that it would be either incompetent or unfair for the claimant to seek such an award at this stage.  The majority view that the appeal must be dismissed has deprived the appellant of that opportunity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;124.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is worth noting also that in their response to written submissions which the appellant's counsel provided at the invitation of the House after the hearing on the issue of quantum counsel for the respondent accepted that, if an award were to be made of general damages which reflected merely the direct physical consequences of the delay and any consequent apprehension about early mortality, they should not be reduced in consequence of any loss of a chance argument.  In my opinion this is a correct statement of the approach which should be taken when an award of that kind is being made.  That remains the conventional way of dealing with an award of general damages, whatever the facts may be on which it is based.</p>
LORD PHILLIPS OF WORTH MATRAVERS
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125.&nbsp;&nbsp;This appeal has raised an important issue of policy. Should this House introduce into the law of clinical negligence the right of a patient who has suffered an adverse event to recover damages for the loss of a chance of a more favourable outcome? My noble and learned friend Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead has simplified the facts in order to identify with clarity the nature of this issue. I propose to take a different approach. I intend to wrestle with the complexities raised by the facts of this case. I do so because I have found it helpful, when considering the change in our law that is proposed, to examine the practical consequences of the change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;126.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten years ago Dr Scott negligently failed to take appropriate action when his patient, Mr Gregg, drew his attention to a lump in his armpit. The negligence delayed by nine months the commencement of Mr Gregg's treatment for cancer. Mr Gregg is entitled to damages for the adverse consequences of this delay. It is impossible to say with certainty what, if any adverse consequences were caused by the delay. In these circumstances an attempt has been made, with the help of medical expert evidence, to estimate in terms of percentage the chance that the delay caused the adverse consequences. The exercise has not been a simple one. It has involved the use of statistics. It does not appear that either the judge or the parties had the assistance of a statistician. Nor have we. In these circumstances I have felt some diffidence about forming my own conclusions about the import of the evidence. None the less, after lengthy reflection, I have reached the conclusion that counsel and the Court of Appeal have misunderstood both the effect of the evidence and the findings made by the trial judge, Judge Inglis, in relation to that evidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;127.&nbsp;&nbsp;Four matters have complicated the task of evaluating the evidence in this case:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i)&nbsp;&nbsp;The complexity and yet the paucity of the statistical evidence;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;The procedural history;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;The novel approach taken on behalf of Mr Gregg to his claim for "lost years";</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that Mr Gregg is still alive some nine years after the commencement of his treatment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose to say a word about each, before embarking on a more detailed consideration of the facts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;128.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The statistical evidence:</i> Each side employed a medical expert and these reached a measure of agreement. Ultimately only Mr Gregg's expert, Professor Goldstone, gave evidence. He developed a model showing the expected fate of 100 patients diagnosed with the type of cancer from which Mr Gregg suffered, although the data on that type of cancer was sparse. He gave additional oral evidence about the effect on Mr Gregg's prognosis of the delay in commencing his treatment and on his expectation of life as at the date of the trial. The task of drawing from the totality of this evidence quantitative conclusions as to the effect of the delay on Mr Gregg's clinical history and on his expectation of life is particularly difficult. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;129.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The procedural history</i>: Mr Gregg's claim was initially advanced as a conventional claim for having been deprived of an early and complete cure. This was on the basis of medical evidence that, on balance of probabilities, but for the delay in commencing his treatment he would have achieved such a cure. Before the trial, however, it was discovered that Mr Gregg had a rare type of cancer with a less favourable prognosis. This led Mr Gregg to advance an alternative claim for damages for the reduction of the chance of a favourable outcome. The judge held that Mr Gregg had failed to prove, on balance of probabilities, that the delay in commencing his treatment had adversely affected his clinical experience or expectation of life. He held that the alternative claim for loss of a chance was bad in law. He went on, however, to make findings that would have been relevant to such a claim and to sketch out the approach to quantifying damages in respect of such a claim.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;130.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Court of Appeal the focus was largely on Mr Gregg's claim for loss of expectation of life. Before this House submissions focussed exclusively on loss of expectation of life. It seemed to us that it was not possible to approach the issues raised without also considering whether and on what basis Mr Gregg had a claim to other heads of damages. We sought further written submissions in respect of damages. The response to that request has persuaded me that the issue of principle raised by this appeal must be considered in the context of all heads of damages claimed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;131.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The claim for lost years:</i> In <i>Pickett v British Rail Engineering</i> [1980] AC 136 this House determined that where a defendant negligently causes bodily injury to a claimant which reduces the claimant's expectation of life, the claimant is entitled to recover as a head of damage the earnings lost in the "lost years". Where such a claim is advanced, the conventional way of determining the effect of the injury on expectation of life is as follows. The court determines what the claimant's expectation of life would have been but for the injury. The court then determines what the claimant's expectation of life is having regard to the effect of the injury. The difference between the two constitutes the "lost years". Statistical evidence is usually used in calculating both limbs of the determination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;132.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case an unconventional approach to claiming for lost years has been adopted. Mr Gregg's claim has been advanced on the basis of the effect of Dr Scott's negligence on Mr Gregg's chance of being alive and disease free after 10 years. This, as I understand it, is treated for the purposes of medical statistics as being cured. I shall describe survival disease free after 10 years as "being a survivor". It is not quite clear to me what is the starting point for this 10 year period. I think that it is probably the date of commencement of treatment.</p>
