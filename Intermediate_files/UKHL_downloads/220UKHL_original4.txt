<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;64.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case the Divisional Court did not have that opportunity.  It is common ground that prior to the Divisional Court hearing the Home Secretary offered the appellants a procedure (involving the use of a Special Advocate) whereby the Divisional Court could review in closed session the underlying intelligence material on the basis of which the Home Secretary had confirmed the authorisation.  But the offer was not taken up and the relevant evidence, given by Catherine Byrne, a senior civil servant in the Home Office, was of an unspecific character (see paras.11 to 18 of her witness statement).  In that state of the evidence the Divisional Court could not reasonably have concluded that the authorisation was a disproportionate response to the threat of terrorist activity in London appearing from the available intelligence material.  Nor could the Court of Appeal and nor, in my opinion, can your Lordships.  What the position would have been had the underlying intelligence material been reviewed it is impossible to tell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;65.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore reject the challenge to the validity of the authorisation and its confirmation by the Home Secretary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appellants say also that, even if the authorisation and its confirmation were valid, the stopping and searching to which each of them was subjected was unlawful.  Section 45 of the Act makes clear that the exercise of the section 44 stop and search power</p>
<p></p><ul>"â€¦ may be exercised only for the purpose of searching for articles of a kind which could be used in connection with terrorism" (ss(1)(a)).<p></p></ul>
<p>It follows that if the section 44 stop and search power is used for some other purpose, its use is unlawful.  Each of the appellants has formed the view that he/she was stopped and searched for public order reasons not connected with terrorism but with protests and disturbances that the police apprehended might occur at the Docklands arms fair.  Each of them has commenced county court proceedings claiming damages in tort.  These contentions raise issues of fact which can be resolved in the county court proceedings but cannot assist the appellants on this appeal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;67.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having had the advantage of reading in advance the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood I would like to associate myself with his comments about random searches.  Whether a stop and search is random depends on whether the question is asked from the point of view of the searcher or that of the searched.  From the point of view of the person searched the police officer's choice of him or her to be subjected to a search may seem entirely random, or may seem absurd or discriminatory or vindictive.  But from the point of view of the police officer, it is difficult to see how the choice could ever be a random one.  A policy of stopping and searching every tenth person is not a random search; it is a search that follows a pattern.  The pattern would allow the police officer no room for judgment as to who to stop and search.  It would therefore be a pattern designed to minimise the chances of achieving the statutory purpose of combating terrorism.  In the real world a police officer will always have some reason for selecting a particular individual as a person to be stopped and searched.  The reason does not have to be based on grounds for suspicion (see s.45(1)(b)).  It may be based, as Lord Brown has said, on no more that a professional's intuition.  Or it may be because the person selected conforms to some extent in the mind of the police officer to a stereotype of a person who might possibly be in possession of articles "which could be used in connection with terrorism" (s.45(1)(a)).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;68.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Brown has raised the question whether an exercise of the section 44 power more frequently with regard to persons of Asian appearance than to others can be reconciled with the requirements of domestic discrimination law.  This issue was not addressed by counsel but, speaking for myself, I do not think that domestic discrimination law would invalidate what otherwise would be a lawful use of stop and search powers conferred by the 2000 Act.  If and to the extent that a use of stop and search powers for the statutory purpose expressed in section 45(1) might require some degree of stereotyping in the selection of the persons to be stopped and searched and arguably, therefore, some discrimination, that use would, I think, be validated by the statutory authority of the 2000 Act (see s.41(1)(a) and s.42 of the Race Relations Act 1976, as amended).  I do not, therefore, share the concerns of my noble and learned friend about the implications of the <i>Roma Rights</i> case [2005] 2 AC 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;69.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would dismiss these appeals.</p>
LORD WALKER OF GESTINGTHORPE
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in full agreement with the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill, which I have had the privilege of reading in draft. For the reasons given by Lord Bingham I would dismiss these appeals.</p>
<p><b>LORD BROWN OF EATON-UNDER-HEYWOOD</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;71.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the advantage of reading in draft the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill.  So completely do I agree with it that much of what I had intended to say now seems superfluous.  The appeal does, however, raise points of real constitutional importance and on one particular aspect of it I would still like to express certain thoughts of my own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sections 44 and 45 of the Terrorism Act 2000 ("the 2000 Act") allow police officers in certain circumstances to stop and search members of the public innocently going about their business (whether in a vehicle or on foot) without the officer having to have any grounds whatever for suspecting the person of the least wrongdoing.  Those two sections, together with the other relevant legislation, are to be found in Lord Bingham's opinion and it is quite unnecessary to set them out afresh.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73.&nbsp;&nbsp;Put shortly, these provisions enable an authorisation to be given (if considered expedient for the prevention of acts of terrorism) which in turn confers upon police officers the power to stop and search vehicles, their drivers, passengers and contents, and also pedestrians.  The power may be exercised only to search for articles of a kind useful in connection with terrorism (which the constable can then retain if he reasonably suspects that such was their intended use), but it is exercisable irrespective of whether the constable has grounds for suspecting the presence of articles of that kind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74.&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the exceptional (although, as Lord Bingham has explained, neither unique nor particularly novel) nature of that power (often described as the power of random search, requiring for its exercise no reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing), it is unsurprisingly hedged about with a wide variety of restrictions and safeguards.  Those most directly relevant to the way in which the power impacts upon the public on the ground are perhaps these.  It can be used only by a constable in uniform (section 44 (1) and (2)).  It can be used only to search for terrorist-connected articles (section 45(1) (a)).  The person searched must not be required to remove any clothing in public except for headgear, footwear, an outer coat, a jacket or gloves (section 45(3)).  The search must be carried out at or near the place where the person or vehicle is stopped (section 45(4)).  And the person or vehicle stopped can be detained only for such time as is reasonably required to permit such a search (section 45(4)).  Unwelcome and inconvenient though most people may be expected to regard such a stop and search procedure, and radically though it departs from our traditional understanding of the limits of police power, it can scarcely be said to constitute any very substantial invasion of our fundamental civil liberties.  Nevertheless, given, as the respondents rightly concede, that in certain cases at least such a procedure will be sufficiently intrusive to engage a person's article 8 right to respect for his private life, and given too that this power is clearly open to abuseâ€”the inevitable consequence of its exercise requiring no grounds of suspicion on the police officer's partâ€”the way is clearly open to an argument that the  scheme is not properly compliant with the Convention requirement that it be "in accordance with the law."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75.&nbsp;&nbsp;For this requirement to be satisfied, Mr Rabinder Singh QC correctly reminds your Lordships, not only must the interference with the Convention right to privacy have some basis in domestic law (as here clearly it does in the 2000 Act); not only must that law be adequately accessible to the public (as here clearly it isâ€”unlike, for example, the position in <i>Malone v United Kingdom</i> (1985)  7 EHRR 14); not only must the law be reasonably foreseeable, to enable those affected to regulate their conduct accordingly (a requirement surely here satisfied by the public's recognition, from the very terms of the legislation, that drivers and pedestrians are liable to be subjected to this form of random search and of the need to submit to it); but there must also be sufficient safeguards to avoid the risk of the power being abused or exercised arbitrarily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I understand the appellants' argument, it is upon this final requirement that it principally focuses: this power, submits Mr Singh, is all too easily capable of being used in an arbitrary fashion and all too difficult to safeguard against such abuse.  True, he acknowledges, if the power is in fact abused in any particular case the police officer concerned will be liable to a civil claim for damages (and, no doubt, to police disciplinary action).  But, he submits, it will usually be impossible to establish a misuse of the power given that no particular grounds are required for its apparently lawful exercise.  Assume, for example, that a police officer in fact exercises this power for racially discriminatory reasons of his own, how could that be established?  There are simply no effective safeguards against such abuse, no adequate criteria against which to judge the propriety of its use.  Certainly it is provided by paragraph 2.25 of Code A (a published code issued under section 66 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984) that: "Officers must take particular care not to discriminate against members of minority ethnic groups in the exercise of these powers".  But, say the appellants, there is simply no way of policing that instruction with regard to the exercise of so wide a random power.  No way, that is, submits Mr Singh, unless it is by stopping and searching literally everyone (as, of course, occurs at airports and on entry to certain other specific buildings) or by stopping and searching on a strictly numerical basis, say every tenth person.  Only in one or other of these ways, the appellants' argument forces them to contend, could such a power as this be exercisable consistently with the principle of legal certainty: there cannot otherwise be the necessary safeguards in place to satisfy the Convention requirement as to "the quality of the law" (a concept explored in a number of the Strasbourg authorities, as, for example in <i>Huvig v France</i> (1990) 12 EHRR 528 at paragraphs 29-35).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would reject this argument.  In the first place it would seem to me impossible to exercise the section 44 power effectively in either of the ways suggested.  Imagine that following the London Underground bombings last July the police had attempted to stop and search everyone entering an underground station or indeed every tenth (or hundredth) such person.  Not only would such a task have been well nigh impossible but it would to my mind thwart the real purpose and value of this power.  That, as Lord Bingham puts it in paragraph 35 of his opinion, is not "to stop and search people who are obviously not terrorist suspects, which would be futile and time-wasting [but rather] to ensure that a constable is not deterred from stopping and searching a person whom he does suspect as a potential terrorist by the fear that he could not show reasonable grounds for his suspicion."  It is to be hoped, first, that potential terrorists will be deterred (certainly from carrying the tools of their trade) by knowing of the risk they run of being randomly searched, and, secondly, that by the exercise of this power police officers may on occasion (if only very rarely) find such materials and thereby disrupt or avert a proposed terrorist attack.  Neither of these aims will be served by police officers searching those who seem to them least likely to present a risk instead of those they have a hunch may be intent on terrorist action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78.&nbsp;&nbsp;In his 2001 review of the operation of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989 (amended as explained by Lord Bingham in paragraph 9 of his opinion) and the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996, Mr John Rowe QC said this of the power to stop and search those entering or leaving the United Kingdom with a view to finding out whether they were involved in terrorism:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The 'intuitive' stop <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>37.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is impossible to overstate the value of these stops â€¦ <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>38.&nbsp;&nbsp;I should explain what I mean by an 'intuitive stop'.  It is a stop which is made 'cold' or 'at random'â€”but I prefer the words 'on intuition'â€”without advance knowledge about the person or vehicle being stopped.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>39.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think such a stop by a trained Special Branch officer is 'cold' or 'random'.  The officer has experience and training in the features and circumstances of terrorism and terrorist groups, and he or she may therefore notice things which the layman would not, or he or she may simply have a police officer's intuition.  Often the reason for such a stop cannot be explained to the layman."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79.&nbsp;&nbsp;Later in his review Mr Rowe noted of the more general stop and search powers originally contained in sections 13A and 13B of the 1989 Act that "these powers were used sparingly, and for good reason".  I respectfully agree that the section 44 power (as it is now) should be exercised sparingly, a recommendation echoed throughout a series of annual reports on the 2000 Act by Lord Carlile of Berriew QC, the independent reviewer of the terrorist legislation appointed in succession to Mr Roweâ€”see most recently paragraph 106 of his 2005 report, suggesting that the use of the power "could be cut by at least 50 per cent without significant risk to the public or detriment to policing."  To my mind, however, that makes it all the more important that it is targeted as  the police officer's intuition dictates rather than used in the true sense randomly for all the world as if there were some particular merit in stopping and searching people whom the officers regard as constituting no threat whatever.  In short, the value of this legislation, just like that allowing people to be stopped and searched at ports, is that it enables police officers to make what Mr Rowe characterised as an intuitive stop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, as the Privy Counsellor Review Committee chaired by Lord Newton of Braintree noted in its December 2003 report on the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Sophisticated terrorists change their profile and methods to avoid presenting a static target.  For example, al Qaeda is reported to place particular value on recruiting Muslim converts because they judge them to be less likely to be scrutinised by the authorities."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me inevitable, however, that so long as the principal terrorist risk against which use of the section 44 power has been authorised is that from al Qaeda, a disproportionate number of those stopped and searched will be of Asian appearance (particularly if they happen to be carrying rucksacks or wearing apparently bulky clothing capable of containing terrorist-related items).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is such a conclusion inimical to Convention jurisprudence or, indeed, inconsistent with domestic discrimination law?  In my judgment it is not, provided only that police officers exercising this power on the ground pay proper heed to paragraph 2.25 of Code A:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The selection of persons stopped under section 44 of Terrorism Act 2000 should reflect an objective assessment of the threat posed by the various terrorist groups active in Great Britain.  The powers must not be used to stop and search for reasons unconnected with terrorism.  Officers must take particular care not to discriminate against members of minority ethnic groups in the exercise of these powers.  There may be circumstances, however, where it is appropriate for officers to take account of a person's ethnic origin in selecting persons to be stopped in response to a specific terrorist threat (for example, some international terrorist groups are associated with particular ethnic identities)."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ethnic origin accordingly can and properly should be taken into account in deciding whether and whom to stop and search provided always that the power is used sensitively and the selection is made for reasons connected with the perceived terrorist threat and not on grounds of racial discrimination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82.&nbsp;&nbsp;A salutary reminder of the need for sensitivity in the exercise of this power is to be found in the June 2005 report (2005) 41 EHRR SE9 by Mr Gil-Robles, the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, following his visit to the United Kingdom in November 2004:</p>
<p></p><ul>"33.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst strong measures may prove necessary to counter serious terrorist threats, their impact on certain communities should be an important consideration when deciding to adopt such measures and every effort must be made to avoid the victimisation of the vast majority of innocent individuals.  What is essential is that the measures themselves are proportionate to the threat, objective in their criteria, respectful of all applicable rights and, on each individual application, justified on relevant, objective, and not purely racial or religious, grounds.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>34.&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of extended stop and search powers under anti-terror legislation raises all of these issues.  I was informed by the Commission for Racial Equality that there was a 36% increase in the number of Asians stopped over the course of 2002/3 under section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 compared to a 17% increase for Whites.  Between the adoption of the Act and 2002/3, there was a 300% increase in the number of Asians stopped.  The maintenance of good community relations is clearly difficult under such circumstances.  The Government has, however, shown considerable sensitivity to these concerns and the need to maintain a constant dialogue with the leaders of Muslim communities."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No suggestion is to be found there, one notes, that the section 44 power, despite being exercised more frequently with regard to Asians than others (and certainly not on a purely random basis), necessarily involves a violation of the Convention either for want of legal certainty or on any other ground.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83.&nbsp;&nbsp;How then is this approach to be reconciled with the requirements of domestic discrimination law, and in particular with the decision of the House of Lords in <i>R (European Roma Rights Centre) v Immigration Officer at Prague Airport (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees intervening) </i> [2005]  2 AC 1?  This I confess to have found substantially the most difficult question arising on this appeal.  Tempting though it is to leave it unaddressed (as largely it was in argument) this would seem to me ultimately unhelpful given not least the explicit reference made in the <i>Roma Rights</i> case to the use of police stop and search powers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is perhaps convenient to remind your Lordships of what essentially was decided in the <i>Roma Rights</i> case.  The Prague operation was designed largely to stop people travelling from the Czech Republic to this country to seek asylum here.  The vast majority of those who had done so in the past and could be expected to do so in future were Roma and realistically therefore it was Roma applicants at whom the scheme was principally targeted.  British immigration officers at Prague airport were concerned to refuse leave to enter the United Kingdom to anyone who either admitted an intention to claim asylum on arrival or, more likely, avowed some other reason for coming but in fact harboured that intention.  The House of Lords reversed the decision of the majority in the Court of Appeal (myself and Mantell LJ, Laws LJ dissenting) and found the operation to be unlawful because Roma, being inherently more likely than non-Roma to make false applications for entry, were routinely treated with more suspicion and subjected to more intense and intrusive questioning than others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85.&nbsp;&nbsp;Baroness Hale of Richmond said (at para 89) that the immigration officers should have been instructed "to treat all would-be passengers in the same way, only subjecting them to more intrusive questioning if there was specific reason to suspect their intentions from the answers they had given to standard questions which were put to everyone," and at para 90 added:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is worth remembering that good equal opportunities practice may not come naturally.  Many will think it contrary to common sense to approach all applicants with an equally open mind, irrespective of the very good reasons there may be to suspect some of them more than others.  But that is what is required by a law which tries to ensure that individuals are not disadvantaged by the general characteristics of the group to which they belong."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Steyn said (at para 37) that "the reasoning of the majority of the Court of Appeal in this case had at first glance the attractiveness of appearing to be in accord with common sense", setting out in this regard the following passage from my own judgment below:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Because of the greater degree of scepticism with which Roma applicants will inevitably be treated, they are more likely to be refused leave to enter than non-Roma applicants.  But this is because they are less well placed to persuade the immigration officer that they are not lying in order to seek asylum.  That is not to say, however, that they are being stereotyped.  Rather it is to acknowledge the undoubtedly disadvantaged position of many Roma in the Czech Republic.  Of course it would be wrong in any individual case to assume that the Roma applicant is lying, but I decline to hold that the immigration officer cannot properly be warier of that possibility in a Roma's case than in the case of a non-Roma applicant.  If a terrorist outrage were committed on our streets today, would the police not be entitled to question more suspiciously those in the vicinity appearing to come from an Islamic background?"<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Steyn however, then quoted with approval from an article by Mr Rabinder Singh QC, "Equality: The Neglected Virtue" 2004 EHRLR 141 which, he said, "convincingly exposed the flaw in the reasoning of the majority":</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is clear that there was less favourable treatment.  It is also clear that it was on racial grounds.  As all the judges acknowledged, the reason for the discrimination is immaterial: in particular, the absence of a hostile intent or the presence of a benign motive is immaterial.  What the majority view amounts to is, on analysis, an attempt to introduce into the law of direct discrimination the possibility of justification.  But Parliament could have provided for that possibilityâ€”as it has done in the context of allegations of indirect discriminationâ€”and has chosen not to do so. . . .[T]he danger in the majority's reasoning is that it is capable of application outside the limited areas with which the Court was concerned.  For example, it could be applied in the context of police stop and search powers.  Simon Brown LJ expressly gives an example from just that context.  This is potentially very damaging to race relations law going beyond what may have been perceived to be the problem in the Roma case itself."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Steyn agreed with that analysis and concluded that the Prague airport scheme was "inherently and systematically discriminatory on racial grounds against Roma, contrary to section 1(1)(a) of the Race Relations Act 1976."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Bingham and Lord Hope agreed with Lady Hale's reasoning on the discrimination issue.  Lord Carswell, whilst recognising (at para 112) that </p>
<p></p><ul>"many people would regard it as nothing more than an application of ordinary common sense to treat Romani applicants in that way [i.e. with a greater degree of scepticism than others], given the officers' regular experience of dealing with them (and assuming in the officers' favour that they were doing no more than attempting conscientiously to ascertain which applications were genuine)," <p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;similarly concluded (at para 113) that the officers must </p>
<p></p><ul>"treat all applicants, whatever their racial background, alike in the method of investigation which they carry out until in any individual case sufficient reason appears to prolong or intensify the examination."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88.&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, each of the three reasoned speeches on this issue acknowledged the apparent common sense underlying the immigration officers' approach.  Why, one must therefore ask, if it was adjudged right to override the dictates of common sense in that case should police officers be allowed to use their common sense in exercising the section 44 power?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not found it altogether easy to distinguish between on the one hand the greater scepticism logically felt by immigration officers towards Roma than non-Roma applicants (held in the <i>Roma Rights</i> case to have been unlawfully discriminatory) and on the other hand the greater preparedness which police officers understandably have to stop and search those of Asian appearance (as Mr Gil-Robles noted) given the perceived source of the main terrorist threat today.  The difficulty in making this distinction is, indeed, apparent from Mr Rabinder Singh's article published in response to my own reference in that case to the use of police powers in a terrorist context.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only basis I can see for a distinction (and I do not pretend to find it entirely satisfactory) is if one assumes that in the <i>Roma Rights</i> case the immigration officers had not sufficiently had regard to each Roma applicant as an individual, rather merely than as a stereotypical member of the group (see para 74 of Lady Hale's speech).  It would, of course, have been wrong for immigration officers to have treated every Roma applicant identically irrespective of how his answers to questions put to him affected the interviewing officer's view as to the genuineness of his particular application.  But that surely, so far from according with common sense, would have been not merely wrong but also silly.  Nevertheless the House appears to have concluded that this was indeed the immigration officers' approach and on that basis struck down the scheme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91.&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly nothing which your Lordships are saying on the present appeal would support that kind of an approach to the stop and search power.  It is one thing to accept that a person's ethnic origin is part (and sometimes a highly material part) of his profile; quite another (and plainly unacceptable) to profile someone solely by reference to his ethnicity.  In deciding whether or not to exercise their stop and search powers police officers must obviously have regard to other factors too.</p>
