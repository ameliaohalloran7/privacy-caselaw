<p class="para">210.&nbsp;&nbsp;S &amp; R’s claim against Moore Stephens is also capable of quite brief summary. It is agreed for present purposes that it is to be considered a claim in negligence only (though there is in relation to the 1998 audit a strongly denied and presently irrelevant allegation that Moore Stephens shut a Nelsonian eye to the fraud). The alleged negligence, put as a breach both of contract and of a duty of care, consists of failure on Moore Stephens’s part to detect various aspects of the scheme of fraud. In this respect S &amp; R accepts that no distinction can be drawn between the obtaining of monies under the letters of credit and their payment out. The two were integral parts of Mr Stojevic’s scheme, and much of the negligence alleged against Moore Stephens consists of failure to react to clear signs that the goods purportedly being sold and represented by documents presented to the banks did not exist. The causation alleged is that, if Moore Stephens had discovered the fraud, they would have had to resign and report the matter to regulatory authorities. The loss claimed consists in the amounts paid out of S &amp; R after the end of each of the audits upon which it is alleged the fraud should have been discovered.</p>
<i><p class="para">The audit role</p></i>
<p class="para">211.&nbsp;&nbsp;The proper starting point for consideration of this appeal is the nature of an audit and the duties which Moore Stephens as an auditor undertook each year. Both the statutory context and the terms of the particular engagement are important. But the existence of Moore Stephens’s contractual engagement in each year is common ground, and it was neither pleaded (see Defence, paragraph 3) nor suggested in oral submissions that it was invalid or unenforceable as such; had any such point had any validity, one may be confident that those advising Moore Stephens would not have overlooked it, particularly bearing in mind the novelty and nature of some points which have been argued. The existence of a duty on the part of Moore Stephens to the company and its general scope are for present purposes also common ground. As the company’s case puts it, Moore Stephens “owed the company a duty to take care to detect ….. the fraud; and …… breached that duty” or, as Moore Stephens’ own case puts it, they “owed the company a duty to report whether its accounts showed a true and fair view of its financial affairs. One of the things that they had to do to perform that duty was take such steps as were reasonable in the circumstances to discover that the company’s business was fraudulent". The audits were undertaken under the Companies Act 1985, and the cases of <i>Caparo Industries plc v. Dickman </i>[1990] 2 AC 605 and <i>Al Saudi Banque v. Clarke Pixley </i>[1990] Ch 313 (Millett J), approved in <i>Caparo</i>, therefore contain relevant further guidance as to Moore Stephens’ role and duties.  In so far as these are prescribed by statute, such role and duties are necessarily inflexible - they cannot be changed or waived by the company, its management or its shareholders.</p>
<p class="para">212.&nbsp;&nbsp;An auditor’s primary duty is to report to shareholders on the annual accounts and report to be prepared by the directors: ss.226(1), 227(1), 233(1) and (3) and 234(1) of the 1985 Act, as inserted by the Companies Act 1989. S.235, as so inserted, states the duty:</p>
<p class="qt">“235(1) A company’s auditors shall make a report <i>to the company’s members</i> on all annual accounts of the company of which copies are to be laid <i>before the company in general meeting</i> during their tenure of office.</p>
<p class="qt">(2) The auditors’ report shall state whether in the auditors’ opinion the annual accounts have been properly prepared in accordance with this Act, and in particular whether a true and fair view is given ….</p>
<p class="qt">(3) The auditors shall consider whether the information given in the directors’ report for the financial year ….. is consistent with those accounts; and if they are of opinion that it is not they shall state that fact in their report.” (Emphasis added).</p>
<p class="para">213.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Caparo </i>at pp. 625D-616C Lord Bridge of Harwich approved the following summary by Bingham LJ [1989] QB 653, 680 of the position of auditors in relation to shareholders:</p>
<p class="qt">“The members, or shareholders, of the company are its<br>owners. But they are too numerous, and in most cases too<br>unskilled, to undertake the day to day management of that which they own. So responsibility for day to day<br>management of the company is delegated to directors. The shareholders, despite their overall powers of control, are in most companies for most of the time investors and little more. But it would of course be unsatisfactory and open to abuse if the shareholders received no report on the financial stewardship of their investment save from those to whom the stewardship had been entrusted. So provision is made for the company in general meeting to appoint an auditor (section 384 of the Companies Act 1985), whose duty is to investigate and form an opinion on the adequacy of the company’s accounting records and returns and the correspondence between the company’s accounting records and returns and its accounts: section 237. The auditor has then to report to the company’s members (among other things) whether in his opinion the company’s accounts give a true and fair view of the company’s financial position: section 236 [sic]. In carrying out his investigation and in forming his opinion the auditor necessarily works very closely with the directors and officers of the company. He receives his remuneration from the company. He naturally, and rightly, regards the company as his client. But he is employed by the company to exercise his professional skill and judgment for the purpose of giving the shareholders an independent report on the reliability of the company’s accounts and thus on their investment.</p>
<p class="qt">‘No doubt he is acting antagonistically to the<br>directors in the sense that he is appointed by the<br>shareholders to be a check upon them:’ <i>In re Kingston Cotton Mill Co.</i> [1896] 1 Ch. 6, 11, <i>per </i>Vaughan Williams J.</p>
<p class="qt">The auditor’s report must be read before the company in<br>general meeting and must be open to inspection by any<br>member of the company: section 241. It is attached to and forms part of the company’s accounts: sections 238(3) and 239. A copy of the company’s accounts, including the auditor’s report, must be sent to every member: section 240. Any member of the company, even if not entitled to have a copy of the accounts sent to him, is entitled to be furnished with a copy of the company’s last accounts on demand and without charge: section 246.”</p>
<p class="para">214.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> Caparo </i>establishes that the auditor’s statutory duty is not to any individual shareholder as a purchaser or potential shareholder of shares in the company, but to the shareholders collectively, and that their remedy for any breach lies through the company. As Lord Bridge put it at p.626D-E:</p>
<p class="qt">“….. in practice no problem arises in this regard since the interest of the shareholders in the proper management of the company’s affairs is indistinguishable from the<br>interest of the company itself and any loss suffered by the<br>shareholders, e.g. by the negligent failure of the auditor to<br>discover and expose a misappropriation of funds by a director of the company, will be recouped by a claim against the auditors in the name of the company, not by individual shareholders.”</p>
<p class="para">Consistently with this, Lord Oliver of Aylmerton at p.630F-G described the auditor’s function as being </p>
<p class="qt">“to protect the company itself from the consequences of undetected errors or, possibly, wrongdoing (by, for instance, declaring dividends out of capital) and, secondly, to provide shareholders with reliable intelligence for the purpose of enabling them to scrutinise the conduct of the company’s affairs and to exercise their collective powers to reward or control or remove those to whom that conduct has been confided.”</p>
<p class="para">At p.653H, he quoted with approval the statement by O'Connor LJ in the Court of Appeal (at p.714) to the effect that loss by “fraudulent abstraction of assets by directors or servants …..is recoverable by the company".<i> </i></p>
<p class="para">215.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the auditor’s primary responsibility to the shareholders as a whole, the legislation recognises certain obligations in respect of others. At p.631D-F Lord Oliver noted that: </p>
<p class="qt">“…… the history of the legislation is one of an increasing<br>availability of information regarding the financial affairs of the company to those having an interest in its progress and stability.  It cannot fairly be said that the purpose of making such information available is solely to assist those interested in attending general meetings of the company to an informed supervision and appraisal of the stewardship of the company’s directors, for the requirement to supply audited accounts to, for instance, preference shareholders having no right to vote at general meetings and to debenture holders cannot easily be attributed to any such purpose.”</p>
<p class="paraleft">Further, s.394 provides that:</p>
<p class="qt">“394(1) Where an auditor ceases for any reason to hold office, he shall deposit at the company’s registered office a statement of any circumstances connected with his ceasing to hold office which he considers should be brought to the attention of <i>the members or creditors</i> of the company or, if he considers that there are no such circumstances, a statement that there are none.” (Emphasis added)</p>
<p class="para">S.394(3) provides that the company must either send a copy of any statement identifying any such circumstances to every member, debenture-holder and person entitled to notice of general meetings or apply to the court.</p>
<p class="para">216.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore Stephens’s statutory duties were reinforced by the contractual terms of their engagement letter dated 19 December 1996 and signed by Mr Stojevic for S &amp; R on 14 January 1997. This letter acknowledged their statutory duties and identified their “professional responsibility to report if the financial statements do not comply in any material respect with applicable accounting standards, unless in our opinion the non-compliance is justified in the circumstances". The audit was to be “conducted in accordance with the Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board", and the letter stated that</p>
<p class="qt">“(11) The responsibility for safeguarding the assets of the company and for the prevention and detection of fraud, error and non-compliance with law or regulations rests with yourselves. However, we shall endeavour to plan our audit so that we have a reasonable expectation of detecting material misstatements in the financial statements or accounting records (including those resulting from fraud, error or non-compliance with law or regulations) but our examination should not be relied upon to disclose all such material misstatements or frauds, errors or instances of non-compliance as may exist …..”</p>
<p class="para">217.&nbsp;&nbsp;Auditing Standard SAS 110 (issued January 1995) deals with fraud and error. It contains statements of auditing standards (SAS) and explanatory text in numbered paragraphs. SAS 110.1 states: “Auditors should plan and perform their audit procedures and evaluate and report the results thereof, recognising that fraud or error may materially affect the financial statements". SAS 110.10 (para. 50) states that, on becoming aware of a suspected or actual instance of fraud, auditors </p>
<p class="qt">“should (a) consider whether the matter may be one that ought to be reported to a proper authority in the public interest; and where this is the case (b) except in the circumstances covered in SAS 110.12, discuss the matter with the board of directors, including any audit committee". </p>
<p class="para">SAS 110.12 (para. 52) provides that </p>
<p class="qt">“When a suspected or actual instance of fraud casts doubt on the integrity of the directors auditors should make a report direct to a proper authority in the public interest without delay and without informing the directors in advance.” </p>
<p class="paraleft">The text at paragraph 56 explains that matters to be taken into account when considering whether disclosure is justified in the public interest may include “the extent to which the suspected or actual fraud is likely to affect members of the public". Plainly, one situation in which members of the public would be affected is where the fraud conceals or risks bringing about the company’s insolvency. The viability of a company as a going concern is always a matter of audit importance.</p>
<p class="para">218.&nbsp;&nbsp;The relationship of company and auditor is not therefore a simple two-party relationship. The company cannot in the audit context be equated with its board of directors or management. The company’s shareholders are - at least while the company is solvent - the main focus of an auditor’s activity and duties. The auditor, in undertaking the statutory role and contractual and tortious duties, is “acting antagonistically to the directors” (see para. 213 above).</p>
<i><p class="para">Analysis</p></i>
<p class="para">219.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore Stephens’s case, accepted by the Court of Appeal, is that the company, S &amp; R, in order to show negligence on the part of Moore Stephens, has to plead and so rely on a scheme, to which it was through Mr Stojevic party and one aspect of which was fraud on S &amp; R’s banks; Mr Stojevic was S &amp; R’s directing mind; and the claim therefore falls within the core principle in <i>Tinsley v Milligan </i>[1994] 1 AC 340, which, it is submitted, precludes a party from pursuing a contractual or tortious claim if, in order to do so, it has to plead and rely on its own iniquity. Mr Sumption accepts that whether there is iniquity sufficient to trigger the maxim may sometimes require careful examination of the facts: see e.g. <i>Burrows v. Rhodes </i>[1899] 1 QB 816; <i>United Project Consultants Pte Ltd v. Leong Kwok Onn </i>[2005] SGCA 38; [2005] 4 SLR  214, but Mr Stojevic’s iniquity is not here in doubt. The Court of Appeal accepted Moore Stephens’ analysis, without drawing any distinction between cases where the directing mind of a company was and was not sole shareholder. S &amp; R in resisting it draws on the nature and purpose of an audit (summarised above) as well as on two general principles of law: the first, that fraud <i>on</i> a company by even its most senior officer(s) constituting its directing mind is not to be attributed to the company: <i>In re Hampshire Land Company </i>[1896] 2 Ch 743, <i>Belmont Finance Corp. Ltd. v Williams Furniture Ltd. </i>[1979] Ch 250 and <i>Attorney General’s Reference (No 2 of 1982</i>) [1984] QB 624; and the second, that a person should not be entitled to deny liability for a breach of contract or duty consisting in failure to do the “very thing” (here, it is said, to check for and detect fraud) which it was his duty to do, reliance in this connection being placed on <i>Reeves v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis </i>[2000] 1 AC 360. </p>
<p class="para">220.&nbsp;&nbsp;A company, once legally incorporated, “must be treated like any other independent person with its rights and liabilities appropriate to itself": <i>Salomon v. Salomon &amp; Co Ltd </i>[1897] AC 22, 30 per Lord Halsbury LC. But a company “has no mind of its own any more than it has a body of its own": <i>Lennard’s Carrying Co. Ltd. v. Asiatic Petroleum Co. Ltd. </i>[1915] AC 705, 713. For some purposes it is necessary to attribute or impute to a company the mind, knowledge or intentions of one or more human beings. In a criminal law context, where the company stands accused, the law is likely to look at the acts and state of mind of a person who can be regarded as the embodiment of the company - its alter ego or directing mind - rather than at those of a person acting merely as servant, agent or delegate, for whom the company might in a civil law context be vicariously liable: <i>Tesco Supermarkets Ltd. v Nattrass </i>[1972] AC 153, 170E-G per Lord Reid.  When and how far a company will be attributed with the state of mind of individuals who have acted for it depends on the circumstances and context. My noble and learned friend Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood refers to the rejection of Lord Bramwell’s view in <i>Abrath v. North Eastern Railway Co. </i>(1886) 11 App. Cas. 247, 251 that a company, as a fictitious person, is “incapable of malice or of motive". But the corollary of that rejection is not that the company is always to be attributed with the malice or motive of anyone acting for it or even of its top management (or indeed that it is always necessary to attribute to a company itself any state of mind at all).</p>
<p class="para">221.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>locus classicus</i> in this area is now the advice of the Privy Council given by Lord Hoffmann in <i>Meridian Global Funds Management Asia Ltd. v  Securities Commission  </i> [1995] 2 AC 500. Lord Hoffmann identified the provisions of a company’s constitution as its primary rules of attribution. He instanced provisions making decisions of the majority of its board decisions of the company and the common law rule that the unanimous decision of all the shareholders in a <i>solvent</i> company about anything which the company under its memorandum of association has power to do are also decisions of the company. He cited in the latter connection <i>Multinational Gas and Petrochemical Co. v. Multinational Gas and Petrochemical Services Ltd. </i>[1983] Ch 258. A company’s primary rules of attribution are supplemented by general principles of agency and vicarious liability. </p>
<p class="para">222.&nbsp;&nbsp;At p.507B, Lord Hoffmann went on to say that these together “are usually sufficient to enable one to determine its rights and obligations. In exceptional cases, however, they will not provide an answer. This will be the case when a rule of law, either expressly or by implication, excludes attribution on the basis of the general principles of agency or vicarious liability". He gave as examples situations where the law requires some act or state of mind of a person “himself” as opposed to his servants or agents, and the rule of the criminal law “which ordinarily imposes liability only for the actus reus and mens rea of the defendant himself". The court might then find that the rule of law was not intended to apply to companies at all, or that it could apply only on the basis of the company’s primary rules of attribution or that neither of these solutions was satisfactory. In that case:</p>
<p class="qt">“the court must fashion a special rule of attribution for the particular substantive rule. This is always a matter of interpretation: given that it was intended to apply to a company, how was it intended to apply? Whose act (or knowledge, or state of mind) was <i>for this purpose</i> intended to count as the act etc. of the company? One finds the answer to this question by applying the usual canons of interpretation, taking into account the language of the rule (if it is a statute) and its content and policy.” (p.507D-F)</p>
<p class="para">223.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Lord Hoffmann in these passages focused on situations in which the primary rules of attribution might not alone suffice, he was not excluding the possibility of cases in which not even the primary rules of attribution should apply; and Mr Sumption QC for Moore Stephens rightly did not suggest that he was, though submitting that such cases would be “very rare indeed". One issue before your Lordships is whether the audit context may be such a case.  </p>
<i><p class="para">Mr Stojevic’s position as the company’s directing mind</p></i>
<p class="para">224.&nbsp;&nbsp;I start with the company’s position vis-à-vis Mr Stojevic. Moore Stephens’s case has changed at each instance. But before the House Mr Sumption submitted was that S &amp; R could only claim against Mr Stojevic on a narrow basis for abstraction of its monies (a proprietary claim like that mentioned by O'Connor LJ in <i>Caparo</i>: see paragraph 214  above); and that any claim against him for damages for breach of duty as an officer would be barred by the maxim <i>ex turpi causa </i>because it would involve pleading S &amp; R’s fraud on the banks. I do not accept this submission. It would mean that, if one element of Mr Stojevic’s fraud on the banks had involved persuading the banks to pay the funds direct into an account represented as being S &amp; R’s but in fact Mr Stojevic’s, S &amp; R could not sue Mr Stojevic. Mr Stojevic’s common law duty as a director to S &amp; R was to conduct its affairs honestly and properly. S.172(1) of the Companies Act 2006 now states the duty, in terms expressly based on common law rules and equitable principles (see s.170(3)), as being to “act in the way he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole” - a duty made expressly “subject to any enactment or rule of law requiring directors, in certain circumstances, to consider or act in the interests of creditors of the company” (see s.172(3)). S.212 of the Insolvency Act 1986 provides a summary remedy available in the course of winding up against anyone who is or has been an officer of the company in respect of, inter alia, “any misfeasance or breach of any fiduciary or other duty in relation to the company". (This is in addition to the specific remedies that apply in circumstances of fraudulent or wrongful trading under ss.213 and 214.)</p>
<p class="para">225.&nbsp;&nbsp;As between S &amp; R and Mr Stojevic, Mr Stojevic’s fraud on the banks was and is just as objectionable as the later abstraction of monies to which it was designed to lead. In holding a director responsible in such a case, a company is as a separate legal entity enforcing duties owed to it by the director. It is not acting inconsistently, or asking the court to act inconsistently, with the law. It is a remarkable proposition, that the directing mind of a company can commit the company to a scheme of fraud and then avoid liability in damages if the company would have to plead and rely on this scheme to establish such liability. It is even more remarkable, indeed paradoxical, when it is, I conceive, clear beyond doubt that the company has a remedy against its auditor for negligent failure to detect and report fraud by a company’s directing mind where (at the very least) the company has innocent shareholders: see paragraphs 241 to 245 below.</p>
<i><p class="para">Ex turpi causa as between S &amp; R and Mr Stojevic</p></i>
<p class="para">226.&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows that one would not expect the maxim <i>ex turpi causa</i>, however mechanistic it may be, to have any operation in a context such as the present. Mr Sumption stressed that “the true rationale for the defence of illegality associated with the maxim <i>ex turpi causa non oritur actio</i>,” is “the preservation of the integrity of the justice system” - meaning the need to avoid permitting a claimant “to indirectly profit from his or her crime, in the sense of obtaining remuneration for it” or in the sense of evading “a penalty prescribed by criminal law", to avoid putting “the courts in the position of saying that the same conduct is both legal, in the sense of being capable of rectification by the court, and illegal": <i>Hall v. Hebert </i>(1993) 101 DLR (4th) 129, 160-165, 167 and 168 per McLachlin J (as she was). In <i>Hall v. Hebert </i>two drunken men had set off home by car. The defendant initially drove but stalled the car and lost the ignition key, and both then decided to try to push-start the car, with the plaintiff now as driver. The car turned over injuring the plaintiff. The defence of <i>ex turpi causa </i>failed, because the plaintiff was not seeking to make a profit from his wrongful act, but merely to claim damages for personal injury. The integrity of the legal system was not affected.  No more do I think that it is here. On the contrary, S &amp; R would be enforcing, and not seeking to profit from but to obtain compensation for, breach of the duties which Mr Stojevic owed to it. The law must enable that. </p>
<i><p class="para">The Hampshire Land principle</p></i>
<p class="para">227.&nbsp;&nbsp;Though not essential to my reasoning, I also consider that the principle established in <i>In re Hampshire Land Company, Belmont Finance</i> and <i>Attorney General’s Reference (No 2 of 1982)</i> points towards the same result  It prevents a company being treated as party to a fraud committed by its officers “on” or “against” the company, at least in the context of claims by the company for redress for offences committed <i>against</i> the company: <i>Belmont Finance</i>, 261D-H, per Buckley LJ, and 271F-G, per Goff LJ, and <i>Attorney General’s Reference (No 2 of 1982)</i>, p.640A-B, per Kerr LJ; and see <i>Edwards Karwacki Smith &amp; Co. Pty. Ltd. v Jacka Nominees Pty. Ltd. </i>(1994) 15 ACSR 502, 515-517. Thus, in <i>Belmont Finance </i>the company’s directors were party to an illegal conspiracy, “part and parcel” of which was that the company bought shares at an inflated price (p.264A), but their knowledge of this illegality was not imputed to the company and did not bar the company suing them for the conspiracy. The principle has also been applied in the context of a claim or allegation of estoppel against a company, seeking to hold the company responsible for a transaction in fraud of the company, by attributing to it knowledge of the fraud possessed by directors or agents who did not represent or act for the company in the transaction but had knowledge of it which they withheld from the company: <i>J C Houghton and Co. v. Nothard, Lowe and Wills Ltd. </i>[1928] AC 1; <i>Kwei Tek Chao v. British Traders and Shippers Ld. </i>[1954] 2 QB 459, 471- 472. </p>
<p class="para">228.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sumption submits that the principle has no present relevance for two reasons. The first is based on its original rationale: that, since an agent deceiving a company will not disclose his own fraud to the company, the company cannot be imputed with knowledge of or treated as party to the fraud. This rationale, Mr Sumption submits, postulates a company with an “innocent constituency” (other officers and/or shareholders) to whom Mr Stojevic could have disclosed, but from whom he would and did actually conceal, his misdeeds. If the suggestion is that the <i>Hampshire Land </i>principle or the thinking behind it can only apply where a company alleges loss through being deceived, I see no reason why it should be so confined. Whether knowledge should be attributed to a company is irrelevant in contexts like the present, where S &amp; R’s claim is not that there were others within the company who relied on misleading statements by Mr Stojevic, but rather that Mr Stojevic’s actions were in breach of his duties to S &amp; R and that, had Moore Stephens detected them, no further breaches of duty would have been possible. </p>
