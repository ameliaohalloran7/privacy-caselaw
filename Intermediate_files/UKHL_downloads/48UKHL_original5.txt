<p class="para">105.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ashleys found their entitlement to proceed on the battery claim on two different bases. First, they have sued for damages for negligence and for battery, and are entitled to seek judgment for damages under both heads. Their alternative argument, preferred by the Court of Appeal, is that, although their claim for damages may have fallen away as a result of the concession, the Ashleys can seek a declaration that Mr Ashleys death was caused by battery.</p>
<p class="para">106.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Constable’s answer to the Ashleys’ case that they should be allowed to proceed to seek judgment for damages on their battery claim, is that they have a judgment for damages which effectively puts an end to that claim. If a claim in battery were established, they would be entitled to consequential damages, but they now have judgment for that very relief. As the only purpose of a claim based on a past tort is to compensate for the resultant injury, runs the argument, there is nothing left in the battery claim. </p>
<p class="para">107.&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to this point, in my judgment, is that, at any rate until the damages have been assessed, the claim in battery can still be maintained. However, given that there is a judgment for such damages to be assessed for negligence, it seems to me that the Chief Constable can seek to invoke the court’s case management powers to stay the battery claim. I have in mind both the inherent powers of the court and the specific powers under CPR 1.4(2) (c) and (d) (which enable the court to decide which issues need to be determined, and the order of determination) and, in particular, under CPR 3.1(2)(f) (which enables the court to stay any part of proceedings). </p>
<p class="para">108.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where there are two bases of claim for the same damages and the first basis is conceded, it seems to me that it would require a relatively exceptional case where it would not be appropriate to give directions for the assessment of damages and to stay the resolution of the second basis, thereby avoiding costs and court time. Nonetheless, I accept that there will be cases where, under its case management powers, the court can, even should, permit the second basis to proceed to judgment - e.g. where it would be appropriate to do so in the public interest, or to vindicate a contention. This means that case management powers can be invoked to determine substantive rights, but there is nothing surprising about that - see  the decision of this House in <i>Bristol City Council v Lovell </i>[1998] 1 WLR 446.</p>
<p class="para">109.&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the alternative argument preferred by the Court of Appeal, even now the Ashleys have not formulated the declaration which they are seeking. Before the claim for a declaration could proceed, it must be right for the Chief Constable to be told the terms of the declaration being sought, and to have the opportunity to make submissions on it. For the moment, I proceed on the assumption that an acceptably worded form of declaration will be found.</p>
<p class="para">110.&nbsp;&nbsp;The court’s power to grant a declaration is subject to a well-established, if developing, discretion, as discussed in chapter 4 of <i>Zamir &amp; Woolf on The Declaratory Judgment, </i>3rd ed (2002). If it is a discretionary remedy, the court must have power, in appropriate cases, to stay a claim for a declaration. The Chief Constable’s argument is that a declaration would have no point, and the court will not make a declaration unless it has some point - see <i>R (Rusbridger) v Attorney General </i>[2004] 1 AC 357 and <i>Clarke v Fennoscandia Ltd</i> 2008 SLT 33. I accept the Ashleys’ response to this, namely that there is a point in seeking a declaration, for the reasons mentioned above, namely because it is reasonable for Mr Ashleys estate to wish to establish that his death was unlawfully caused and because there is a public interest element in proceeding. </p>
<p class="para">111.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in relation to neither of these points can it fairly be said, at least to my mind, that the Ashleys should have a virtually automatic right to proceed. The desire for “mere” vindication must be very rarely the sole private law ground on which a claim for a declaration is pursued or can even be justified. As to the public interest, that frequently involves competing factors which the court has to balance against each other. Accordingly, as with the first basis on which the Ashleys justify their claim proceeding, it must be a matter for the court’s discretion whether to let the claim for a declaration proceed. Whether that discretion is that traditionally applicable to declarations or is based on case management sense seems to me to be of no practical significance. Although these discretions may be juridically different (see per Lord Hoffmann in <i>Bristol City Council </i>[1998] 1 WLR 446, 453E-454E), the same considerations must apply to their exercise here.</p>
<p class="para">112.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, I reject the argument that the battery claim cannot proceed. Like the Master of the Rolls, “I do not accept the submission that a party with a real prospect of success on a particular point in a case is entitled to a trial", as “each case of course depends upon its own  particular facts” (para 148). So I turn to the question of how the discretion should be exercised in this case.</p>
<i><p class="para">The factors in favour of the battery claim proceeding</p></i>
<p class="para">113.&nbsp;&nbsp;As already indicated, it appears to me that, where the defendant has conceded one basis for claiming damages, the court would normally stay determination of a disputed, alternative, basis for claiming the same damages, and would refuse to permit a claim for a declaration that such a basis exists to proceed, if the purpose was simply to establish a principle or to show that the claimant was right. Ordinarily, it would either be pointless, or it would involve an unjustifiable or disproportionate use of effort money and court time, if a claimant was permitted to try to establish his alternative basis of claim simply for vindicatory purposes. However, this case involves a claim on behalf of the estate of a victim of an allegedly unlawful killing by the police, which takes it out of the ordinary. </p>
<p class="para">114.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there is, at least potentially, a substantial public interest in the outcome of the battery claim. If the claim does not proceed, there will, with the exception of a criminal trial, where the prosecution failed to make out its case, never be a full scrutiny or judicial (or quasi-judicial) assessment in public of what happened on 15 January 1998. </p>
<p class="para">115.&nbsp;&nbsp;The constitutional and public interest aspects of the court’s functions in the present connection are identified by the editors of <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on the Law of Torts</i>,<i> </i>19th ed (2006), para 1-10, where they emphasise that “tort law protects a wide range of interests against harmful conduct and that protection is not limited to compensation". The editors go on to say that “in many situations it is the publicity resulting from an action which may do most to protect rights” and that “[t]ort law may serve as an ‘ombudsman’ function in this respect". To similar effect, in <i>Governor and Company of the Bank of Scotland v A Ltd </i>[2001] 1 WLR 751, para 45, Lord Woolf CJ cited with approval an extra-curial observation of Lord Denning about “the need” for the court to develop the scope of its declaratory jurisdiction “in order to control the abuse of executive power", going on to emphasise that the “development of declaratory relief has not however been confined to judicial review".</p>
<p class="para">116.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in my view, only very limited assistance is gained in this connection from the decision in <i>Attorney General of Trinidad and Tobago v Ramanoop</i> [2006] 1 AC 328, as explained in para 18 of<i> Merson v Cartwright </i>[2005] UKPC 38. In that case, damages were awarded to “vindicate the right of the complainant … to carry on his or her life … free from unjustified executive interference, mistreatment or oppression", in other words to acknowledge that her constitutional rights had been infringed. As damages were sought and awarded, the complainant pursued her claim for thoroughly conventional reasons, indeed effectively as of right. The decision nonetheless emphasises the court’s role in ensuring that allegations of unjustified invasion of fundamental rights by the executive are scrutinised.</p>
<p class="para">117.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, the court’s function of supervising, and curbing the excesses of, the executive, should obviously be invoked only in appropriate cases. A citizen is, of course, entitled to expect the court’s assistance in relation to excesses or wrongful acts of the executive. But the executive is sometimes entitled to seek the court’s protection from a claim from a citizen - e.g. where the costs and effort involved in its resolution are disproportionate to any benefit. </p>
<p class="para">118.&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the fact that the claim is for the unlawful killing of Mr Ashley means that it could not be more serious from the point of view of his estate, which the Ashleys represent, and it means that article 2 of the ECHR is potentially engaged. Accordingly, the claimants’ desire for vindication has far more force and deserves far more sympathy than in the normal run of cases. </p>
<p class="para">119.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the fact that a death, which may turn out to have been caused by unlawful police shooting, was involved cannot conclusively entitle the battery claim to proceed, particularly as the Chief Constable has accepted full civil liability for that death, albeit only in negligence. In the case of a death occurring before the Human Rights Act 1998 came into force, there is no right to an investigation - see <i>In re McKerr </i>[2004] 1 WLR 807 and <i>R (Hurst) v London Northern  District Coroner </i>[2007] 2 AC 189.</p>
<p class="para">120.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am unpersuaded by a third point, namely that the Chief Constable’s desire to stay the battery claim helps justify its prosecution. If it proceeds, it may well involve the Sussex police in much expenditure in terms of money, time, and manpower, and it is easy to understand why he wishes to avoid that. No doubt, he also wants to avoid the risk of a finding of battery, but that is no more a reason for refusing (or granting) a stay than the fact that the Ashleys want to obtain such a finding. The Chief Constable’s desire to avoid a trial is perfectly proper, as is the Ashleys’ desire to have such a trial.</p>
<i><p class="para">The factors against the battery claim proceeding</p>
</i>
<p class="para">121.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side of the coin, there are a number of arguments as to why the battery claim should not be entitled to proceed, quite apart from the fact that the Chief Constable has accepted liability for Mr Ashleys death (albeit in negligence) and submitted to an assessment of damages, and that, at least in general, as Auld LJ said in para 181 below, “the civil courts exist to award compensation, not to conduct public enquiries” (quoting from Dobbs J at para 99 at first instance). </p>
<p class="para">122.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the tribunals in which public investigations normally take place into allegedly unlawful killings are a criminal court, a coroner’s court or a public inquiry. All those three options have been pursued in respect of Mr Ashleys death, at least to some extent. There has been a criminal trial, where the prosecution case, with full argument and evidence, was aired in public over more than 10 days, and a verdict obtained, although, as the prosecution did not make out a <i>prima facie </i>case, PC Sherwood and other defence witnesses have never given evidence in public about Mr Ashleys death. The coroner decided not to proceed with the inquest after the acquittal of PC Sherwood, pursuant to section 16(3) of the Coroners Act 1989. The Ashleys’ request for a public inquiry was refused by the Home Office in 2001 and in 2004, and an application by the Ashleys for leave to challenge the 2004 decision by way of judicial review has been refused.</p>
<p class="para">123.&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there have been the activities of the police themselves. There have been two inquiries into the shooting of Mr Ashley, although neither inquiry was conducted in public. One was carried out by an independent police force under section 43 of the Police Act 1996, the other by the Sussex Police Authority itself for the benefit of Mr Ashley’s family. There has also been an unqualified public apology to Mr Ashley’s family delivered in person by the Chief Constable and the Chairman of the Authority. </p>
<p class="para">124.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, there is the position of PC Sherwood. He stood trial for murder in 2001, and was acquitted. If the battery claim proceeds, he will effectively (but not technically, as he is not a defendant) be facing what amounts to the same claim in the civil court. He will be likely to have to give evidence relating to acts which took place some 10 years ago, more than seven years after he was acquitted. Further, there is no new and compelling relevant evidence, which was not available at the criminal trial.</p>
<p class="para">125.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that the battery claim would not involve PC Sherwood in double jeopardy or constitute a collateral attack on his acquittal, as explained. However, the purpose of the battery claim is, in practice, close to representing a collateral attack on his acquittal. The Ashleys’ reason for proceeding with the battery claim is simply to establish that Mr Ashley was unlawfully shot by PC Sherwood. All the civil cases considered by the courts in this jurisdiction and in Strasbourg, such as <i>Y v Norway, </i>where a claimant was seeking to show that an accused had been responsible for an act of which he had been acquitted in a criminal court, were for claims for monetary compensation suffered as a result of that act. </p>
<p class="para">126.&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the purpose of the civil proceedings in those cases was to recover compensation for damage suffered as a result of the act. The purpose of the Ashleys in pursuing the battery claim here is simply to establish that Mr Ashley was unlawfully killed, which is a much more limited and unusual (if quite understandable) sole reason for pursuing a civil claim. The interest of PC Sherwood, as a person acquitted of murder and who was responsible for the shooting, must, in my opinion, be relevant when the court is considering whether, in its discretion, it should permit such a claim to proceed.</p>
<p class="para">127.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, there are the implications of a civil trial of the battery claim. The Master of the Rolls may be right in saying that the trial would be “comparatively short” and “thus not too costly” (para 99). However, like my noble and learned friend Lord Carswell, whose speech I have had the privilege of seeing in draft, I have severe doubts about that. I note that at first instance Dobbs J said that a trial would involve “huge costs to the public purse” (quoted in para 146 in the Court of Appeal). There could be many witnesses, much examination of and dispute over the detailed circumstances of, and leading up to, the shooting, and considerable legal and factual argument. Although it can only be a very rough guide, at best, the criminal trial, which did not get past the prosecution case, lasted nearly three weeks. </p>
<p class="para">128.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the trial will relate to an event that occurred over 10 years earlier in very fraught circumstances. The resolution of the ultimate issue will almost certainly involve disputed points of law and fact, much examination of witnesses as to what happened, what they thought, and why they acted in the way they did. There will, I suspect, be many and detailed cross-references to evidence and conclusions at the criminal trial and the two inquiries.</p>
<p class="para">129.&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for caution before a civil court permits a trial to proceed simply to establish that a person was subjected to unlawful battery is all the greater where, as here, there is a risk of substantial police time and resources being diverted to prepare for and proceed with the trial. The point is not as clear-cut as in <i>Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire </i>[1989]  AC 53, but, as in that case, according to Lord Keith of Kinkel at p 63G, a “great deal of police time, trouble and expense might be expected to have to be put into the preparation of the defence to the action” resulting in “a significant diversion of police manpower and attention from their most important function, that of the suppression of crime.”</p>
<i></i><p class="para"><i>Conclusion on whether the battery claim should proceed</i> </p>
<p class="para">130.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I acknowledge that there is a real case to the contrary, I have come to the conclusion that the claim in battery should not be allowed to proceed. The Chief Constable has conceded that he is liable for the death of Mr Ashley, albeit only on grounds of negligence, and has proffered a full public apology, so there is only a rather limited purpose in pursuing any point of principle, either from the point of view of the Ashleys or in the public interest. The Chief Constable has also agreed to pay all the damages which could flow from the killing of Mr Ashley, so the Ashleys have no financial interest in the battery claim proceeding. There has been a three week criminal trial (albeit that it did not go beyond the prosecution case), and two inquiries (albeit not a full public inquiry), so there has been real and detailed scrutiny in more than one forum, one of which was wholly in public, of the circumstances in which Mr Ashley was killed. The entities primarily responsible for any further public investigation, the Home Office and the Coroner, have decided that such an investigation would be unnecessary. </p>
<p class="para">131.&nbsp;&nbsp;Taken together, these points make out a formidable case for staying a claim whose purpose is simply to try and establish that the police were liable for Mr Ashleys death on the ground of battery as well as their conceded negligence. As Cooke P said in the New Zealand Court of Appeal, in a case on strikingly similar facts, <i>Re Chase </i>[1989]  1 NZLR 325, 334, the “basic facts of the episode culminating in [the deceased’s] death have become well known. … Little or nothing would be likely to be gained by further raking over of the details.” What he went on to say (on the following page) is also equally applicable here, namely “this is not such an exceptional case as to justify the Court in embarking, under the declaratory jurisdiction, into an inquiry into the death of the deceased". He also said that in that case “to allow the action to proceed under the guise of a claim for nominal damages … would be an abuse of procedure"; similarly, it be inappropriate to allow the Ashleys’ claim for battery simply to recover damages already awarded for negligence.</p>
<p class="para">132.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there is an obvious and substantial public interest in any death for which the police are responsible being publicly investigated, especially where there is an arguable case that the killing was unlawful. However, in this case, the three primary routes to obtaining a public investigation have either been taken or, perfectly lawfully, not been adopted, there have been two internal inquiries (one of them statutory and independent), as well as a public apology, and a full acceptance of liability for damages to the family of the victim. I question whether, in those circumstances, it is right for court, exercising its common law jurisdiction in tort, to permit a trial to proceed simply because it may enable his family to show that the victim was killed by battery as well as negligence.</p>
<p class="para">133.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of additional significance are two other factors. The immediate perpetrator was prosecuted and acquitted seven years ago, and his reasonable interest, as an acquitted person whose actions 10 years ago would again be challenged in court, militates against the claim proceeding merely for the purpose of establishing in a civil court that he had committed the wrong of which he had been acquitted. Further, substantial costs and court time, as well as police effort, might very well have to be devoted to the claim if it proceeds, and a reliable assessment of a split second decision and action in very fraught circumstances would be difficult, especially more than 10 years after the event.</p>
<p class="para">134.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had wondered whether it would be appropriate to reverse the conclusion of the Court of Appeal on this issue, and stay the battery claim, given that the issue is one of discretion. However, the original discretion was that of Dobbs J, who clearly indicated that she would have stayed the battery claim for cogently expressed reasons, if she had not struck it out (because she concluded that reasonableness was not an ingredient of self-defence in a civil claim for battery) - see the passage quoted in para 146 of the Master of Rolls’ judgment. </p>
