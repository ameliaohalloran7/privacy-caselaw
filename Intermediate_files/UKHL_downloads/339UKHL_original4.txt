<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84.&nbsp;&nbsp;This decision has had the effect of restricting the way the court can react to cases of the kind which is illustrated by the these appeals.  In Mirza's case the Court of Appeal said that it could not initiate any further inquiries into the allegations that had been made, because the substance of what the juror said in her letter related to what was said and done between jurors in private after they were empanelled which can never be known because of the provisions of section 8(1) of the 1981 Act: para 21.  In Connor and Rollock's case the Vice President (Rose LJ) observed that the trial judge "no doubt very properly, being conscious of his possible susceptibility to proceedings for contempt of court, in the light of this court's decision in <i>Young</i>" did not disclose the juror's letter to counsel but sent it instead to the Court of Appeal in a sealed envelope.  These comments indicate the extent to which the court feels inhibited by that decision from reacting in a robust manner to allegations which raise doubts about the jury's impartiality, notwithstanding the requirements of article 6(1) of the Convention: see <i>Sander v United Kingdom</i> (2000)  31 EHRR 1003, 1010-1011, para 34.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85.&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of the court being in contempt of itself is, as was submitted in <i>Young's</i> case, difficult to grasp.  In <i>Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission,</i> <i>Petitioners </i>2001 SLT 1198, 1202G-H, para 15, the court drew attention to the difference between the situation where the court itself makes inquiries with the aim of bringing the court in question into contempt and that where it makes inquiries with the aim of trying to ensure that justice does not miscarry.  The proposition that the court ought not to "breach" section 8(1) of the 1981 Act, in the sense of permitting others to act in breach of the statute, is perhaps more intelligible.  But it raises questions, which do not seem to have been fully considered in <i>Young</i>, about the true meaning and effect of the subsection.  At the heart of this issue is the question, to whom is the subsection addressed?  In particular, do the persons to whom it is addressed include the court itself whether at first instance or on appeal?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86.&nbsp;&nbsp;The key to the meaning and effect of the subsection lies in its use of the verbs "obtain, disclose or solicit".  The word "disclose" is addressed in the first instance to jurors, but it is plain that it extends also to those who, having received the prohibited information from a juror either direct or at second-hand, extend the chain of communication by disclosing it to someone else: <i>Attorney General v Associated Newspapers Ltd</i> [1994]  2 AC 238.  The word "solicit" is directed to persons who seek to obtain the information from anyone else who is in possession of it.  The prohibited activity is inviting somebody to pass on particulars which he is not bound to give, but which may nevertheless be obtained from him by asking for them.  The effect of the inclusion of the word "obtain" is to widen the reach of the subsection, so that it catches those into whose hands the prohibited information comes as a result of some deliberate act without their having to ask for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87.&nbsp;&nbsp;This analysis does not, by itself, solve the problem as to whether the subsection applies to the court.  But it does invite more careful examination of the question what the words mean in this context.  Section 8 was enacted against the background of the decision in <i>Attorney General v New Statesman and Nation Publishing Co Ltd</i> [1981]  QB 1.  The Attorney General had applied for an order of contempt of court at common law following the publication in the "New Statesman" of a juror's account of significant parts of the jury's deliberations in the course of arriving at their verdict in the trial of the prominent politician, Jeremy Thorpe.  The application failed on the ground that the contents of the article did not justify the title of contempt of court.  The court held that there were no special circumstances, other than publication of some of the secrets of the jury room, that called for condemnation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Divisional Court referred in its judgment to the 10th Report of the Criminal Law Revision Committee, <i>Secrecy of Jury Room</i> (1968) (Cmnd 3750).  The Committee had concluded, in response to the Home Secretary's request that it should consider whether statutory provision should be made to protect the secrecy of the jury room, that the rule of secrecy should remain one of conduct and that it was to be hoped that intervention by the Press Council would be effectual to check any abuse of the freedom which then existed to approach jurors for this information.  The court observed that the Committee evidently did not take the view that there was already a sufficient obligation imposed by the common law to protect the secrecy of the jury room, but that it did not think that it was immediately necessary or desirable to do this by statute: [1981]  QB 1, 10G-11C.  It is plain that events following the Jeremy Thorpe trial led to a different view being taken on the question whether legislation was necessary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt in the light of this background, as Lord Lowry said in <i>Attorney General v Associated Newspapers Ltd</i> [1994]  2 AC 238, 256D, that the mischief to which the subsection was directed was the release of information to the press which ought to be kept secret.  There is nothing, apart perhaps for the provisions of section 8(2)(a) to which Lord Taylor of Gosforth CJ referred in <i>Young's</i> case, to suggest that it was intended to prevent the court itself from doing what is necessary in the interests of justice if presented with an allegation that the defendant did not receive a fair trial.  As the Criminal Law Revision Committee observed in para 10 of its Report, the obligation to maintain secrecy cannot be absolute:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Jurors are clearly under a duty to inform the court at once of any irregularity which occurs during their deliberations.  Even after a trial disclosure may be necessary in the interests of justice."  <p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 8(2)(a) permits the disclosure of information "in the proceedings in question" for the purpose of enabling the jury to arrive at their verdict or in connection with its delivery.  It was suggested in <i>R v Young (Stephen)</i> [1995]  QB 324, 330G that, if the court were excluded from the embargo in section 8(1), this provision would not have been necessary.  But some relaxation of the embargo was obviously needed, as the Criminal Law Revision Committee had predicted, to permit jurors to perform their duty of informing the court of any irregularity which occurs during their deliberations.  To exclude the court itself from the embargo would not deprive the provision of its content.  The better view is that a court cannot be in contempt of itself.  In my opinion section 8(1) is addressed to third parties who can be punished for contempt, and not to the court which has the responsibility of ensuring that the defendant receives a fair trial.  The observations to the contrary in <i>R v Young (Stephen)</i> at p 330 F-H should now be disapproved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Fitzgerald QC made it clear that his primary submission was that section 8(1) could be interpreted, according to the ordinary rules of statutory construction, in such a way as to exclude from its scope disclosure of the prohibited information to the Court of Appeal and the obtaining of any further information that was needed on its authority.  But he said that, if that was not possible, the interpretative obligation in section 3(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998 should be applied, failing which your Lordships should consider making a declaration of incompatibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, for my part, hold that the ordinary rules of statutory construction provide a sufficient vehicle for giving a meaning to section 8(1) of the 1981 Act which will enable the court to do what is necessary in the interests of justice.  Where allegations are made which suggest that a defendant is not receiving, or did not receive, the fair trial to which he was entitled under article 6(1) of the Convention, they must be considered and investigated. Any investigation must, of course, be within the limits that are set by the common law.  Evidence which is struck at by the common law rule will be inadmissible, and the court should not ask for or receive such evidence.  But there is nothing in the statute that expressly inhibits or restricts the court in its performance of this task, and I do not think that an intention to do this can or should be read into it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obvious that the court cannot release jurors, journalists or anyone else from the constraints of section 8(1).  But it is going too far to suggest, as the Court of Appeal appears to have done in <i>Young's</i> case, that the trial court will be in contempt of itself if during the trial, having received allegations such as those made by the jurors in these cases, it investigates them and discloses the result of these investigations to counsel so that they may have an opportunity of making submissions about them to the court; or that the Court of Appeal in its turn, or persons acting under its direction, will be in contempt if the Court of Appeal decides that in the interests of justice the allegations must be investigated.  The court must look to the common law for guidance as to the extent to which any such investigation is permissible.</p>
<i><p><i>The common law prohibition</i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is common ground that the primary obstacle to the admission of the evidence which the appellants seek to adduce in this case is to be found not in the statute but in the common law rule that evidence of jury deliberations after the verdict has been delivered is inadmissible.  This raises the question whether the common law rule is incompatible with article 6(1) of the Convention and, if so, whether it requires to be modified.  But it is first necessary to examine the existing state of the rule and the reasons on which it is based.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95.&nbsp;&nbsp;The general rule is that the court will not investigate, or receive evidence about, anything said in the course of the jury's deliberations while they are considering their verdict in their retiring room.  The importance of this rule was recognised long ago in an opinion given by Lord Mansfield in <i>Vaise v Delaval</i> (1785)  1 TR 11, 99 ER 944 (KB), where it was held that the court could not receive affidavits from two jurors indicating that they had decided on their verdict by tossing a coin to resolve the issue.  The rationale that was given was that this was to protect them against self-incrimination for what he described as a very high misdemeanour.  So the evidence had to come from some other source.  This was an innovation upon the prior practice, which had been to receive evidence from jurors and others about misconduct or irregularities during the trial without discrimination: 8 Wigmore, <i>Evidence in Trials at Common Law, </i>J McNaughton rev ed (1961), para 2352.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96.&nbsp;&nbsp;The rule was also recognised long ago in Scotland: see Hume, <i>Commentaries of the Law of Scotland respecting Crimes</i>, the first edition of which was published in 1797.  What, Hume asked, was to be done if the verdict is challenged on the ground that it had been obtained improperly, such as by the use of unlawful means to obtain the jurors' assent to it?   He gave this answer, as it appears in the 4th edition (1844) at p 429, in terms which place the rationale for the rule on a more secure basis:</p>
<p></p><ul>"If a plea of this sort, in impeachment of the substance of a verdict, can at all be listened to, one thing at least seems to be clear, that it can only be in those cases, comparatively but few in number, where the jury re-enter the Court straightway on breaking up their private sitting.  For if they disperse, and disclose their verdict (as sometimes happens,) then are they exposed to all those temptations, from the opinions and commentaries of the world, against which it is the very object of our law to guard, when it orders them to be inclosed; and they may thus be prevailed with to disavow their genuine verdict, on false and affected grounds.  Nay, though they conceal even, as they ought to do, the result of their deliberations, yet still they learn the sentiments of others concerning the case and the evidence, and are liable to be influenced, less or more, by what they thus hear passing in the world."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Pirie v Caledonian Railway Company</i> (1890)  17 R 1157, 1161 Lord President Inglis said that it was out of the question for the court to entertain any challenge after the trial to a verdict which had been delivered and agreed to by the jurors as their verdict.  He said that this point had been regarded as settled in Scotland in <i>Stewart v Fraser</i> (1830)  5 Murray 166, in which the Lord Chief Commissioner Adam had referred to the passage from Hume's <i>Commentaries</i> which I have set out above in which, as the Lord President put it, the principle could not have been better expressed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98.&nbsp;&nbsp;The common law rule which prohibited the admission of juror testimony to impeach a jury verdict was firmly established in the United States also by the beginning of the twentieth century: <i>Tanner v United States</i> (1987) 483 US 107, 117.  Substantial policy considerations were thought to support the rule.  In <i>McDonald v Pless</i> (1915) 238 US 264, 267-268, the court set out the reasons for it in terms which are equally valid in this jurisdiction:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Let it once be established that verdicts solemnly made and publicly returned into court can be attacked and set aside on the testimony of those who took part in their publication and all verdicts could be, and many would be, followed by an inquiry in the hope of discovering something which might invalidate the finding.  Jurors would be harassed and beset by the defeated party in an effort to secure from them evidence of facts which might establish misconduct sufficient to set aside a verdict.  If evidence thus secured could be thus used, the result would be to make what was intended to be a private deliberation, the constant subject of public investigation - to the destruction of all frankness and freedom of discussion and conference." <p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Ellis v Deheer</i> [1922]  2 KB 113 the Court of Appeal heard an application for a new trial of a civil action which had been tried before a jury on the ground that the verdict as delivered by the foreman was not the verdict of the jury.  The opportunity was taken to reaffirm the rule that once a verdict has been given it is not open to a juror to challenge it, or to attempt to support it if it is challenged.  Bankes LJ expressed the consequences of the rule in these terms, at pp 117-118:</p>
<p></p><ul>"I desire to make it clear that the court will never admit evidence from jurymen of the discussion which they may have had between themselves when considering their verdict or of the reasons for their decision, whether the discussion took place in the jury room after retirement or in the jury box itself.  It has for many years been a well accepted rule that when once a verdict has been given it ought not to be open to an individual juryman to challenge it, or to attempt to support it if challenged.  I have spoken of this as a rule of law, but it has also been generally accepted by the public as a rule of conduct, that what passes in the jury room during the discussion by the jury of what their verdict should be ought to be treated as private and confidential."  <p></p></ul>
<p>At p 121 Atkin LJ said that the rule prohibits the leading of evidence as to what took place in the jury room by way of explanation of the grounds upon which the verdict was given or by way of a statement as to what the juror believed its effect to be.  He added this explanation as to its rationale:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The reason why that evidence is not admitted is twofold, on the one hand it is in order to secure the finality of decisions arrived at by the jury, and on the other to protect the jurymen themselves and prevent their being exposed to pressure to explain the reasons which actuated them in arriving at their verdict.  To my mind it is a principle which it is of the highest importance in the interests of justice to maintain, and an infringement of the rule appears to me a very serious interference with the administration of justice."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Boston v W S Bagshaw &amp; Sons (Note)</i> [1966]  1 WLR 1135, 1136, following <i>Ellis v Deheer</i>, Lord Denning MR said that once a jury have given their verdict, and it has been accepted by the judge, and they have been discharged, they are not at liberty to say that they meant something different, adding by way of elaboration of what had been said in that case by Atkin LJ:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The reasons for this are twofold: first, to secure the finality of decisions arrived at by the jury; secondly, to protect the jury themselves and to prevent them being exposed to pressure or inducement to explain or alter their views.  If this were to be permitted, where is it to stop?  After a jury have solemnly found a man 'Guilty' and he has been sentenced, are they to be at liberty next day to return and say they meant to find him 'Not Guilty'?  It cannot be."  <p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>R v Miah</i> [1997]  2 Cr App R 12, 18 the Court of Appeal said that the reasoning in <i>Ellis v Deheer</i> must extend to anything said by one juror to another about the case from the moment the jury is empanelled.  In <i>R v Qureshi</i> [2002] 1 WLR 518 a juror alleged after the trial was over that disparaging remarks about the defendant had been made by jurors throughout the trial which were of a racist nature.  The Court of Appeal, observing that the court must follow <i>R v Miah</i>, said, at p 522E, para 14:</p>
<p></p><ul>"If we follow it, we cannot have any regard to anything said by the juror thus far.  Nor can we initiate any further inquiries because the substance of what she has said relates to what was said and done between jurors in private after they were empanelled."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102.&nbsp;&nbsp;The common law recognises exceptions to the rule, but they are confined to situations where the jury is alleged after the verdict has been delivered to have been affected by what were described by O'Connor J in <i>Tanner v United States</i> 483 US 107, 117 as extraneous influences.  In <i>R v Papadopoulos</i> [1979]  1 NZLR 621, 627, Cooke J said that the rule of exclusion is usually understood not to apply to evidence, even by the jurors themselves, about matters extrinsic to their deliberations.  Examples can be given of cases that fall on either side of this exception.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Ellis v Deheer</i> [1922]  2 KB 113, the rule was departed from in highly unusual circumstances, following <i>R v Wooller</i> (1817)  2 Stark 111, when some of the jurors, although present when the verdict was delivered, were so placed that they were not able to hear what the foreman said and were in fact in disagreement with it.  The exclusionary rule was held not to be infringed by evidence that the jurors could not see or hear what was taking place when the verdict was announced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Ras Behari Lal v King-Emperor</i> (1933)  50 TLR 1 it was alleged that one of the jurors did not understand English, which was the language in which some of the evidence was given, the addresses of counsel were made and the judge had delivered his summing up.  An inquiry was held, and it was reported that it was indeed the case that the juror had insufficient English to be able to follow what had been said.  Giving the judgment of the Board, disapproving <i>R v Thomas</i>  [1933] 2 KB 489 where the Court of Criminal Appeal had refused to receive evidence that two Welsh-speaking jurors at Merioneth Quarter Sessions did not have sufficient knowledge of English to enable them to follow the proceedings, Lord Atkin said, at p 2:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The question whether a juror is competent for physical or other reasons to understand the proceedings is not a question which invades the privacy of the discussions in the jury-box or in the retiring-room.  It does not seek to inquire into the reasons for a verdict."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105.&nbsp;&nbsp;Commenting on that case in <i>Lalchan Nanan v The State</i> [1986]  AC 860, where the Board refused to admit the evidence of four members of the jury, including the foreman, that they were acting under a misapprehension when they agreed to the verdict, Lord Goff of Chieveley said, at p 872D-E, that their Lordships did not wish to exclude altogether the possibility that other cases might arise in the future where the presumption might be rebutted.  In <i>R v Millward</i> [1999]  1 Cr App R 61, where the foreman wrote to the judge the next day saying that she had made a mistake when she said on the jury's behalf that the verdict of guilty was the verdict of them all, Lord Bingham of Cornhill CJ said, at p 65:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It would in our judgment set a very dangerous precedent if, save in quite extraordinary circumstances, an apparently unanimous verdict of a jury delivered in open court, and not then and there challenged by any juror, were to be re-opened and subjected to scrutiny."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106.&nbsp;&nbsp;These observations may be contrasted with the decisions reached in cases where the argument undoubtedly was that the jurors' deliberations had been affected by extraneous influences.  In <i>R v Hood</i> [1968]  1 WLR 773 the juror was acquainted with one of the witnesses and may have known of the appellant's record.  In <i>R v Brandon</i> (1969)  53 Cr App R 466 remarks were made by the bailiff which might have indicated that the appellant had previous convictions.  In <i>R v Young (Stephen)</i> [1995]  QB 324, 331C-D (the ouija board case) the Court of Appeal held that it could consider an alleged irregularity which related to something other than the jurors' deliberations among themselves in the jury room.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107.&nbsp;&nbsp;These exceptions do not, of course, provide an avenue for dealing with the allegations that have been made in these cases.  These allegations are directed to what took place during the jury's deliberations in the jury room.  There is no suggestion that the comments which were made were extrinsic to those deliberations.  It is obvious that we are not dealing here with events that took place outside the jury room.  Nor are we dealing with irregularities which may have led to the jury being provided with information which they should not have had, or with the possession by a juror of knowledge or characteristics which made it inappropriate for that person to serve on the jury.  The question which these cases raise is whether the boundary between what is admissible and what is inadmissible, between what is extrinsic and what is intrinsic to the deliberations, has been drawn in the right place.</p>
<i><p><i>The Strasbourg jurisprudence</i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108.&nbsp;&nbsp;The rationale which underpins the common law rule has been recognised and accepted by the European Court of Human Rights.  It has examined allegations that jurors were racially biased on two occasions.  In <i>Gregory v United Kingdom</i> (1997)  25 EHRR 577 the applicant, who was black, was on trial for robbery.  On the final day of the trial, while the jury were considering their verdict, a note was passed by the jury to the trial judge to the effect that the jury were showing racial overtones and that one member ought to be excused.  The judge showed the note to the prosecution and the defence.  Having consulted them, he warned the jury to put aside any prejudice and try the case according to the evidence.  Following his conviction the applicant complained that he had not received a fair trial.  He said that he had been discriminated against on the ground of race.  The court noted at p 593, para 43 that it was of fundamental importance in a democratic society that the courts inspire confidence in the public and above all, as far as criminal proceedings are concerned, in the accused.  At pp 593-594, para 44 the court said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The court observes that it was not disputed that there was no evidence of actual or subjective bias on the part of one or more jurors.  It was also accepted by both the applicant and the Government that it was not possible under English law for the trial judge to question the jurors about the circumstances which gave rise to the note.  The court acknowledges that the rule governing the secrecy of jury deliberations is a crucial and legitimate feature of English trial law which serves to reinforce the jury's role as the ultimate arbiter of fact and to guarantee open and frank deliberations among jurors on the evidence which they have heard.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Furthermore, the members of the jury were committed by oath or affirmation to faithfully try the applicant and to give a true verdict according to the evidence."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Sander v United Kingdom</i> (2000)  31 EHRR 1003 the applicant, who was an Asian, was on trial with two others for conspiracy to defraud.  The judge had almost completed his summing up when a juror handed a letter to the court usher in which he alleged that at least two of the jurors had been making remarks which were openly racist and expressed his concern that the defendants would not receive a fair verdict.  The judge, having discussed the complaint with counsel in chambers, decided not to discharge the jury immediately or to conduct an inquiry.  He told the jury to search their conscience overnight and to let the court know if they felt that they were not able to try the case solely on the evidence.  Having received assurances by letter the next morning that they would do so without racial bias, he allowed the trial to proceed and the applicant was convicted.  The European Court held by four votes to three that there had been a violation of article 6(1), on the ground that the judge should have acted in a more robust manner and that he had failed to provide sufficient guarantees to exclude any objectively justified or legitimate doubts about the impartiality of the court: pp 1010-1011, para 34.  Sir Nicolas Bratza, joined by two other judges, dissented on the grounds which are carefully set out in his closely reasoned opinion.  The case is important for present purposes because the court took the opportunity to recall its observation in <i>Gregory</i>, p 593, para 43 about the fundamental importance of public confidence in the courts: see p 1008, para 22.  It did not repeat its observation in <i>Gregory</i>, pp 593-594, para 44, that the rule governing the secrecy of jury deliberations was a crucial and legitimate feature of English trial law, although it was not overlooked as Sir Nicolas Bratza referred to it in his dissenting opinion: see p 1013, para O-II4.  It is significant, in view of that dissent, that the European Court did not depart from the rule in any respect in <i>Sander</i> and that nothing was said in the judgment which casts doubt on its validity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110.&nbsp;&nbsp;My noble and learned friend Lord Steyn has drawn attention to what the Court said in <i>Remli v France</i> (1996)  22 EHRR 253, 271-272, paras 47 and 48.  The critical passage in that case is to be found in para 48, where the Court said that it agreed with the Commission that article 6(1) imposes an obligation on every national court to check whether, as constituted, it is "an impartial tribunal" within the meaning of that provision where this is disputed on a ground that does not immediately appear to be manifestly devoid of merit.  The Court did not mention the<i> Remli</i> case in its judgment in <i>Sander.</i>  But it is worth noting the observations that were made about the case in <i>Gregory</i>, p 595, para 49, where it said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The Court further observes that the facts at issue are to be distinguished from those which led it to find a violation in the abovementioned <i>Remli </i>case.  In that case, the trial judges failed to react to an allegation that an identifiable juror had been overheard to say that he was a racist.  In the present case, the judge was faced with an allegation of jury racism which, although vague and imprecise, could not be said to be devoid of substance.  In the circumstances, he took sufficient steps to check that the court was established as an impartial tribunal within the meaning of article 6(1) of the Convention and he offered sufficient guarantees to dispel any doubts in this regard."<p></p></ul>
