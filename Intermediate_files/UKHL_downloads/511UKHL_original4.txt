<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88. The appellants further submitted that even if they could not rely on article 6, they were entitled to claim that the admission of the evidence of witness CS/1 was in breach of their right under article 5(4) of the Convention to take proceedings for a speedy decision of the lawfulness of their detention.  In my opinion the Administrative Courts were also right to reject this submission.  I consider that at the committal proceedings the appellants were able to challenge the lawfulness of their detention, and as they cannot rely on article 6 in respect of that hearing they cannot claim the rights given by article 6 by relying on article 5(4).</p>
<i><p><i>The sufficiency of the evidence</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89. The test for the magistrate to apply to the sufficiency of the evidence before him is that set out in paragraph 7(1) of Schedule 1 to the 1989 Actâ€” whether the evidence produced would make a case requiring an answer by the prisoner at a trial.  Counsel for Mr Al-Fawwaz accepted that if it was proper for the magistrate to admit the evidence of CS/1 this test was satisfied in his case.  However in his evidence CS/l did not refer to either Mr Abdel Bary or Mr Eidarous by name and counsel for these two appellants submitted that the evidence against them was insufficient for the magistrate to commit.  This submission was considered in the judgment of the Administrative Court delivered by Kennedy LJ.  As he observed, citing the judgment of Lloyd LJ in <i>R v United States Government, Ex p Blair, </i> The Times, 21 June 1985, the question for the High Court to decide is not whether the evidence constitutes a case to answer but whether a reasonable magistrate, directing himself properly and in accordance with the law, could take that view.  This question was carefully considered by Kennedy LJ who outlined in his judgment, in paragraphs 17 to 30, the various strands of evidence and concluded that the facts as a whole were capable of enabling a court to come to the conclusion that each defendant was guilty of the proposed charge.  In my opinion the Administrative Court was fully entitled to come to this decision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90. The two appellants further submitted that the decision of the magistrate to commit was flawed because he failed to give reasons for his decision and this submission was rejected by the Administrative Court. In <i>Rey v Government of Switzerland</i> [1999]  1 AC 54, 66F Lord Steyn, in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Despite a growing practice in England of stipendiary magistrates to give reasons in extradition proceedings it has not been held that magistrates are under a legal duty to do so.  And the legal position in England is perhaps justified by the right of the fugitive to apply for habeas corpus to the Divisional Court if the decision of the stipendiary magistrate goes against him:  see section 11 of the Extradition Act 1989. . . . In these circumstances their Lordships are not prepared to hold that there is a general implied duty upon magistrates to give reasons in respect of all disputed issues of fact and law in extradition proceedings.  But their Lordships must enter a cautionary note:  it is unnecessary in the present case to consider whether in the great diversity of cases which come before magistrates in extradition proceedings the principle of fairness may in particular circumstances require a magistrate to give reasons."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91. Counsel for the appellant submitted that in the particular circumstance of this case fairness required the magistrate to give reasons.  In fact the magistrate did give some reasons.  He said in the course of delivering his decision and referring to two faxes claiming responsibility for the Nairobi bombing and the Tanzania bombing:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Nevertheless, I am satisfied that a jury, properly directed, <i>could</i> conclude, on the totality of the evidence that the claims were sent before the bombings.  Similarly a jury <i>could</i> conclude, regardless of whether they conclude the claims were sent before or after the bombings, that they were genuine.  Similarly a jury <i>could</i> conclude that both defendants played a part in the dissemination of the claims to the international media.  Further, a jury <i>could</i> conclude that Bin Laden was the moving force behind the bombings and played a central part in the conspiracy to cause the explosions.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"I have carefully re-read all the defence written submissions and my notes and considered those matters afresh.  It does not seem to me to be either sensible or desirable that I should deal with each point in turn.  Any review of my decision would necessitate those conducting the review to come to their own conclusion on whether there is a case to answer, rather than deciding whether or not there are flaws in my approach or reasoning.  I am satisfied that the facts taken as a whole are <i>capable</i> of enabling this court (or a jury properly directed) to come to the conclusion that the only reasonable inference to be drawn from them is that each defendant is guilty of the proposed charge.  Thus each has a case to answer."<p></p></ul>
<p>However counsel submitted that these reasons were inadequate.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92. In a case where there was such a mass of material and where the issue was whether a reasonable jury could draw the inference from that material that the prisoners were parties to the conspiracy alleged, striking a balance between stating his reasons briefly and over elaboration presented the magistrate with a task of some difficulty.  Kennedy LJ said, in paragraph 40, of his judgment that he would have found it helpful if the magistrate had given more detailed reasons, but he rejected the submission that his reasons were inadequate and he stated, at paragraph 41, of his judgment:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The magistrate did explain his approach, and it can be said that he was being realistic.  Even if he had attempted to explain in more detail the case which he decided required an answer it is overwhelmingly likely that we would have still been required to carry out the exercise performed in this court.  Accordingly I do not accept that in law his reasons were inadequate, and even if I were able to accept that submission I cannot see that it would afford any basis for relief given that, in reality, in my judgment there were good reasons for the magistrate deciding as he did."<p></p></ul>
<p>I consider that Kennedy LJ was right so to hold.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93. Accordingly for the reasons which I have given I would dismiss the three appeals.  I would add that the matters referred to by my noble and learned friend Lord Scott of Foscote in paragraph 121 of his speech were not referred to in argument before the House and I express no opinion in relation to them.</p>
<p><b>LORD MILLETT</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94. The double criminality rule lies at the heart of our law of extradition. It is a precondition of extradition that the offence for which extradition may be ordered should be within the criminal jurisdiction of both the requesting and the requested state. The question for decision in the present case is whether this means the territorial jurisdiction of the states concerned or embraces their extraterritorial jurisdiction also.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95. In considering this question it is important to bear the objects of the double criminality rule in mind, for its two requirements serve different purposes. The first requirement, that the offence for which extradition is ordered should be within the jurisdiction of the requesting state, serves a purely practical purpose. There is no point in extraditing a person for an offence for which the requesting state cannot try him. The second requirement, that the offence should also be within our own criminal jurisdiction, serves to protect the accused from the exercise of an exorbitant foreign jurisdiction. Views as to what constitutes an exorbitant jurisdiction naturally differ; the test adopted by our own law has been to accord to other countries the jurisdiction which we claim ourselves but no more. As my noble and learned friend Lord Rodger of Earlsferry has observed, this is not the only means of protection given by our system of extradition, for the exercise of an exorbitant foreign jurisdiction may be forestalled by executive action. But it is the only measure of judicial control which the law provides for this purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96. The first requirement is given effect by the definition of "fugitive criminal" in paragraph 20 of Schedule 1 to the Extradition Act 1989; the second by the definition of "extradition crime" (where as in the present case the relevant Order in Council was made before the coming into force of the 1989Act) in Section 26 of the Extradition Act 1870.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97. The magistrate's power to commit a person to prison to await extradition is contained in paragraph 7 of Schedule 1 to the 1989 Act as amended.  This provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"7 - &nbsp;&nbsp;(1) In the case of a fugitive criminal accused of an extradition crime, if the foreign warrant authorising the arrest of such criminal is duly authenticated, and such evidence is produced as (subject to the provisions of this Schedule) would, according to the law of England and Wales, make a case requiring an answer by the prisoner if the proceedings were for the trial in England and Wales of an information for the crime, the metropolitan magistrate shall commit him to prison, but otherwise shall order him to be discharged.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(2) In the case of a fugitive criminal alleged to have been convicted of an extradition crime, if such evidence is produced as (subject to the provisions of this Schedule) would, according to the law of England and Wales, prove that the prisoner was convicted of such crime, the metropolitan magistrate shall commit him to prison, but otherwise shall order him to be discharged."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98. Thus the magistrate must satisfy himself not only that the foreign warrant is duly authenticated but also (1) that the accused is "a fugitive criminal" (2) who is accused or has been convicted of "an extradition crime" and (3) that the evidence would according to our own law make a case requiring an answer if the proceedings were for trial here.</p>
<i><p>Fugitive criminal</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99. "Fugitive criminal" is defined as follows:</p>
<p></p><ul>"'fugitive criminal' means any person accused or convicted of an extradition crime committed within the jurisdiction of any foreign state who is in or is suspected of being in some part of Her Majesty's dominions;<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100. Two points deserve particular attention. First, in order to found his jurisdiction in an accusation case the magistrate must satisfy himself only that the person brought before him is <i>accused</i> of an extradition crime committed within the jurisdiction of the requesting state; for this limited purpose he is not required to satisfy himself that the accusation is well founded. Accordingly he will ordinarily need to look no further than the allegations in the indictment and the supporting documentation. Secondly, the requirement that the offence in question should constitute an extradition crime committed within the jurisdiction of the requesting state applies equally to both accusation and conviction cases. Accordingly the expression "the jurisdiction of" the requesting state must bear a meaning which is capable of accommodating both kinds of case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101. The question for decision is whether these words refer to the territorial jurisdiction of the requesting state over crimes committed within its own territory (expansively defined to include for example its ships or colonies) or whether they also embrace its extra-territorial jurisdiction, however wide this may be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102. I have no doubt that the latter interpretation is correct. My reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) As I have already explained, it is not the function of this branch of the double criminality rule to protect the accused from the exercise of an exorbitant foreign jurisdiction. That is adequately catered for by the other branch of the rule and by other means.</p>
<p>(2) As a matter of ordinary language, the  "jurisdiction of a state" in the criminal context simply means its power to try an offender for an alleged offence, and includes both its territorial and extra-territorial jurisdiction. The meaning of the expression may, of course, be controlled by its context, as when we speak of "leaving the jurisdiction"; but there is no controlling context here.</p>
<p>(3) Although the general rule is that "[t]he jurisdiction over the crime belongs to the country where the crime is committed" (see <i>Macleod v Attorney General for New South Wales</i> [1891]  AC 455, 458 per<i> </i>Lord Halsbury LC) most countries exercise some degree of extra-territorial jurisdiction and were doing so well before 1870. The English courts have for centuries claimed jurisdiction to try British subjects for murder committed abroad; most civil law countries exercise a similar jurisdiction based on the nationality of the victim rather than that of the accused.</p>
<p>(4) There is high authority for and sound sense in the proposition that extradition treaties should not be construed in a way which would "hinder the working and narrow the operation of most salutary international arrangements" see <i>R v Governor of Ashford Remand Centre, Ex p Postlethwaite</i> [1988]  AC 924, 947 per Lord<i> </i>Bridge of Harwich. This is even more the case in today's global village where national borders are no impediment to international terrorists and other criminals.</p>
<p>(5) The Extradition Act is an enabling Act. It applies not only to existing treaties but also to future treaties yet to be entered into. These may, of course, place further restrictions on the powers of the English Courts to order extradition but they may not extend them beyond those conferred by the Act. Such an Act should be given a wide construction in order not to fetter the power of the executive to enter into future treaties in future in whatever terms may be considered appropriate.</p>
<p>(6) The Act would be unworkable in some conviction cases if the magistrate had to be satisfied that the crime been committed within the territorial jurisdiction of the requesting state. For this purpose, he should look no further than the conviction itself, yet this may not provide an answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103. While the other reasons are sufficient in themselves to indicate the correct interpretation of the word "jurisdiction", I regard this last as conclusive. Take this very case, where the appellants are accused of conspiring to murder American citizens in the United States and abroad. The conspiracy is alleged to have been entered into and all the victims to have been murdered outside the United States. Very few overt acts are alleged to have taken place within the United States, and they may not be proved.  The United States does not claim extra-territorial jurisdiction to try cases of murder on the basis of the nationality of the victims, yet it is conceded that the offences of which the appellants are accused are within its extra-territorial jurisdiction. Suppose the appellants had been convicted of the charges by a United States court and had escaped to the United Kingdom, so that it was a conviction and not an accusation case. The magistrate would look at the certificate of conviction in order to decide whether the offences of which they had been convicted were "committed within the jurisdiction of the United States". He would observe that the appellants had been found guilty of the offence of conspiracy and that it was alleged that some of the overt acts had taken place in the United States. But he would also observe from the summing up that the judge had instructed the jury that the offence was one over which the United States had extra-territorial jurisdiction and did not depend on the commission of any overt acts within its territory; so that they could convict even if they were not satisfied that any such acts had in fact taken place. In such a case it would be impossible to discover from the verdict or otherwise whether the jury had or had not been satisfied that overt acts had been committed in the United States as alleged. In these circumstances the magistrate would have no way of telling whether the accused had been convicted of an offence within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States or not.</p>
<i></i><p><i>Extradition crime</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104. "Extradition crime" is defined as follows:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The term 'extradition crime' means a crime which, if committed in England or within English jurisdiction, would be one of the crimes described in the first Schedule to this Act."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105. The same question arises here: whether the words "within English jurisdiction" mean within our territorial jurisdiction or whether they extend to our extra-territorial jurisdiction. I have no doubt that the latter interpretation is correct. My reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The contradistinction between "in England" and "within English jurisdiction" points strongly in favour of the wider interpretation. It is not in itself conclusive, since the latter expression could be intended merely to bring in British ships and colonies. But why stop there, when the English criminal jurisdiction has always been wider than this?</p>
<p>(2) The only reason for distinguishing between one kind of jurisdiction and another is the need to protect the accused from the exercise of an exorbitant foreign jurisdiction. But there is no justification for classifying as exorbitant a jurisdiction which, <i>mutatis mutandis,</i> we claim ourselves. The thinking behind this part of the definition is that we should not extradite for an offence which, in the corresponding circumstances, we could not try ourselves.</p>
<p>(3) The policy which underlies the law of extradition is that a criminal should not escape trial and punishment by leaving one country and going to another. If the offence with which he is charged or of which he has been convicted is also an offence triable in the country to which he has fled, he should be returned for trial or punishment to the country from which he came.</p>
<p>(4) In <i>Liangsiriprasert v Government of the United States of America</i> [1991]  1 AC 225 the Privy Council rejected a submission that a conspiracy entered into abroad is not a crime at common law unless some overt act takes place in the territory of the forum, in that case Hong Kong. It was sufficient that the conspiracy was aimed at Hong Kong.  Although the point was not argued by counsel, who agreed that the principles of extradition were not in dispute and that the offences in question were extradition crimes, it was clearly assumed that the words "or within English jurisdiction" are not limited to English territorial jurisdiction. The case has, in my view rightly, been taken as clear authority for that proposition in the leading textbook on the subject (see <i>Jones on Extradition</i> (1995), p 88).</p>
<p>(5) The list of extradition crimes contained in the Schedule includes piracy <i>iure gentium. </i>This is an offence which can only be committed on the high seas and (unlike municipal piracy) on a foreign ship. Accordingly it <i>cannot </i>be committed in England or within the territorial jurisdiction of the English courts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106. I regard this last point as conclusive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107. Crimes which are the natural subject of extradition proceedings are almost invariably committed abroad and as such are usually outside the jurisdiction of the English courts, however widely that expression may be construed. So the conduct which constitutes an extradition crime does not consist of acts which actually were committed in England or within English jurisdiction, but rather conduct which would constitute a crime under English law if the acts in question were so committed. The test, therefore, is a hypothetical one, which calls for some degree of transposition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108. In <i>R v Governor of Pentonville Prison, Ex p Tarling</i> (1978)  70 Cr App R 77 Lord Keith of Kinkel stated, at p 136:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In considering the jurisdiction aspect it is necessary to suppose that England is substituted for Singapore as regards all the circumstances of the case connected with the latter country, and to examine the question whether upon that hypothesis and upon the evidence adduced the English courts would have jurisdiction to try the offences charged."<p></p></ul>
<p>This guidance was followed by the Divisional Court in <i>R v Governor of Pentonville Prison, Ex p Osman</i> [1990]  1 WLR 227. Lloyd LJ explained that only the acts which took place in the requesting state (Hong Kong) were to be treated as having taken place in England. All else remained as it in fact happened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109. For my own part, and subject to one point which I will mention in a moment, I think that this is the correct way to effect the transposition. The principle at work is <i>mutatis mutandis. </i>Given that the court is concerned with an extradition case, the crime will not have been committed in England but (normally) in the requesting state. So the test is applied by substituting England for the requesting state wherever the name of the requesting state appears in the indictment. But no more should be changed than is necessary to give effect to the fact that the court is dealing with an extradition case and not a domestic one. The word <i>mutandis </i>is an essential element in the concept; the court should not hypothesise more than necessary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110. The one point to which I would draw attention is that it is not sufficient to substitute England for the territory of the requesting state wherever that is mentioned in the indictment. It is necessary to effect an appropriate substitution for every circumstance connected with the requesting state on which the jurisdiction is founded. In the present case the appellants are accused, not merely of conspiring to murder persons abroad (who happened to be Americans), but of conspiring to murder persons unknown because they were Americans. In political terms, what is alleged is a conspiracy entered into abroad to wage war on the United States by killing its citizens, including its diplomats and other Internationally Protected Persons, at home and abroad.  Translating this into legal terms and transposing it for the purpose of seeing whether such conduct would constitute a crime "in England or within English jurisdiction", the charges must be considered as if they alleged a conspiracy entered into abroad to kill British subjects, including Internationally Protected Persons, at home or abroad.  Such a conspiracy would constitute a criminal offence within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of our courts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111. I should not, however, wish it to be thought that the inclusion of Internationally Protected Persons among the potential victims is necessary to found the jurisdiction.  A conspiracy formed outside the jurisdiction to commit a crime in England is triable in England even though no overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is committed in England: see <i>Liangsiriprasert </i>[1991] 1 AC 225, 250 Lord Griffiths pointed out that the inchoate crimes of conspiracy, attempt and incitement developed with the principal object of frustrating the commission of a contemplated crime by arresting and punishing the offenders before they committed the crime, and asked:</p>
<p></p><ul>"If the inchoate crime is aimed at England with the consequent injury to English society why should the English courts not accept jurisdiction to try it if the authorities can lay hands on the offenders, either because they come within the jurisdiction or through extradition procedures? If evidence is obtained that a terrorist cell operating abroad is planning a bombing campaign in London what sense can there be in the authorities holding their hand and not acting until the cell comes to England to plant the bombs, with the risk that the terrorists may slip through the net? Extradition should be sought before they have a chance to put their plan into action and they should be tried for conspiracy or the attempt as the case may be. Furthermore, if one of the conspirators should come to England, for whatever purpose, he should be liable to arrest and trial for the criminal agreement he has entered into."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112. When Lord Griffiths referred to a conspiracy "aimed at England" he was clearly thinking of a conspiracy to commit a crime in England.  If a conspiracy to plant bombs in England would be triable in England even though it was entirely inchoate and no bombs had yet been planted anywhere, a conspiracy to plant bombs in England and abroad where some bombs had already been planted abroad would be <i>a fortiori</i>.  This is sufficient to uphold the jurisdiction in the present case, since a conspiracy to murder British subjects because they were British and for no other reason must be a conspiracy to murder them wherever they might be found, whether in England or elsewhere; and such a conspiracy is (inter alia) a conspiracy to commit a crime in England.  Moreover, while the point does not strictly arise for decision in the present case, I do not think that a definition of the offence which requires the prosecution to prove an intent to murder British subjects in England as opposed to elsewhere is either sensible or likely to prove to be stable.  In my opinion, a conspiracy to plant bombs in British owned properties abroad and kill British subjects wherever they may be ought not to be the less triable in England because the conspirators do not plan to carry out their murderous campaign in England itself.</p>
<i>
<p>Sufficiency of the evidence</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113. The final matter which the magistrate is required to consider is whether the evidence is sufficient to make a case requiring an answer if the proceedings were for trial in England or Wales. This involves another hypothesis, but solely for the purpose of testing the sufficiency of the prosecution evidence. The magistrate is to consider this as if the proceedings were a purely domestic case. No transposition of facts and no feats of imagination are called for.</p>
<i>
</i><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114. Subject to the foregoing and in all other respects I am in full agreement with the speeches of my noble and learned friends Lord Hutton and Lord Rodger of Earlsferry. Like them, I would dismiss all three appeals.</p>
<p>LORD SCOTT OF FOSCOTE</p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115. I have had the advantage of reading in advance the opinions on these appeals given by my noble and learned friends Lord Slynn of Hadley, Lord Hutton, Lord Millett and Lord Rodger of Earlsferry.  I am in agreement with them and propose simply to add a few comments of my own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116. The purpose of extradition arrangements made between this country and other states is, in my view, twofold.  First there is the desire that malefactors should not be able to escape the criminal justice consequences of their misdeeds by sheltering in a country other than that against whose laws they have offended.  The comments of Cockburn CJ in <i>In re Tivnan</i> (1864)  5 B &amp; S 645, 678 and of Lord Bridge of Harwich in <i>Ex p Postlethwaite</i> [1988]  AC 924, 947, cited by Lord Hutton in his opinion, are very much in point.  But alleged malefactors who are present in this country, whether as permanent residents, as refugees or asylum seekers, or as visitors, are entitled, while they are here, to the protection of our laws and our standards of criminal justice.  They should not be exported abroad to face trial under a foreign criminal justice system unless, by our standards, there is a case against them that is fit for trial, and unless, by our standards, they will receive a fair trial in accordance with the requirements of article 6 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.  The second purpose of extradition arrangements is, or should be, to provide the requisite safeguards.</p>
