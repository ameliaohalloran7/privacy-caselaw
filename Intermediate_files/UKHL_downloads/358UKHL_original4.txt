<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ordered that the Bank should serve a further and better list of documents and make them available for inspection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal (Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers MR, Longmore and Thomas LJJ) dismissed the Bank's appeal.  In giving the judgment of the court, the Master of the Rolls commenced by defining legal advice, not as advice given by a lawyer but as "advice in relation to law".  He examined in some detail a series of authorities, which I shall consider in due course, and concluded (para 16) that the statements in them lent support to the argument that legal advice is restricted to advice about legal rights and liabilities.  He referred (para 25) to the opinion expressed by the Law Reform Committee in its 16th Report on Privilege in Civil Proceedings (1967) (Cmnd 3472), to the effect that the true rationale of legal advice privilege was that it was "a privilege in aid of litigation" and was concerned exclusively with rights and liabilities enforceable in law.  He regarded the authorities as supporting that statement, since he considered that in all of them the relationship of solicitor and client arose in relation to transactions involving legal rights and obligations capable of becoming the subject matter of litigation.  The court set out in paragraph 26 the conclusion which it drew from this examination:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In summary, the authorities to which we have referred show that, where a solicitor-client relationship is formed for the purpose of obtaining advice or assistance in relation to rights and liabilities, broad protection will be given to communications passing between solicitor and client in the course of that relationship.  In all the cases, however, the primary object of the relationship was to obtain assistance that required knowledge of the law.  We do not consider that the same principle applies to communications between solicitor and client when the dominant purpose is not the obtaining of advice and assistance in relation to legal rights and obligations."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal rejected (para 28) the Bank's argument that since the subject matter of the inquiry was very sensitive and the Bank could be subject to criticism or blame as a result of its findings, the giving of advice and assistance by the solicitors, being designed to protect the Bank against such a possibility, was in the context of a professional relationship that involved advising on legal rights and obligations.  It held that the advice and assistance sought was primarily in relation to the presentation of evidence to the inquiry rather than in relation to the Bank's rights and obligations.  Nor did the possibility of damage to the Bank's reputation suffice to attract legal advice privilege for the communications in question.  Although the role of the solicitor might have widened in recent times, the extent of legal advice privilege should not be widened to encompass that extension.  The court expressed this conclusion in paragraph 37 of its judgment:</p>
<p></p><ul>"We do not consider that the facts of this case justify this extension to the law of privilege.  The inquiry in this case was a private, non-statutory inquiry.  One of the sponsors of that inquiry, albeit a reluctant sponsor, was the Bank itself.  The Bank's primary concern was, or should have been, to ascertain whether the collapse of BCCI was attributable to any regulatory shortcomings in this country.  We cannot see that in these circumstances communications between the Bank and the solicitors who were assisting in the obtaining, preparation and presentation of evidence and submissions to the inquiry should attract privilege, even if the Bank was anxious that this assistance should enable the Bank's role to be presented in the best possible light."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master of the Rolls concluded his judgment with remarks in paragraph 39 which caused a degree of concern to the interveners in the appeal before the House, HM Government, the Bar Council and the Law Society:</p>
<p></p><ul>"We have found this area of the law not merely difficult but unsatisfactory.  The justification for litigation privilege is readily understood.  Where, however, litigation is not anticipated it is not easy to see why communications with a solicitor should be privileged.  Legal advice privilege attaches to matters such as the conveyance of real property or the drawing up of a will.  It is not clear why it should.  There would seem little reason to fear that, if privilege were not available in such circumstances, communications between solicitor and client would be inhibited.  Nearly fifty years have passed since the Law Reform Committee looked at this area.  It is perhaps time for it to receive a further review."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sumption QC presented the case on behalf of the Bank on two main grounds, one broader and one narrower.  The essence of the former was that legal advice privilege attaches to the documents in question, as being communications between lawyer and client constituting advice and assistance of a kind which it is part of the proper function of a lawyer to give by virtue of his legal skills.  Mr Pollock, upholding the decision of the Court of Appeal, contended that legal advice privilege is an "outgrowth and extension" of litigation privilege, the true root of legal professional privilege, which should be closely confined in extent to advice on legal rights and obligations.  It did not cover advice and assistance in the presentation of a client's case before a tribunal such as the Bingham Inquiry, the outcome of which did not have legal consequences for that client.  Mr Sumption challenged this last point in advancing his narrower submission, to the effect that the Bingham Inquiry did have considerable potential legal consequences for the Bank, and that even on the definition of legal advice propounded by the Court of Appeal Freshfields' advice to it was covered by legal advice privilege.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is convenient first to consider the narrower submission, which involves looking at the nature of the inquiry and the implications which it held for the Bank.  The terms of reference were:</p>
<p></p><ul>"To enquire into the supervision of BCCI under the Banking Acts; to consider whether the action taken by all the UK authorities was appropriate and timely; and to make recommendations."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The focus of the inquiry was always going to be a critical examination of the Bank's performance of its supervisory duties under the Banking Acts.  It was apparent that some would seek to attach blame to the Bank for failing to take earlier action - the then Prime Minister stated in the House of Commons that the inquiry would "determine where the blame lies" - and that public criticism in the inquiry report of the conduct of some officials was a distinct possibility.  Nor could one rule out the possibility that some amendment, which might be unwelcome to the Bank, of its regulatory powers and duties might be recommended.  There appears accordingly to be some substance in the suggestion made by Mr Croall in paragraph 8 of his second witness statement that </p>
<p></p><ul>"any criticism and consequential damage to its reputation (or to that of any of its senior officials in the Banking Supervision Division) might impair its ability to supervise effectively."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 1(4) of the Banking Act 1987 the Bank was immune against ordinary civil liability for failure to perform its duty to supervise deposit takers, but if bad faith were established it would be liable to remedies in private law.  Public law remedies could also be obtained against the Bank in respect of its performance of its functions.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82.&nbsp;&nbsp;In these circumstances I consider that the observations made by Tomlinson J were justified, when he stated at paragraph 7 of his judgment in <i>Three Rivers (No 5)</i>:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Anything that the Bank did and said in relation to the Inquiry was potentially of great legal sensitivity.  It was an inquiry one outcome of which could be criticism of the conduct of the Bank from an informed and highly authoritative source, an outcome which would not only be of some importance in relation to the Bank's ongoing regulatory and supervisory role but would itself be likely either to lead to or to encourage the institution or attempted institution of proceeding against the Bank by depositors and others who had lost money in consequence of the collapse of BCCI."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, in paragraph 15 of that judgment the judge referred to the "obvious possibility" that litigation might in due course be instituted against the Bank.  Bingham LJ also appears to have envisaged the same possibility when he referred in his covering letter of July 1992 to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Governor of the Bank to "any forthcoming litigation".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83.&nbsp;&nbsp;Counsel for the Bank did not seek to argue that this possibility was sufficient to make the case one of litigation privilege.  For that head of privilege to apply litigation must be reasonably in prospect: see Matthews &amp; Malek, <i>Disclosure</i>, 2nd ed (2001) para 9.034 and authorities cited there.  He did contend, however, that the prospect of litigation, added to that of criticism and blame and the possibility of amendment of the regulatory regime, meant that the advice and assistance given by Freshfields concerned the Bank's legal rights and obligations.  If, contrary to his submission, the Court of Appeal was correct in its definition of legal advice for which privilege can be claimed, the advice and assistance given fell within that definition on a correct view of the facts of the case.  The Court of Appeal was not correct in stating at paragraph 28 of the judgment of the court that the matter was concluded by the judge's finding in paragraph 8 of his judgment, for that was to disregard what he stated in paragraphs 7 and 15 which I have quoted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion there is substantial force in the appellant's argument.  Even if the definition of legal advice adopted by the Court of Appeal is to be regarded as correct, the circumstances in which the Bank sought advice and assistance from Freshfields were such that much of the focus was on the legal rights and obligations of the Bank.  There may be room for argument, however, on the question whether that was the dominant purpose of the Bank in seeking that advice and assistance, but I do not propose to attempt to resolve that issue or to determine the appeal on this ground alone.  I think that it is of some importance for the House to take the opportunity to examine more generally the basis of legal advice privilege and the correctness of the major thesis of the Court of Appeal in its judgment in this case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85.&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of litigation privilege was described in the classic statement of Jessel MR in <i>Anderson v Bank of British Columbia </i>(1876) 2 Ch D 644 at 649:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The object and meaning of the rule is this: that as, by reason of the complexity and difficulty of our law, litigation can only be properly conducted by professional men, it is absolutely necessary that a man, in order to prosecute his rights or to defend himself from an improper claim, should have recourse to the assistance of professional lawyers, and it being so absolutely necessary, it is equally necessary, to use a vulgar phrase, that he should be able to make a clean breast of it to the gentleman whom he consults with a view to the prosecution of his claim, or the substantiating his defence against the claim of others; that he should be able to place unrestricted and unbounded confidence in the professional agent, and that the communications he so makes to him should be kept secret, unless with his consent (for it is his privilege, and not the privilege of the confidential agent), that he should be enabled properly to conduct his litigation. That is the meaning of the rule."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86.&nbsp;&nbsp;Determining the bounds of privilege involves finding the proper point of balance between two opposing imperatives, making the maximum relevant material available to the court of trial and avoiding unfairness to individuals by revealing confidential communications between their lawyers and themselves.  The practice which has developed is a reconciliation between these principles: <i>Seabrook v British Transport Commission </i>[1959] 1 WLR 509 at 513, per Havers J.  There is a considerable public interest in each of these.  The importance of keeping to a minimum the withholding of relevant material from the court, upon which Mr Pollock laid emphasis, is self-evident.  It was stressed by Wigmore (<i>Evidence</i>, vol 8, para 2291 McNaughton rev. 1961), who expressed the opinion that the privilege should be strictly confined within the narrowest possible limits consistent with the logic of its principle, an approach echoed in the speech of Lord Edmund-Davies in <i>Waugh v British Railways Board </i>[1980] AC 521 at 543.  The competing principle of legal professional privilege is also rooted in public policy: cf <i>B v Auckland District Law Society </i>[2003] 2 AC 736, paras 46-7.  It is not based upon the maintenance of confidentiality, although in earlier case-law that was given as its foundation.  If that were the only reason behind the principle the same privilege would be extended to such confidants as priests and doctors, whereas it has been settled in a line of authority stemming from the<i> Duchess of Kingston's Case </i>(1776) 1 East PC 469 that it is confined to legal advisers: see, eg, Cross &amp; Tapper on Evidence, 9th ed, pp 461-5.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is stated in Cross &amp; Tapper, <i>op cit</i>, p 439 that in England the rule was traditionally regarded as a rule of evidence, but the learned editor points out that in some Commonwealth jurisdictions </p>
<p></p><ul>"The privilege was elevated into something more nearly resembling a basic constitutional principle, expressed in the rhetoric of rights."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That development has been mirrored in this jurisdiction.  In <i>R v Derby Magistrates' Court, ex parte B </i>[1996] AC 487 Lord Taylor of Gosforth CJ, with whose reasons the other members of the House agreed, stated at page 509, after reviewing the authorities:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The principle which runs through all these cases, and the many other cases which were cited, is that a man must be able to consult his lawyer in confidence, since otherwise he might hold back half the truth.  The client must be sure that what he tells his lawyer will never be revealed without his consent.  Legal professional privilege is thus much more than an ordinary rule of evidence, limited in its application to the facts of a particular case.  It is a fundamental condition on which the administration of justice as a whole rests."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Hoffmann expressed himself similarly, again with the concurrence of the other members of the House, in <i>R (Morgan Grenfell &amp; Co Ltd) v Special Commissioner of Income Tax </i>[2003] 1 AC 563, when he described legal professional privilege in paragraph 7 as "a fundamental human right long established in the common law."  In paragraph 31 he referred with approval to the judgments of the New Zealand Court of Appeal in <i>IRC v West-Walker </i>[1954] NZLR 191, where the privilege was described as not merely a rule of evidence but a substantive right founded on an important public policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88.&nbsp;&nbsp;The approach of the Court of Appeal to ascertaining the ambit of legal advice which will attract privilege was conditioned by its acceptance of Mr Pollock's proposition to which I have referred, that legal professional privilege is an outgrowth and extension of litigation privilege.  The Master of the Rolls stated at paragraph 25 of the judgment of the court:</p>
<p></p><ul>"All of the cases to which we have thus far referred were ones in which the relationship of client and solicitor arose in relation to transactions involving legal rights and obligations capable of becoming the subject matter of litigation."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One must therefore commence consideration of this part of the case by examining the validity of the proposition.  One has to ask the question, does legal professional privilege stem from litigation, as the Court of Appeal held, in which event any extension of it outside that sphere requires to be carefully limited?  Or is it, as the appellant contended, a more general privilege based on the relationship of lawyer and client and so extending to a wider area of advice and assistance given by legal advisers to their clients?  Subsidiary arguments were developed about the need for certainty and the inconvenience which would ensue if the ruling given by the Court of Appeal were generally applied.  But if answers are found to these questions which embody proper principles and are consistent with established lines of authority, that will, I think, take one a good distance towards conclusions which will settle the issues debated in this part of the case under appeal.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89.&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose to commence that search by examining the authorities.  The arguments on the issue of principle depend to a large extent on one's starting point, which is determined by the answers to the questions which I have posed.  There is no <i>a priori </i>reason why legal professional privilege should be regarded as stemming from litigation rather than more generally from the giving of legal advice, or vice versa, and therefore it is of assistance to attempt to ascertain the direction which the law has taken on this topic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the appellant and the respondents claimed that the decided cases supported their respective interpretations of the law, so it is necessary to consider them in some detail.  The early history of legal privilege is set out in the speech of Lord Taylor of Gosforth CJ in <i>R v Derby Magistrates, ex parte B </i>[1996] AC 487 at 507 <i>et seq</i>, where he traces it back to the earliest instances, to be found in 16th century reports, and follows it through a number of cases in the 18th and 19th centuries.  For present purposes it is sufficient to commence with the case of <i>Greenough v Gaskell </i>1 My &amp; K 98, decided by Lord Brougham LC in 1833.  The defendant in the suit, a solicitor, objected to being required to produce book entries, memoranda, letters and other papers generated over a period in the course of furnishing professional legal advice to his client, to whom money was advanced out of a fund in court in an administration suit.  In his judgment Lord Brougham LC set out his conclusions on the claim to privilege in a passage at pages 101-3 which is worth quoting at length, since it is the <i>fons et origo </i>of the modern law:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Here the question relates to the solicitor, who is called upon to produce the entries he had made in accounts, and letters received by him, and those written (chiefly to his town agent) by him, or by his direction, in his character or situation of confidential solicitor to the party; and I am of opinion that he cannot be compelled to disclose papers delivered, or communications made to him, or letters, or entries made by him in that capacity. To compel a party himself to answer upon oath, even as to his belief or his thoughts, is one thing; nay, to compel him to disclose what he has written or spoken to others, not being his professional advisers, is competent to the party seeking the discovery; for such communications are not necessary to the conduct of judicial business, and the defence or prosecution of men's rights by the aid of skilful persons. To force from the party himself the production of communications made by him to professional men seems inconsistent with the possibility of an ignorant man safely resorting to professional advice, and can only be justified if the authority of decided cases warrants it. But no authority sanctions the much wider violation of professional confidence, and in circumstances wholly different, which would be involved in compelling counsel or attorneys or solicitors to disclose matters committed to them in their professional capacity, and which, but for their employment as professional men, they would not have become possessed of.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>As regards them, it does not appear that the protection is qualified by any reference to proceedings pending or in contemplation. If touching matters that come within the ordinary scope of professional employment, they receive a communication in their professional capacity, either from a client, or on his account, and for his benefit in the transaction of his business, or, which amounts to the same thing, if they commit to paper, in the course of their employment on his behalf, matters which they know only through their professional relation to the client, they are not only justified in withholding such matters, but bound to withhold them, and will not be compelled to disclose the information or produce the papers in any Court of law or equity, either as party or as witness. If this protection were confined to cases where proceedings had commenced, the rule would exclude the most confidential, and it may be the most important of all communications - those made with a view of being prepared either for instituting or defending a suit, up to the instant that the process of the Court issued.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>If it were confined to proceedings begun or in contemplation, then every communication would be unprotected which a party makes with a view to his general defence against attacks which he apprehends, although at the time no one may have resolved to assail him. But were it allowed to extend over such communications, the protection would be insufficient, if it only included communications more or less connected with judicial proceedings; for a person oftentimes requires the aid of professional advice upon the subject of his rights and his liabilities, with no references to any particular litigation, and without any other reference to litigation generally than all human affairs have, in so far as every transaction may, by possibility, become the subject of judicial inquiry.  'It would be most mischievous,' said the learned Judges in the Common Pleas, 'if it could be doubted whether or not an attorney, consulted upon a man's title to an estate, was at liberty to divulge a flaw' (2 Brod. &amp; Bingh. 6).<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>The foundation of this rule is not difficult to discover. It is not (as has sometimes been said) on account of any particular importance which the law attributes to the business of legal professors, or any particular disposition to afford them protection, though certainly it may not be very easy to discover why a like privilege has been refused to others, and especially to medical advisers.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>But it is out of regard to the interests of justice, which cannot be upholden, and to the administration of justice, which cannot go on, without the aid of men skilled in jurisprudence, in the practice of the Courts, and in those matters affecting rights and obligations which form the subject of all judicial proceedings. If the privilege did not exist at all, every one would be thrown upon his own legal resources; deprived of all professional assistance, a man would not venture to consult any skilful person, or would only dare to tell his counsellor half his case. If the privilege were confined to communications connected with suits begun, or intended, or expected, or apprehended, no one could safely adopt such precautions as might eventually render any proceedings successful, or all proceedings superfluous."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91.&nbsp;&nbsp;Statements to the same effect concerning advice given in relation to legal proceedings may be found in such cases as <i>Bolton v Liverpool Corporation </i>(1833) 1 My &amp; K 88 at 94-5, per Lord Brougham LC and <i>Holmes v Baddeley </i>(1844) 1 Ph 476 at 480-1, per Lord Lyndhurst LC.  In <i>Herring v Clobery </i>(1842) 1 Ph 91 Lord Lyndhurst L C followed the rule laid down in <i>Greenough v Gaskell </i>in preference to a narrower rule confined to litigation, in progress or anticipated, which had been propounded by Lord Tenterden CJ at nisi prius.  He stated at pages 94-5:</p>
<p></p><ul>"But further, I think that restriction of the rule is not consistent with, and not founded on, any sound principle; for it may, and in a great variety of cases would, be of as much importance to parties that the communications made between a client and a solicitor with respect to the state of the client's property, with respect to his liabilities, with respect to his title, should be protected, as that protection should be afforded to communications made in the progress of a cause; and it appears to me that, as individuals must from time to time resort to their legal advisers for guidance in their ordinary transactions, public policy requires that communications of that kind should be privileged and protected, in order that they may be free and unfettered."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Lyndhurst gave a similar ruling in <i>Carpmael v Powis </i>(1846) 1 Ph 687, where he held the privilege to exist in respect of communications relating to the fixing of a reserved bidding on a sale of land.  He said at page 692:</p>
<p></p><ul>"I am of opinion that the privilege extends to all communications between a solicitor, as such, and his client, relating to matters within the ordinary scope of a solicitor's duty."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Lyndhurst declined to confine it to the lawyer's work <i>stricto sensu</i> of drawing the agreements, investigating the title and preparing the conveyance.  The work done was all part of one transaction of the nature in which solicitors are ordinarily employed.  Knight Bruce V-C gave a decision to the same effect in <i>Pearse v Pearse </i>(1846) 1 De G &amp; Sm 12, where the communications related to transactions concerning the client's lands and were unconnected with any existing or anticipated litigation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92.&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the clarity of the expressions of opinion which I have cited, there remained for some time some differences of view and some contrary statements in the case-law.  The differences were authoritatively resolved by a judgment given by Lord Selborne LC in the Court of Appeal in Chancery in <i>Minet v Morgan </i>(1873) 8 Ch App 361, in which he said that the law had not at once reached a broad and reasonable footing, but reached it by successive steps.  He affirmed in very positive terms the propositions set out in the judgments to which I have referred, quoting with approval the statement of Kindersley V-C in <i>Lawrence v Campbell </i>(1859) 4 Drew 485 at 490, in which he said that it was now sufficient for privilege if communications passed as professional communications in a professional capacity, even though they were not made either during or relating to an actual or even to an expected litigation.  Similarly, the operation of the rule was described in unqualified terms in the Privy Council by the Earl of Halsbury LC, when he said in <i>Bullivant v Attorney-General for Victoria </i>[1901] AC 196 at 200 that</p>
<p></p><ul>"for the perfect administration of justice, and for the protection of the confidence which exists between a solicitor and his client, it has been established as a principle of public policy that those confidential communications shall not be subject to production."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93.&nbsp;&nbsp;In modern law authoritative statements support this view of the law.  In <i>R v Derby Magistrates, ex parte B </i>[1996] AC 487 at 510 Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The law has been established for at least 150 years, since the time of Lord Brougham LC in 1833 in <i>Greenough v Gaskell </i>1 M &amp; K 98: subject to recognised exceptions, communications seeking professional legal advice, whether or not in connection with pending court proceedings, are absolutely and permanently privileged from disclosure even though, in consequence, the communications will not be available in court proceedings in which they might be important evidence."<p></p></ul>
