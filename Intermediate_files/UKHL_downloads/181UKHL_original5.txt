<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it may seem hard if a defendant is held liable in solidum even though all that can be shown is that he made a material contribution to the risk that the victim would develop mesothelioma.  But it is also hard - and settled law - that a defendant is held liable in solidum even though all that can be shown is that he made a material, say 5%, contribution to the claimant's indivisible injury.  That is a form of rough justice which the law has not hitherto sought to smooth, preferring instead, as a matter of policy, to place the risk of the insolvency of a wrongdoer or his insurer on the other wrongdoers and their insurers.  Now the House is deciding that, in this particular enclave of the law, the risk of the insolvency of a wrongdoer or his insurer is to bypass the other wrongdoers and their insurers and to be shouldered entirely by the innocent claimant.  As a result, claimants will often end up with only a small proportion of the damages which would normally be payable for their loss.  The desirability of the courts, rather than Parliament, throwing this lifeline to wrongdoers and their insurers at the expense of claimants is not obvious to me.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor do I find useful guidance for the position in this country in the examples of several liability from the United States.  When introducing comparative fault legislation - similar to the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945 - some states have thought it necessary or desirable to depart from a system of joint and several liability.  Parliament made no such change in this country.  Jury awards of punitive damages and the multitude of suits by persons suffering no symptoms of mesothelioma are special factors which help to explain why insurers in the United States have been engulfed by a crisis for which various forms of several liability may afford some relief.  I am prepared to assume that insurers in this country are also faced with problems arising out of the post-<i>Fairchild </i>mesothelioma awards, even though, quite properly, the House was given no specific information about the scale of these difficulties.  That information would, of course, be very relevant if Parliament were being asked to legislate to assist the insurers at the expense of the victims of mesothelioma and their relatives.  In the meantime, however, I would adhere to the usual rule of liability in solidum which applies generally to defendants who are held to have made a material contribution to indivisible injuries such as mesothelioma.</p>

<i></i><p><i>Application of Fairchild</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92.&nbsp;&nbsp;This issue arises only in the case concerning the death of Mr barker.  As Lord Hoffmann has explained, on the facts found by Moses J, Mr barker was exposed to asbestos dust during three periods.  The first was when he worked for Graessers Ltd for six weeks in 1958.  The judge found that the company were at fault, since they should have known of the risks and should have taken precautions.  The second period was between April and October 1962, while he was working for Corus.  Corus accept that they were at fault.  The third was during a period when he was a self-employed plasterer between 1968 and 1975.  In particular, the judge found that he was exposed to asbestos dust on three occasions in about 1974 and 1975:  when he cut asbestos sheets at the builders Neville Wood, when he did the same for other builders, Hedley Greenslade, and when he worked for Roger Williams on pipes lagged with asbestos at Courtauld's.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Moses J and the Court of Appeal, counsel for Corus argued that the fact that Mr barker was self-employed when exposed to the dust was sufficient to take the case outside the scope of the decision in <i>Fairchild</i>, which should not be construed as applying to cases where the deceased may have inhaled asbestos dust without a breach of duty by anyone.  The judge rejected that argument, as did the Court of Appeal.  They held that justice was best served by applying the <i>Fairchild </i>exception but reducing the damages to be awarded by 20% to reflect Mr barker's failure to take proper precautions for his own safety in 1974 and 1975.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hearing before the House Mr Stuart-Smith for Corus emphasised that the key factor was not whether a victim had been self-employed when an exposure occurred but whether there had been a period when he, and no-one else, had been responsible for his exposure to asbestos dust.  For instance, duties under the Asbestos Regulations 1969 (SI 1969/690) could be owed to self-employed persons hired to carry out a particular process, just as much as to an employee.  In that situation the <i>Fairchild </i>principle would apply in full measure.  If, on the other hand, for example, someone pulled down an old shed in his garden which had been lined with asbestos boards, he and he alone might be responsible for his exposure to the asbestos dust and, if the exposure could be regarded as material, the <i>Fairchild </i>exception would not apply.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no evidence about the exact nature of Mr barker's work on the three occasions in 1974 and 1975.  Although the point was not explored before the House, it seems at least possible that, if Mr barker was at fault in failing to take the necessary precautions, as the judge found, those for whom he cut asbestos sheets or worked on asbestos-lagged pipes may also have been at fault under the Asbestos Regulations 1969.  In that eventuality, the proper analysis would be that his exposure was partly due to the fault of those for whom he worked and partly due to his own contributory fault.  That would bring the case squarely within the scope of <i>Fairchild</i>, but some allowance would have to be made for the deceased's fault in relation to those incidents.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96.&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore respectfully share the doubts of my noble and learned friend, Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe, about the claimant's concession.  Assuming, however - as is conceded - that Mr barker was solely at fault, how does that affect the position?  Discussion ranged fairly widely.  Since the decision in <i>Fairchild </i>had been based on <i>McGhee</i>, it was, nevertheless, common ground that <i>Fairchild </i>must apply in cases where the claimant has been exposed to asbestos by a number of employers or occupiers, all of whom were at fault, but one or more of whom may also have exposed him lawfully to asbestos dust.  I had suggested as much in <i>Fairchild</i>, [2003] 1 AC 32, 119, para 170.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97.&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting from "the <i>McGhee </i>extension", counsel considered whether <i>Fairchild </i>would apply where one or more of the sources of exposure to asbestos dust had been lawful but unconnected with any wrongdoer.  For instance, the victim had been employed for a period before the dangers of exposure to asbestos dust should have been known in the industry and there had been no fault on the part of the employer.  Having reserved my opinion on the point in <i>Fairchild</i>, I would now hold that the rule should apply in that situation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>Fairchild </i>problem arises because the victim has been exposed to asbestos dust while working for a number of employers and, in the present state of scientific knowledge, it is impossible to say which employer was responsible for the fibre which led to the mesothelioma.  So, if the usual test for proof of causation is applied, the claimant will be unable to obtain damages.  In deciding whether or not to apply a more relaxed rule relating to causation, the House was concerned to recognise and to weigh the potential injustices to the claimant and defendants respectively.  In the circumstances of those three cases, the House held that there would be greater injustice in sticking to the usual test and giving no remedy to the claimant than in applying a more relaxed standard and holding the defendants liable.  The result was that a defendant was held liable to pay damages even though the unlawful act of one of the other wrongdoers might have been the actual cause of the victim's mesothelioma.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99.&nbsp;&nbsp;Assume for the sake of argument, however, that one of several periods of exposure to asbestos dust occurred before the risks should have been appreciated in the industry.  That is, of course, a conclusive reason for not holding the relevant employer liable.  If the <i>Fairchild </i>exception applies in that situation, a wrongdoer may be held liable even though the victim was injured either by another employer's wrongful act or by another employer's lawful act.  Putting the point differently, the claimant may recover even though the victim's illness may not have been caused by any tort at all.  But the <i>McGhee </i>extension already shows that the exception can apply in such circumstances.  And, weighing the potential injustices, it seems right to apply it in this case too.  An employer may well feel aggrieved because, under the <i>Fairchild </i>exception, he is held liable, even though not his, but some other employer's, wrongful exposure may have caused the victim's injury.  But he can scarcely claim to feel more aggrieved just because one of the other employers was acting lawfully when he may have caused the victim's injury.  In that sense, as between the victim and a wrongdoing employer, the lawfulness or unlawfulness of the exposure by any other employer is irrelevant.  The balance of potential injustice between the victim and the wrongdoers in applying the rule remains in favour of the victim.  I agree with your Lordships on this point.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100.&nbsp;&nbsp;Different factors are in play, however, where - and such cases are likely to be extremely rare - the victim was himself solely responsible for a material exposure to asbestos dust.  In that situation, in weighing the potential injustices, as between the victim and the wrongdoing defendants, of sticking to the usual test for proof of causation or applying the <i>Fairchild </i>exception, the fact that the victim may have caused his own injury cannot be irrelevant - especially if, as here, the victim was at fault.  Applying the <i>Fairchild </i>exception in such a case would involve tipping the balance even further in the victim's favour.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the defendants' liability under the <i>Fairchild </i>exception had been in solidum, in my view the potential injustice to a defendant in applying the exception in a case where the victim was solely responsible for a material exposure to asbestos dust would have been too great.  On that basis I would have favoured applying the normal rule for proof of causation.  The majority conclusion is, however, that a defendant's liability is to be several only.  This involves such a major reduction in the scope of the defendants' liability that, on that basis, I too would conclude that the balance of potential injustices favours applying the <i>Fairchild </i>exception.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, in respectful disagreement with your Lordships, I would have dismissed the defendants' appeals on the question of apportionment.  But, having regard to the majority conclusion that the defendants' liability is to be several, I would dismiss the appeal by Corus in the barker<i> </i>case and hold them liable on the basis of the <i>Fairchild </i>exception.</p>

<p><b>LORD WALKER OF GESTINGTHORPE</b></p>

<p>My Lords,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the great advantage of reading in draft the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann, and I gratefully adopt his statement of the facts of these three appeals.  I am also in full agreement with Lord Hoffmann's reasons for allowing the appeals on the issue of apportionment.  But because of the general importance of the issues I will briefly state my reasons in my own words.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104.&nbsp;&nbsp;The starting point must be the decision of this House in <i>Fairchild (Fairchild v Glenhaven Funeral Services Ltd</i> and associated appeals [2003] 1 AC 32).  In <i>Fairchild</i> the House explicitly established or affirmed a new principle (already emerging in <i>McGhee v National Coal Board</i> [1973] 1 WLR 1) and began to mark out the field in which that principle applies.  A defendant who is under a duty to protect a worker from the risk associated with a single noxious agent, and who breaches that duty by exposing the worker to that very risk, may be held liable even though the worker cannot (on the traditional "but-for" test) prove that his ensuing disease was caused by that exposure.  Exposing the claimant (or the deceased worker whose personal representative is the claimant) to the risk of injury is in this situation equated with causing his injury.  This result is achieved not by manipulation of the burden of proof, or some other comparable fiction, but as an explicit variation of the ordinary requirement as to causation, adopted in order to avoid injustice: see the speech of Lord Bingham of Cornhill at pp 67-68, paras 33-35; Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead at pp 70-71, paras 42-45; Lord Hoffmann at pp 71, 74 and 75, paras 47, 61-62 and 65; and Lord Rodger of Earlsferry at pp 112 and 118-119, paras 155 and 168-170 (only Lord Hutton, pp 91-92, paras 107-112, based his conclusion on an inference of causation).  All those speeches must be read in full, to do justice to their closely-reasoned surveys of principle, authority and policy; but the above references contain the salient statements of the new principle.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105.&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the field in which the principle is to be applied, the narrowest reading of <i>Fairchild</i> would limit it to mesothelioma caused by the inhalation of asbestos fibres during successive periods of employment, in circumstances where each of two or more employers was in breach of duty, and where any other possible cause of the claimant's mesothelioma can be disregarded: see Lord Bingham, at p 40, para 2 (also p 41, para 3, observing that Waddingtons Plc's duty was as occupier of premises, not as employer, but that nothing turned on that).  The other speeches were rather less clear-cut: see Lord Nicholls, at p 70, para 41; Lord Hoffmann, at p 74, para 61 (not expressly excluding the possibility of other occasions of exposure to asbestos); Lord Hutton, at p 95, para 116 (a widely-stated conclusion which must no doubt be read in context); and Lord Rodger, at p 119, para 170 (reserving his opinion "where the other possible source of injury is a similar but lawful act or omission of someone else or a natural occurrence").  The whole House recognised that the principle would be subject to "incremental and analogical development" (Lord Bingham, at p 68, para 34) but took a cautious attitude towards the pace of such development: see also Lord Nicholls, at p 70, para 43; Lord Hoffmann, at pp 77-78, paras 73-74; Lord Hutton, at p 95, para 118; and Lord Rodger, at p 118, para 169.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Fairchild</i> it was not argued by any of the respondents that the liability of a defendant employer should be limited to part only of the claimant's damage, in proportion to the duration and intensity of the claimant's exposure to asbestos during successive periods of employment.  The House noted this and deliberately abstained from expressing any view on the point which had not been argued: see Lord Bingham, at p 68, para 34; Lord Hoffmann, at p 78, para 74; Lord Hutton, at p 95, para 117; and Lord Rodger, at p 97, para 125.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107.&nbsp;&nbsp;In deciding these appeals your Lordships have two important tasks: to go further than was necessary in <i>Fairchild</i> in defining the field in which the new principle should be applied, and to determine the issue as to apportionment which was deliberately left open.  I prefer to start with the more fundamental issue of apportionment, since it must have a bearing on how far and how fast the boundaries of the new principle are to be extended.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108.&nbsp;&nbsp;In many cases the issue of apportionment will be of crucial importance to a defendant employer.  It is true that where all the relevant employers and insurers are known to be in existence and solvent, the same result will be produced whatever the basis of liability, by the mechanism of contribution between all the tortfeasors, whether or not they were originally made defendants to the claim.  The guidelines issued by the Association of British Insurers (<i>Guidelines for Apportioning and Handling Employers' Liability Mesothelioma Claims, 28 October 2003</i>) show that this sort of apportionment can be achieved in a rough and ready way (although it should not, I think, be assumed that the guidelines would necessarily be followed by the court, which might be persuaded that a more precisely "weighted" approach was called for on the facts of the particular case).  But in a large number of cases claimants have been exposed to asbestos during employment with one or more employers which have since ceased to exist, or have become untraceable or insolvent (and uninsured).  In such cases a single solvent employer (or its insurers) might be faced, in the absence of proportionately limited liability, with a very heavy liability for a relatively short period of tortious exposure during employment with that employer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109.&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple fairness does therefore argue in favour of liability under the <i>Fairchild</i> principle being proportionately limited.  A rule of law by which exposure to risk of injury is equated with legal responsibility for that injury entails the possibility that an employer may be held liable for an injury which was not in fact caused by that exposure (though in the present state of medical science, that fact can be neither proved nor disproved).  This possible unfairness cannot be eliminated, as the House recognised in <i>Fairchild,</i> but it is considerably reduced if each employer's liability is limited in proportion to the fraction of the total exposure (measured by duration and intensity) for which each is responsible.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110.&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been argued that apportionment of that sort would be contrary to principle, since mesothelioma is "indivisible" damage, and where several concurrent tortfeasors are legally responsible for damage of an indivisible nature, each is liable for the whole damage.  This principle was stated by Devlin LJ in a well-known passage in <i>Dingle v Associated Newspapers Ltd</i> [1961]  2QB 162, 188-189 (a case concerned with two publications of defamatory matter, one protected by privilege).  Lord Hoffmann has already set out the passage in his speech, and I need not repeat it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111.&nbsp;&nbsp;Devlin LJ described unlimited concurrent liability for indivisible damage as a fundamental principle; but he also emphasised that whether the damage is indivisible is a question of fact, not law.  The rather improbable example which he gave (of a claimant losing a month's wages after four unconnected assaults by different defendants) illustrates that.  So does the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Rahman v Arearose  Ltd</i> [2001]  QB 351,  in which three psychiatrists agreed that the aetiology of the claimant's very severe psychiatric disabilities was complex and that different elements of his mental troubles could be attributed to the two separate tortious incidents (a vicious physical assault from which the claimant's employers should have protected him, and an incompetently-performed surgical operation).  It has been suggested that the court ought not to have accepted the expert evidence, unanimous though it was; but at the very least the case shows that indivisible damage is not always instantly recognisable, and that there are debateable borderline cases.  As Hale LJ said, giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal in <i>Hatton v Sutherland</i> and associated appeals [2002] 2 All ER 1, 18 para 41 (cases concerned with illnesses caused by stress at work),</p>

<p></p><ul>"Hence if it is established that the constellation of symptoms suffered by the claimant stems from a number of different extrinsic causes then in our view a sensible attempt should be made to apportion liability accordingly.  There is no reason to distinguish these conditions from the chronological development of industrial diseases or disabilities.  The analogy with the polluted stream is closer than the analogy with the single fire."<p></p></ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last sentence of this quotation refers back to a passage in <i>Prosser and Keeton on Torts</i> 5th ed (1984) pp 345-346 which Laws LJ quoted in <i>Rahman</i> [2001] QB 351 (pp 361-362, para 17).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112.&nbsp;&nbsp;So there may be borderline cases of indivisibility of damage, but I do not think that your Lordships can avoid the problem by treating mesothelioma itself as a borderline case.  It is not an industrial disease (such as hearing loss eventually leading to profound deafness) which becomes progressively more severe (although not necessarily at a uniform rate) with continuing exposure to a harmful agent (such as excessive noise in shipyards).  Prolonged exposure to asbestos does indeed increase the risk of mesothelioma, but only in a statistical sense. The disease may be caused by inhalation of a single fibre of asbestos which operates (in a way that medical science does not fully understand) in the transformation of a normal mesothelial cell into a malignant tumour (see para 7 of Lord Bingham's speech in <i>Fairchild</i>; the state of medical knowledge has not changed significantly since 2002).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113.&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution to the problem is in my opinion more radical, in line with the radical departure which this House has already made in <i>Fairchild</i>.  That case was decided by the majority, as I have already noted, not on the fictional basis that the defendants should be treated as having caused the claimant's (or deceased's) damage, but on the factual basis that they had wrongfully exposed him to the risk of damage.  The damage was indivisible, but the risk was divisible—a matter of statistics.  In line with that new principle established or affirmed in <i>Fairchild</i>, and as a solution which does justice (so far as possible) both to the generality of claimants and to the generality of defendants, limited liability proportionate to risk is the better course for the law to take.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114.&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking that course does not in my view require your Lordships to revisit either <i>Wilsher v Essex Area Health Authority</i> [1988] AC 1074 or <i>Gregg v Scott</i> [2005] 2 AC 176.  <i>Wilsher</i> was not a case of successive periods of exposure to a single noxious agent, but of uncertainty as to the causative effect (in producing the infant's retrolental fibroplasia) of wholly disparate factors, only one of which (excessive oxygen) was the fault of the defendant health authority.  The excessive oxygen might have been the cause of the disability, but it would be a very long step indeed, which I would not contemplate, to extend an analysis based on "increase in risk" (or its mirror image, "loss of a chance") to a case like <i>Wilsher</i>.  In <i>Gregg v Scott</i> the "loss of a chance" approach was more plausible (as the division in this House demonstrates), but it would nevertheless have gone far beyond the <i>Fairchild</i> principle as it now stands.  Such an extension would lead to great uncertainty in a large number of clinical negligence cases.  The principle must in my view be restricted to mesothelioma induced by inhalation of asbestos fibres, and other conditions having the same distinctive aetiology and prognosis (such as the dermatitis caused by brick dust in <i>McGhee</i> [1973] 1 WLR 1).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115.&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue which your Lordships have to decide is the effect (in the <i>barker</i> appeal) of the deceased's period of self-employment, during which he was exposed to asbestos.  Moses J and the Court of Appeal treated this as contributory negligence reducing the value of the claim by 20%.  Mrs barker does not challenge that finding before your Lordships.  Nevertheless it raises an important issue of principle, since it involves applying the <i>Fairchild</i> principle in a situation in which the court cannot be sure that Mr barker's fatal disease was caused by breach of duty on the part of any one of his employers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before addressing this general issue I would interpose a word of caution as to the concession made by the claimant in <i>barker</i>.  Moses J made some findings about Mr barker's period of self-employment (they are set out in para 30 of his judgment), but they are not very detailed, no doubt because there simply was not the evidential material on which to make more detailed findings.  I would be slow to accept that the owner or occupier of industrial or public buildings does not owe a duty of care to workers engaged on the refitting, repair or modification of those buildings even if the workers are labour-only subcontractors rather than employees in the strict sense.  Lord Bingham appears to have accepted this in <i>Fairchild</i> (para 3) and no one expressed a different view.  So while accepting the concession for the purposes of deciding the point of principle, I think it is a matter which may have to be looked at more closely at some future time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117.&nbsp;&nbsp;The injustice, recognised in <i>Fairchild</i>, of denying a claimant any remedy in a situation in which his (or the deceased's) fatal disease <i>must</i> have been caused by a breach of duty on the part of at least one of two or more employers loses some of its edge if the disease <i>might</i> have been caused by the claimant's (or the deceased's) own fault, or (as will become increasingly unlikely with the passage of time) by exposure to asbestos which (because public knowledge was deficient) did not involve any breach of duty by an employer or occupier, and without contributory negligence on the part of the claimant (or the deceased).  In that sort of situation the possible injustice to the defendant assumes more importance.  Nevertheless, if your Lordships accept that the right way forward is to limit a defendant's liability by reference to its own contribution to the risk, the balance of fairness is still clearly, to my mind, in favour of applying the <i>Fairchild</i> principle to cases where less than 100% of the risk has been caused by employers or occupiers guilty of breaches of duty.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118.&nbsp;&nbsp;On this approach, questions of contributory negligence under the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945 and contribution under the Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978 will not normally arise.  A defendant found to be in breach of duty will be liable for no more than a fraction of the damage in proportion to its contribution to the risk, whether or not the other periods of exposure involved breaches of duty or contributory negligence on the part of others.  That is not to say that questions of contributory negligence or contribution may not sometimes arise in respect of some particular period of exposure: for instance, contributory negligence on the part of a claimant (or deceased person) by failing to comply with measures taken for his protection, or contribution as between an employer and an engineering consultant or specialist manufacturer who has failed to install an adequate system of protection in the workplace.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, and for the fuller reasons given in the opinion of Lord Hoffmann, I would allow these appeals (but in <i>barker</i> only on the issue of apportionment) and make the order which Lord Hoffmann proposes.</p>
