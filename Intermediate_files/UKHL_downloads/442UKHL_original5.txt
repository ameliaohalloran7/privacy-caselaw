<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;63. So the question of principle is this: in cases which exhibit the five features I have mentioned, which rule would be more in accordance with justice and the policy of common law and statute to protect employees against the risk of contracting asbestos-related diseases?  One which makes an employer in breach of his duty liable for the claimant's injury because he created a significant risk to his health, despite the fact that the physical cause of the injury <i>may</i> have been created by someone else?  Or a rule which means that unless he was subjected to risk by the breach of duty of a single employer, the employee can never have a remedy?  My Lords, as between the employer in breach of duty and the employee who has lost his life in consequence of a period of exposure to risk to which that employer has contributed, I think it would be both inconsistent with the policy of the law imposing the duty and morally wrong for your Lordships to impose causal requirements which exclude liability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;64. My Lords, I turn from principle to authority.  The case which most closely resembles the present is <i>McGhee v National Coal Board</i> [1973]  1 WLR 1, which my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill has analysed in some detail.  There too,  the employer was under a duty (to provide washing facilities) specifically intended to protect employees against being unnecessarily exposed to the risk of (among other things) a particular disease, namely dermatitis.  Secondly, the duty was one intended to create a civil right to compensation for injury relevantly connected with its breach.  Thirdly, it was established that the longer the workman exerted himself while particles of dust adhered to his skin, the greater was the risk of his contracting dermatitis.  Fourthly, the mechanism by which dust caused the disease was unknown, so that medical science was unable to prove whether the particular dust abrasions which caused the dermatitis were more likely than not to have occurred before or after the dust would have been removed if washing facilities had been provided.  All that could be said was that the absence of facilities added materially to the risk that he would contract the disease. Fifthly, the employee contracted the disease against which he should have been protected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;65. My Lords, in these circumstances, which in my opinion reproduce the essential features of the present case, the House decided that materially increasing the risk that the disease would occur was sufficient to satisfy the causal requirements for liability.  It is true that Lord Wilberforce spoke of reversing the burden of proof and imposing liability unless the employer could prove that washing would have made no difference.  But I respectfully think that it is artificial to treat the employer as having a burden of proof in a case in which ex hypothesi the state of medical knowledge is such that the burden cannot be discharged.  There are also passages in the speeches which suggest that materially increasing the risk of disease is being treated as equivalent to materially contributing to the injury - making the illness worse than it would otherwise have been.  But this, as Lord Wilberforce pointed out (at p. 7), is precisely what the doctors did not say.  They refused to say that it was more likely than not that the absence of washing facilities had had any effect at all.  So when some members of the House said that in the circumstances there was no distinction between materially increasing the risk of disease and materially contributing to the disease, what I think they meant was that, in the particular circumstances, a breach of duty which materially increased the risk should be treated <i>as if</i>  it had materially contributed to the disease. I would respecfully prefer not resort to legal fictions and to say that the House treated a material increase in risk as sufficient in the circumstances to satisfy the causal requirements for liability.  That this was the effect of the decision seems to me inescapable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66. The grounds upon which the House was willing to formulate a special causal requirements rule in <i>McGhee</i> seem to me equally applicable in this case.  So Lord Wilberforce said (at p. 6):</p>
<p></p><ul>"If one asks which of the parties, the workman or the employers, should suffer from this inherent evidential difficulty [i.e. the absence of knowledge of the mechanism by which dust caused the disease], the answer as a matter of policy or justice should be that it is the creator of the risk who, ex hypothesi must be taken to have foreseen the possibility of damage, who should bear its consequences."<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Lord Simon of Glaisdale said (at p. 9):<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"To hold otherwise would mean that the respondents were under a legal duty which they could, in the present state of medical knowledge, with impunity ignore."<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Lord Salmon said (at p. 12):<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"It would mean that in the present state of medical knowledge and in circumstances such as these (which are by no means uncommon) an employer would be permitted by the law to disregard with impunity his duty to take reasonable care for the safety of his employees."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;67. I therefore regard <i>McGhee</i> as a powerful support for saying that when the five factors I have mentioned are present, the law should treat a material increase in risk as sufficient to satisfy the causal requirements for liability.  The only difficulty lies in the way <i>McGhee</i> was explained in <i>Wilsher v Essex Area Health Authority</i> [1988]  AC 1074.  The latter was not a case in which the five factors were present. It was an action for clinical negligence in which it was alleged that giving a premature baby excessive oxygen had caused retrolental fibroplasia, resulting in blindness.  The evidence was that the fibroplasia could have been caused in a number of different ways including excessive oxygen but the judge had made no finding that the oxygen was more likely than not to have been the cause.  The Court of Appeal [1987] QB 730 held that the health authority was nevertheless liable because even if the excessive oxygen could not be shown to have caused the injury, it materially increased the risk of the injury happening. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;68. The Court of Appeal reached this conclusion by treating the causal requirement rule applied in <i>McGhee</i> as being of general application. Mustill LJ said, at pp 771-772:</p>
<p></p><ul>"If it is an established fact that conduct of a particular kind creates a risk that injury will be caused to another or increases an existing risk that injury will ensue; and if the two parties stand in such a relationship that the one party owes a duty not to conduct himself in that way; and if the first party does conduct himself in that way; and if the other party does suffer injury of the kind to which the risk related; then the first party is taken to have caused the injury by his breach of duty, even though the existence and extent of the contribution made by the breach cannot be ascertained."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;69. The House of Lords, in a speech by Lord Bridge of Harwich with which all other noble Lords concurred, rejected this broad principle.  I would respectfully agree.  The principle in <i>McGhee's</i> case is far narrower and I have tried to indicate what its limits are likely to be.  It is true that actions for clinical negligence notoriously give rise to difficult questions of causation.  But it cannot possibly be said that the duty to take reasonable care in treating patients would be virtually drained of content unless the creation of a material risk of injury were accepted as sufficient to satisfy the causal requirements for liability.  And the political and economic arguments involved in the massive increase in the liability of the National Health Service which would have been a consequence of the broad rule favoured by the Court of Appeal in <i>Wilsher's</i> case are far more complicated than the reasons given by Lord Wilberforce for imposing liability upon an employer who has failed to take simple precautions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70. I therefore think that <i>Wilsher</i> was correctly decided.  The appellants have not made any submission to the contrary.  But the grounds upon which<i> McGhee</i> was distinguished are unsatisfactory.  Lord Bridge of Harwich said (at p. 1090) that it represented a "robust and pragmatic approach" to the facts which had enabled the House to draw a "legitimate inference of fact" that the "defenders' negligence had materially contributed to the pursuer's injury."  My Lords, however robust or pragmatic the tribunal may be, it cannot draw inferences of fact in the teeth of the undisputed medical evidence.  My noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill has demonstrated that such an analysis of <i>McGhee's</i> case is untenable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;71. An alternative ground of distinction is to be found in a passage in the dissenting judgment of Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson V-C in the Court of Appeal, which was approved by the House.  He said that the difference was that in <i>McGhee's</i> case the agent of injury was the same - brick dust - and the only question was whether it happened before or after it should have been washed off.  In <i>Wilsher</i>, the fibroplasia could have been caused by a number of different agencies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72. That distinction would leave the present case on the right side of the line because the agent of injury was the same - asbestos dust.  But I do not think it is a principled distinction.  What if Mr Matthews had been exposed to two different agents - asbestos dust and some other dust - both of which created a material risk of the same cancer and it was equally impossible to say which had caused the fatal cell mutation?  I cannot see why this should make a difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73. The question is how narrowly the principle developed in <i>McGhee's</i> case and applied in this case should be confined.  In my opinion,  caution is advisable.  <i>Wilsher's</i> case shows the dangers of over-generalisation.  In <i>Rutherford v Owens-Illinois Inc.</i> (1997)  67 Cal Rptr.2d 16  the Supreme Court of California, in a valuable and lucid judgment, said that in cases of asbestos-related cancer, the causal requirements of the tort were satisfied by proving that exposure to a particular product was a substantial factor contributing to the "plaintiff's or decedent's risk of developing cancer": see p.32.  That is precisely the rule your Lordships are being invited to apply in this case.   The Californian Supreme Court stated the principle specifically in relation to asbestos-related cancer cases. No doubt it could also apply in other cases which were thought to have sufficient common features, but that was left for decision on a case-by-case basis. Likewise I would suggest that the rule now laid down by the House should be limited to cases which have the five features I have described.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74. That does not mean that the principle is not capable of development and application in new situations. As my noble and learned friend Lord Rodger of Earlsferry has demonstrated, problems of uncertainty as to which of a number of possible agents caused an injury have required special treatment of one kind or another since the time of the Romans.  But the problems differ quite widely and the fair and just answer will not always be the same.  For example, in the famous case of <i>Sindell v Abbott Laboratories</i> (1980)  607 P.2d 924 the plaintiff had suffered pre-natal injuries from exposure to a drug which had been manufactured by any one of a potentially large number of defendants. The case bears some resemblance to the present but the problem is not the same. For one thing, the existence of the additional manufacturers did not materially increase the risk of injury. The risk from consuming a drug bought in one shop is not increased by the fact that it can also be bought in another shop. So the case would not fall within the <i>McGhee</i> principle. But the Supreme Court of California laid down the imaginative rule that each manufacturer should be liable in proportion  to his market share.  Cases like this are not before the House and should in my view be left for consideration when they arise. For present purposes, the <i>McGhee</i> principle is sufficient.  I would therefore allow the appeals.</p>
<p><b>LORD HUTTON</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75. In these three cases the deceased husbands of two of the appellants, Mrs Fox and Mrs Fairchild, contracted the disease of mesothelioma from the conditions in which they worked and the disease caused their deaths.  The third appellant, Mr Matthews, also contracted that disease from the conditions in which he worked and he is now very gravely ill.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76. Mesothelioma is caused by the inhalation of tiny fibres of asbestos contained in asbestos dust.  The nature of the disease, the way in which it develops and the extent of medical knowledge in relation to it, and a description of the working conditions which caused the disease in these three cases are set out in the judgment of my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill and I gratefully adopt that account.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77. In order for a claimant to recover damages against his employer for injury or disease suffered by him he must prove a breach of duty owed to him by his employer and that the breach was a cause of the injury or disease.  The defendants have not disputed that they were each in breach of the respective duties which they owed to the husbands of Mrs Fox and Mrs Fairchild and to Mr Matthews.  It is the requirement of the law that a claimant must prove causation in order to recover damages which has given rise to the issue in these cases.  If Mr Fox, Mr Fairchild and Mr Matthews had each been employed throughout their working lives by a single employer each of them (or his widow) would have been entitled to recover damages against that employer. The dispute in these cases arises because Mr Fox, Mr Fairchild and Mr Matthews were each employed by a number of different employers throughout their working lives and in the present state of medical knowledge and on the basis of the medical evidence given in the High Court it is possible that the disease suffered by each employee could have been caused solely by the breach of duty of one employer.  Accordingly each of the defendants has argued that each claimant cannot establish that it was its breach of duty which was a cause of the disease and that it is as probable as not that the disease was caused by the breach or breaches of duty of one or more other employers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78. In considering the argument advanced on behalf of the defendants there are two parts of the medical evidence (which did not differ in any material respect between the three cases) which are of particular importance and which are summarised as follows in the agreed statement of facts in the case of Matthews:</p>
<p></p><ul>"5.&nbsp;&nbsp;The risk of mesothelioma increases in proportion to the dose of asbestos received and each successive period of exposure augments the risk that mesothelioma will occur.  There is no evidence of a threshold dose below which there is no risk but at low levels of exposure the risk is very small, whereas a lagger with his high level of exposure has a 10% chance of dying from mesothelioma.  Mesothelioma usually occurs in persons who have inhaled millions of asbestos fibres in the course of their work. <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>…..<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;The mechanism by which asbestos causes mesothelioma being unknown, the transformation of a normal mesothelial to a cancerous cell could be due to the action of a single fibre, a few fibres or multiple fibres.  It is believed that carcinogenesis of mesothelioma is a multi-stage process involving a sequence of 6 or 7 genetic changes which together result in a normal mesothelial cell being transformed into a malignant mesothelioma cell.  Asbestos is probably involved at one or more stages of this process."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79. The claimants rely on the decision of this House in <i>McGhee v National Coal Board</i> [1973] 1 WLR 1; 1973 SC(HL) 37 to counter the arguments of the defendants on the issue of causation and submit that they are entitled to succeed by reason of that decision. In that case a workman contracted dermatitis after working in the hot and dusty brick kilns of his employer. The dermatitis was caused by quantities of abrasive brick dust adhering to his skin softened by sweating, and exertion would cause the dust to injure the horny layer exposing the tender cells below to injury or infection from which dermatitis would develop. Washing was the only practicable way of removing the danger, and if the skin was not thoroughly washed as soon as the workman ceased work the process could continue for some considerable time.  The workman, cycling home caked with sweat and dust, was liable to further injury until he could wash himself thoroughly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80. The Lord Ordinary found that there was no breach of duty by the employer in requiring the pursuer to work in the hot and dusty brick kilns, but that there was a breach of duty in failing to provide a shower for him to use after his work.  On the issue of causation the pursuer's doctor said in evidence that he could not say that the provision of showers would probably have prevented the dermatitis.  He said that showers would have reduced the risk materially but he would not go further than that.  On this evidence the Lord Ordinary found that the pursuer had failed to prove that the breach of duty had caused the dermatitis and he held that he could not succeed if the only inference from the evidence was that lack of shower baths was a possibility as a cause of his having contracted the disease.  His decision was upheld by the First Division, the Lord President stating that risk of dermatitis and causation of dermatitis are two quite separate matters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81. On appeal to this House the pursuer relied on the decision of the House in <i>Bonnington Castings Ltd v Wardlaw</i> [1956] AC 613 where it was held that if there are two causes of the disease each materially contributing to it such as dust from two sources, and the defendant company is responsible for only one of them, it is liable notwithstanding that the dust for which it was responsible was not in itself sufficient to cause the disease.  Part of the pursuer's argument is reported at 1973 SC(HL) 37, 51:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Reliance was placed on <i>Wardlaw v Bonnington Castings</i> and <i>Nicholson v Atlas Steel Foundry and Engineering Co</i>. The dicta in these cases were followed in <i>Gardiner v Motherwell Machinery and Scrap Co </i>which applied the principles of the two earlier cases.  Where there were a number of contributory factors to an injury, it was enough to bring the case within the dicta if the employers were guilty in relation to one."<p></p></ul>
<p>The defender sought to distinguish <i>Wardlaw's</i> case by arguing that in that case every particle of dust inhaled played its part in causing the onset of the disease whereas in the case of <i>McGhee</i> the disease might have been started by a single abrasion.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82. In considering this point Lord Reid stated in his speech at [1973] 1 WLR 1, p 4F that the evidence did not show how the dermatitis began.  It might be a necessary precondition for the onset of the disease that there should be an accumulation of minor abrasions of the skin, or it might be that the disease started at one particular abrasion and then spread, so that multiplication of abrasions merely increased the number of places where the disease could start and in that way increased the risk of its occurrence.  Lord Reid stated that he could not hold that it was probable that an accumulation of minor abrasions was a necessary precondition;  if this had been proved the case would have been indistinguishable from <i>Wardlaw's</i> case.  He then stated, at pp 4-5:</p>
<p></p><ul>"But I think that in cases like this we must take a broader view of causation. The medical evidence is to the effect that the fact that the man had to cycle home caked with grime and sweat added materially to the risk that this disease might develop.  It does not and could not explain just why that is so.  But experience shows that it is so.  Plainly that must be because what happens while the man remains unwashed can have a causative effect, though just how the cause operates is uncertain.  I cannot accept the view expressed in the Inner House that once the man left the brick kiln he left behind the causes which made him liable to develop dermatitis.  That seems to me quite inconsistent with a proper interpretation of the medical evidence.  Nor can I accept the distinction drawn by the Lord Ordinary between materially increasing the risk that the disease will occur and making a material contribution to its occurrence.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>There may be some logical ground for such a distinction where our knowledge of all the material factors is complete.  But it has often been said that the legal concept of causation is not based on logic or philosophy.  It is based on the practical way in which the ordinary man's mind works in the everyday affairs of life.  From a broad and practical viewpoint I can see no substantial difference between saying that what the defender did materially increased the risk of injury to the pursuer and saying that what the defender did made a material contribution to his injury."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83. Lord Wilberforce stated, at p 6B:</p>
<p></p><ul>"My Lords, I agree with the judge below to the extent that merely to show that a breach of duty increases the risk of harm is not, in abstracto, enough to enable the pursuer to succeed.  He might, on this basis, still be met by successful defences.  Thus, it was open to the respondents, while admitting, or being unable to contest, that their failure had increased the risk, to prove, if they could, as they tried to do, that the appellant's dermatitis was 'non-occupational'.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>But the question remains whether a pursuer must necessarily fail if, after he has shown a breach of duty, involving an increase of risk of disease, he cannot positively prove that this increase of risk caused or materially contributed to the disease while his employers cannot positively prove the contrary.  In this intermediate case there is an appearance of logic in the view that the pursuer, on whom the onus lies, should fail— a logic which dictated the judgments below.  The question is whether we should be satisfied, in factual situations like the present, with this logical approach.  In my opinion, there are further considerations of importance.  First, it is a sound principle that where a person has, by breach of a duty of care, created a risk, and injury occurs within the area of that risk, the loss should be borne by him unless he shows that it had some other cause.  Secondly, from the evidential point of view, one may ask, why should a man who is able to show that his employer should have taken certain precautions, because without them there is a risk, or an added risk, of injury or disease, and who in fact sustains exactly that injury or disease, have to assume the burden of proving more: namely, that it was the addition to the risk, caused by the breach of duty, which caused or materially contributed to the injury?  In many cases, of which the present is typical, this is impossible to prove, just because honest medical opinion cannot segregate the causes of an illness between compound causes.  And if one asks which of the parties, the workman or the employers, should suffer from this inherent evidential difficulty, the answer as a matter of policy or justice should be that it is the creator of the risk who, ex hypothesi must be taken to have foreseen the possibility of damage, who should bear its consequences."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84. Lord Simon of Glaisdale stated, at p 8B:</p>
<p></p><ul>"But <i>Bonnington Castings Ltd v Wardlaw</i> [1956] AC 613 and <i>Nicholson v Atlas Steel Foundry and Engineering Co Ltd</i> [1957] 1 WLR 613 establish, in my view, that where an injury is caused by two (or more) factors operating cumulatively, one (or more) of which factors is a breach of duty and one (or more) is not so, in such a way that it is impossible to ascertain the proportion in which the factors were effective in producing the injury or which factor was decisive, the law does not require a pursuer or plaintiff to prove the impossible, but holds that he is entitled to damages for the injury if he proves on a balance of probabilities that the breach or breaches of duty contributed substantially to causing the injury.  If such factors so operate cumulatively, it is, in my judgment, immaterial whether they do so concurrently or successively.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>The question, then, is whether on the evidence the appellant brought himself within this rule.  In my view, a failure to take steps which would bring about a material reduction of the risk involves, in this type of case, a substantial contribution to the injury.  In this type of case a stark distinction between breach of duty and causation is unreal.  If the provision of shower baths was (as the evidence showed) a precaution which any reasonable employer in the respondents' position would take, it means that such employer should have foreseen that failure to take the precaution would, more probably than not, substantially contribute towards injury: this is sufficient prima facie evidence."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85. Lord Kilbrandon stated, at p 10F:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In the present case, the pursuer's body was vulnerable, while he was bicycling home, to the dirt which had been deposited on it during his working hours.  It would not have been if he had had a shower.  If showers had been provided he would have used them.  It is admittedly more probable that disease will be contracted if a shower is not taken.  In these circumstances I cannot accept the argument that nevertheless it is not more probable than not that, if the duty to provide a shower had not been neglected, he would not have contracted the disease.  The pursuer has after all, only to satisfy the court of a probability, not to demonstrate an irrefragable chain of causation, which in a case of dermatitis, in the present state of medical knowledge, he could probably never do."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86. At pp 11H-12A, Lord Salmon stated:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In the circumstances of the present case it seems to me unrealistic and contrary to ordinary common sense to hold that the negligence which materially increased the risk of injury did not materially contribute to causing the injury."<p></p></ul>
<p>And at pp 12H-13A:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In the circumstances of the present case, the possibility of a distinction existing between (a) having materially increased the risk of contracting the disease, and (b) having materially contributed to causing the disease may no doubt be a fruitful source of interesting academic discussions between students of philosophy.  Such a distinction is, however, far too unreal to be recognised by the common law."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87. In <i>Wilsher v Essex Area Health Authority</i> [1987] QB 730 the plaintiff was born prematurely and due to the negligence of a doctor excessive amounts of oxygen were administered to him.  The plaintiff developed retrolental fibroplasia, a condition of the eyes, which resulted in blindness.  The administration of the excessive amounts of oxygen was a possible cause of the retrolental fibroplasia but there were a number of other possible causes of the condition which were in no way related to the negligence of the doctor.  At first instance the judge gave judgment for the plaintiff and awarded damages.  The defendant appealed and the appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal (Mustill and Glidewell LJJ, Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson V-C dissenting).  Mustill LJ recognised that the case differed from <i>McGhee</i> in that in the latter case there was only one risk operating, which was that the contact of brick dust with a sweaty skin would lead to dermatitis, whereas in the <i>Wilsher</i> case there was a list of risk factors, any one of which might have caused the injury.  However he came to the conclusion that the approach taken in <i>McGhee</i> could be adopted in the case before him and stated, at pp 771H-772C: </p>
<p></p><ul>"Reading all the speeches together, the principle applied by the House seems to me to amount to this.  If it is an established fact that conduct of a particular kind creates a risk that injury will be caused to another or increases an existing risk that injury will ensue; and if the two parties stand in such a relationship that the one party owes a duty not to conduct himself in that way; and if the first party does conduct himself in that way; and if the other party does suffer injury of the kind to which the risk related; then the first party is taken to have caused the injury by his breach of duty, even though the existence and extent of the contribution made by the breach cannot be ascertained.  If this is the right analysis, it seems to me that the shape taken by the enhancement of the risk ought not to be of crucial significance.  In the <i>McGhee</i> case [1973] 1 WLR 1, the conduct of the employers made it more likely that the pursuer would contract dermatitis, and he did contract dermatitis.  Here, the conduct of those for whom the defendants are liable made it more likely that Martin would contract RLF, and he did contract RLF.  If considerations of justice demanded that the pursuer succeed in the one case, I can see no reason why the plaintiff should not succeed in the other."<p></p></ul>
