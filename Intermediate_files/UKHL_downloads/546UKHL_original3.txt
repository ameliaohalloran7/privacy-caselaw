<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75. In these circumstances, in my opinion, the fact that at the date of the continuation contract Cosslett did not have an immediate right to possession did not deprive the continuation contract of its effect as constituting a conversion by the council of the coal washing plants.  What it did do was to postpone the date at which, for measure of damages purposes, the value of the converted plants had to be assessed.  Cosslett was, and in my opinion is, entitled to damages for conversion representing the value of the plants at the date of the conversion, that is to say, January 1994.  But the plants were, at that date, subject to the clause 63(1) rights of user that were binding on Cosslett.  So the value should be adjusted accordingly.  In practice, I imagine that the value of the plants subject to the rights of user will be equivalent to the value of the plants in their used state at the completion of the works.</p>
<p>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;Set-off</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76. Can the council, even if its clause 63(1) rights do constitute a security that was unregistered and therefore void, claim the benefit of equitable set-off so as to set off its contractual damages claim against Cosslett's conversion damages claim?  In my opinion, clearly not.  This is a case in which the parties, in clause 63(1) of their contract, have provided the council with a contractual right of set-off that, for failure to comply with applicable statutory provisions, is void against Cosslett in administration.  Why should equity intervene and protect the council from its failure to comply with the statutory provisions?  Similar questions arose in <i>Orakpo v Manson Investments Ltd</i> [1978]  AC 95  and in <i>Dimond v Lovell</i> [2000]  2 WLR 1121 (HL).  <i>Orakpo </i> was a moneylending case.  The defendants were licensed moneylenders but, in respect of loans to the plaintiff with which the plaintiff had purchased properties, had failed to comply with the requirements of the Moneylenders Act 1927.  (17&amp;18 Geo 5, c 21).  The consequence was that the loan agreements were unenforceable and so were the mortgages granted by the plaintiff to secure the repayment of the loans.  The defendants claimed to be entitled by subrogation to the benefit of the vendors' liens.  This House rejected the claim and Lord Salmon, at p 111, commented that he could not think "that it would be proper to apply an equitable doctrine for the purpose of enabling a moneylender to escape from the consequences of his breach of the statute . . . "  Lord Edmund Davies, in answer to the question whether a court of equity should grant relief to a moneylender who was in breach of the Act, said, at p 115, that he felt compelled to answer in the negative:</p>
<p></p><ul>"for to answer affirmatively would be to enable the court to express a policy of its own in regard to moneylending transactions which would be in direct conflict with the policy of the 1927 Act itself".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77. In <i>Dimond v Lovell </i>a regulated consumer credit agreement relating to the hire of a car was unenforceable for failure to comply with the requirements of the Consumer Credit Act 1974.  It was argued for the car hire company that it should have an unjust enrichment remedy.  The argument was rejected by this House.  Lord Hoffmann, citing <i>Orakpo v Manson Investments Ltd</i>, said [2000] 2 WLR 1121, 1131:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Parliament intended that if a consumer credit agreement was improperly executed, then . . . the debtor should not have to pay.  This meant that Parliament contemplated that he might be enriched and I do not see how it is open to the court to say that this consequence is unjust and should be reversed by a remedy at common law".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78. Similar reasoning applies here.  If the council's clause 63(1) security is barred by section 395(1) from being enforceable against Cosslett in administration, it is no part of equity to provide, via equitable set-off, an alternative security.</p>
<p>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;Title to sue in conversion</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79. I respectfully agree that the plaintiff/claimant in Cosslett's conversion action ought to have been "Cosslett (Contractors) Ltd (In administration)" and have nothing to add on this point to what Lord Hoffmann has already said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80. For all these reasons I agree that the appeal should be allowed and the judgment and interim order of Judge Toulmin QC restored.</p>
