<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79.&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be some tension or conflict between purposes (a) and (b), and decisions may have to be made which will prevail, bearing in mind the high importance of maintaining a desirable level of fairness in the complaints and adjudication process.  The instant case is an example of just such a conflict, in that disclosure of the documents sought by the appellant would assist the achievement of the second purpose but might have the effect of hindering the effective accomplishment of the first.  There is a demonstrable public benefit in disclosure of documents where it is reasonably possible, but where there is a countervailing factor of sufficient strength it cannot be said to be necessary within the terms of section 80(1)(a) of the 1996 Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reasons which Lord Rodger of Earlsferry described in his opinion as his wider grounds, I would regard it as inappropriate to disclose witnesses' statements to a complainant while a criminal prosecution or disciplinary charge may be brought against the officer against whom the complaint has been made.  I also regard the possibility of contamination as having quite material significance, for I think that it can be a problem in criminal cases and, by analogy, in the conduct of disciplinary charges.  I agree that the issue of confidentiality is of relatively minor importance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81.&nbsp;&nbsp;One then has to consider what steps can be and have been taken by the Authority to inform the appellant of what is being done and why, with the object of enhancing his confidence and that of other persons in the integrity of the complaints process.  The appellant has been given a detailed and fully reasoned provisional decision dealing with the Authority's proposed recommendation, on which he has received an opportunity to comment.  He has seen the video recording of the incident of which he complains and has been given (if somewhat belatedly) a copy of the video.  He will receive a final version of the Authority's decision when it is made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appellant makes the case that he cannot comment effectively on the proposed recommendation without seeing the underlying materials consisting of witnesses' statements.  He has, however, received a pretty fair idea of their content from the provisional decision letter.  If his information is less than perfect in extent, it is because of the strength of the countervailing considerations.  I would therefore agree with the conclusion reached by the Court of Appeal that it is not necessary for the statements to be disclosed before criminal or disciplinary proceedings have either been completed or finally ruled out, which is not yet the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appellant also relied on articles 2 and 3 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms as reinforcement for his case.  There has not been unanimity in the views expressed by some of your Lordships about the applicability of these provisions.  While I have reservations about the applicability of either to the present case, I should prefer to leave expression of a definite opinion on the issue to another occasion.  I am content to assume for the purposes of this appeal that one or other article applies.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84.&nbsp;&nbsp;The requirements of the Convention relating to effective investigations were set out in para 20 of the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill in <i>R (Amin) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</i> [2003]  3 WLR 1169, 1177-1179, and I need not set them out here.  It is sufficient to say that they can be very shortly summarised for present purposes as requiring an independent investigation undertaken by the state, conducted with reasonable promptitude, capable of leading to a determination whether the acts of the agents of the state were justified and, if not, to identification and punishment of those responsible, with a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the process.  I venture to doubt whether these requirements go beyond those imposed by domestic law in any material respect, but in any event I consider that they have been satisfied in the case before your Lordships.  Accordingly, if either article 2 or article 3 applies, there has in my opinion been no breach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sake of completeness, I would add that I agree with the judgment of Simon Brown LJ rather than that of Chadwick LJ on the ability of the Authority to re-open an investigation if they think it necessary in the light of representations made or evidence supplied following the issue of a provisional decision letter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore dismiss the appeal.</p>
