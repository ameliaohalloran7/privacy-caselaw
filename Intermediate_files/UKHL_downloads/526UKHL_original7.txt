<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;151. The second observation is that whilst there can be no dispute that the Minister of State was correct to say, in the passage from the debate in the House of Lords which I have set out above, that "The fact that a complainant has consented previously does not mean that she will consent again", it does not follow, in my opinion, where there has been a recent affectionate relationship between a woman and a man, that one cannot say that the fact that she has consented previously is relevant in deciding whether she consented when there was intercourse with the same man a relatively short time later.  I consider that there is much force in the statement of Professor Galvin, at p 807 of her article, that</p>
<p></p><ul>"Even the most ardent reformers acknowledged the high probative value of past sexual conduct in at least two instances.  The first is when the defendant claims consent and establishes prior consensual sexual relations between himself and the complainant … although the evidence is offered to prove consent, its probative value rests on the nature of the complainant's specific mindset towards the accused rather than on her general unchaste character."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;152. In my opinion there will be some cases where evidence of previous consensual sexual intercourse between the complainant and the defendant would be clearly relevant, but there will also be cases where such evidence would not be relevant.  Where there has been a recent close and affectionate relationship between the complainant and the defendant it is probable that the evidence will be relevant, not to advance the bare assertion that because she consented in the past she consented on the occasion in question, but for the reason given by Professor Galvin, which is that evidence of such a relationship will show the complainant's specific mindset towards the defendant, namely her affection for him.  In relation to this point Professor Galvin, at p 786, cites the opinion of Dean Wigmore that such evidence shows: "an emotion towards the particular defendant tending to allow him to repeat the liberty."  But where there had only been some isolated acts of intercourse, even if fairly recently, without the background of an affectionate relationship, it is probable that the evidence will not be relevant.  But beyond stating that the test is that of relevance, I think that it is not possible to state with precision where the dividing line is to be drawn—it will depend on the facts of the individual case as assessed by the trial judge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;153. An additional difficulty in the present case is that the information before the House as to the evidence which the defendant wishes to give is very limited.  The agreed statement of facts records:</p>
<p></p><ul>"On 15 June 2000 the respondent attended Fulham police station and, following a consultation with his solicitor, was interviewed.  He declined to answer questions but read out a prepared statement which included the following:<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>'…. I, myself and my friend have only known her for about a month.  And we both had sexual relationship with her.  The evening or the night when they took my friend to the hospital I had sex with [the complainant] and we had sex in front of the river in Ham.  While I had sex with her I was not wearing a condom.  This sexual relationship which took place [the complainant] started it.  [She] was never against this sexual relationship that we were having.  This sex took place on Wednesday 14 June very early in the morning.'<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>It remains the respondent's case that, on the occasion in question, the complainant initiated consensual sexual intercourse and that this was part of a continuing sexual relationship.  The consensual sexual relationship covered a period of approximately three weeks prior to 14 June 2000;  and in particular he had consensual sexual relations with her, including sexual intercourse, at his flat on occasions between 26 May 2000 and 14 June 2000.  The last instance was approximately one week before 14 June 2000."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;154. If the evidence were confined to those bare facts I would be of opinion that it would not be relevant to the issue of consent.  But it may be that the defendant will be able to give more detailed evidence of his relationship with the complainant which would make his evidence of previous consensual intercourse relevant.</p>
<p align="left"><u></u></p>
<p align="left"><u>Is relevant evidence admissible under section 41?</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;155. Therefore on the basis that further evidence which the defendant may wish to give may be relevant I turn to consider whether such evidence is admissible under section 41.  This gives rise to the following questions.  The first is whether the evidence would be admissible under section 41 on ordinary principles of construction.  If the answer to this question is in the negative the second question is whether the exclusion of the evidence infringes the defendant's right to a fair trial under article 6 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms ("the Convention").  If the answer to this question is in the affirmative the third question is whether section 41 can be construed pursuant to section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998 in such a way that it is compatible with article 6.  If the answer to this question is in the negative it would be the duty of the House under section 4(2) of the 1998 Act to consider making a declaration that section 41 is incompatible with the Convention right given by article 6.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;156. I consider it to be clear that if, as in this case, the defendant says that the most recent act of previous intercourse took place approximately one week before the date of the alleged offence, that sexual behaviour of the complainant cannot come within the scope of the words "at or about the same time as the event which is the subject matter of the charge against the accused" in section 41(3)(b).  This is so whether ordinary rules of construction are applied or the more expansive approach to construction is taken under section 3 of the 1998 Act.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;157. A more difficult question arises under section 41(3)(c) because that paragraph is, in itself, a difficult one to construe in the context of the section.  In <i> R v Boardman</i> [1975]  AC 421 this House laid stress on the need for "striking similarity" between the criminal acts with which the accused was charged and other criminal acts which the prosecution sought to put in evidence against him.  But in <i>Director of Public Prosecutions v P</i> [1991]  2 AC 447 the House stated that "striking similarity" is not an essential element in permitting evidence to be given of other conduct and Lord Mackay of Clashfern LC (with whose speech all the other Members of the House concurred) stated, at p 460D:</p>
<p></p><ul>"As this matter has been left in <i>R v Boardman</i> I am of opinion that it is not appropriate to single out 'striking similarity' as an essential element in every case in allowing evidence of an offence against one victim to be heard in connection with an allegation against another.  Obviously, in cases where the identity of the offender is in issue, evidence of a character sufficiently special reasonably to identify the perpetrator is required and the discussion which follows in Lord Salmon's speech on the passage which I have quoted indicates that he had that type of case in mind.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>From all that was said by the House in <i>R v Boardman</i> I would deduce the essential feature of evidence which is to be admitted is that its probative force in support of the allegation that an accused person committed a crime is sufficiently great to make it just to admit the evidence, notwithstanding that it is prejudicial to the accused in tending to show that he was guilty of another crime.  Such probative force may be derived from striking similarities in the evidence about the manner in which the crime was committed …  But restricting the circumstances in which there is sufficient probative force to overcome prejudice of evidence relating to another crime to cases in which there is some striking similarity between them is to restrict the operation of the principle in a way which gives too much effect to a particular manner of stating it, and is not justified in principle."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;158. It is to be noted that paragraph (c) does not contain the term "strikingly similar"—it contains the less stringent words "so similar … that the similarity cannot reasonably be explained as a coincidence."  It also provides that it is sufficient if the sexual behaviour of the complainant is alleged to have been so similar "in any respect".   Moreover section 42(1)(c) defines "sexual behaviour" as being "any sexual behaviour".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;159. I turn to consider the following hypothetical case.  A defendant wishes to give evidence that for a number of months prior to the date of the alleged offence he had had a close and affectionate relationship with the complainant and that he had had frequent consensual intercourse with her during that period.  Before intercourse he would kiss her and she would return his kisses.  At the time of the alleged offence, before having intercourse, affectionate behaviour took place between them as it had done on the early occasions.  Is this evidence admissible under section 41(3)(c)?  It  can be argued that the similarity between the sexual behaviour of the woman on the earlier occasions and on the occasion in question cannot reasonably be explained as a coincidence:  there is a causal connection which is that the woman was fond of the defendant and attracted to him and that is why intercourse has taken place on all occasions.  But can it be said that the behaviour is "so similar that the similarity cannot reasonably be explained as a coincidence"?  Such behaviour is normal between a man and a woman and so it cannot be said to be "strikingly similar", but that is not what the paragraph requires.  Therefore I think there is an argument that such evidence would be admissible under section 41(3)(c).  However I consider that some weight must be given to the word "so", which I think was intended to emphasis that mere similarity was not sufficient.   Moreover having regard to the way in which the mischief at which the section was directed was described by the Minister of State in the debate in the House of Lords, I do not think that Parliament intended that evidence such as that which I have described in the hypothetical case can be admitted under section 41(3)(c).  Therefore I would hold that such evidence is not admissible under the paragraph.</p>
<p align="left"><u></u></p>
<p align="left"><u></u></p>
<p align="left"><u>Is section 41, on ordinary principles of construction, incompatible with the right to a fair trial given by article 6?</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;160. In <i>Brown v Stott</i> [2001] 2 WLR 817 the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council considered the circumstances in which a particular right given by article 6 may be qualified by considerations of the public interest which Parliament has taken into account in enacting the statutory provision under consideration;  in that case the public interest being the need to address in an effective way the high incidence of death and injury on the roads caused by the misuse of motor vehicles.  But it is clear that in relation to a fair trial certain rights are absolute and cannot be qualified.  Lord Bingham of Cornhill stated, at p 825A:</p>
<p></p><ul>"There is nothing to suggest that the fairness of the trial itself may be qualified, compromised or restricted in any way, whatever the circumstances and whatever the public interest in convicting the offender.  If the trial as a whole is judged to be unfair, a conviction cannot stand.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>What a fair trial requires cannot, however, be the subject of a single, unvarying rule or collection of rules.  It is proper to take account of the facts and circumstances of particular cases, as the European Court has consistently done."<p></p></ul>
<p>And, at p 836B:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The jurisprudence of the European Court very clearly establishes that while the overall fairness of a criminal trial cannot be compromised, the constituent rights comprised, whether expressly or implicitly, within article 6 are not themselves absolute.  Limited qualification of these rights is acceptable if reasonably directed by national authorities towards a clear and proper public objective and if representing no greater qualification than the situation calls for."<p></p></ul>
<p>Lord Hope of Craighead stated, at p 851A:</p>
<p></p><ul>"A similar approach to the function of the rule of law can be seen in the fact that the court has consistently recognised that, while the right to a fair trial is absolute in its terms and the public interest can never be invoked to deny that right to anybody under any circumstances, the rights which it has read into article 6 are neither absolute nor inflexible."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;161. In the type of case which I have instanced where a man, who may be innocent, wishes to give evidence of previous acts of sexual intercourse with the complainant in the course of a recent close and affectionate relationship, such evidence would be a central and essential part of his defence, and I consider that to deny him the opportunity to cross-examine the complainant and to give such evidence would compromise the overall fairness of the hearing and would deny him the essence of a fair trial.   In my opinion the right of a defendant to call relevant evidence, where the absence of such evidence may give rise to an unjust conviction, is an absolute right which cannot be qualified by considerations of public interest, no matter how well founded that public interest may be.  This right is well described in the argument of counsel for the appellants as set out by McLachlin J in <i>R v Seaboyer </i>83 DLR (4th) 193, 260-261:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The right of the innocent not to be convicted is reflected in our society's fundamental commitment to a fair trial, a commitment expressly embodied in s 11(d) of the Charter.  It has long been recognized that an essential facet of a fair, hearing is the 'opportunity adequately to state [one's] case.' ….<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>The right of the innocent not to be convicted is dependent on the right to present full answer and defence.  This, in turn, depends on being able to call the evidence necessary to establish a defence and to challenge the evidence called by the prosecution.  As one writer has put it:<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>'If the evidentiary bricks needed to build a defence are denied the accused, then for that accused the defence has been abrogated as surely as it would be if the defence itself was held to be unavailable to him.'<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>In short, the denial of the right to call and challenge evidence is tantamount to the denial of the right to rely on a defence to which the law says one is entitled.  The defence which the law gives with one hand, may be taken away with the other.  Procedural limitations make possible the conviction of persons who the criminal law says are innocent."<p></p></ul>
<p>Therefore I would hold on ordinary principles of construction that section 41 is incompatible with the right to a fair trial given by aticle 6. </p>
<p align="left"><u></u></p>
<p align="left"><u></u></p>
<p align="left"><u>Under section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998 can section 41 be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the right to a fair trial given by article 6?</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;162. Section 3(1) provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"So far as it is possible to do so, primary legislation and subordinate legislation must be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights."<p></p></ul>
<p>As my noble and learned friend Lord Steyn stated in <i>R v Director of Public Prosecutions, Ex p Kebilene</i> [2000]  2 AC 326, 366B, this subsection enacts a strong interpretative obligation, and Lord Cooke of Thorndon, at p 373F, described the subsection as an adjuration.  It is clearly desirable that a court should seek to avoid having to make a declaration of incompatibility under section 4 of the 1998 Act unless the clear and express wording of the provision makes this impossible.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;163. In paragraph 159 I have observed that on ordinary principles of construction and having regard to the change in emphasis in <i>Director of Public Prosecutions v P </i>[1991] 2 AC 447 away from "striking similarity" to "probative force" there is a possible argument that relevant evidence of a previous close and affectionate relationship in which sexual intercourse took place is admissible under section 41(3).  Therefore pursuant to the obligation imposed by section 3(1) that section 41 must be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with article 6, I consider that section 41(3)(c) should be read as including evidence of such previous behaviour by the complainant because the defendant claims that her sexual behaviour on previous occasions was similar, and the similarity was not a coincidence because there was a causal connection which was her affection for, and feelings of attraction towards, the defendant.  It follows that I am in full agreement with the test of admissibility stated by my noble and learned friend Lord Steyn in paragraph 46 of his speech.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;164. Therefore I consider that the matter should be remitted to the trial judge in the Crown Court to consider if the evidence which the defendant wishes to give (as amplified by him if he wishes to do so) is admissible under that test.  Having regard to the terms of this speech I think it is unnecessary to answer the certified question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;165. In conclusion I wish to make some observations on the nature of the present "appeal".  In this case there was an appeal by the defendant under section 35 of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 from the ruling of the trial judge on a preparatory hearing.  The appeal was brought by the defendant to challenge the ruling of the trial judge that section 41 of the 1999 Act prohibited him from giving evidence of, or addressing questions to the complainant, about previous consensual sexual intercourse between himself and the complainant.  The Court of Appeal gave two principal rulings.  One ruling was that the trial judge was in error in excluding such evidence and questioning entirely, because they were permissible under section 41(3)(a) in relation to the defence of belief as to consent.  The other ruling was, however, that the trial judge was correct to rule that such evidence and questioning were not admissible on the issue of consent.  Because of the first ruling the Court of Appeal held that the appeal was allowed.  Therefore, in discussion with the Court of Appeal after the judgment had been given, counsel for the defendant accepted that he could not seek to appeal to this House as the Court of Appeal had allowed the defendant's appeal.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;166. Moreover the Crown did not wish to appeal against the ruling of the Court of Appeal upholding the decision of the trial judge that the evidence and questioning were inadmissible under section 41 on the issue of consent, because this was the result for which the Crown contended.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;167. In the course of delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal Rose LJ stated, at para 15:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It will not, in due course, form any part of this judgment as to whether or not, as a matter of final determination, the provisions of section 41(3)(b) of the 1999 Act, if they preclude evidence as to previous consensual sexual activity between the complainant and the defendant, is compatible with the fair trial provisions of article 6."<p></p></ul>
<p>However later in the judgment, at para 37, Rose LJ stated in an obiter dictum:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Whether if, following a trial . . . , the appellant were to be convicted, it would be possible to argue, by way of appeal, that his trial had not been fair, in the light of article 6, remains for consideration on some future occasion."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;168. This dictum caused the Crown concern because it was its view that the exclusion of evidence of previous sexual behaviour by the complainant with the defendant would not render the trial unfair under article 6.  Accordingly the Crown sought leave from the Court of Appeal to appeal to this House, and the Court of Appeal granted leave and certified the following question as being a point of law of general public importance which was involved in the decision to allow the interlocutory appeal:</p>
<p></p><ul>"May a sexual relationship between a defendant and complainant be relevant to the issue of consent so as to render its exclusion under section 41 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 a contravention of the defendant's right to a fair trial?"<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;169. Section 33 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 (as amended, inter alia, by section 36 of the 1996 Act) provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"(1)	An appeal lies to the House of Lords, at the instance of the defendant or the prosecutor, from any decision of the Court of Appeal on an appeal to that court under Part I of this Act [or section 9 (preparatory hearings) of the Criminal Justice Act 1987] [or section 35 of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996].<p></p></ul>
(2) <p></p><ul>The appeal lies only with the leave of the Court of Appeal or the House of Lords; and leave shall not be granted unless it is certified by the Court of Appeal that a point of law of general public importance is involved in the decision and it appears to the Court of Appeal or the House of Lords (as the case may be) that the point is one which ought to be considered by that House."<p></p></ul>
<p>In the written statement of facts and issues before the House the final paragraph states:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The appellant wishes to make clear that it is not suggested that the decision of the Court of Appeal was wrong on the question of whether the evidence was admissible as relevant to the issue of belief in consent."<p></p></ul>
<p>And in its written case the Crown states:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The appellant's principal submissions in relation to the judgment of the Court of Appeal are as follows:<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(i)	the Court of Appeal was correct to decide that the disputed evidence was relevant to the defence of genuine belief in consent;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(ii)	the Court of Appeal was also correct to conclude that if the disputed evidence was admissible solely on the question of belief in consent, the jury will, in due course, have to be directed that the evidence is not relevant to the issue of actual consent;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(iii)	the Court of Appeal erred in suggesting that such a direction to the jury might lead to an unfair trial."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;170. Therefore it would appear to be clear that this was not "an appeal . . . at the instance of the . . .  prosecutor from [a] decision of the Court of Appeal"— rather the prosecutor accepted that the decision of the Court of Appeal was correct but wished to appeal against an obiter dictum of the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;171. However the Court of Appeal granted leave to appeal and certified that a point of law of general public importance was involved in the decision, and therefore I think, on balance, that the House had jurisdiction to hear the matter.  Moreover in this case it was of obvious importance that the issue whether section 41 is compatible with article 6 or whether the section can be read in a way which is compatible with the article should be resolved because of the number of cases pending in which the point arose and of the need to protect vulnerable complainants from the risk of having to give evidence at a second trial and, very understandably, the Court of Appeal was clearly influenced by this consideration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;172. Section 33 of the 1968 Act, however, makes it clear that leave should only be given to appeal from a decision of the Court of Appeal.  If it is considered desirable that a party who does not wish to challenge the decision of the Court of Appeal but to obtain a ruling of the House on the correctness of an important obiter dictum in the course of the judgment on a point which affects other cases should be allowed to do so, I consider that the wording of section 33 would have to be amended by Parliament.</p>
