<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;175.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing to suggest that SIAC erred in their general approach to the issues which they had to decide.  When scrutinising a decision which has been taken on grounds of national security, SIAC and the appellate courts must accord an appropriate degree of deference to the measures adopted by the Government and by Parliament.  In <i>Secretary of State for the Home Department v Rehman </i>[2003] 1 AC 153 the House held that SIAC had failed to appreciate the nature of their role when reviewing a deportation decision which the Home Secretary had taken in the interests of national security.  Not surprisingly, therefore, at an early stage in their judgment in this case SIAC reminded themselves that it is particularly necessary to allow a margin of discretion to the Home Secretary, as the primary decision-maker in matters relating to national security, and quoted the relevant passage from paras 57 and 58 of the speech of my noble and learned friend, Lord Hoffmann, in <i> Rehman.</i>  SIAC's judgment is peppered with references to the need for them to accord the appropriate margin to the executive and legislature in relation to the various points that they had to consider.  Indeed my noble and learned friend, Lord Hope of Craighead, considers that SIAC gave not too little, but too much leeway to the executive and legislature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;176.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the provisions of section 30 of the 2001 Act are to have any real meaning, deference to the views of the Government and Parliament on the derogation cannot be taken too far.  Due deference does not mean abasement before those views, even in matters relating to national security.  Even in such matters what Simon Brown LJ said in <i>International Transport Roth GmbH v Secretary of State for the Home Department </i>[2003] QB 728, 754, holds true:  "There are limits to the legitimacy of executive or legislative decision-making, just as there are to decision-making by the courts."  Indeed the considerable deference which the European Court of Human Rights shows to the views of the national authorities in such matters really presupposes that the national courts will police those limits.  Moreover, by enacting section 30, Parliament, including the democratically elected House of Commons, gave SIAC and the appellate courts a specific mandate to perform that function - a function which the executive and the legislature cannot perform for themselves - in relation to this derogation.  The legitimacy of the courts' scrutiny role cannot be in doubt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;177.&nbsp;&nbsp;On a broader view, too, scrutiny by the courts is appropriate.  There is always a danger that, by its very nature, a concern for national security may bring forth measures that are not objectively justified.  Sometimes, of course, as with the Reichstag fire, national security can be used as a pretext for repressive measures that are really taken for other reasons.  There is no question of that in this case:  it is accepted that the measures were adopted in good faith.  But good faith does not eliminate the risk that, because of an understandable concern for national security, a measure may be taken which, on examination, can be seen to go too far.  For example, even though it was a bona fide response to the crisis facing the nation in the summer of 1940, the mass detention of German and Italian enemy aliens, including many refugees, is sometimes thought - rightly or wrongly - to be a case in point.  So, in these proceedings, even though detention of foreign suspects was introduced in good faith on grounds of national security, SIAC and the appellate courts have a limited, but none the less important, duty to check whether, as article 15(1) stipulates, the measure was strictly required by the exigencies of the situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;178.&nbsp;&nbsp;In discharging that duty British courts are performing their traditional role of watching over the liberty of everyone within their jurisdiction, regardless of nationality.  In the words of La Forest J in <i>RJR-MacDonald Inc v Attorney General of Canada </i>[1995] 3 SCR 199, 277, "Courts are specialists in the protection of liberty...."  Here the exercise happens to take the particular form of examining the grounds for the derogation from the basic guarantees in article 5 of the Convention, which aim to secure the right of individuals in a democracy to be free from arbitrary detention at the hands of the authorities:  <i>Kurt v Turkey </i>(1998) 27 EHRR 373, 447, para 122.  In performing this role and checking whether detention of the foreign suspects, such as the appellants, was strictly required, the courts are entitled to have regard to the extent of the inroad which it makes into the liberty of those foreign suspects:  the greater the inroad, the greater the care with which the justification for it must be examined.  On any view, the inroad into the appellants' liberty is far-reaching.  It is true, of course, that they will be released from detention if they can find another country which will take them and where they do not face the risk of inhuman or degrading treatment.  Two of the appellants have been able to take that route.  For most of the others, however, the reality is that they have already been detained for three years and their detention is likely to continue for at least two more years.  In fact it is likely to go on for even longer if the legislation is renewed in 2006, since in October 2003 the Director General of the Security Service saw no prospect of a significant reduction in the threat posed to the United Kingdom and its interests from Islamist terrorism over the following five years and, she feared, for a considerable number of years after that.  The acute question is whether the exigencies of the situation strictly required a small number of foreign suspects to endure indefinite detention of this kind while, in the judgment of the Government and Parliament, an undisclosed number of British suspects could safely be allowed to remain at liberty.  SIAC had to answer this question on the basis of the evidence placed before it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;179.&nbsp;&nbsp;In his second witness statement, Mr Bob Whalley, the Head of the Terrorism and Protection Unit in the Home Office, put forward three reasons why the Home Secretary had decided to limit the power of detention to foreign suspects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;180.&nbsp;&nbsp;One was that foreign nationals are subject to immigration control and that it remains the Home Secretary's intention to remove the persons concerned from the United Kingdom, at a future date, using the United Kingdom's immigration powers.  Since the Secretary of State wished to remove them even before September 2001, this is plainly right in the case of the appellants.  As I have already pointed out, however, since they were previously at liberty, the reason for detaining them under section 23 cannot be that the Secretary of State would like to deport them.   The reason is that, after 9/11, they are suspected of presenting a threat to the life of the nation.  In this, the relevant, respect they are comparable to the British suspects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;181.&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason given by Mr Whalley is that a measure dealing with foreign suspects was required because of a perception in other countries, including Moslem countries, that the United Kingdom was weak in its response to international terrorists operating in its territory.  At best, such a consideration could only be a makeweight:  it could not justify the detention of the appellants without trial, if there were no other valid reason for detaining them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;182.&nbsp;&nbsp;In his submissions the Attorney General attached most importance to the reason given in para 19 of Mr Whalley's second witness statement:</p>
<p></p><ul>"First, it was considered by the Secretary of State that the serious threats to the nation emanated predominantly (albeit not exclusively) and more immediately from the category of foreign nationals."<p></p></ul>
<p>There was no elucidation or elaboration of what exactly Mr Whalley meant by the threat emanating "more immediately" from the category of foreign nationals.  Whatever its importance, however, Mr Whalley's statment is simply one element in the material which was before SIAC and on which they had to reach their conclusion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;183.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although most of the serious threats may have come from foreign nationals, by its very terms Mr Whalley's statement shows that serious threats were also considered to emanate, to a not insignificant extent, from British nationals.  This is borne out by other passages in the material which the Government placed before SIAC.  I pick out some of them.  The <i>Amended Open Statement on International Terrorism linked to Usama Bin Laden and Al Qaida in the UK </i>describes the way that the terrorists operated through networks, with training camps in Afghanistan.  It comments that "a number of those attending the camps have come from (and after training returned to) the UK and other countries in Europe."  It is estimated that upwards of a thousand individuals from the United Kingdom attended;  there is nothing to suggest that those coming from, and returning to, the United Kingdom did not include British nationals.  Indeed, para 26 of the Statement<i> </i>shows that the "shoe bomber" Richard Reid, a British national, attended a training camp in Afghanistan in 1998.  The <i>Amended Addendum to the Open Generic Statement </i>mentions that 9 British citizens were detained as a consequence of Coalition action in Afghanistan and Pakistan and points out that the attendance of one of them at a mosque in London facilitated the process whereby he became involved in terrorism.  The Addendum also refers to two British citizens who were suspected of being involved in a planned attack.  One of them was convicted of possession of explosives with intent to endanger life and sentenced to 20 years in prison.  In his summary the author of the Addendum says that it reinforces knowledge of the United Kingdom as a logistics and recruitment base:  "the nine British citizens detained [in Afghanistan and Pakistan], as well as Richard REID and Zacarias MOUSSAOUI, provide clear evidence of the effectiveness of the networks to recruit in and from the UK."  Finally, in para 27 of the <i>Amended Addendum to the Open Derogation Statement </i>the author summarises the position by saying that the backgrounds of those detained in Afghanistan and Pakistan "show the high level of involvement of British citizens and those otherwise connected with the UK in the terrorist networks".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;184.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having considered not only the open evidence, including this material, but the closed evidence as well, SIAC explained their conclusion on article 14 in this way, [2002] HRLR 1274, 1313, paras 94 - 95:</p>
<p></p><ul>"If there is to be an effective derogation from the right to liberty enshrined in article 5 in respect of suspected international terrorists - and we can see powerful arguments in favour of such a derogation - the derogation ought rationally to extend to all irremovable suspected international terrorists.  It would properly be confined to the alien section of the population only if, as the Attorney General contends, the threat stems exclusively or almost exclusively from that alien section.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>95.  But the evidence before us demonstrates beyond argument that the threat is not so confined.  There are many British nationals already identified - mostly in detention abroad - who fall within the definition of 'suspected international terrorists', and it was clear from the submissions made to us that in the opinion of the respondent there are others at liberty in the United Kingdom who could be similarly defined.  In those circumstances we fail to see how the derogation can be regarded as other than discriminatory on the grounds of national origin."<p></p></ul>
<p>In their view the evidence demonstrated beyond argument that the threat did not stem exclusively or almost exclusively from the alien section of the population.  Since there could be discrimination in terms of article 14 only if the foreign and British suspects both posed a comparable threat, plainly SIAC concluded on the evidence that they did indeed do so.  In other words SIAC were not satisfied that there was a material difference in the nature of the threat posed by foreign suspects such as would provide a rational justification for their detention while British suspects were not detained.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;185.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to remember that SIAC had seen not only the open material but the closed material as well.  So they knew what the closed material contained and what bearing it had on the issues to be determined.  Their assessment was that it was obvious that the closed material was most relevant to the first issue, whether there was an emergency threatening the life of the nation:  [2002] HRLR 1274, 1286, para 14.  The Court of Appeal did not see the closed material and, on due consideration, the Attorney General decided that it would not assist his case for your Lordships to do so.  It is therefore appropriate to proceed on the view that, on the disparity of treatment issue, there is nothing in the closed material which significantly alters the picture to be derived from the open material.  In particular, while, as a general observation, it is undoubtedly true, as Brooke LJ remarked, [2004] QB 335, 375, para 103, that "five generals and their chiefs of staff may pose a more serious and immediate threat than 5,000 foot-soldiers", there is nothing in the open material which gives the slightest basis for inferring that the foreign suspects made up the generals and chiefs of staff, while the British suspects provided the foot-soldiers.  On the contrary, as I have noted, the open material contains evidence that British citizens were involved at a high level in the terrorist networks.  In these circumstances SIAC's conclusion cannot be discounted on the speculative basis that they had somehow overlooked closed evidence to the contrary effect, which would have provided an objective basis for the distinction that the Secretary of State drew.  In my view, therefore, SIAC applied the correct approach and the conclusion which they reached was open to them on the material before them. There is no basis for an appellate court to interfere with that conclusion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;186.&nbsp;&nbsp;If, then, as SIAC concluded, the threat posed by the foreign and British suspects was comparable, one would expect that the measures strictly required to deal with the threat from all the suspects would be the same.  The fact that the foreign suspects were to be detained, while the British suspects were not, gives rise to two possible further conclusions:  either both the foreign and the British suspects should have been detained in order to avert the threat or else it was unnecessary to detain either of them for that purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;187.&nbsp;&nbsp;SIAC favoured the first of these possible conclusions since they could see powerful arguments for the view that there should be a derogation to permit detention of suspects.  They therefore held, in terms of the issue which they had reserved in para 52 of their judgment, that it was irrational to limit the detention power to foreign suspects.  Since the limitation on the power was irrational, it followed that the power could not be "strictly required" in terms of article 15(1).  It followed also that the distinction between those suspects who were detained and those who were not detained was being drawn, irrationally, on the basis, not of the threat that they posed, but of their national origin, contrary to article 14.  The derogation was therefore invalid because it failed to meet both the second and third requirements of article 15(1).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;188.&nbsp;&nbsp;The starting point for SIAC's view is that there are powerful arguments in favour of detaining both groups of suspects.  The Government's assessment is, however, that it is not necessary to detain the British suspects in order to contain the threat that they pose.  That is implicit in the entire policy that they adopted and emerges in any event from para 36 of the Home Office discussion paper on <i>Counter-Terrorism Powers:  Reconciling Security and Liberty in an Open Society </i>issued in February 2004:</p>
<p></p><ul>"While it would be possible to seek other powers to detain British citizens who may be involved in international terrorism it would be a very grave step.  The Government believes that such draconian powers would be difficult to justify."<p></p></ul>
<p>I consider it right to defer to the Government's considered judgment that it would be difficult to justify taking draconian powers to detain British suspects.  In other words, the Government believe that they could not show that the indefinite detention of British suspects was justified, and hence strictly required, in terms of article 15(1), in order to meet the threat that they pose to the life of the nation.  Starting from that premise, SIAC's conclusion, that the threats posed by the foreign and British suspects are comparable, leads to the further conclusion that the detention of the foreign suspects is not strictly required either.  That further conclusion is not affected by the theoretical distinction that the foreign suspects can end their detention at any time by leaving for another country, whereas the British suspects could not.  As the facts of the present cases demonstrate, the reality is that most of the foreign suspects who are detained cannot actually leave:  they have nowhere to go and so face remaining in detention, indefinitely, for years on end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;189.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, I have anxiously considered all the evidential and other material, as well as the arguments which the Attorney General advanced to justify the legislation.  Proceeding on the same basis as the Government and Parliament, that detention of the British suspects is not strictly required to meet the threat that they pose to the life of the nation, I have come, however, to the conclusion that the detention of the foreign suspects cannot be strictly required, either, to meet the comparable threat that they pose.  The second requirement of article 15(1) is accordingly not satisfied.  Equally, it follows that there has been a breach of article 14 and that the third of the requirements for a valid derogation under article 15(1) is not satisfied either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;190.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Attorney General presented submissions on a number of other points, including the international law position.  On these matters I respectfully agree with the conclusions reached by Lord Bingham of Cornhill in his comprehensive speech.  I would accordingly allow the appeal, hold that the power to detain foreign suspects in section 23 of the 2001 Act was not "strictly required" by the exigencies of the situation and make the order and declaration proposed by Lord Bingham.  </p>
<p><b>LORD WALKER OF GESTINGTHORPE</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;191.&nbsp;&nbsp;As all your Lordships recognise, these are very important and difficult appeals.  Your Lordships have to consider the balancing of one of the most fundamental human freedoms—freedom from imprisonment for an indefinite period, without indictment, trial or conviction on a criminal charge—with one of the state's most basic and imperative duties—the duty of safeguarding the lives and well-being of its citizens and others resident in the United Kingdom.  It is unnecessary to repeat citations as to the importance of these two principles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;192.&nbsp;&nbsp;The detention without trial of terrorist suspects is therefore a crucial instance—probably the most crucial instance of all—of the problems of reconciling individual human rights with the interests of the community, and of determining the proper functions, in this process, of different arms of government.  My noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann has recently addressed the latter topic in <i>Secretary of State for the Home Department v Rehman</i> [2003]  1 AC 153, 192-193, paras 50-54  (and also in his postscript, written after 11 September 2001, at  p 195, para 62 and in <i>R (ProLife Alliance) v British Broadcasting Corporation</i> [2004]  1 AC 185, 240, paras 74-76.  His observations are well known and I need not repeat them (see also, in <i>Rehman, </i>the observations of Lord Slynn of Hadley, at p183, para 17 and Lord Steyn, at p 187, para 31).  Safeguarding national security is (with the possible exception of some questions of macro-economic policy and allocation of resources) the area of policy in which the courts are most reluctant to question or interfere with the judgment of the executive or (a fortiori) the enacted will of the legislature.  Nevertheless the courts have a special duty to look very closely at any questionable deprivation of individual liberty.  Measures which result in the indefinite detention in a high-security prison of individuals who have not been tried for (or even charged with) any offence, and who may be innocent of any crime, plainly invite judicial scrutiny of considerable intensity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;193.&nbsp;&nbsp;This dilemma is heightened by the secrecy which necessarily attends most issues of national security.  As my noble and learned friend Lord Rodger of Earlsferry pointed out in the course of argument, a portentous but non-specific appeal to the interests of national security can be used as a cloak for arbitrary and oppressive action on the part of government.  Whether or not patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel, national security can be the last refuge of the tyrant.  It is sufficient to refer (leaving aside more recent and probably more controversial examples) to the show trial and repression which followed the Reichstag fire in Berlin and the terror associated with the show trials of Zinoviev, Bukharin and others in Moscow during the 1930s.  It is therefore important to note that in this appeal no attack is made on the good faith of the Secretary of State, or any other individual or group of individuals in the executive or legislative arms of government.  It is not suggested that the Secretary of State or any of his officials has given misleading or disingenuous reasons for their actions.  What is said is that they have asked themselves the wrong questions, and have reached irrational and disproportionate answers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;194.&nbsp;&nbsp;Another special feature of these appeals is that your Lordships are concerned with a derogation from the European Convention on Human Rights.  Article 15 (1) of the Convention provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In time of war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation any High Contracting Party may take measures derogating from its obligations under this Convention to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation, provided that such measures are not inconsistent with its other obligations under international law."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The derogation was effected by the Human Rights Act 1998 (Designated Derogation) Order 2001 (SI 2001/3644) made on 11 November 2001 and coming into force on 13 November 2001.  The terms of the derogation (set out in a schedule to the Order and repeated almost word for word in the <i>note verbale</i> sent to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe on 18 December 2001) described the public emergency as follows:</p>
<p></p><ul>"There exists a terrorist threat to the United Kingdom from persons suspected of involvement in international terrorism.  In particular, there are foreign nationals present in the United Kingdom who are suspected of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of international terrorism, of being members of organisations or groups which are so concerned or of having links with members of such organisations or groups, and who are a threat to the national security of the United Kingdom."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It then referred to the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 ("the 2001 Act") as follows:</p>
<p></p><ul>"As a result of the public emergency, provision is made in the [2001 Act], <i>inter alia</i>, for an extended power to arrest and detain a foreign national which will apply where it is intended to remove or deport the person from the United Kingdom but where removal or deportation is not for the time being possible, with the consequence that the detention would be unlawful under existing domestic law powers."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;195.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appellants and the interveners challenged the validity of the derogation on three main grounds (with a considerable degree of overlap between the second and third grounds):</p>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;that there was not in November 2001 a "public emergency threatening the life of the nation" within the meaning of  article 15;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;that the measures taken by and under the 2001 Act were not "strictly required by the exigencies of the situation";<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;that those measures were on the contrary irrational, discriminatory and disproportionate.<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first ground of challenge is a question of fact and degree which does not depend on the terms of the 2001 Act (except that by section 30 of the 2001 Act a "derogation matter", as defined in that section, can be called into question only before or on appeal from SIAC, the Special Immigration Appeals Commission).  The second and third grounds depend crucially on the terms of the 2001 Act and the factual evidence adduced before SIAC (of which your Lordships have seen the open part, but not the closed part).  There are other subsidiary grounds of challenge.  It is readily apparent that the fact that a state has decided to make a derogation from the Convention does not close the door to an examination of human rights issues.  On the contrary, it opens the door even wider, because of the need for the measures to be "strictly required by the exigencies of the situation".  Your Lordships have had the benefit of submissions in support of the appeals not only from leading counsel for the two sets of appellants but also (in writing and orally) on behalf of Liberty and (in writing only) on behalf of Amnesty International as interveners.  Every possible line of argument has been explored, with a very full citation of human rights case law and other materials.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;196.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appropriate intensity of scrutiny of decisions in this crucial area—involving both national security and individual liberty—presents a real dilemma which is fully discussed in your Lordships' speeches.  I am not sure that I can usefully add much to the views expressed by others but I will make a few brief observations.  For my part I think that in a case of this sort the court has to proceed at two different levels.  The court should show a high degree of respect for the Secretary of State's appreciation, based on secret intelligence sources, of the security risks; but at the same time the court should subject to a very close scrutiny the practical effect which derogating measures have on individual human rights, the importance of the rights affected, and the robustness of any safeguards intended to minimise the impact of the derogating measures on individual human rights.  In doing so the court must allow for the fact that it may be impossible for the intelligence services to identify the target or predict the scale of a violent attack by international terrorists (whose methods involve secrecy, deception and surprise).  The likely effects of a natural disaster (such as a hurricane or a volcanic eruption) are, within limits, more easily predictable than those of attacks by terrorists who (on the evidence) may have access to biological, chemical or even radiological or nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;197.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Strasbourg Court has in <i>Ireland v United Kingdom</i> (1978)  2 EHRR 25 approved what amounts to a precautionary approach to measures of protection against terrorist activity.  It said in its judgment, at p 95, para 214): </p>
<p></p><ul>"It is certainly not the Court's function to substitute for the British Government's assessment any other assessment of what might be the most prudent or most expedient policy to combat terrorism.  The Court must do no more than review the lawfulness, under the Convention, of the measures adopted by that Government from 9 August 1971 [the date of introduction of internment] onwards.  For this purpose the Court must arrive at its decision in the light, not of a purely retrospective examination of the efficacy of those measures, but of the conditions and circumstances reigning when they were originally taken and subsequently applied."<p></p></ul>
