<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32.&nbsp;&nbsp;The essence of the new approach was to give the statutory provision a purposive construction in order to determine the nature of the transaction to which it was intended to apply and then to decide whether the actual transaction (which might involve considering the overall effect of a number of elements intended to operate together) answered to the statutory description.  Of course this does not mean that the courts have to put their reasoning into the straitjacket of first construing the statute in the abstract and then looking at the facts.  It might be more convenient to analyse the facts and then ask whether they satisfy the requirements of the statute. But however one approaches the matter, the question is always whether the relevant provision of statute, upon its true construction, applies to the facts as found. As Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead said in <i>MacNiven v Westmoreland Investments Ltd</i> [2003]  1 AC 311, 320, para 8:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The paramount question always is one of interpretation of the particular statutory provision and its application to the facts of the case."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33.&nbsp;&nbsp;The simplicity of this question, however difficult it might be to answer on the facts of a particular case, shows that the <i>Ramsay</i> case did not introduce a new doctrine operating within the special field of revenue statutes. On the contrary, as Lord Steyn observed in <i>McGuckian</i> [1997] 1 WLR 991, 999 it rescued tax law from being "some island of literal interpretation" and brought it within generally applicable principles. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;34.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the novelty for tax lawyers of this exposure to ordinary principles of statutory construction produced a tendency to regard <i>Ramsay</i> as establishing a new jurisprudence governed by special rules of its own. This tendency has been encouraged by two features characteristic of tax law, although by no means exclusively so.  The first is that tax is generally imposed by reference to economic activities or transactions which exist, as Lord Wilberforce said, "in the real world".  The second is that a good deal of intellectual effort is devoted to structuring transactions in a form which will have the same or nearly the same economic effect as a taxable transaction but which it is hoped will fall outside the terms of the taxing statute. It is characteristic of these composite transactions that they will include elements which have been inserted without any business or commercial purpose but are intended to have the effect of removing the transaction from the scope of the charge. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;35.&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been a number of cases, such as <i>Inland Revenue v Burmah Oil Co Ltd</i> 1982  SC (HL) 114, <i>Furniss v Dawson</i> [1984]  AC 474 and <i>Carreras Group Ltd v Stamp Commissioner</i> [2004]  STC 1377 in which it has been decided that elements which have been inserted into a transaction without any business or commercial purpose did not, as the case might be, prevent the composite transaction from falling within a charge to tax or bring it within an exemption from tax. Thus in the <i>Burmah</i>  case, a series of circular payments which left the taxpayer company in exactly the same financial position as before was not regarded as giving rise to a "loss" within the meaning of the legislation. In <i>Furniss</i>, the transfer of shares to a subsidiary as part of a planned scheme immediately to transfer them to an outside purchaser was regarded as a taxable disposition to the outside purchaser rather than an exempt transfer to a group company. In <i>Carreras</i> the transfer of shares in exchange for a debenture with a view to its redemption a fortnight later was not regarded as an exempt transfer in exchange for the debenture but rather as an exchange for money. In each case the court looked at the overall effect of the composite transactions by which the taxpayer company in <i>Burmah</i> suffered no loss, the shares in <i>Furniss</i> passed into the hands of the outside purchaser and the vendors in <i>Carreras</i> received cash.  On the true construction of the relevant provisions of the statute, the elements inserted into the transactions without any commercial purpose were treated as having no significance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;36.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cases such as these gave rise to a view that, in the application of <i>any </i>taxing statute, transactions or elements of transactions which had no commercial purpose were to be disregarded.  But that is going too far. It elides the two steps which are necessary in the application of any statutory provision: first, to decide, on a purposive construction, exactly what transaction will answer to the statutory description and secondly, to decide whether the transaction in question does so. As Ribeiro PJ said in <i>Collector of Stamp Revenue v Arrowtown Assets Ltd</i> [2003]  HKCFA 46, para 35:</p>
<p></p><ul>"[T]he driving principle in the <i>Ramsay</i> line of cases continues to involve a general rule of statutory construction and an unblinkered approach to the analysis of the facts. The ultimate question is whether the relevant statutory provisions, construed purposively, were intended to apply to the transaction, viewed realistically."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;37.&nbsp;&nbsp;The need to avoid sweeping generalisations about disregarding transactions undertaken for the purpose of tax avoidance was shown by <i>MacNiven v Westmoreland Investments Ltd</i> [2003]  1 AC 311 in which the question was whether a payment of interest by a debtor who had borrowed the money for that purpose from the creditor himself and which had been made solely to reduce liability to tax, was a "payment" of interest within the meaning of the statute which entitled him to a deduction or repayment of tax.  The House decided that the purpose of requiring the interest to have been "paid" was to produce symmetry by giving a right of deduction in respect of any payment which gave rise to a liability to tax in the hands of the recipient (or would have given rise to such a liability if the recipient had been a taxable entity.)  As the payment was accepted to have had this effect, it answered the statutory description notwithstanding the circular nature of the payment and its tax avoidance purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;38.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>MacNiven</i> shows the need to focus carefully upon the particular statutory provision and to identify its requirements before one can decide whether circular payments or elements inserted  for the purpose of tax avoidance should be disregarded or treated as irrelevant for the purposes of the statute. In the speech of Lord Hoffmann in <i>MacNiven</i> it was said that if a statute laid down requirements by reference to some commercial concept such as gain or loss, it would usually follow that elements inserted into a composite transaction without any commercial purpose could be disregarded, whereas if the requirements of the statute were purely by reference to its legal nature (in <i>MacNiven</i>, the discharge of a debt) then an act having that legal effect would suffice, whatever its commercial purpose may have been.  This is not an unreasonable generalisation, indeed perhaps something of a truism, but we do not think that it was intended to provide a substitute for a close analysis of what the statute means. It certainly does not justify the assumption that an answer can be obtained by classifying all concepts <i>a priori</i> as either "commercial" or "legal". That would be the very negation of purposive construction: see Ribeiro PJ in <i>Arrowtown</i> at paras 37 and 39 and the perceptive judgment of the special commissioners (Theodore Wallace and Julian Ghosh) in <i>Campbell v Inland Revenue Commissioners</i> [2004]  STC (SCD) 396.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;39.&nbsp;&nbsp;The present case, like <i>MacNiven</i>, illustrates the need for a close analysis of what, on a purposive construction, the statute actually requires.  The object of granting the allowance is, as we have said, to provide a tax equivalent to the normal accounting deduction from profits for the depreciation of machinery and plant used for the purposes of a trade. Consistently with this purpose, section 24(1) requires that a trader should have incurred capital expenditure on the provision of machinery or plant for the purposes of his trade.  When the trade is finance leasing, this means that the capital expenditure should have been incurred to acquire the machinery or plant for the purpose of leasing it in the course of the trade.  In such a case, it is the lessor as owner who suffers the depreciation in the value of the plant and is therefore entitled to an allowance against the profits of his trade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;40.&nbsp;&nbsp;These statutory requirements, as it seems to us, are in the case of a finance lease concerned entirely with the acts and purposes of the lessor.  The Act says nothing about what the lessee should do with the purchase price, how he should find the money to pay the rent or how he should use the plant. As Carnwath LJ said in the Court of Appeal [2003] STC 66, 89, para 54:</p>
<p></p><ul>"There is nothing in the statute to suggest that 'up-front finance' for the lessee is an essential feature of the right to allowances. The test is based on the purpose of the lessor's expenditure, not the benefit of the finance to the lessee."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;41.&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as the lessor is concerned, all the requirements of section 24(1) were satisfied. Mr Boobyer, a director of BMBF, gave unchallenged evidence that from its point of view the purchase and lease back was part of its ordinary trade of finance leasing.  Indeed, if one examines the acts and purposes of BMBF, it would be very difficult to come to any other conclusion.  The finding of the special commissioners that the transaction "had no commercial reality" depends entirely upon an examination of what happened to the purchase price after BMBF paid it to BGE.  But these matters do not affect the reality of the expenditure by BMBF and its acquisition of the pipeline for the purposes of its finance leasing trade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;42.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the lessee chooses to make arrangements, even as a preordained part of the transaction for the sale and lease back, which result in the bulk of the purchase price being irrevocably committed to paying the rent, that is no concern of the lessor.  From his point of view, the transaction is exactly the same. No one disputes that BMBF had acquired ownership of the pipeline or that it generated income for BMBF in the course of its trade in the form of rent chargeable to corporation tax.  In return it paid £91m.  The circularity of payments which so impressed Park J and the special commissioners arose because BMBF, in the ordinary course its business, borrowed the money to buy the pipeline from Barclays Bank and Barclays happened to be the bank which provided the cash collateralised guarantee to BMBF for the payment of the rent.  But these were happenstances.  None of these transactions, whether circular or not, were necessary elements in creating the entitlement to the capital allowances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;43.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, which are substantially the same as those of the Court of Appeal, we would dismiss this appeal.</p>
