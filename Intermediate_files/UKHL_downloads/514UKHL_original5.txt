<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;130. The "Vicarious Liability" section goes on to refer to the manner in which exemplary damages in vicarious liability cases is dealt with in the American Restatement. </p>

<p></p><ul>"The problem has received some discussion in America although the courts are divided in the result.  The Restatement, however, comes out in favour of a compromise.  While denying vicarious liability for exemplary damages in principle, it admits such liability in four cases, that is, if, but only if:<p></p></ul>

<p></p><ul>'(a)	the principal authorised the damage and the manner of the act, or<p></p></ul>

<p></p><ul>(b)	the agent was unfit and the principal was reckless in employing him, or <p></p></ul>

<p></p><ul>(c)	the agent was employed in a managerial capacity and was acting in the scope of his capacity, or<p></p></ul>

<p></p><ul>(d)	the principal or a managerial agent of the principal ratified or approved the act.'<p></p></ul>

<p>None of these four paragraphs would cover the exemplary damages claim in the present case, nor, for that matter, in either of the two Northern Ireland cases referred to by my noble and learned friend, Lord Hutton.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;131. The objection to exemplary damages awards in vicarious liability cases seems to me to be fundamental.  The only acceptable justification of exemplary damages awards in cases falling within Lord Devlin's first category (<i>Rookes v Barnard</i> [1964] AC 1129, 1226), "oppressive, arbitrary or unconstitutional action by the servants of the Government", including police officers, is that the conduct complained of has been so outrageous as to warrant a punitive response.  As Lord Devlin said, at p 1227:  "the plaintiff cannot recover exemplary damages unless he is the victim of the punishable behaviour".  The other side of the coin is, in my opinion, equally valid:  the defendant should not be liable to pay exemplary damages unless he has committed punishable behaviour.  This principle leaves no room for an award of exemplary damages against an individual whose alleged liability is vicarious only and who has not done anything that constitutes punishable behaviour.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;132. In 1997 the Law Commission laid before Parliament a paper on Aggravated, Exemplary and Restitutionary Damages (Law Com No 247).  The paper was, by order of the House of Commons, printed on 15 December 1997.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;133. The section of the paper dealing with exemplary damages refers to some of the complications that arise in vicarious liability cases.  The paper notes, in paragraph 4.69, that "when calculating the appropriate exemplary sum, it has been laid down that the court or jury should take into account the defendant's capacity to pay" and went on in the following paragraphs to consider how this could work in a vicarious liability case:</p>

<p></p><ul>"4.69	When calculating the appropriate exemplary sum, it has been laid down that the court or jury should take into account the defendant's capacity to pay.  It would seem that either party may give evidence of the defendant's resources, but that in practice evidence of the defendant's means is rarely, if ever, adduced.<p></p></ul>

<p></p><ul>4.70	Until the recent case of <i>Thompson v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis</i> [1997] 3 WLR 403 it was unclear how this consideration should be applied in a vicarious liability case, where a plaintiff seeks to make an employer liable for the wrongful conduct of his employee.  One possibility was that any sum which an employer is liable to pay as exemplary damages could be subject to deduction on account of the employ<i>ee</i>'s lack of means.  Another, contrasting, possibility was that the means of the wrongdoing employee are irrelevant to the size of the sum which the employer is vicariously liable to pay.<p></p></ul>

<p></p><ul>4.71	In <i>Thompson v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis </i>the Court of Appeal finally endorsed the second approach.  It was said [at p 418] that where the action is brought against the chief police officer, and damages are paid on the basis of vicarious liability for the acts of his officers,<p></p></ul>

<p></p><ul>'it [is] wholly inappropriate to take into account the means of the individual officers except where the action is brought against the individual tortfeasor.'<p></p></ul>

<p></p><ul>	There seems to be no good reason why this approach should not apply generally to vicarious liability to exemplary damages."<p></p></ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;134.<i>&nbsp;Thompson v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis</i>, referred to in the Law Commission Paper, is now reported in [1998] QB 498.  The case was one in which the plaintiff, having been lawfully arrested, was subsequently assaulted and manhandled by police officers and wrongly detained in a cell for about four hours.  She claimed against the Commissioner damages for false imprisonment and malicious prosecution.  She claimed both aggravated damages and exemplary damages.  The only defendant was the Commissioner.  No argument was presented to the court that exemplary damages should not be awarded in a vicarious liability case.  So the court was entitled to proceed on the footing that exemplary damages as well as aggravated damages could be awarded.  The points taken before the court related simply to quantum.  Counsel for the Commissioner argued, at p 501, that:</p>

<p></p><ul>"The jury should be directed (1) that the [exemplary damages] award should be the minimum sum necessary to meet the underlying purpose of punishing the defendant …"<p></p></ul>

<p>But why should the Commissioner have been punished at all?  He had done nothing that merited punishment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;135. Lord Woolf MR said, at p 512:</p>

<p></p><ul>"The fact that the defendant is a chief officer of police also means that here exemplary damages should have a lesser role to play.  Even if the use of civil proceedings to punish a defendant can in some circumstances be justified it is more difficult to justify the award where the defendant and the person responsible for meeting any award is not the wrongdoer, but his 'employer'.  While it is possible that a chief constable could bear a responsibility for what has happened, due to his failure to exercise proper control, the instances when this is alleged to have occurred should not be frequent."<p></p></ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;136. I respectfully agree with the first two sentences in the above cited passage.  As to the third sentence, there is nothing in the report of the case in the Court of Appeal which indicates that any factual findings of breach of duty on the part of the Chief Constable personally were made, whether in respect of failure to exercise proper control or otherwise.  But it is possible that there were such findings.  In the absence of any finding of some personal breach of duty by the Chief Constable, there would, in my opinion, have been no basis upon which punishment, in the form of exemplary damages, could properly have been visited upon him.  The conduct meriting punishment was not his conduct but that of his officers.  It appears to me that, silently and without any proper or principled justification for it, a system of vicarious punishment of public employers for the misfeasances of their employees has crept into our civil law.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;137. In my opinion vicarious punishment, via an award of exemplary damages, is contrary to principle and should be rejected.  The plaintiff's pleaded case against the Chief Constable of Leicestershire Constabulary is a vicarious liability case and no more.  It does not, in my opinion, enable an award of exemplary damages to be made against the Chief Constable.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;138. However, the point regarding vicarious liability and exemplary damages was not the basis on which the strike-out application was made, was not dealt with in the courts below and was not addressed by counsel before your Lordships.  The views I have expressed should, therefore, be regarded as provisional and the point left for decision at a later stage in the proceedings.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;139. In the result I would, for the reasons given in paragraph 122 above, with reluctance, allow this appeal.  My reluctance is the consequence of my opinion that, on the vicarious liability point, this exemplary damages claim is bound to fail.</p>
