<p class="para">114.&nbsp;&nbsp;Total’s primary response is that the commission of a crime alone is insufficient to constitute “unlawful means” for the purposes of grounding a tortious cause of action for conspiracy. Total submits that for this purpose “unlawful means” would have to consist in conduct that was itself actionable by the Commissioners in tort (or possibly breach of contract). In the case of the payment made to Alldech, the Commissioners do allege that the cheating was accompanied by positive deceit, itself actionable by them in tort against Alldech. In response to this, Total submits, and the Court of Appeal held, that the statutory scheme of the VAT Act 1994 precludes any independent actionable remedy in tort against Alldech. </p>
<p class="para">115.&nbsp;&nbsp;The House is not concerned with an alleged conspiracy committed with the predominant intention of injuring the Commissioners. In the Court of Appeal, counsel for the Commissioners declined on instructions, for reasons which he explained to the Court, to seek to amend to plead that the conspirators’ predominant purpose was to injure the Commissioners. The House is concerned with the other branch of conspiracy depending upon an intention (although not a predominant intention) to injure by unlawful means. The existence of unlawful means is therefore critical to the Commissioners’ case. </p>
<p class="para">116.&nbsp;&nbsp;In agreement with the reasoning of Lord Walker and Lord Neuberger, I consider that the history and jurisprudence relating to this type of conspiracy point clearly to the conclusion that at least some criminal acts, not amounting to torts, may suffice to ground the tort. Lord Wright’s speech in <i>Crofter Hand Woven Harris Tweed Co. Ltd v. Veitch </i>[1942] AC 435, cited by Lord Walker, contains particularly clear support for the view that this type of conspiracy is not to be regarded as a purely secondary form of liability, limited (apart from the possibility that the wrongful means might consist of breach of contract) to duplicating liability that the conspirators would anyway have as joint tortfeasors. The decision in <i>Lonhro Ltd v. Shell Petroleum Co Ltd (No. 2) </i>[1982] AC 173 proceeded, as explained in <i>Lonhro plc v. Fayed </i>[1992] 1 AC 448, on the basis that a purely criminal act, consisting of Shell’s alleged breach of the United Kingdom’s sanctions Orders making it a criminal offence to supply oil to Rhodesia, could constitute relevant unlawful means for the purposes of the tort of conspiracy by unlawful means. The conclusion that no tort had been committed derived from the absence - admitted by counsel for Lonhro plc (p.180B-C) - of any allegation of any intention at all to injure Lonhro plc. (It was also the fact that the sanctions Orders were “not passed for the protection of any particular section of the public and [gave] rise to no special duty to [Lonhro]": see the concession at p.179B-C.)  </p>
<p class="para">117.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Lonhro plc v. Fayed</i> at pages 467A to 468H Lord Bridge Harwich, giving the leading speech with which all other members of the House agreed, quoted extensively from the judgment of Lord Denning MR in the Court of Appeal as well as from Lord Diplock’s speech in the House of Lords in <i>Lonhro Ltd v. Shell Petroleum Co Ltd (No. 2)</i> to show that what was fatal in the latter case had been the absence of any intent at all to injure; and on that basis he concluded that conspiracy by unlawful means, where there was an intention to injure the claimant, even if this was not the defendant’s predominant intention, continued to exist as an English law tort. It is also worth noting that in <i>Lonhro plc v. Fayed</i> the unlawful means alleged consisted in misleading the board of directors of the House of Fraser and the Secretary of State, in other words of torts committed at most against third parties. Yet the House accepted that the claim for conspiracy by unlawful means was arguable. </p>
<p class="para">118.&nbsp;&nbsp;Liability in conspiracy has been described as an anomaly. But it is again to be noted that in <i>Metall und Rohstoff AG v. Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Inc.</i> [1990] 1 QB 391, the Court of Appeal at p.460C-D thought that to interpret <i>Lonhro Ltd v. Shell Petroleum Co Ltd (No. 2) </i>as preventing a plaintiff from relying on a damage-causing act which was merely a breach of the criminal law but gave no right of action in tort would be to treat the House as having intended to introduce a new anomaly. It would mean that “a cause of action in conspiracy would exist where it was least needed (i.e. where the acts done pursuant to the agreement were torts, which would in themselves provide a cause of action) but not where it was most needed….". The Court of Appeal’s understanding of <i>Lonhro Ltd v. Shell Petroleum Co Ltd (No. 2) </i>in another respect (that on which its decision was overruled by <i>Lonhro plc v. Fayed</i>) does not detract from this observation. </p>
<p class="para">119.&nbsp;&nbsp;Caution is nonetheless necessary about the scope of the tort of conspiracy by unlawful means. Not every criminal act committed in order to injure can or should give rise to tortious liability to the person injured, even where the element of conspiracy is present. The pizza delivery business which obtains more custom, to the detriment of its competitors, because it instructs its drivers to ignore speed limits and jump red lights (Lord Walker in <i>OBG Ltd. v. Allan </i>[2007] UKHL 21; [2007] 2 WLR 920, para. 266) should not be liable, even if the claim be put as a claim in conspiracy involving its drivers and directors. And - as in relation to the tort of causing loss by unlawful means inflicted on a third party - there is a legitimate objection to making liability “depend upon whether the defendant has done something which is wrongful for reasons which have nothing to do with the damage inflicted on the claimant": per Lord Hoffmann in <i>OBG Ltd. v. Allan </i>at para. 59. </p>
<p class="para">120.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the same concern does not apply where, as here, the offence exists in its very nature to protect the Revenue; where its commission is necessarily, directly and intentionally targeted at and injurious to the Revenue; and where its intended result is the wrongful non-payment of VAT by Redlaw and Lockparts of statutorily recoverable VAT or the payment to Alldech of a VAT credit not properly due under the VAT Act 1994. Like others of your Lordships, I think that there would be an evident lacuna if the law did not respond to this situation by recognising a civil liability. </p>
<p class="para">121.&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be asked why the liability should only exist through the medium of a claim for unlawful means conspiracy, and not on the basis of the cheating alone. There is force in the point. It was not argued on this appeal that mere cheating of the Revenue would (without either conspiracy or the commission of another recognised tort such as deceit) give rise to liability in tort. But I would reserve my opinion about that. The assumption in the case-law recognising the common law offence of cheating the public revenue appears to have been that cheating would as between subject and subject be actionable (though actionable only) by civil action: see e.g. <i>Rex v. Bainbridge </i>(1783) 22 St. Tr. 1, 155 per Lord Mansfield CJ, cited in <i>R v. Hudson</i> [1956] 2 QB 252, 260, per Lord Goddard CJ (and 253, in counsel’s argument). I note the observations of Sales and Stilitz in <i>Intentional Infliction of Harm by Unlawful Means </i>(1999) 115 LQR 411, at pp.420-425 as well as by Lord Hoffmann and Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead in <i>OBG Ltd v. Allan</i> at paras. 61 and 161 about the possibility of civil liability in the case of deliberate infliction of harm in “two-party” situations. In practical terms, however, the possibility of the point now arising in relation to cheating the public revenue must be negligible, having regard to the statutory scheme of civil liability arising under the VAT and other taxing statutes. The statutory scheme would in a two-party situation be likely to supersede any tortious liability: see further below. </p>
<p class="para">122.&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming that cheating the public revenue is not, even apart from the statutory scheme of the VAT and other taxing statutes, itself tortious in the absence of some other recognised tort such as deceit, the fact of conspiracy in my opinion offers a sufficient justification for recognising tortious responsibility in the present context, as it does in cases of predominant purpose to injury. The present appeal illustrates the extent to which cheating the revenue is a crime likely to be facilitated by a combination of conspirators. A devious individual or entity might - possibly - achieve the same result by himself or itself, but would be a great deal less likely to try or succeed.  </p>
<p class="para">123.&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavy reliance was placed by Total on <i>OBG Ltd. v. Allan</i> [2007] UKHL 21. In that case, the House considered and distinguished the accessory or secondary liability which exists under the principle in <i>Lumley v. Gye </i>(1853) 2 E &amp; B 216, where C induces B to break B’s contract with A, and the primary liability which exists under the tort of causing loss to a person (A) by unlawful means where C commits acts (including the threat to do acts) against B which are  actionable by B or would be if B had suffered loss and which affect B’s freedom to deal with A (see paras. 49, 51, 129 and 136, per Lord Hoffmann). The majority of the House in <i>OBG </i>held the actionability (or potential actionability) of C’s acts against B to be a pre-requisite to A having a claim in tort against C for causing loss by unlawful means. The submission made to the House on this appeal is that the House should adopt the same view of unlawful means in the context of the tort of conspiracy to injure. The submission has on its face attraction, as I have myself said in <i>Grupo Torras SA v Al-Sabah</i> [1999] CLC 1,469, 1,649 (though in support of an analysis according to which actionability at the suit of the plaintiff was <i>not</i> necessary). But another view has been suggested at the highest level (<i>Rookes v Barnard</i> [1964] AC 1129, 1210-1211 per Lord Devlin), and, on reflection, there can be danger in what Lord Goff of Chieveley called “the temptation of elegance” (<i>Henderson v. Merrett Syndicates Ltd </i>[1995] 2 AC 145, 186B-C). The two torts are different in their nature, and the interests of justice may require their development on somewhat different bases.</p>
<p class="para">124.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Hope (in para. 43) and Lord Neuberger (in para. 223) note that Lord Hoffmann at para. 61 in <i>OBG</i>, in “defining the tort of causing loss by unlawful means as a tort which requires interference with the actions of a third party in relation to the plaintiff", made clear that “a case of ‘two party intimidation’ raises altogether different issues". In relation to the three-party tort of causing loss by unlawful means, Lord Hoffmann’s criticism of the Court of Appeal’s reasoning in <i>OBG</i> was that it first expanded the concept of “unlawful means", and then sought to counteract the width of the concept “by insisting upon a highly specific intention, which ‘targets’ the plaintiff"; this, he considered, “places too much strain on the concept of intention” (paras.60 and 135). That problem does not to my mind arise with anything like the same force in the present context. I accept that conspiracy can be categorised as a three- rather than two-party tort, in that liability depends on at least two persons joining together to injure another: see also Hazel Carty in <i>An Analysis of the Economic Torts</i> at e.g. pp.271 and 278. Nevertheless, there is in my view a distinction between the infliction of harm through the intermediary of a third party (as in the case of the tort of causing harm by unlawful means under consideration in <i>OBG Ltd. v. Allan</i>) and the present situation where two wrongdoers join and act together to inflict injury directly upon another person or body; and to do so, moreover, by committing an offence integrally related to the Revenue and recognised specifically to protect it from such injury. This in turn assists to delimit the liability for conspiracy by unlawful means which the House is recognising by its present decision.</p>
<p class="para">125.&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as the Commissioners’ claim relates of the VAT credit paid to Alldech, I would only add that the Commissioners ought on any view to succeed on issue (b). It matters not if the Commissioners’ only remedy to recover the VAT credit as against Alldech (as opposed to other conspirators responsible for the deceit) is under s.73(2) of the VAT Act 1994. The wrongful extraction of the money from the Commissioners by deceit involved unlawful means and a sufficiently actionable wrong to justify a civil claim in conspiracy.</p>
<p class="para">126.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore answer affirmatively issue (b) identified in paragraph 112 above. This brings me to the issue on which my opinion proves critical to the outcome of this appeal. It is a curious feature that the appeal was in terms brought only on part (i) of issue (a), that is the Bill of Rights point. Part (ii), the inconsistent statutory scheme point, was taken below, but not in either the cross-notice of appeal or the statement of issues. Total’s case only mentions the statutory scheme as a background factor to its submissions on issue (b) and to the Bill of Rights. Even during oral argument before the House, Mr Charles Flint QC for Total did no more than say that issue (a) could also be put on a pure “ultra vires/statutory” basis, but that article 4 of the Bill of Rights was how they had formulated it. However, as all aspects of issue (a) involve pure questions of law and raise questions of general importance, I agree that they need deciding. </p>
<p class="para">127.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Hope and Lord Neuberger have helpfully analysed the detailed provisions of the VAT Act 1994. The Act was of course passed in the context of the Sixth VAT Directive 77/388, but it has not been suggested by counsel that the Directive contains anything presently material. I agree with Lord Scott (para. 59) and Lord Neuberger (paras. 168-172) in rejecting Total’s submission that the Commissioners’ claim infringes article 4 of the Bill of Rights (issue (a) part (i)). For the reasons they give the Commissioners’ claim is a damages claim for being wrongfully cheated of monies or revenue with the management or collection of which the Commissioners were entrusted, rather than a claim to levy money for or to the use of the Crown within the meaning of article 4. The Commissioners are claiming damages against a conspirator (Total) whose wrongdoing either prevented the recovery of tax which was due under Parliamentary authority (from Redlaw and Lockparts) or led to the Commissioners mistakenly paying (to Alldech) a VAT credit which was not due and which is in law recoverable under Parliamentary authority (from Alldech). In short, although the claim is against Total, it is a claim aimed at the recovery of damages to uphold, not to extend, the tax system. Such a claim is in my view outside the language and mischief of article 4. Article 4 aims to prevent the levying of taxation for which there is no Parliamentary authority, not the recovery of compensation for wrongdoing causing the loss of monies belonging or due to the Commissioners.</p>
<p class="para">128.&nbsp;&nbsp;The statutory scheme point (issue (a) part (ii)) is, self-evidently in view of the division in the House, more difficult. Lord Neuberger identifies and examines various aspects of the point: the Commissioners’ functions, the remedial rights given to them and the procedural and other stipulations relating to such rights. Some of his reasoning in relation to the Commissioners’ functions echoes Mr Flint’s reference to vires. But for my part, I do not find vires a problem. First, no question of vires in a strict sense has ever been raised. The most that was argued below or touched on in the House is the suggestion that the statutory scheme excludes the ordinary common law rights that the Commissioners would otherwise have in respect of Total’s alleged conduct. Second, the Commissioners had, in the language which applied until 2005, “the care and management” of VAT (sched. 11, para. 1(1) to the 1994 Act). They were charged with “the duty of collecting and accounting for, and otherwise managing, the revenues of customs and excise” (s. 6(2) of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979). If, as their alternative case involves, their loss consists in paying out in respect of a false claim to a VAT credit, that involves loss of money under their direct management. Lord Neuberger accepts (at para. 184) that the Commissioners could bring tortious claims for theft of monies in their possession. Wrongful abstraction of monies as a result of a successful deceit or conspiracy seems no different in principle. And if, as their primary case involves, the Commissioners’ loss is their inability, as a result of the conspiracy, to recover VAT due from the missing traders, the recovery of such loss seems to me also to fall within the scope of their competence. I see no reason why it should be outside the Commissioners’ competence, if the statutory scheme otherwise permits, to take common law action in respect of a successful conspiracy which abstracts monies en route to the Commissioners or which prevents the Commissioners from recovering from others what is due from such others to the Commissioners. It is in my view neither wrong nor artificial to describe the Commissioners as having suffered loss or as seeking compensation, in whichever way their case is put; and I see no incongruity in their and the public’s interests being in this respect protected by a common law action for conspiracy. Again, the claim is not for the VAT due or for repayment of the VAT credit, it is for damages in respect of loss suffered by the Commissioners due to a successful conspiracy to manipulate the VAT system. </p>
<p class="para">129.&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision in <i>Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Goldblatt </i>[1972] Ch 498 is in my opinion of interest, even though, and to some degree because it was taken for granted that the Commissioners were entitled to pursue private law remedies to recoup loss which they had suffered through the receivers’ and/or debenture holder’s failure to pay tax out of monies available for the purpose. Goff J accepted that the Commissioners could bring both a misfeasance claim for breach by a receiver and/or debenture holder of the statutory duty to pay the revenue preferentially (pp.505B-C, 506E and 506G-507C), and claim in equity on the footing of constructive trusteeship (pp.507G-508A). Goff J based his decision on each of these grounds, and the existence of the latter as well as the former appears to me to strengthen, rather than weaken, the significance of the case. A claim for breach of a statutory duty specifically designed to protect preferential creditors such as the Commissioners might be argued to fall into a different category to the Commissioners’ present claim to invoke the common law tort of conspiracy. Nonetheless, a claim on this basis enables the Commissioners to recover compensation for wrongdoing causing a loss of tax due to them. In that respect, it mirrors the Commissioners’ present claim. A claim in equity on the footing of constructive trust cannot on any view be distinguished as belonging to some special category associated with breach of statutory duty.</p>
<p class="para">130.&nbsp;&nbsp;The critical question, in my view, is whether the statutory scheme supersedes and displaces the common law rights and remedies which the Commissioners would otherwise have: see <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Group plc v. Inland Revenue Commissioners </i>[2006] UKHL 49, [2007] 1 AC 558, per Lord Walker at para. 135. For this to be the case, it seems to me that the statute must positively be shown to be inconsistent with the continuation of the ordinary common law remedy otherwise available, and further that this must be shown to be the case as against the particular defendant. In support of the passage cited above, Lord Walker referred to two cases where an exclusive scheme would have been “set at nought” or “defeated” if a common law claim had been permitted. In <i>Marcic v. Thames Water Utilities Ltd. </i>[2003] UKHL 66; [2004] 2 AC 42, the statutory scheme for ensuring that water undertakers performed their statutory duties appropriately would have been set at nought if a common law claim for damages in nuisance had been possible; and in <i>Autologic Holdings plc v. Inland Revenue Commissioners </i>[2004] UKHL 54; [2006] 1 AC 118, the majority in this House held that, at least where the time limit for use of the statutory scheme had not expired, a taxpayer’s only way of challenging a taxing provision as contrary to European law was by making use of the statutory tribunal scheme, as opposed to judicial review. In contrast, in <i>Woolwich Equitable Building Society v. Inland Revenue Commissioners</i> [1993] AC 70, also cited by Lord Walker, there had been no lawful assessment, it was not therefore possible  to seek a remedy through the statutory scheme (which “where applicable, overlaid and replaced the common law principles”) and so a common law claim for restitution could lie: per Lord Goff of Chieveley at pp.168G-170D, esp. at p.169H-170B. The case of <i>Johnson v. Unisys Ltd. </i>[2003] 1 AC 518 falls in my opinion into the same category. The claimant was contending for a common law remedy covering the same ground as the statutory right available to him under the Employment Rights Act 1996 through the Employment Tribunal system, and it was held that it would have been contrary to Parliament’s intention to recognise such a remedy: per Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead at para. 2 and Lord Hoffmann at paras 58-59.</p>
<p class="para">131.&nbsp;&nbsp;As against any taxable person, including in the present case Redlaw, Lockparts and Alldech, the legislation provides direct remedies for the recovery of any VAT due as well as of any sums paid as a VAT credit which ought not to have been so paid: cf para. 5 of sched. 11 to the VAT Act 1994 and s.73(2). In each case, as I read the statute, the Commissioners could only pursue the person concerned in respect of VAT due from or a VAT credit paid to him, her or it.</p>
<p class="para">132.&nbsp;&nbsp;S.77A, introduced only with effect from 10th April 2003 by the Finance Act 2003 and so not applicable at the times relevant to this appeal, contains a major extension, by creating potentially joint and several liability for unpaid VAT on the part of any taxable person who, at the time a supply was made to such person, “knew or had reasonable grounds to suspect that some or all of the VAT payable in respect of that supply, or on any previous or subsequent supply of those goods, would go unpaid” (s.77A(2)). The permissibility and validity of that extension under article 21(3) of the Sixth Directive were upheld by the European Court of Justice in <i>Commissioners of Customs and Excise v. Federation of Technological Industries </i>Case C-384/04; [2006] 3 CMLR 11. But, even s.77A would not have created a liability for VAT on the part of Total, which was not a taxable person. The possibility that article 21(3) might have permitted the United Kingdom to go further than it did in s.77A, by imposing liability for VAT on an otherwise non-taxable overseas company such as Total, was not raised or explored before the House. It may be the case that this would not be possible. But, assuming for the moment that it would, it did not happen. Nothing in the language of article 21(3) of the Sixth Directive seems to me (or was suggested by Mr Flint QC before the House) to exclude, or preclude the pursuit by the Commissioners of, any ordinary civil remedy that would otherwise be available to them against a third party for tortiously causing the Commissioners a loss of VAT or a loss by way of payment of a VAT credit. </p>
<p class="para">133.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the statutory scheme, I would accept as correct the Court of Appeal’s answer to the third question before it, namely that the Commissioners cannot pursue an independent actionable remedy (outside the statute) against Alldech. But the issue on the present appeal is whether the Commissioners can pursue such a remedy against Total. It was not, as I understand it, suggested, nor would it in my view be correct to suggest, that the Commissioners’ inability in law to pursue anything but a statutory remedies against Alldech (or any other of the United Kingdom companies in the chain) means that they cannot still pursue Total for the conspiracy to which it is alleged that all were in fact party. </p>
<p class="para">134.&nbsp;&nbsp;No statutory remedy to recover VAT or repayment of a VAT credit from Total has been identified as available to the Commissioners in this respect. Total happens to be a company in the chain of suppliers and purchasers involved in the present alleged “carousel” fraud, and it is its overseas status and the fact that it is not a taxable person that takes it outside the statutory scheme. But the claim for conspiracy does not depend upon its membership of the chain of suppliers and purchasers or its overseas status. It is quite possible to conceive of other conspirators here or abroad, including financial and legal advisers, involved in the conception, preparation and implementation of a carousel fraud, who would themselves have no liability under the statutory scheme for VAT or its repayment (except perhaps criminal liability under e.g. s.72, which I address below). </p>
<p class="para">135.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, I think, on the statutory scheme of liability for VAT and the repayment of VAT paid that attention should primarily be focused when considering whether a separate common law claim for being cheated by a conspiracy out of VAT can be pursued. A penalty is a sanction, and differs in nature from compensation for loss. But, when one does look at the penalty provisions which the VAT Act 1994 also contains, they also do not apply to Total. S.60 in particular is, as I read it, concerned with evasion of VAT by the person liable to the VAT or claiming a credit or refund. S.61 provides a minor qualification to this, by allowing a penalty to be imposed on a director or managing officer of a body corporate liable to a penalty under s.60. Neither the liability for VAT which the VAT Act 1994 imposes on taxable and some other persons, nor the potential liability to a penalty or criminal offences which it also imposes on certain persons, including some who are not themselves taxable persons under the Act, seem to me reasons for treating the Act as excluding or precluding the exercise of ordinary civil remedies against non-taxable persons like Total against whom the Act provides no parallel statutory remedy. </p>
