<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76.&nbsp;&nbsp;In deciding between these three possible outcomes your Lordships must clearly be guided to a large degree by the Strasbourg case law on article 3.  It would not be appropriate for this House to interpret the scope of Convention protection in this sort of case significantly more generously than does the European Court of Human Rights itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77.&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 3 of the Convention provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This case has nothing to do with torture or punishment.  The question for present purposes is whether deporting the appellant in the circumstances outlined would be subjecting her to inhuman or degrading treatment.  I shall refer to such treatment generically as article 3 ill-treatment: it seems unhelpful in a case like this to attempt any sub-classification although the Strasbourg jurisprudence sometimes suggests it—see, for example, <i>Pretty v United Kingdom </i>(2002)  35 EHRR 403 at para 52.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78.&nbsp;&nbsp;One's starting point in this case must inevitably be the decision of the E Ct HR in <i>D v UK</i> (1997) 24 EHRR 423.  The facts of <i>D</i> were very extreme.  D was arrested in possession of cocaine on his arrival in the UK from St Kitts in January 1993.  Following conviction and imprisonment he was released on licence in January 1996 and placed in immigration detention pending removal back to St Kitts.  During his term of imprisonment, however, he had been diagnosed HIV positive and he sought to remain on compassionate grounds.  Despite treatment his HIV infection worsened and in January 1997 he was transferred to an AIDS hospice.  At the beginning of February 1997 there was a sudden deterioration in his condition and he had to be transferred to hospital.  At the time of the hearing of his application before the E Ct HR on 20 February 1997 it was said that his life was drawing to a close.  He had received counselling and was psychologically prepared for death in the UK environment in which he was being looked after.  If he were returned to St Kitts, where the population was beset with health and sanitation problems, there was nothing to show that he would receive any moral or social support or even that he would be guaranteed a bed in either of the hospitals on the Island which cared for AIDS patients.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court's judgment on D's article 3 complaint constitutes the essential framework within which all subsequent case law in this area, and indeed the present appeal, falls to be considered and I propose, therefore, to set it out at some length:</p>
<p></p><ul>"46&nbsp;&nbsp;The court recalls at the outset that Contracting States have the right, as a matter of well-established international law and subject to their treaty obligations including the Convention, to control the entry, residence and expulsion of aliens.  It also notes the gravity of the offence which was committed by the applicant and is acutely aware of the problems confronting Contracting States in their efforts to combat the harm caused to their societies through the supply of drugs from abroad.  The administration of severe sanctions to persons involved in drug trafficking, including expulsion of alien drug couriers like the applicant, is a justified response to this scourge.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>47.&nbsp;&nbsp;However in exercising their right to expel such aliens Contracting States must have regard to article 3 of the convention which enshrines one of the fundamental values of democratic societies.  It is precisely for this reason that the court has repeatedly stressed in its line of authorities involving extradition, expulsion or deportation of individuals to third countries that article 3 prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and that its guarantees apply irrespective of the reprehensible nature of the conduct of the person in question.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>48.&nbsp;&nbsp; … It is for the respondent State therefore to secure to the applicant the rights guaranteed under article 3 irrespective of the gravity of the offence which he committed.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>49.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that this principle has so far been applied by the court in contexts in which the risk to the individual of being subjected to any of the proscribed forms of treatment emanates from intentionally inflicted acts of the public authorities in the receiving country or from those of non-State bodies in that country when the authorities there are unable to afford him appropriate protection.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Aside from these situations and given the fundamental importance of article 3 in the Convention system, the court must reserve to itself sufficient flexibility to address the application of that article in other contexts which might arise.  It is not therefore prevented from scrutinising an applicant's claim under article 3 where the source of the risk of proscribed treatment in the receiving country stems from factors which cannot engage either directly or indirectly the responsibility of the public authorities of that country, or which, taken alone, do not in themselves infringe the standards of that article.  To limit the application of article 3 in this manner would be to undermine the absolute character of its protection.  In any such contexts, however, the court must subject all the circumstances surrounding the case to a rigorous scrutiny, especially the applicant's personal situation in the expelling State.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>50.&nbsp;&nbsp;Against this background the court will determine whether there is a real risk that the applicant's removal would be contrary to the standards of article 3 in view of his present medical condition.  In so doing the court will assess the risk in the light of the material before it at the time of its consideration of the case, including the most recent information on his state of health.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>51.&nbsp;&nbsp;The court notes that the applicant is in the advanced states of a terminal and incurable illness.  At the date of the hearing, it was observed that there had been a marked decline in his condition and he had to be transferred to a hospital.  His condition was giving rise to concern.  The limited quality of life he now enjoys results from the availability of sophisticated treatment and medication in the United Kingdom and the care and kindness administered by a charitable organisation.  He has been counselled on how to approach death and has formed bonds with his carers.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>52.&nbsp;&nbsp;The abrupt withdrawal of these facilities will entail the most dramatic consequences for him.  It is not disputed that his removal will hasten his death.  There is a serious danger that the conditions of adversity which await him in St Kitts will further reduce his already limited life expectancy and subject him to acute mental and physical suffering.  Any medical treatment which he might hope to receive there could not contend with the infections which he may possibly contract on account of his lack of shelter and of a proper diet as well as exposure to the health and sanitation problems which beset the population of St Kitts.  While he may have a cousin in St Kitts no evidence has been adduced to show whether this person would be willing to or capable of attending to the needs of a terminally ill man.  There is no evidence of any other form of moral or social support.  Nor has it been shown whether the applicant would be guaranteed a bed in either of the hospitals on the island which, according to the Government, care for AIDS patients.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>53.&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of these exceptional circumstances and bearing in mind the critical stage now reached in the applicant's fatal illness, the implementation of the decision to remove him to St Kitts would amount to inhuman treatment by the respondent State in violation of article 3.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>The court also notes in this respect that the respondent State has assumed responsibility for treating the applicant's condition since August 1994.  He has become reliant on the medical and palliative care which he is at present receiving and is no doubt psychologically prepared for death in an environment which is both familiar and compassionate.  Although it cannot be said that the conditions which would confront him in the receiving country are themselves a breach of the standards of article 3, his removal would expose him to a real risk of dying under most distressing circumstances and would thus amount to inhuman treatment.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Without calling into question the good faith of the undertaking given to the court by the Government, it is to be noted that the above considerations must be seen as wider in scope than the question whether or not the applicant is fit to travel back to St Kitts.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>54.&nbsp;&nbsp;Against this background the court emphasises that aliens who have served their prison sentences and are subject to expulsion cannot in principle claim any entitlement to remain on the territory of a Contracting State in order to continue to benefit from medical, social or other forms of assistance provided by the expelling State during their stay in prison.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>However, in the very exceptional circumstances of this case and given the compelling humanitarian considerations at stake, it must be concluded that the implementation of the decision to remove the applicant would be a violation of article 3.<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court's judgment in <i>D</i> supports the following propositions at least:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 3 enshrines one of the fundamental values of democratic societies and constitutes an absolute prohibition on article 3 ill-treatment irrespective of how reprehensibly the applicant may have behaved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding that ordinarily a state is entitled to  extradite, expel or deport aliens, whether to honour extradition treaties, combat crime, safeguard its own population, or more generally in the interests of immigration control, the exercise of such a power may itself in certain circumstances constitute article 3 ill-treatment.  This will be so if the applicant would be at substantial risk of article 3 ill-treatment in the receiving country (a proposition previously established by the Court in cases such as <i>Soering v United Kingdom</i> (1989)  11 EHRR 439 and <i>Chahal v United Kingdom</i> (1997)  23 EHRR 413) or even exceptionally (as on the facts of <i>D</i> itself) if the applicant's removal would sufficiently exacerbate the suffering flowing from a naturally occurring illness (see for this formulation of the nature of the violation, <i>Pretty</i> at para 52).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3)&nbsp;&nbsp;In this latter exceptional class of case the Court will assess whether the applicant's removal is itself properly to be characterised as article 3 ill-treatment in the light of the applicant's present medical condition.  The mere fact that the applicant is fit to travel, however, is not of itself sufficient to preclude his removal being characterised as article 3 ill-treatment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4)&nbsp;&nbsp;An alien otherwise subject to removal cannot in principle claim any entitlement to remain in order to benefit from continuing medical, social or other assistance available in the contracting state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing could be plainer than that the Court itself regarded <i>D</i> as a highly exceptional case.  Paragraph 53 of its judgment speaks of "these exceptional circumstances", paragraph 54 of "the very exceptional circumstances of this case".  These circumstances included that the applicant was "in the advanced states of a terminal and incurable illness" (para 51); that "the abrupt withdrawal of these [medical, caring and counselling] facilities will entail the most dramatic consequences for him" (para 52); that he was "psychologically prepared for death in an environment which is both familiar and compassionate" (para 53), and that there were "compelling humanitarian considerations at stake" (para 54).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is instructive to note how the court in later cases came to characterise the decision in <i>D</i>.  In <i>Bensaid v United Kingdom</i> (2001)  33 EHRR 10 (a case of psychotic illness rather than AIDS) the Court referred to "the exceptional circumstances of the <i>D</i> case where the applicant was in the final stage of a terminal illness, AIDS, and had no prospect of medical care or family support on expulsion to St Kitts".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Henao v The Netherlands </i> (App No 13669/03, 24 June 2003) the court contrasted the position of that applicant, an AIDS sufferer, with D (and with the applicant in <i>BB v France</i>—a case held admissible by the Commission (App No 39030/96) but, following the French Government's agreement not after all to remove the applicant, not then adjudicated upon by the Court because it saw "no reason of public policy to proceed with the case [since in <i>D</i>] the Court [had already] explained the nature and extent of the obligations under the Convention": (para 39 of the Court's judgment of 7 September 1998, Reports 1998-VI, p2595)):</p>
<p></p><ul>"unlike the situation in the above-cited case of <i>D v United Kingdom</i> or in the case of <i>BB v France …</i>, it does not appear that the applicant's illness has attained an advanced or terminal stage, or that he has no prospect of medical care or family support in his country of origin.  The fact that the applicant's circumstances in Colombia would be less favourable than those he enjoys in the Netherlands cannot be regarded as decisive from the point of view of article 3 of the Convention."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84.&nbsp;&nbsp;The application in <i>Henao</i> was accordingly held inadmissible.  So too, for identical reasons, were the applications in each of the succeeding two cases: <i>Ndangoya v Sweden</i> (App No 17868/03, 22 June 2004) and <i>Amegnigan v The Netherlands</i> (App No 25629/04, 25 November 2004)—identical, that is, save that the applicant in <i>Ndangoya</i> was to be returned from Sweden to Tanzania; in <i>Amegnigan</i> from The Netherlands to Togo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85.&nbsp;&nbsp;In stating in all three of these cases that "it does not appear that the applicant . . . has no prospect of medical care or family support" in his own country, the Court was very far from saying that the applicant was likely to be able to access and afford treatment and support remotely comparable to that enjoyed in the contracting state.  On the contrary, the evidence before the Court suggested that in reality this was unlikely.  The Court found only that "the required treatment is in principle available in Colombia, where the applicant's father and six siblings reside" (<i>Henao </i>p8); "adequate treatment is available in Tanzania, albeit at a considerable cost . . . the applicant is in principle at liberty to settle at a place where medical treatment is available . . . it is clear that he has many siblings in the country.  It therefore appears that the family links have not been completely severed and that, consequently, the applicant would not be unable to seek the support of his relatives upon return to Tanzania" (<i>Ndangoya</i> pp12/13); "adequate treatment is in principle available in Togo, albeit at a possibly considerable cost. . . . His mother and a younger brother are residing [in Togo]" (<i>Amegnigan</i> p9).  (It is convenient to note at this stage that Uganda is said to be one of the most advanced African countries in the treatment of AIDS and that, although the appellant has lost five of her siblings to HIV-related illnesses and would herself clearly have the very greatest difficulty in accessing and paying for the necessary treatment, she has some 10 or 12 relatives still living in Uganda.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86.&nbsp;&nbsp;The unmistakable conclusion to be drawn from this series of recent decisions is that the Court has adopted the clear stance that article 3 is not breached by the return of an AIDS sufferer to his or her home country save in circumstances closely comparable to those in <i>D</i> itself.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not perhaps surprising.  <i>D</i> represented, as Laws LJ below observed, "an extension of an extension to the article 3 obligation".  The Court in <i>Bensaid</i> (para 40) spoke of "the high threshold set by article 3, particularly where the case does not concern the direct responsibility of the Contracting State for the infliction of harm".  The threshold must if anything be higher still where the Contracting State not only has no direct responsibility for the infliction of harm but rather is contemplating a decision falling at the very opposite end of the spectrum from those article 3 cases which involve State-sponsored violence.  It was in <i>Limbuela v Secretary of State</i> [2004]  QB 1440 (a case involving the refusal of asylum support) that Laws LJ suggested the metaphor of a spectrum and he later carried the analysis further in <i>Gezer v Secretary of State for the Home Department</i> [2004]  EWCA Civ 1730  (where an asylum seeker was challenging his dispersal to Glasgow). <i>Gezer,</i> particularly at paras 24-29, usefully explores the categories and sub-categories of article 3 cases falling within the spectrum and also the kind of action required in any given case to exonerate the State from liability under article 3, action which reflects but is not identical with the distinction between the different categories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although, as Laws LJ in <i>Gezer </i>rightly observes, the utility of the distinction between a negative obligation not to inflict article 3 ill-treatment and a positive obligation to take steps to protect persons from forms of suffering sufficiently grave to engage article 3 (positive obligations being intrinsically less absolute in character) is limited and capable of giving rise to sterile argument, it is in my judgment essential, in a case like the present, to look at the problem in the round and to recognise that it is indeed positive obligations for which the appellant here must necessarily be contending.  It is quite unreal to treat this article 3 complaint for all the world as if all that is required to safeguard the appellant's health is that the State refrain from deporting her.  Realistically what she seeks is continuing treatment for her condition and it is necessarily implicit in her case that the State is bound to provide it.  There would simply be no point in not deporting her unless her treatment here were to continue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89.&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the second colloquy on the European Convention on Human Rights and the protection of refugees, asylum-seekers and displaced persons, held at Strasbourg in May 2000, and in particular the keynote presentation made by Mr Lorenzen, a judge at the E Ct HR.  Under the heading "Cases where there is a lack of adequate medical treatment" Mr Lorenzen stated that the leading case was <i>D,</i> that "the difficulty was to determine what was to be understood by 'very exceptional circumstances'", that "it was too early to say whether the Court would take a restrictive line or whether it would be willing to adopt a more liberal line", that the position remained unclear following <i>BB v France, Tatete v Switzerland </i> (App No 41874/98) and <i>SCC v Sweden</i> (App No 46553/99); that "it was therefore necessary to await the outcome of the pending cases in order to have a better picture", and that:</p>
<p></p><ul>"this type of case presented a challenge to the court, which was not easily solved.  On the one hand, no one could reasonably deny that compelling humanitarian considerations demanded that persons suffering from serious diseases should be given appropriate treatment that was unavailable in their country of origin.  The protection under article 3 was consistently held to be absolute in the case law of the Court: those in need of it were entitled to it despite individual circumstances, such as, for example the fact that the applicant's stay in the host country was short.  On the other hand, the consequences of granting an absolute right for seriously ill persons to remain in the host country to get treatment, provided they had managed to set foot there, were very far reaching."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90.&nbsp;&nbsp;As already indicated, my clear understanding of the subsequent Strasbourg case law is that the Court has now adopted "a restrictive line".  It has not been prepared to grant "an absolute right for seriously ill persons to remain in the host country to get treatment, provided they had managed to set foot there."  The "very far-reaching" consequences of such a right would give rise to positive obligations which the Court has not thought it right to impose upon the Contracting States.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not pretend to find the precise reasoning by which the Court has come to its conclusion entirely convincing or satisfactory.  The contrasts which the Court has struck between <i>D</i> and the recent cases are, as I have already shown, first that <i>D's</i> illness had attained its terminal stage and secondly that <i>D</i>, unlike the later applicants, had no prospect of medical care or family support on return home.  It is perhaps not, however, self-evidently more inhuman to deport someone who is facing imminent death than someone whose life expectancy would thereby be reduced from decades to a year or so.  Nor, as already suggested, has there generally been a sound evidential basis for supposing that much if anything in the way of medical care or family support would be available to the applicants on return.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92.&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is that the medicine has developed hugely since <i>D</i> and that a quite different problem now presents itself from that presented by <i>D</i>.  The choice now is between allowing the patient to remain in the host state to enjoy decades of healthy life at the expense of that state—an expense both in terms of the cost of continuing treatment (the medication itself being said by the Intervener to cost some £7,000 per annum) and any associated welfare benefits, and also in terms of immigration control and the likely impact of such a ruling upon other foreign AIDS sufferers aspiring to these benefits—and deporting the patient to a life of rapidly declining health leading to a comparatively early death.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93.&nbsp;&nbsp;The logical distinction between the two very different scenarios presented respectively by <i>D</i> and the later cases is surely this.  <i>D</i> appeared to be close to death; paragraph 21 of the Court's judgment there records that at the hearing on 20 February 1997: "according to his counsel, it would appear that the applicant's life was drawing to a close much as the experts had predicted" (a medical report of June 1996 having stated that D's prognosis was limited to 8-12 months).  The critical question there was accordingly where and in what circumstances <i>D</i> should die rather than where he should live and be treated.  <i>D</i> really did concern what was principally a negative obligation, not to deport <i>D</i> to an imminent, lonely and distressing end.  Not so the more recent cases including the present one.  Given the enormous advances in medicine, the focus now is rather on the length and quality of the applicant's life than the particular circumstances of his or her death.  In these cases, therefore, the real question is whether the State is under a positive obligation to continue treatment on a long-term basis.  It is precisely in this type of case that the Court's statement in <i>D</i> (para 54), that those subject to removal "cannot in principle claim any entitlement to remain on the territory of a Contracting State in order to continue to benefit from medical, social or other forms of assistance provided by the expelling state", has particular application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94.&nbsp;&nbsp;What then must be established to bring a case of this nature within the category of very exceptional cases represented by <i>D</i>? I am content to adopt the test stated by my noble and learned friend, Lord Hope of Craighead: it must be shown that the applicant's medical condition has reached such a critical state, that there are compelling humanitarian grounds for not removing him or her to a place which lacks the medical and social services which he or she would need to prevent acute suffering.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that test satisfied here?  Much though I would prefer not to have to make this decision, I for my part feel driven to answer no to this question.  This was, of course, the answer given by the majority below (consistently with earlier Court of Appeal decisions on the point—see in particular <i>K v Secretary of State for the Home Department</i> [2001]  Imm AR 11)—and, although Carnwath LJ dissented, he did so only on the basis that the decision might be affected by a fuller factual examination.  Altogether more importantly, however, this is the answer which, as I have sought to demonstrate, all the recent Strasbourg case law clearly suggests the E Ct HR would now give to these questions and, as I began by saying, this House ought largely to be guided by the jurisprudence of that Court.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96.&nbsp;&nbsp;I set out in paragraph 75 above the three conclusions now open to your Lordships.  It is tempting to hold (as Carnwath LJ below was inclined to hold) that all these AIDS cases are fact sensitive and that the matter should now therefore be remitted for further consideration by the IAT (or the adjudicator) as the appropriate fact-finding body with regard to judgments of this kind.  I conclude, however, that this temptation should be resisted: this is, after all, in all its essentials, a paradigm case which inevitably will be widely replicated and which is realistically indistinguishable from the recent line of Strasbourg cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97.&nbsp;&nbsp;True, there are circumstances in the present case which induce particular sympathy for this appellant, perhaps beyond the extreme sympathy one inevitably feels for anyone in her position.  Not least amongst these are the length of her stay in this country and the excellence of her recovery.  But is it really to be said that a different conclusion might have been reached had her case fallen for decision after only four years, or two years, or 6 months or immediately on her arrival?  Surely not.  The moral quandary remains the same.  Why should article 3 be engaged here but not had the UK succeeded in denying the appellant entry in the first place (she arrived on a false passport) or managed to deport her much earlier?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98.&nbsp;&nbsp;From all this it follows that, substantially for the same reasons as those given by Lord Hope, I too would dismiss this appeal.</p>
