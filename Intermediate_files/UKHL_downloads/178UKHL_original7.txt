<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;Southern Cross's functions with regard to the provision of care and accommodation would not be regarded as "governmental" in nature, at least in the United Kingdom;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to its business, a care home proprietor such as Southern Cross has no special statutory powers in relation to those it provides with care and accommodation, or otherwise;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e.&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither the care home nor any aspect of its operation, as opposed to the cost of the care and accommodation provided to Mrs YL and others in her situation, is funded by Birmingham;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f.&nbsp;&nbsp;The rights and liabilities between Southern Cross and Mrs YL arise under a private law contract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When taken together, these considerations establish to my satisfaction that the provision of care and accommodation by Southern Cross to Mrs YL, despite being arranged and paid for by Birmingham pursuant to its statutory duty under sections 21 to 26 of the 1948 Act, is not a function "of a public nature" within section 6(3)(b).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;161.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already explained that I agree with Lord Mance's analysis of what the position would be in relation to judicial review. The Strasbourg jurisprudence has also been admirably discussed in his speech, and it would be otiose for me to repeat his analysis. The decisions are not all entirely easy to reconcile, but it appears to me that they support the arguments put forward by Ms Beverley Lang QC for Southern Cross. First, Southern Cross would be regarded as falling within article 34 in connection with the provision of care and accommodation to Mrs YL. Secondly, and more controversially, Southern Cross would not be susceptible to a claim in the Strasbourg court at the suit of Mrs YL. In other words, to interpret section 6(3)(b) as giving Mrs YL Convention rights against Southern Cross would appear to involve extending her rights in a way inconsistent with the observations quoted above from <i>Quark </i>and <i>Denbigh</i>. Further, as already discussed, she has substantial Convention rights against Birmingham.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;162.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also of real significance, in my view, is the not unrelated point arising from the reference in the speeches in <i>Aston Cantlow </i>[2004] 1 AC 546 to the governmental character of the functions covered by section 6(3)(b). As Lord Rodger explained in paragraph 159, "the exact range of governmental power will vary â€¦ from state to state". Providing care and accommodation in a care home would not, in my opinion, be seen in this country as being a function which was of a character which could be described as "governmental", in the normal sense of that word. The fact that local authorities are empowered to run care homes no more justifies a contrary conclusion than the fact that they enter into maintenance or cleaning contracts in respect of their buildings or run restaurants for their staff justifies the view that such activities are governmental functions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;163.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true, as Lord Bingham points out, that the state has accepted responsibility for the past 60 years for ensuring that care is provided for the old and infirm who cannot support themselves. However, that does not mean that the actual provision of such care to an individual is a function of a public nature, or that it would be perceived as being a governmental function, at least in a privately owned care home, even if paid for, as in her particular case at least in part, by a core public authority. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;164.&nbsp;&nbsp;The state provides education and health to everyone, and indeed it is obliged by the Convention to provide education. However, that certainly does not mean that the provision of health or education services in a private school or hospital is a function of a public nature, and, at least as at present advised, that would apply, in my view, even where the costs of the recipient of the service happens to be paid for by a core public authority. Similarly, local authorities provide free or subsidised accommodation for those who need it, but that does not mean that a private landlord falls within section 6(3)(b), even if its tenants receive rent support (including direct payment to the landlord) from a local authority. There are state pensions for every retired worker, and public sector workers receive earnings-related pensions, but that does not mean that a private company managing those pension funds, or underwriting of the pensions, would thereby be exercising a function of a public nature. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;165.&nbsp;&nbsp;As already mentioned, it seems to me much easier to invoke public funding to support the notion that service is a function of "a public nature" where the funding effectively subsidises, in whole or in part, the cost of the service as a whole, rather than consisting of paying for the provision of that service to a specific person. Section 6(3)(b) is primarily concerned with functions and what is entailed with them (eg statutory powers and duties) rather than to whom they are provided, or indeed who provides them. Thus, it appears to me to be far easier to argue that section 6(3)(b) is engaged in relation to the provision of free housing by an entity all of whose activities are wholly funded by a local authority, than it is in relation to the provision of housing by an independently funded entity to impecunious tenants whose rent is paid by the local authority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;166.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my judgment, it is of particular importance in relation to the issue which we have to decide that a proprietor of a care home is not given significant, or indeed (as far as I am aware) any, coercive or other statutory powers, over its residents, whether they are in the care home pursuant to an arrangement with a local authority or otherwise. If proprietors had such powers, that would be a powerful reason for justifying the conclusion that a function was "public in nature". Running a prison, discharging a statutory regulatory regime (Lord Nicholls's examples in paragraph 9 of <i>Aston Cantlow</i> [2004] 1 AC 546), maintaining defence (as is mentioned by Lord Bingham) and providing police services, which are plainly functions falling within section 6(3)(b), carry with them such powers. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;167.&nbsp;&nbsp;I accept that the fact that some statutory power is attached to a function may not always determine that the function is "of a public nature". Indeed, if it were, <i>Aston Cantlow </i>[2004] 1 AC 546 may well have been differently decided (and see also <i>R(West) v Lloyd's of London </i>[2004] EWCA Civ 506, [2004] 3 All ER 251)<i>.</i> In <i>Aston Cantlow</i> [2004] 1 AC 546, para 147, Lord Rodger said the existence of a statutory power was not "sufficient" to bring the function within section 6(3)(b), and he characterised the existence of such a power as an "imprecise criterion for identifying [a public] authority". However, the existence of a relatively wide-ranging and intrusive set of statutory powers in favour of the entity carrying out the function in question is a very powerful factor in favour of the function falling within section 6(3)(b). Indeed, it may well be determinative in many cases, because such powers are very powerfully indicative of a public institution or service. (For completeness, I should add that the source of the powers need not always be statutory: see, by analogy, <i>R v Panel on Take-overs and Mergers Ex p Datafin Plc </i>[1987] QB 815).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;168.&nbsp;&nbsp;In paragraph 63 of his speech in <i>Aston Cantlow</i> [2004] 1 AC 546, Lord Hope of Craighead approached the issue slightly differently. He held that section 6(3)(b) did not apply because "the liability [in question] arises as a matter of private law". Although he dissented in the answer on this aspect, Lord Scott appears, in paragraph 131, to have thought this the right approach. The liability of Southern Cross to provide Mrs YL with care and accommodation in the present case similarly "arises as a matter of private law". That is illustrated by the fact that Mrs YL was (or her relatives were) free to choose which care home she went into, and took advantage of that right by selecting a care home more expensive than Birmingham was prepare to pay for, and funding the difference. Indeed, although provided as a result of a core public authority carrying out its duty to arrange and pay towards its cost, the services provided in this case, are very much of a personal nature, as well as arising pursuant to a private law contract between Southern Cross and Mrs YL.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;169.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Fordham QC, for the Interveners, Justice, Liberty and BIHR, made much of the point which I have already briefly mentioned, namely the alleged anomaly which would result if the question of whether a person whose care home was paid for (or arranged by) the local authority would have Convention rights should depend on whether the care home was run by the local authority or a private entity. Even if that can be characterised as an anomaly, it is a point which seems to me to be of little relevance. It is inherent in the scheme of section 6 that any service provided by a core public authority is caught, whereas it is only if the service falls within section 6(3)(b) that it is caught where the service is provided by anyone else. It would in my view, if anything, be rather more of an anomaly in my view if inhabitants of a privately owned care home, who were funded in whole or in part by a local authority, had Convention rights, whereas other inhabitants, who paid for themselves but were in an otherwise identical situation, did not. In any event, the balancing exercise in the case of a resident who claimed her Convention rights were being infringed, would be different in a care home run by a local authority (who would have no Convention rights) from a care home with a private proprietor (who would be able to pray in aid his own Convention rights).</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;170.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, for the reasons given by Lord Mance, as well for those given by Lord Scott, and for the additional reasons I have set out, I am of the view that the provision of care and accommodation by Southern Cross to Mrs YL, even though it was arranged, and is being paid for, by Birmingham pursuant to sections 21 to 26 of the 1948 Act, does not constitute a "function of a public nature" within section 6(3)(b). Accordingly, I would dismiss this appeal.</p>
