<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30. Much of the claimants' pleading has been based upon material taken from that report.  This is unsurprising, in view of the fact that the claimants have not yet had the benefit of discovery of documents or the obtaining of answers to interrogatories.  The assumption can properly be made at this stage that the narrative which the report contains will in due course be capable of being established by evidence once the claimants have obtained access to the relevant documents.  But there are important limitations on the use which can be made of this document.  I shall have to deal with this matter in more detail later when I come to the arguments relating to strike out, but I should like to make the following observations at this stage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;31. The first point that has to be borne in mind is that neither the report itself nor any of its findings or conclusions will be admissible at any trial in this case.  At this stage, when the only material that is available for consideration apart from the pleadings is the report and an incomplete bundle of relevant documents, it is tempting to fill in the gaps by reference to Bingham LJ's findings and the conclusions which he was able to draw from his review of the evidence.  Nevertheless a sharp dividing line must be observed between, on the one hand, his narrative of the evidence and, on the other hand, his findings and conclusions in the light of that evidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32. It can, as I have said, be assumed that if the claim is not struck out the claimants will in due course have access to the evidence which provides the source material for that narrative, and that that evidence will be capable of being led by them at the trial.  But, as Bingham LJ's findings and conclusions based on that narrative are inadmissible, they must be held to be incapable either of being led in evidence at the trial or of being used by either side in any other way in support of the competing arguments.  As Hirst LJ observed in the Court of Appeal, no comparable statutory provisions to those which are to be found in section 441 of the Companies Act 1985 apply to the Bingham report: <i> </i> [2000] 2 WLR 15, 91A-C.  The investigation which Bingham LJ conducted was a private and not a statutory inquiry.  The rigorous attention which must be paid to the distinction between what would and what would not be admissible has not always been observed in the written cases, and I had the impression that it was not always being observed during the oral argument.  Nor, for reasons which I shall explain later, do I think that it was always observed either by Clarke J or by the majority in the Court of Appeal in their judgments on the issues relating to the question of strike out.  This has an important bearing on the question whether those judgments were soundly based and should be upheld or whether, because they were not soundly based, the question of strike out is now at large for your Lordships' re-consideration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33. A further point that should be noted at this stage about the findings and conclusions in the Bingham report is that they were the result of an investigation that lacked the benefit of statutory powers and was conducted behind closed doors.  The claimants were not present nor were they represented.  In the conduct of his fact-finding exercise Bingham LJ was, as he said in his covering letter, greatly assisted by the co-operation which he received especially from the Bank and Price Waterhouse.  But he had no power to compel the attendance of witnesses or to require the production of documents, and there was no counsel to the inquiry.  As the appendices have not been published, the claimants have not had access to all the material which Bingham LJ had before him.  None of these observations are intended to suggest that the investigation was incomplete or that the report, for the purposes for which it was prepared, is in any way open to criticism.  But it is plain that it cannot be suggested that Bingham LJ was in a position to conduct a fair trial of the issues relating to the tort of misfeasance in public office which the claimants are seeking to raise against the Bank in this case.  In these circumstances I agree with the views which Auld LJ expressed in the Court of Appeal in his minority judgment when he said that it would not be right to treat the Bingham report as effectively conclusive on the questions that arise in this litigation or to conclude that all the available evidence on those questions has been gathered in:  [2000]  2 WLR 15 180 D-E.</p>
<i><p>(c) 	History of proceedings to date</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;34. The claimants' writ of summons was issued on 24 May 1993.  On 19 July 1995 Clarke J made an order for the following questions to be tried as preliminary issues: (1) Is the defendant capable of being liable to the plaintiffs for the tort of misfeasance in public office? (2) Were the plaintiffs' alleged losses caused in law by the acts or omissions of the defendant? (3) Are the plaintiffs entitled to recover for the tort of misfeasance in public office as existing depositors or potential depositors?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;35. On 19 July 1995 Clarke J gave the claimants leave to amend their pleadings for the purposes of these preliminary issues.  On 21 August 1995 the claimants lodged a re-amended statement of claim.  Following Clarke J's first and second judgments of 1 April 1996 and 10 May 1996 <i> </i> [(1996] 3 All ER 558 and 634) in which he expressed his preliminary conclusions on the three preliminary issues, the claimants applied for leave to re-re-amend their statement of claim and the Bank made an application for the statement of claim to be struck out.  Clarke J heard argument on these applications in November and December 1996.  The claimants then proposed a series of further amendments to their proposed re-re-amended statement of claim, and an eighth draft was lodged on 6 January 1997.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;36. After a further hearing in April 1997 when he considered the claim as then formulated Clarke J delivered a judgment on 30 July 1997 (unreported) in which he held that, on the basis of the evidence then available, the claim was bound to fail; that, as there was no reasonable possibility that the claimants would obtain evidence in the future which might enable them to succeed, the claim was bound to fail in the future; that in these circumstances it would be an abuse of process or vexatious or oppressive to allow the action to proceed; that the application to re-re-amend the statement of claim should be refused;  and the action should be struck out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;37. When he was expressing his conclusions in his third judgment on the present material, at pp 166-167, Clarke J said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"I have reached the firm conclusion that on the material available at present the plaintiffs have no arguable case that the Bank dishonestly granted the licence to BCCI or dishonesty failed to revoke the licence or authorisation in circumstances when it knew, believed or suspected that BCCI would probably collapse.  There is nothing in the Bingham report or in the documents which I have seen to support such a conclusion and there is much to contradict it."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;38. In regard to the future, he recognised, at p. 167, that Bingham LJ was not conducting a trial but an inquiry, that he did not see a number of Bank officials, that the witnesses whom he did see were not cross-examined in an adversarial process and that there was no right of appeal.  But he then went on to say that there was in his judgment no realistic possibility that he had not correctly set out the state of mind of the Bank at each stage.  He concluded, at p 169:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In these circumstances I accept Mr Stadlen's further submission that there is no realistic possibility of more evidence becoming available, whether by further investigation, discovery, cross-examination or otherwise, which might throw light upon the state of mind of the Bank or any of its relevant officials during the period in which BCCI was operating."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;39. In the Court of Appeal the majority (Hirst and Robert Walker LJJ) upheld the order pronounced by Clarke J.  They asked themselves the question whether the claimants had an arguable case that the Bank actually foresaw BCCI's imminent collapse at each relevant stage.  They said that they agreed with the judge's conclusion that, on the material then available, the plaintiffs did not have an arguable case that the Bank actually foresaw BCCI's imminent collapse at each relevant stage.  They also agreed with him that, in all the circumstances, it was now for all practical purposes inconceivable that new material would emerge of such significance as to alter that conclusion:<i> </i> [2000]  2 WLR 15, 101F-H.  Auld LJ dissented as to the test to be applied.  He did not consider that a claimant in an action for misfeasance in public office who could establish dishonesty in the sense of a knowing and deliberately or recklessly unlawful act by the defendant need also establish some knowledge on the officer's part of consequential damage, whether in the form of foresight or foreseeablility: p 166A-B.  But he went on to consider and give his view on the question whether the claim should be struck out on the assumption that the claimants had to establish that the Bank knew, believed or suspected that its conduct would probably cause loss: p 175F.  He said that there were no exceptional circumstances to justify departing from the normal rule of leaving the matter to the trial judge: p 180D-H.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;40. On 21 January 1999 the Court of Appeal gave leave to the claimants to appeal to the House of Lords on the claimants' undertaking to apply to your Lordships for a direction that the correct test for misfeasance in public office should be determined before any consideration of whether the facts alleged or capable of being alleged were capable of meeting that test.  On 12 May 1999 your Lordships gave the claimants leave to appeal against the refusal of leave to re-re-amend the statement of claim.  On 17 July 2000, as they were directed to do at the procedural hearing on 27 June 2000 which followed the delivery of your Lordships' first judgment, the claimants served the new draft particulars on the Bank.  </p>
<i><p align="center"><i></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p align="center"><i>(2) The Requirements of the Tort</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;41. The correct test for misfeasance in public office was established by your Lordships' judgment following the previous hearing of this appeal:<i> </i> [2000] 2 WLR 1220.  I do not wish to repeat or to analyse what your Lordships said in that judgment.  But there are two matters with which I must deal.  In the first place it is necessary for me to identify my understanding of the various elements in the light of which the question whether the facts pleaded by the claimants in the new draft particulars satisfy its requirements must be tested.  In the second place I must examine Mr Stadlen's argument that the claimants' pleadings are based on a misunderstanding of those requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;42. The following are the essential elements of the tort which are relevant to the examination of the new draft particulars.  First, there must be an unlawful act or omission done or made in the exercise of power by the public officer.  Second, as the essence of the tort is an abuse of power, the act or omission must have been done or made with the required mental element.  Third, for the same reason, the act or omission must have been done or made in bad faith.  Fourth, as to standing, the claimants must demonstrate that they have a sufficient interest to sue the defendant.  Fifth, as causation is an essential element of the cause of action, the act or omission must have caused the claimants' loss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;43. As to standing, the interest to sue of those who were already depositors with BCCI is not in doubt.  A question has been raised about the interest to sue of potential depositors.  This is because a widespread economic effect resulting from the misfeasance does not give a cause of action to the public in general.  But the Bank, while reserving the right to pursue the issue at trial, accepts that it is capable of being liable for the tort to claimants who were potential depositors with BCCI at the time of any relevant act or omission of misfeasance by the Bank.  As to causation, the Bank submits that it is not capable of having caused loss to depositors or potential depositors where the proximate cause of the loss was the deliberate act of a third party - in this case, fraudulent acts of individuals within BCCI.  But questions of fact are raised by this argument which are unsuitable for summary determination at this stage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;44. The first, second and third requirements lie at the heart of the argument.  No further explanation is required as to the test which must be met to satisfy the first requirement.  As to the second and third requirements, the claimants do not allege that the Bank did or made the acts or omissions intentionally with the purpose of causing loss to them.  The allegation is that this is a case of what is usually called "untargeted malice".  Where the tort takes this form the required mental element is satisfied where the act or omission was done or made intentionally by the public officer (a) in the knowledge that it was beyond his powers and that it would probably cause the claimant to suffer injury, or (b) recklessly because, although he was aware that there was a serious risk that the claimant would suffer loss due to an act or omission which he knew to be unlawful, he wilfully chose to disregard that risk.  In regard to this form of the tort, the fact that the act or omission is done or made without an honest belief that it is lawful is sufficient to satisfy the requirement of bad faith.  In regard to alternative (a), bad faith is demonstrated by knowledge of probable loss on the part of the public officer.  In regard to alternative (b), it is demonstrated by recklessness on his part in disregarding the risk.  The claimants rely on each of these two alternatives.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;45. At the first hearing Mr Stadlen argued that recklessness was not sufficient to satisfy the required mental element.  Your Lordships rejected this submission, with the result that it must be assumed for the purposes of the argument at this stage that the claimants are entitled to include this alternative as part of their case.  His argument at the further hearing was that, as one of the essential requirements of the tort was knowledge, belief or suspicion that the act or omission would probably cause loss to depositors or potential depositors, in order to achieve harmony between the two alternatives knowledge, belief or suspicion of "probable loss" was a necessary element in the case of the alternative of recklessness.  He submitted that without evidence to support this requirement there could be no liability under the second, or "untargeted malice", limb of the tort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;46. I would reject these submissions also.  The effect of your Lordships' decision following the first hearing is that it is sufficient for the purposes of this limb of the tort to demonstrate a state of mind which amounts to subjective recklessness.  That state of mind is demonstrated where it is shown that the public officer was aware of a serious risk of loss due to an act or omission on his part which he knew to be unlawful but chose deliberately to disregard that risk.  Various phrases may be used to describe this concept, such as "probable loss", "a serious risk of loss" and "harm which is likely to ensue".  Although I have used the phrase "serious risk of loss", I do not think that for present purposes it is necessary to choose between them.  Further attempts to define their meaning would raise issues of fact and degree which are best considered at trial.  The absence of an honest belief in the lawfulness of the conduct that gives rise to that risk satisfies the element of bad faith or dishonesty.</p>
<p>(3) <i>Whether the facts pleaded are capable of meeting the requirements of the tort</i></p><i>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;47. The question to which I now turn relates to the adequacy of the pleadings.  This is the first of the two broad grounds on which the Bank say the claim should be struck out.  The issue here is directed to the sufficiency of the particulars.  It is whether, assuming the facts alleged to be true, a case has been made out in the pleadings for alleging misfeasance in public office by the Bank.  If it has, then the question whether the pleading is supported by the evidence is normally left until trial.  In <i>McDonald's Corp v Steel</i> <i> </i> [1995]  3 All ER 615, 621E-F Neill LJ said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is true that a pleader must not put a plea of justification (or indeed a plea of fraud) on the record lightly or without careful consideration of the evidence available or likely to become available.  But, as counsel for the plaintiffs recognised in the course of the argument, there will be cases where, provided a plea of justification is properly particularised, a defendant will be entitled to seek support for his case from documents revealed in the course of discovery or from answers to interrogatories."<p></p></ul>
<p>I shall deal later (in section (3)) with the question to which Mr Stadlen directed the main part of his argument.  This is whether there are reasonable grounds for thinking that evidence to support the allegations is or is capable of being made available.  The question with which I propose to deal at this stage is whether the grounds for the claim have been properly particularised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;48. The Bank makes much of the fact that the claimants have received numerous warnings of the need for particulars to be given of the facts relied on in support of their allegations and of the many opportunities that they have been given to amend their statement of claim.  Your Lordships are invited to infer from the absence of particulars, and in the light of the available evidence, that the claimants are not able to make good their allegations and that on this ground alone Clarke J was right to order that the claim should be struck out.  On the other hand the claimants say that the Bank is well aware of the case that they seek to bring and that the Bank's argument is calculated to place an insuperable obstacle in their path.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;49. In my judgment a balance must be struck between the need for fair notice to be given on the one hand and excessive demands for detail on the other.  In <i>British Airways Pension Trustees Ltd v Sir Robert McAlpine &amp; Sons Ltd</i> (1994) 72 BLR 26, 33-34<i> </i>Saville LJ said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The basic purpose of pleadings is to enable the opposing party to know what case is being made in sufficient detail to enable that party properly to prepare to answer it.  To my mind it seems that in recent years there has been a tendency to forget this basic purpose and to seek particularisation even when it is not really required.  This is not only costly in itself, but is calculated to lead to delay and to interlocutory battles in which the parties and the court pore over endless pages of pleadings to see whether or not some particular point has or has not been raised or answered, when in truth each party knows perfectly well what case is made by the other and is able properly to prepare to deal with it."  <p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50. These observations were made under the old rules.  But the same general approach to pleadings under the CPR was indicated by Lord Woolf MR in <i>McPhilemy v Times Newspapers Ltd</i> [1999]  3 All ER 775, 792J-793A:<i></i></p><i>
</i>
<p></p><ul>"The need for extensive pleadings including particulars should be reduced by the requirement that witness statements are now exchanged.  In the majority of proceedings identification of the documents upon which a party relies, together with copies of that party's witness statement, will make the detail of the nature of the case the other side has to meet obvious.  This reduces the need for particulars in order to avoid being taken by surprise.  This does not mean that pleadings are now superfluous.  Pleadings are still required to mark out the parameters of the case that is being advanced by each party.  In particular they are still critical to identify the issues and the extent of the dispute between the parties.  What is important is that the pleadings should make clear the general nature of the case of the pleader.  This is true both under the old rules and the new rules."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;51. On the other hand it is clear that as a general rule, the more serious the allegation of misconduct, the greater is the need for particulars to be given which explain the basis for the allegation.  This is especially so where the allegation that is being made is of bad faith or dishonesty.  The point is well established by authority in the case of fraud.  <i></i></p><i>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;52. In <i>Wallingford v Mutual Society </i>(1880)  5 App Cas 685, 697 Lord Selborne LC<i> </i>said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"With regard to fraud, if there be any principle which is perfectly well settled, it is that general allegations, however strong may be the words in which they are stated, are insufficient even to amount to an averment of fraud of which any court ought to take notice."<p></p></ul>
<p>In the same case, at p 709, Lord Watson said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"My Lords, it is a well-known and a very proper rule that a general allegation of fraud is not sufficient to infer liability on the part of those who are said to have committed it.  And even if that were not the rule of the common law, I think the terms of Order XIV would require the parties to state a very explicit case of fraud, or rather of facts suggesting fraud, because I cannot think that a mere statement that fraud had been committed, is any compliance with the words of that rule which require the defendant to state facts entitling him to defend.  The rule must require not only a general and vague allegation but some actual fact or circumstance or circumstances which taken together imply, or at least very strongly suggest, that a fraud must have been committed, those facts being assumed to be true."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;53. The Bank says that, as an allegation of misfeasance in public office involves an allegation of dishonesty or bad faith on the part of the public officer, particulars must be given of the facts which, if proved, would justify the allegation.  It is also said that it is not enough to aver facts which are consistent either with dishonesty or with negligence.  Dishonesty or bad faith must be proved, so the facts relied on must point distinctly to dishonesty.  Reference was made to <i>Davy v Garrett</i> (1878)  7 Ch D 473, 489 where Thesiger LJ said:<i></i></p><i>
</i>
<p></p><ul>"It may not be necessary in all cases to use the word 'fraud' - indeed in one of the most ordinary cases it is not necessary.  An allegation that the defendant made to the plaintiff representations on which he intended the plaintiff to act, which representations were untrue, and known to the defendant to be untrue, is sufficient.  The word 'fraud'<i> </i>is not used, but two expressions are used pointing at the state of mind of the defendant - that he intended the representations to be acted upon, and that he knew them to be untrue.  It appears to me that a plaintiff is bound to show distinctly that he means to allege fraud.  In the present case facts are alleged from which fraud might be inferred, but they are consistent with innocence.  They were innocent acts in themselves, and it is not to be presumed that they were done with a fraudulent intention."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;54. It seems to me that it can no longer seriously be maintained by the Bank that they do not have sufficient notice of the case which is being made against them.  It is abundantly clear that what the claimants are seeking to prove is misfeasance in public office.  As my noble and learned friend Lord Hutton has pointed out, the draft new particulars contain detailed allegations to the effect that the Bank acted in bad faith.  It has all along been common ground that the claimants cannot base their claim against the Bank in negligence.  As Hirst LJ observed in the Court of Appeal, at p 32, the immunity which the Bank enjoys under section 1(4) of the Banking Act 1987 unless it is shown that the act or omission was in bad faith goes a long way to explaining why the claimants have undertaken the burden of seeking to prove misfeasance in public office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;55. In my view this point alone is a sufficient answer to the criticism based on Thesiger LJ's remarks in <i>Davy v Garrett.  </i>The principle to which those remarks were directed is a rule of pleading.  As the Earl of Halsbury LC said in <i>Bullivant v Attorney General for Victoria </i> [1901] AC 196, 202, where it is intended that there be an allegation that a fraud has been committed, you must allege it and you must prove it.  We are concerned at this stage with what must be alleged.  A party is not entitled to a finding of fraud if the pleader does not allege fraud directly and the facts on which he relies<i> </i>are equivocal.  So too with dishonesty.  If there is no specific allegation of dishonesty, it is not open to the court to make a finding to that effect if the facts pleaded are consistent with conduct which is not dishonest such as negligence.  As Millett LJ said in <i>Armitage v Nurse</i> [1998] Ch 241, 256G , it is not necessary to use the word "fraud" or "dishonesty" if the facts which make the conduct fraudulent are pleaded.  But this will not do if language used is equivocal: <i>Belmont Finance Corporation Ltd v Williams Furniture Ltd</i> [1979] Ch 250, 268 per Buckley LJ.  In that case it was unclear from the pleadings whether dishonesty was being alleged.  As the facts referred to might have inferred dishonesty but were consistent with innocence, it was not to be presumed that the defendant had been dishonest.  Of course, the allegation of fraud, dishonesty or bad faith must be supported by particulars.  The other party is entitled to notice of the particulars on which the allegation is based.  If they are not capable of supporting the allegation, the allegation itself may be struck out.  But it is not a proper ground for striking out the allegation that the particulars may be found, after trial, to amount not to fraud, dishonesty or bad faith but to negligence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;56. In this case it is clear beyond a peradventure that misfeasance in public office is being alleged.  There is an unequivocal plea that the Bank was acting throughout in bad faith.  The Bank says that the facts relied on are, at best for the claimants, equally consistent with negligence.  But the substance of that argument is directed not to the pleadings as such, which leave no doubt as to the case that is being alleged, and the basis for it in the particulars, but to the state of the evidence.  The question whether the evidence points to negligence rather than to misfeasance in public office is a matter which must be judged in this case not on the pleadings but on the evidence.  This is a matter for decision by the judge at trial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;57. The Bank nevertheless submits that the facts pleaded fail to meet the requirements of the tort.  Three reasons are advanced in support of this argument.  The first is that the claimants have failed to allege the requisite mental element as to loss.  Mr Stadlen said that it was not enough for the claimants to show that the Bank knew that depositors and potential depositors were at risk.  As he put it, nothing short of a properly particularised allegation of knowledge or recklessness of probable loss, known or suspected, would satisfy the test.  The second is that the pleadings do not contain a properly particularised allegation that the Bank in the person of identified officials committed acts or omissions of misfeasance dishonestly in the sense of committing them with subjective bad faith.  Mr Stadlen submitted that it was well understood that an allegation of dishonesty had to be supported by particulars from which the inference of dishonesty could be drawn.  A failure to satisfy this requirement was in itself a ground for a strike out.  The third is that the pleadings do not contain a properly particularised allegation that Bank officials took conscious decisions capable of amounting to acts or omissions of misfeasance.  Mr Stadlen directed this part of his argument to what he described as the revocation claim.  He accepted that the initial decision to licence BCCI SA was particularised.  But he said that only three instances were given of decisions not to revoke, and that in the case of only one of these instances - the Bank's decision in October 1986 not to revoke notwithstanding the scale of the central treasury losses - was there any attempt to suggest that the decision was taken dishonestly.</p>
