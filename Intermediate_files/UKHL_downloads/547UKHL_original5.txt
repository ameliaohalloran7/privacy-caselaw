<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105. But it seems to me that, as events unfold, this part of the case gathers momentum and that the available material makes it clear that the Bank knew by April 1990 at the latest that, unless a rescue could be put in hand in time by the Abu Dhabi government, BCCI would collapse and that serious loss to depositors would then be inevitable.   The pattern of events during this final period is complicated, as the majority in the Court of Appeal recognised: [2000] 2 WLR 15, 100F.  For reasons already given I would leave out of account the fact, relied on by the majority at p 101E-F, that the conclusion in the Bingham report was that rescue was feasible and collapse not inevitable.  In my opinion the documents alone do not tell the full story, and the question whether the Bank knew that loss to depositors was probable or was reckless in the relevant sense cannot be answered satisfactorily without hearing oral evidence.<i></i></p><i>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106. I agree with my noble and learned friend Lord Hobhouse that the overriding objective of dealing with cases justly includes dealing with them in a proportionate manner, expeditiously, fairly and without undue expense.  As he says, each case is entitled only to an appropriate share of the court's resources.  Account has to be taken of the need to allot resources to other cases.  But I do not believe that the course which I favour offends against these important principles.  The most important principle of all is that which requires that each case be dealt with justly.  It may well be that the claimants, on whom the onus lies, will face difficulties in presenting their case.  They must face the fact that each and every allegation of bad faith will be examined rigorously.  A trial in this case will be lengthy and it will be expensive.  There is only so much that astute case management can do to reduce the burdens on the parties and on the court.  Nevertheless it would only be right for the claim to be struck out if it has no real prospect of succeeding at trial.  I do not think that one should be influenced in the application of this test by the length or expense of the litigation that is in prospect.  Justice should be even-handed, whether the case be simple or whether it be complex.  It is plain that the situation in which the claimants find themselves was not of their own making, nor are they to be blamed for the volume and complexity of the facts that must be investigated.  I would hold that justice requires that the claimants be given an opportunity to present their case at trial so that its merits may be assessed in the light of the evidence.<i></i></p><i>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107. I have taken one other factor into account.  The decision which your Lordships are being asked by the Bank to take is to give summary judgment in its favour on the entire claim.  It would only be right to strike out the whole claim if it could be said of every part of it that it has no real prospect of succeeding.  That would mean that even the latest depositors who were entrusting their money to BCCI SA up to the very end of the final period would be left without a remedy.  I think that that is too big a step to take on the available material.  Conversely, I consider that if one part of the claim is to go to trial it would be unreasonable to divide the history up and strike out other parts of it.  A great deal of time and money has now been expended in the examination of the preliminary issues, and I think that this exercise must now be brought to an end.  I would reject the Bank's application for summary judgment.</p>
<i></i><p><i>(7) the Bank's cross-appeal</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108. The cross-appeal by the Bank is directed to the second and third of the three questions which in his order of 19 July 1995 Clarke J said should be tried as preliminary issues.  The first question was whether the Bank is capable of being liable to the claimants for the tort of misfeasance in public office.  That is the question to which the main part of this judgment has been directed.  For the reasons which I have given I consider that it cannot be answered until the facts have been established at trial.  The second and third questions were whether the claimants' alleged losses were caused in law by the acts or omissions of the Bank, and whether the claimants are entitled to recover for the tort of misfeasance in public office as existing or potential depositors.  The Court of Appeal held that it would be premature to decide these points conclusively in the Bank's favour until the facts have been established; [2000] 2 WLR 15, 68-70.  I respectfully agree.  As I said earlier (see paragraph 34) the Bank, while reserving the right to pursue the issue at trial, accepts that it is capable of being liable for the tort to potential depositors and questions of fact are raised by the issue about causation which are unsuitable for summary determination at this stage.</p>
<i>
</i><p align="center"><i><i>(8) Conclusion and further procedure</i> </i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109. For these reasons I would allow the appeal and I would dismiss the cross-appeal.  I would set aside the order that the re-amended statement of claim be struck out, and I would give permission to the claimants to amend their particulars of claim in terms of the new draft particulars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110. The claimants invited your Lordships to direct the Bank to serve an amended defence within two months of the date of this order and the claimants to serve a reply, if so advised, within six weeks of service of the amended defence, and to direct the parties to arrange a case management conference with the Commercial Court within four weeks of the date for service of the reply with a view to determining further progress of this action and establishing all necessary timetables and directions for bringing the case on for trial at the earliest date the Commercial Court considers feasible.  These proposals seem to me to be entirely reasonable.  Like Lord Steyn, I anticipate that the court will wish to exercise its powers of case management with a view to bringing the case to trial with due despatch in accordance with the overriding objective and that further delay due to the hearing of interlocutory applications will now be kept to a minimum.  But on balance I think that it is preferable to leave it to the Commercial Judge in charge of the case to make the appropriate directions.</p>
<p><b>LORD HUTTON</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111. I have had the advantage of reading in draft the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Hope of Craighead and I gratefully adopt his account of the factual and statutory background to this appeal and of the course of the proceedings in the High Court and the Court of Appeal.  I am in general agreement with his conclusions and with the reasons which he gives for them, but because of the importance of the issues which have arisen for decision I propose to state the reasons which have led me to the conclusion that the plaintiffs' appeal should be allowed and that the action should not be struck out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112. In his first judgment dated 1 April 1996 Clarke J stated the ingredients of the tort of misfeasance in public office.  In his second judgment dated 10 May 1996 the learned judge held that the amended statement of claim as pleaded at that date did not allege the necessary knowledge of, or recklessness as to, the probability of loss, and that accordingly if that statement of claim were not further amended the plaintiffs' claim would fail and should be dismissed.  But the judge gave leave to the plaintiffs to apply to amend further the statement of claim.  The plaintiffs then brought an application before the judge for leave to re-amend the statement of claim and by his third judgment dated 30 July 1997 the judge held that even if all the proposed amendments to the statement of claim were permitted the plaintiffs' claim was bound to fail.  The judge stated, at pp 166-167:</p>
<p></p><ul>"I have reached the firm conclusion that on the material available at present the plaintiffs have no arguable case that the Bank dishonestly granted the licence to BCCI or dishonestly failed to revoke the licence or authorisation in circumstances when it knew, believed or suspected that BCCI would probably collapse.  There is nothing in the Bingham report or in the documents which I have seen to support such a conclusion and there is much to contradict it."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly the judge ordered that the action be struck out, but the judge made it clear at p 169 that, but for the conclusion which he had reached that the plaintiffs' action was bound to fail, it is likely that he would have allowed all, or almost all, the proposed amendments to the statement of claim.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113. The Court of Appeal (Auld LJ dissenting) upheld the decision of Clarke J and delivering the joint judgment of himself and Robert Walker LJ, Hirst LJ stated [2000] 2 WLR 15, 101F:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The judge reached the firm conclusion, in his third judgment, that, on the material then available, the plaintiffs had no arguable case that the Bank dishonestly licensed BCCI SA or dishonestly failed to revoke the licence or authorisation in circumstances when it knew, believed or suspected that the company would probably collapse without being rescued.  We agree with that conclusion.  We also agree that, in all the circumstances of this extraordinary case, it is now for practical purposes inconceivable that new material would emerge of such significance as to alter that conclusion.  The tort alleged is a tort of dishonesty, and the plaintiffs' claim must be rigorously assessed on their pleaded case and the evidential material shown to be available to support it."<p></p></ul>
<p>In his dissenting judgment, at p 180F, Auld LJ stated:</p>
<p></p><ul>"As the authorities to which Hirst and Robert Walker LJJ have referred indicate, it is normally only in clear and obvious cases that a court should strike out a claim as incapable of proof at the interlocutory stage and before full discovery.  In cases, such as this, of great legal and factual complexity, it requires a justified confidence that the plaintiffs' case is and will remain incapable of proof and most exceptional circumstances to justify stifling it at an early stage.  For the reasons that I have given, I do not consider that the court can be confident that all the evidence material to Clark J's conclusion about the Bank's state of knowledge has been gathered in or, which is as important, properly tested."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114. In giving judgment on the legal issues relating to the nature of the tort of misfeasance in public office the House directed that the plaintiffs should prepare a new draft pleading ([2000] 2 WLR 1220, 1236E) and accordingly the plaintiffs have prepared and served a new pleading consisting of particulars of claim which, with a few additions, largely contain the allegations pleaded in the re-amended statement of claim and in the re-re-amendments which the plaintiffs sought leave to make from Clarke J.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115. Before the House in the present hearing the plaintiffs submitted that the new particulars of claim disclosed a cause of action on which they were entitled to proceed to trial.  The Bank advanced two main submissions.  The first was that the plaintiffs' claim, whether as formulated in the re-amended statement of claim or in the re-re-amendments which Clarke J considered in his third judgment, or as formulated in the new particulars of claim, disclosed no reasonable cause of action so that the action should remain struck out.  The Bank's second submission was that the plaintiffs' claim, in whatever way it was formulated, was frivolous and vexatious and/or an abuse of process and on that ground also the action should remain struck out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116. The issues which arose before Clarke J and the Court of Appeal as to whether the pleadings disclosed a reasonable cause of action and/or were frivolous and vexatious and/or an abuse of process were issues which were governed by Ord 18, r 19 (1)(a)(b) and (d) of the Rules of the Supreme Court.  I think that in applications under the Rules of the Supreme Court a clear distinction was not always drawn between an application under Ord 18, r 19(1)(a) to strike out a statement of claim on the ground that it disclosed no reasonable cause of action and an application under Ord 18, r 19(1)(b) and (d) to strike out a statement of claim on the ground that it was frivolous or vexatious and/or an abuse of the process of the court, and, in practice, there were cases where it was difficult to draw or give effect to this distinction.  But in a complex case such as the present one I think it is helpful to recognise the distinction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117. The 1999 White Book stated at 18/19/10 with reference to r 19(1)(a):</p>
<p></p><ul>"A reasonable cause of action means a cause of action with some chance of success when only the allegations in the pleading are considered (per Lord Pearson in <i> Drummond-Jackson v British Medical Association</i> [1970]  1 WLR 688;  [1970]  1 All ER 1094, CA).  So long as the statement of claim or the particulars (<i>Davey v Bentinck</i> [1893] 1 QB 185) disclose some cause of action, or raise some question fit to be decided by a judge or a jury, the mere fact that the case is weak, and not likely to succeed, is no ground for striking it out (<i>Moore v Lawson</i> (1915) 31 TLR 418, CA;  <i>Wenlock v Moloney</i> [1965] 1 WLR 1238; <i> </i>[1965]  2 All ER 871, CA); "<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore if a plaintiff would be entitled to judgment if he were successful in proving the matters alleged in his pleadings, the statement of claim could not be struck out under rule 19(1)(a) on the ground that he had no prospect of adducing evidence to prove the matters which he alleged.  If a defendant wished to strike out a statement of claim and to obtain an order for the dismissal of the action on the ground that the plaintiff had no prospect of proving the case which he alleged in his statement of claim he had to do so under rule 19(1)(b) and/or (d).   A case which illustrates this (although the application was to strike out, not a statement of claim, but a plea of justification in a defence) was the application made in <i>McDonald's Corporation v Steel</i> [1995] 3 All ER 615 where the Court of Appeal considered the correct approach to an application under Ord 18, r 19(d) to strike out a pleading for abuse of process and held, at p 623E-F, that the power to strike out was a draconian remedy which was to be employed only in clear and obvious cases where it is possible to say at an interlocutory stage and before full discovery that a particular allegation was incapable of being proved.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118. In the present case when Clarke J struck out the action he did so on the ground that even with all the proposed re-re-amendments the plaintiffs' claim was bound to fail and that in those circumstances it would be an abuse of the process or vexatious or oppressive to allow the action to proceed (see paragraph 6 and 7 at p 172 of his third judgment).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119. The applications before Clarke J and the Court of Appeal were governed by the Rules of the Supreme Court but those Rules have now been replaced by the Civil Procedure Rules.  I think that rule 3.4 (2)(a) of the new Rules corresponds in a broad way to Ord 18, r 19(1)(a) and rule 3.4 (2)(b) and rule 24.2 (a)(i) correspond in a broad way to Ord 18, r 19(1)(b) and (d).  Rule 3.4(2) provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The court may strike out a statement of case if it appears to the court—<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a) that the statement of case discloses no reasonable grounds for bringing or defending the claim;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b) that the statement of case is an abuse of the court's process or is otherwise likely to obstruct the just disposal of the proceedings;"<p></p></ul>
<p>Rule 24.2(a)(i) provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The court may give summary judgment against a claimant or defendant on the whole of a claim or on a particular issue if—<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a) it considers that—<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(i) that claimant has no real prospect of succeeding on the claim or issue;<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120. The new particulars of claim, served pursuant to the direction of the House, were served after the new Civil Procedure Rules came into force, and therefore if Clarke J and the majority of the Court of Appeal erred in their approach to the application to strike out the action the question whether the action should remain struck out falls to be determined by the House under the wording of the new Rules.  In the present case I think it is desirable, as I have stated, to distinguish between the two grounds on which the Bank submits that the action should remain struck out.  Using the terminology of the new Rules one ground is that the statement of case (looking only at the pleadings themselves) discloses no reasonable ground for bringing the claim (which I shall term "the attack on the pleadings point"), and the other ground is that taking into account the evidence available to the plaintiffs to adduce at a trial, they have no real prospect of succeeding on the claim (which I shall term "the no real prospect of success point").</p>
<i></i><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attack on the pleadings point</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121. My Lords, the essential ingredients of the tort of misfeasance in public office were stated in the judgment of the House following the previous hearing [2000] 2 WLR 1220 and I do not propose again to restate those elements with precision.  But it is clear that a plaintiff must prove (1) an abuse of the powers given to a public officer;  (2) that the abuse was constituted by a deliberate act or deliberate omission by the public officer with knowledge that the act or omission was wrongful or with recklessness as to whether or not the act or omission was wrongful;  (3) that the public officer acted in bad faith; and (4) that the public officer knew that his act or omission would probably injure the plaintiff or was reckless as to the risk of injury to the plaintiff.  In addition the plaintiff must prove that the act or omission caused him loss, but issues of causation do not arise at this stage.  As to the first and second matters to be proved, I consider that the particulars of claim sufficiently allege that the Bank deliberately abused its statutory powers in licensing BCCI and in failing to revoke the licence after it had been granted.  Paragraph 33, for example, alleges:</p>
<p></p><ul>"33.	No revocation of the licence under the 1979 Act  The Bank, knowingly, deliberately contrary to the statutory scheme or recklessly indifferent to whether it was acting in accordance with the statutory scheme or wilfully disregarding the risk that it was not acting in accordance with the statutory scheme and in bad faith:<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>33.1 purported to conclude that it was still entitled to rely upon assurances from the LBC/IML and/or that it had no discretion or power to revoke the full licence when the Bank knew or was recklessly indifferent as to whether or wilfully disregarded the risk that, as was the case:<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>33.1.1	the criteria under paragraphs 7 (fit and proper), 8 (four eyes) and 10 (prudent manner) of Schedule 2 to the 1979 Act had not been fulfilled at  the time of the grant of the full licence and remained unfulfilled at all times thereafter;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>33.1.2	BCCI SA was illegally calling itself a bank contrary to subsection 36(1) of the 1979 Act;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>33.1.3	BCCI SA had conducted and continued to conduct its affairs in a way which threatened the interests of its depositors;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>33.1.4	the Bank's continued reliance upon assurances from the LBC/IML as to BCCI SA's management and financial soundness was unlawful,<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>and the Bank further knew that the likely consequences were that depositors and potential depositors would suffer losses or the Bank wilfully disregarded the risk of the consequences or was recklessly indifferent to the consequences; and/or…"<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122. Bad faith is an essential element in the tort of misfeasance. In accordance with a well established rule it is necessary that bad faith (or dishonesty - the term used in some authorities) should be clearly pleaded.  In <i>Davy v Garrett</i> (1878) 7 Ch D 473, 489 Thesiger LJ said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"There is another still stronger objection to this statement of claim.  The plaintiffs say that fraud is intended to be alleged, yet it contains no charge of fraud.  In the Common Law Courts no rule was more clearly settled than that fraud must be distinctly alleged and as distinctly proved, and that it was not allowable to leave fraud to be inferred from the facts.  It is said that a different rule prevailed in the Court of Chancery.  I think that this cannot be correct.  It may not be necessary in all cases to use the word 'fraud' - indeed in one of the most ordinary cases it is not necessary.  An allegation that the defendant made to the plaintiff representations on which he intended the plaintiff to act, which representations were untrue, and known to the defendant to be untrue, is sufficient.  The word 'fraud' is not used, but two expressions are used pointing at the state of mind of the defendant - that he intended the representations to be acted upon, and that he knew them to be untrue.  It appears to me that a plaintiff is bound to show distinctly that he means to allege fraud.  In the present case facts are alleged from which fraud might be inferred, but they are consistent with innocence.  They were innocent acts in themselves, and it is not to be presumed that they were done with a fraudulent intention."<p></p></ul>
<p>I would observe that the last two sentences in this passage have to be read together with the sentence which immediately precedes them.</p>
<p>In <i>Belmont Finance Corporation Ltd v Williams Furniture Ltd</i> [1979] Ch D 250, 268 A-C Buckley LJ stated:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In the present case, do the facts alleged in the statement of claim suffice to bring home to the defendants or any of them a charge that  (a) the object of the alleged conspiracy was a dishonest one;  and (b) that they actually knew, or must be taken to have known, that it was so?<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"An allegation of dishonesty must be pleaded clearly and with particularity.  That is laid down by the rules and it is a well-recognised rule of practice.  This does not import that the word 'fraud' or the word 'dishonesty' must necessarily be used:  see <i>Davy v Garrett,</i> 7 Ch D 473, 489, per Thesiger LJ.  The facts alleged may sufficiently demonstrate that dishonesty is allegedly involved, but where the facts are complicated this may not be so clear, and in such a case it is incumbent upon the pleader to make it clear when dishonesty is alleged.  If he uses language which is equivocal, rendering it doubtful whether he is in fact relying on the alleged dishonesty of the transaction, this will be fatal; the allegation of its dishonest nature will not have been pleaded with sufficient clarity."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123. In the present case paragraphs 36, 37 and 38 of the particulars of claim allege:</p>
<p></p><ul>"36.	Failure to supervise  The Bank, knowingly, deliberately contrary to the statutory scheme or recklessly indifferent to whether it was acting in accordance with the statutory scheme or wilfully disregarding the risk that it was not acting in accordance with the statutory scheme and in bad faith failed in the respects set out in these particulars of claim to supervise either BCCI SA or BCCI Overseas when:<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>36.1 the Bank knew that it had a duty to supervise under the 1979 and 1987 Acts;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>36.2 the Bank's motives in deliberately failing to supervise were those pleaded in paragraph 37;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>36.3 the Bank knew that the consequences of BCCI SA and/or BCCI Overseas being unsupervised was that depositors and potential depositors would suffer losses or was recklessly indifferent to the consequences or wilfully disregarded the risk of the consequences.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>In support of these contentions the claimants will rely, prior to disclosure, on the facts and matters set out in Schedules 2 to 7.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>THE BANK'S MOTIVES FOR BREACHING ITS STATUTORY DUTIES<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>37. The motives of the Bank in acting as pleaded above were improper and unlawful and in the premises the Bank acted in bad faith.  The Bank's motives were:<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>37.1 to avoid having to comply with its duty to make, review and, if necessary revise its own express evaluation of the relevant statutory criteria in relation to BCCI SA, the Bank at all times knowing or suspecting that such criteria were not satisfied (as pleaded above);<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>37.2 to avoid having to become the lead supervisor in relation to BCCI or the consolidated supervisor of the BCCI Group, even though it knew that it was the only supervisor capable of performing those roles;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>37.3 to avoid the risks attaching to the Bank from taking on responsibility for becoming lead supervisor or in undertaking consolidated supervision of the BCCI Group including:<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>37.3.1 the risk of blame; and<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>37.3.2 the risk of Her Majesty's Treasury having to act as a lender of last resort;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>37.4 to avoid the substantial political and diplomatic problems which would have been generated by the refusal or revocation of BCCI SA's licence or authorisation and the closure of its 45 branches in the United Kingdom;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>37.5 as to the use of a bank name by BCCI, to perpetuate a situation, which the Bank had favoured since as early as 1978, that regardless of any statutory requirements, BCCI SA should continue to be permitted to use the word 'bank' as part of its corporate description in the United Kingdom;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>37.6 to avoid having to comply with its statutory duty whereby it should have required BCCI Overseas forthwith to apply for and obtain a full licence under the 1979 Act or to cease trading in the United Kingdom.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>38. The claimants' case is that in determining the Bank's motives the Bank must be considered in the round as the body made responsible by the 1979 and 1987 Acts for providing the supervisory regime mandated by those Acts for banks.  The motives attributed to the Bank pleaded above are a matter of inference from the primary facts pleaded in Schedules 2 to 7.  Further particulars will be given following disclosure."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;124. In <i>Armitage v Nurse</i> [1998]  Ch 241, 256G Millett LJ said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is not necessary to use the word 'fraud' or 'dishonesty' if the facts which make the conduct complained of fraudulent are pleaded; but, if the facts pleaded are consistent with innocence, then it is not open to the court to find fraud."<p></p></ul>
<p>Later in his judgment at p 259G the learned Lord Justice said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"I am of opinion that, as at present drawn, the amended statement of claim does not allege dishonesty or any breach of trust for which the trustees are not absolved from liability by clause 15." <p></p></ul>
<p>In <i>Taylor v Midland Bank Trust Co Ltd </i>(unreported, 21 July) 1999 Buxton LJ referred to the first observation of Millett LJ at p 256G  and said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"That, however, was an observation about pleading, not about substance.  If (unlike the pleader in our case) the claim does not expressly allege dishonesty, but stands on facts alone, those facts on their face will meet the requirement of a specific allegation of dishonesty only if they can bear no other meaning."<p></p></ul>
<p>But in the present case, unlike in <i>Armitage v Nurse</i>, the pleader does expressly allege bad faith because paragraph 37 pleads that "the motives of the Bank in acting as pleaded above were improper and unlawful and in the premises the Bank acted in bad faith" and the paragraph sets out particulars in support of that allegation.  In my opinion those particulars are not consistent with mere negligence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125. I further consider that if a plaintiff clearly alleges dishonesty or bad faith and gives particulars, the statement of claim cannot be struck out under rule 3.4(2)(a) because the facts he pleads as giving rise to an inference of dishonesty or bad faith may at the trial, after a full investigation of the circumstances, be held not to constitute proof of that state of mind.  If a defendant applies to strike out an action on the ground that the plaintiff has no prospect of adducing evidence at the trial to establish the case which he pleads the application should be brought under rule 3.4(2)(b) or rule 24.2(a)(1).</p>
