<p class="para">247.&nbsp;&nbsp;Examples of cases where auditors have been held liable for further losses in a continuing scheme of fraud include <i>Pacific Acceptance Corpn. Ltd. v Forsyth </i>(1970) 92 WN (NSW) 29 (see at p.41E-F - quantum was ultimately compromised: see p.133D-E), <i>Dairy Containers Ltd. v NZI Bank Ltd. and Auditor-General </i>[1995] 2 NZLR 30 (see at pp.52 lines 15-20 and 73 lines 23-29) and<i> Barings Plc v Coopers &amp; Lybrand </i>itself (subject in that case to a finding of a break in the chain of causation occurring some 18 months after the negligent audit as a result of the fault of management not involved in the fraud (paras. 839-878). The position in such cases parallels that where auditors failed to detect a continuing negligent course of foreign exchange dealings: <i>Daniels (formerly practising as Deloitte Haskins and Sells) v Anderson </i>(1995) 16 ACSR 607 (see at pp. 703 line 48 to 705 line 3, 717 line 27 to 718 line 3 and 720 lines 34-43).  It is auditors’ exposure in such respects which has led them over the years to press for some mitigation of liability over and above any offered under s.727 of the Companies Act 1985, now s.1157 of the Companies Act 2006. One suggestion was that their liability should be made proportionate. This  suggestion was rejected by the Law Commission in a Feasibility Investigation of Joint and Several Liability for the Department of Trade and Industry (1996). More recently, auditors have however obtained a statutory right to limit their liability contractually under ss.534-536 of the 2006 Act.</p>
<p class="hditl">Overseas authority on attribution</p>
<p class="para">248.&nbsp;&nbsp;The House was shown a range of common law authority, particularly from Canada, Australia and the United States. It amply illustrates the variety of ideas and solutions current in this field. Ultimately, I derive no more than an increasing reluctance in recent case-law to hold that top management fraud provides a defence to a negligent auditor. While this corresponds with my own conclusion as to the right direction in principle for English law, I have relegated detailed examination of the overseas authorities to an annex. </p>
<i><p class="para">The auditor’s position where some of the shareholders have engaged in fraud</p></i>
<p class="para">249.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fraud of the company’s directing mind is as such, therefore, no bar to a claim by the company against its auditor for loss sustained by the company due to negligent failure to detect such fraud (paras 241 to 247 above). It cannot in principle make any difference if (as will very commonly be the case) the same person owns some shares in the company. As a matter of basic company law, the company’s separate legal personality entitles it to claim, and the situation mentioned by Lord Hoffmann in <i>Meridian </i>(paras 221 to 235 above) in which it is legitimate to look behind the veil at the shareholders, applies only when <i>all </i>the shareholders in a solvent company concur in committing the company to some decision within its memorandum of association. </p>
<p class="para">250.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Phillips expresses the view (para. 61) that the position “becomes unclear … if some of the shareholders were complicit in the directing mind and will’s misconduct” because of the possibility of “the fraudulent …. shareholders profiting from their dishonesty". Self-evidently this focuses only on the presently irrelevant situation of a solvent company. But even in a situation of solvency, I consider that the doubt expressed by Lord Phillips about the company’s right of recovery conflicts with the principle precluding the lifting of the corporate veil. In reality, it would, if accepted, transform the law regarding auditors’ responsibility, since in many cases fraudulent management own some shares. </p>
<p class="para">251.&nbsp;&nbsp;The concern behind the doubt is that auditors might be liable to the company in amounts which would then enure to the benefit of guilty shareholders. This is however an insubstantial spectre, whether or not the company is insolvent. In cases of insolvency (such as <i>In re London and General Bank </i>and <i>In re Thomas Gerrard</i> and the present), there is commonly no conceivable prospect of any shareholder benefiting by any recovery, however large, made against a negligent auditor. A claim against auditors will not in practice reimburse the company for all its loss, because the very basis of the claim will be that future loss was caused by failure on one or more audits to detect a continuing scheme of fraud which will <i>already</i> have caused past loss. This is quite apart from the fact that auditors’ negligence cases are commonly compromised before trial. Further, if a guilty shareholder is identifiable and has current assets, the company will often look first to them and any recovery from the auditor will be reduced accordingly (as apparently happened in <i>In re Thomas Gerrard</i>). And, if this does not happen, auditors commonly join fraudulent directors and others as third party defendants, and take steps to freeze any assets that they may have. </p>
<p class="para">252.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, it is appropriate to give some further consideration to the position of a solvent company (or a company which would be rendered solvent if it recovered damages from its auditors), on the remote hypothesis that, if it were to recover in full, then shareholders who had already benefited by or were involved in the wrongdoing might benefit by an increase in value of the company. A similar spectre of double recovery may be summoned in respect of the recovery from negligent auditors of dividends which a company has wrongly paid out to shareholders on the faith of fraudulent accounts. In that situation, the shareholders may either be entirely innocent or may include shareholders aware of the accounts’ falsity. The spectre of double recovery was thus raised, briefly and unsuccessfully, as an objection to the recovery of damages against negligent auditors in <i>In re Thomas Gerrard</i>. Counsel submitted that it would be “monstrous for the shareholders to receive again what they had already received in excess dividends” (p.469F). Pennycuick J’s response was simply that the auditors were “of course entitled to credit for the account [sic] recovered from Mr Croston” (p.478G). As stated above, Mr Croston was not only the managing director, but also a significant shareholder. However, the company was in liquidation, so that the factual basis for counsel’s submission that the shareholders might “receive again what they had already received in excess dividends” is also unclear.</p>
<p class="para">253.&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole topic was however comprehensively revisited by Giles J in the Supreme Court of New South Wales in <i>Segenhoe v Atkins </i>(1990) 1 ACSR 697 where he held that it did not matter whether the company paying the dividend was solvent rather than insolvent. In either case the company as a separate entity was out of pocket to the extent of the money paid away. To prevent recovery by the company because the money was paid to shareholders rather than to a third party “would negate the company’s status as a legal entity separate from its shareholders” and in any event, even if the shareholders remained the same, they would not necessarily be paid twice over. Giles J’s full reasoning at pp.701-702 repays reading. The only contrary suggestion in any authority appears to consist of a single dictum of Cotton LJ in <i>In re Exchange Banking Co (Flitcroft’s case) </i>(1882) 21 Ch D 519. This was another case where dividends were over a period of years wrongly paid out of capital on the basis of accounts showing false profits prepared by directors who as shareholders received some of such dividends. The company, by now in liquidation, sued the directors for the totality of the dividends wrongly paid out. Sir George Jessel MR and Brett LJ held unequivocally that the dividends were recoverable in full, and would have been even had the company remained solvent. However Cotton LJ drew a distinction, saying, at p 536:</p>
<p class="para">“The corporation is not the mere aggregate of shareholders. If the corporation were suing for the purpose of paying over again to the shareholders what the shareholders had already received the Court would not allow it. But that is not the case here, the company is insolvent, and there is no objection to allowing it to get back its funds for the purpose of paying debts. The case of the liquidator is stronger, for in some respects he, as <i>a quasi</i> trustee for creditors as well as shareholders, stands in a different position from the company. But I rely on this, that the money was not paid to the corporation, but was paid improperly to individuals, and the corporation can sue the directors to get it back that it may be applied in payment of the debts of the corporation.”</p>
<p class="para">As Giles J observed in <i>Segenhoe v Atkins</i>, Cotton LJ’s “reference to ‘the shareholders’ was probably to the particular shareholders who had received the dividends, rather than to the shareholders as a fluctuating body", and later case-law has tended to explain Cotton LJ’s dictum as a reference to the court’s power to give directions in a liquidation as to the proceedings which a liquidator may pursue. However, the dictum is on any view irrelevant in the present case where the company is irredeemably insolvent. If a case ever arose of a solvent company, the English courts would have the opportunity, as Giles J did, of reconsidering the dictum, and of either taking the same view as Giles J or fashioning the dictum into a rule preventing any possible double recovery (perhaps building on the <i>VGM </i>principle: see below).</p>
<p class="para">254.&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now to situations where the loss consists not of dividends paid out to shareholders, but of other payments fraudulently extracted from the company. In these situations, by definition, the only shareholders, who might conceivably benefit twice over if a company were able to recover such losses from wrongdoers such as its directors or auditor, would be shareholders participating in the fraud. Again, the issue would only arise in a case where (unlike the present) the company was solvent or (improbably) would be made so by recovery from its directors or auditor. In my view, English law would find, as some American courts have found, a way of addressing this issue, even though it may be a different way. First, if the point ever arose where a company, which had still not received full compensation for injury done to it by management fraud, were due to make a distribution to a manager shareholder, the company could impound the defaulting manager/shareholder’s share of the distribution under the principle identified in <i>In re VGM Holdings Ltd. </i>[1942] Ch 235 and <i>Selangor United Rubber Estates Ltd. v. Cradock (No 4) </i>[1969] 1 WLR 1773. That principle not only enables the impounding, as in <i>VGM</i>,<i> </i>of a defaulting director’s entitlement to satisfy his own liability, but also enables the impounding of the amounts due to a defaulting director in his capacity as shareholder to satisfy the liability of other defaulting directors liable jointly and severally with him. In <i>Brink’s-Mat Ltd. v Noye and others </i>[1991] 1 Bank LR 68, 72 Nicholls LJ suggested and Mustill LJ in his judgment accepted that this “or some other process designed to achieve the ends of justice” would “without doubt” prevent the fraudulent shareholders from profiting by their dishonesty.  I also believe that would be so. The common law is not so barren as to be unable to achieve in this area what Lord Goff of Chieveley once described in another context as “practical justice".</p>
<p class="para">255.&nbsp;&nbsp; One approach that could not, with respect, be adopted is that suggested by my noble and learned friend, Lord Brown, in his judgment at para. 203. That paragraph ignores separate corporate personality when it refers to “a claim against the auditors [which] may well lie (through the company) at their [i.e. innocent shareholders’] suit". A company (all the more so when in insolvent liquidation) sues in its own right, not for or at the suit of its shareholders. I am also aware of no “policies and principles", generally understood or not, which might limit a company’s recovery for a wrong done to it by reference to whatever loss its innocent shareholders might, if the corporate veil were lifted, be said themselves to have suffered. The suggestion that this could be the measure of a company’s recovery again ignores the company’s separate legal identity and interests. Suppose senior management own 50% of the shares, and are operating a scheme of fraud which the auditor should have detected at the end of year 1, and that the fraud costs the company £1m in year 2. Why should it matter whether, but for the £1m abstraction in year 2, shareholders’ equity would or would not have increased in value?  What if the £1m abstraction imperils the company or renders it insolvent? The company has suffered a loss of £1m., and is entitled to recover this for its own purposes including payment of its debts. The only qualification on full recovery that might, theoretically, exist in a solvent situation (other than those inherent in conventional contractual and tortious principles of causation and remoteness) is one tailored to ensuring that no guilty shareholder actually benefits, and this could be achieved, if it were ever to be a real concern, under or by development of the <i>VGM</i> principle in a manner respecting corporate identity (see para. 254 above). Further, as Cotton LJ recognised in <i>In re Exchange Banking Co (Flitcroft’s case)</i>, whatever view one may take about the position where a company is solvent, “there can be no objection to allowing it to get back its funds for the purpose of paying debts". In an insolvent situation like the present, Lord Brown’s suggestion is also in conflict with the decision in <i>In re Thomas Gerrard</i>, where Mr Croston’s shareholding and its value were, rightly, treated as irrelevant to the company’s recovery against its negligent auditors.</p>
<i><p class="para">The auditor’s position where all the shareholders have engaged in fraud</p></i>
<p class="para">256.&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue which is, or should be, critical to this appeal arises where the person(s) responsible for the scheme of fraud own <i>all </i>the company’s shares.  The auditor is there to check on management and report to shareholders. But the shareholders know the true position. In a situation of solvency, the straightforward analysis is that there is nothing to report, no-one to complain and no loss. It might also be questioned whether there is any breach of duty, at least in tort and perhaps also in contract, in failing to report to persons who already know; however, this may overlook the fact that the negligent auditor will by definition not know that the shareholders do know, and it also needs to be considered in the light of the auditor’s statutory role and the duties, here largely express, which an auditor undertakes. More pertinently, “so long as the company is solvent, the shareholders are in substance the company” (para. 235), and the company cannot therefore say that it was ignorant or misled or suffered loss.  </p>
<p class="para">257.&nbsp;&nbsp;Two cases illustrate the application of this straightforward analysis to companies solvent at the audit date. In <i>Pendleburys Ltd. v. Ellis Green and Co. </i>(1936) 181 LT 410, a company claimed against its auditor loss caused by its cashier’s defalcations. It sought to attribute such loss to the auditor’s failure, when reporting on the accounts, to disclose weaknesses in the company’s book-keeping systems arising from the absence of certain books and internal checks. The company’s only three directors were its sole shareholders and debenture-holders, and the auditor had reported the weaknesses to them from time to time. Swift J in dismissing the claim observed that the defendants had made their reports to the three men who had “every pecuniary interest in the company", and that, “although they, as auditors, were there to protect the shareholders it could not seriously be said that the shareholders did not receive the information and protection which the law desired should be secured to them” (p 411). The reference to the directors as having “every pecuniary interest in the company” and the absence in the report of any contrary suggestion indicate that the company remained solvent at all times.</p>
<p class="para">258.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second case is Hobhouse J’s decision in <i>Berg</i>. Berg &amp; Co. was solvent at the date of the relevant 1982 audit. (It became insolvent some years later by reason of a trading debt incurred in 1984.)  The negligence it alleged against its former auditors related to a receivable of £2.39m shown in the 1982 accounts as due from a company called Gimco, in respect of which the auditors had simply accepted the uncorroborated and unsupported assurances of Gimco and Mr Golechha, Berg &amp; Co’s sole active director and ultimate beneficial owner. At p.44 Hobhouse J pointed out that, although Berg &amp; Co was a separate and distinct legal entity, Mr Golechha was its directing mind, his knowledge was the company’s and “There was never any general body of shareholders nor any minority shareholders. In addressing their certificate to ‘the Members’ of Berg, [the auditors] were for all practical purposes  addressing it to Mr Golechha alone". Applying <i>Caparo </i>he said (p.53) that </p>
<p class="qt">“the purpose of the statutory audit is to provide a mechanism to enable those having a proprietary interest in the company or being concerned with its management or control to have access to accurate financial information about the company. Provided that those persons have that information, the statutory purpose is exhausted. What those persons do with that information is a matter for them and falls outside the scope of the statutory purpose.  In the present case the first plaintiffs [the company] have based their case not upon any lack of information on the part of Mr Golechha but rather upon the opportunity that the possession of the auditor’s certificate is said to have given for the company to continue to carry on business and to borrow money from third parties. Such matters do not fall within the scope of the duty of the statutory auditor.”</p>
<p class="para">259.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this passage, Hobhouse J was identifying a situation analogous to that applying where a person (A) undertakes to report to a professional body on the affairs of a third person (B) to enable B to continue to engage in professional practice. If B procures A to issue the relevant certificate by deceiving A about matters which A, had he been careful, should anyway have observed, B cannot then turn round and blame A: <i>Luscombe v. Roberts and Pascho</i> (1962) 106 SJ 373. But the professional body, if it incurs loss through allowing B to continue in practice, can in such a situation claim against A: <i>Law Society v. KPMG Peat Marwick</i> [2000] 1 All ER 515; [2000] 1 WLR 1921(CA). In a case like <i>Berg</i>, once it is established that all relevant persons within a company know the true position, the company falls to be treated as a single person (B) in relation to its auditor (A).  </p>
<p class="para">260.&nbsp;&nbsp;The company argued in <i>Berg </i>that the <i>Hampshire Land </i>principle precluded the attribution to it of Mr Golechha’s knowledge. The argument failed <i>in limine</i> (because it was not shown that Mr Golechha was guilty of any fraud on the audit or towards the company), but Hobhouse J (at p.54) also addressed the position as it would have been had there been any fraud:</p>
<p class="qt">“However one identifies the company, whether it is the head management, or the company in general meeting, it was not misled and no fraud was practised upon it. This is a simple and unsurprising consequence of the fact that every physical manifestation of the company Berg was Mr Golechha himself. Any company must in the last resort, if it is to allege that it was fraudulently misled, be able to point to some natural person who was misled by the fraud. That the Plaintiffs cannot do.”</p>
<p class="para">In the result, the company was entitled only to nominal damages for the technical breach of contract involved in the failure to qualify the audit report. Hobhouse J’s words must be taken in context. The company was solvent at the relevant dates. There was no-one but Mr Golechha to think or act for or be interested in it. </p>
<p class="para">261.&nbsp;&nbsp;American case-law supports a conclusion barring recovery from a auditor who has negligently failed to detect that the company’s sole shareholder and controller (a “sole actor”) has been engaging in fraud, e.g. by falsifying the company’s accounts and conducting its business fraudulently to his own benefit and the injury of depositors and creditors (<i>Federal Deposit Insurance Corpn. v. Ernst &amp; Young </i>967 F.2d 166 (1992)) or by operating a Ponzi scheme leading the company into ever deeper insolvency (<i>Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors v. R.F. Lafferty &amp; Co., Inc. </i>267 F.3d 340 (3rd Cir. 2001)). In the former case (decided under Texas law), the court left open the possibility that the creditors or the liquidator on their behalf might have a cause of action against the auditors. In the latter case, decided under Pennsylvania law, the court said that the nature of the claim (for the company’s loss through “deepening insolvency” - a problematic head of loss in English law in any event) made it one which could only be pursued by the company, and that s.541 of the US Bankruptcy Code meant that the liquidator in pursuing it could be in no better position than the company had been before its liquidation.</p>
<p class="para">262.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore Stephens argue, and I understand the majority of your Lordships to consider, that this appeal is covered by the same analysis. In short, Mr Stojevic was S &amp; R’s sole directing mind and its sole beneficial owner; and the company cannot in consequence complain that it succeeded in deceiving Moore Stephens and was in consequence not stopped by others (regulatory or investigating authorities) from pursuing its scheme of fraud. Such a conclusion could be explained in various ways: the auditor’s duty did not extend to supplying information which all persons who can represent the company already have; or whistle-blowing on S &amp; R was and is outside the statutory purpose of the audit as between the company and the auditor; or the principle <i>ex turpi causa </i>applies. Which way was adopted would be presently immaterial.</p>
<p class="para">263.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, Moore Stephens’s argument and the majority conclusion overlook a critical distinction between a company which is solvent and a company which is insolvent at the audit date. Let me, however, first consider two other reasons suggested by S &amp; R for rejecting Moore Stephens’s argument. They are: (a) the “very thing” principle and (b) the fact that S &amp; R is currently insolvent and in liquidation. The first, that the maxim <i>ex turpi causa </i>is incapable of defeating a claim against Moore Stephens for failure to discover and report the very continuing fraud which is the basis of the claim to rely on the maxim, makes no sense if and so long as S &amp; R and its directing mind and sole shareholder are to be identified with each other. An auditor or reporting accountant (A) cannot be in breach of duty, to a person (B) committing a fraud, by failing to report to a third person (C) B’s own fraud about which B well knows (and which B could perfectly well have reported himself, had that not been the opposite of what he wished). This is so, even if such a report would have led to B being unable to continue the fraud. These points are demonstrated by both <i>Luscombe </i>and <i>Berg</i>. The case of<i> Reeves v Commissioner of Police of  the Metropolis </i>[1999] QB 169 has in my opinion no real relevance. It stands for a principle of causation which does not sensibly extend to situations of fraud and could not override the maxim <i>ex turpi causa</i> if otherwise applicable.</p>
<p class="para">264.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason, that S &amp; R’s current insolvency and liquidation should make a difference since any recoveries will be held on the statutory trust for creditors, is touched on in the American case-law considered in the annex to this speech. Mr Brindle accepts that S &amp; R cannot in liquidation have a claim which it did not have pre-liquidation. But he submits that the defence <i>ex turpi causa </i>may cease to apply to a one-man company which goes into liquidation, because in liquidation its assets are held and will be distributed under the statutory scheme for the benefit of creditors. I cannot however accept the argument. Under English law, the company in liquidation cannot in this respect be in a better position than it was pre-liquidation, merely by virtue of the fact that it has become insolvent and gone into liquidation: see also <i>Berg </i>(para. 258 to 260 above).</p>
<i><p class="para">The significance of insolvency at the audit date</p></i>
<p class="para">265.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that S &amp; R was insolvent at each audit date is, in contrast, in my opinion critical. The powers of directors and shareholders in circumstances of insolvency or potential insolvency are qualified (as described in paras 235 to 240 above). The issue as between the company and its auditors is whether the auditors’ duty to the company extends, like the directors’, beyond the protection of the interests of shareholders in a situation where the auditors ought to have detected that the company was (in fact, as a result of the fraud which the auditors ought to have discovered) insolvent. Despite the immense and highly skilled attention that the appeal has had generally, both prior to and during its presentation before the House, I fear that the centrality of this point may have been a little obscured by the spread of argument over other issues. Hobhouse J touched on it in <i>Berg</i> (at pp.54 to 55). But in <i>Berg </i>the problem did not arise because the insolvency arose <i>after</i> the 1982 audit certificate from Berg’s subsequent unconnected trading misfortune and also because the auditor could not be said to have been “implicated in a breach of the company’s duties to its creditors” in any way paralleling the way in which the directors in <i>West Mercia </i>were (<i>Berg</i>, p.55). On the latter possibility, Hobhouse J added (<i>Berg</i>, p.55):</p>
<p class="qt">“The <i>West Mercia </i>case was a clear case of a director abusing his position for his own advantage but the same principle applies wherever it can be shown that those in charge of the affairs of a company or in control of it are acting contrary to the principles governing insolvency. It is only in this sense that it can be said that once a company is insolvent the interests of the company become those of its creditors. The duty of the company and its directors is then to preserve the assets of the company. The present case does not involve any such situation at any material time. The company may have been trading imprudently; but there is no evidence that in 1982 it was trading in fraud of its creditors. There is no allegation that Dearden Farrow were a party to any breach by Mr Golechha of any of his fiduciary duties.”</p>
<p class="para">This passage shows that the earlier passage in Hobhouse J’s judgment (at p.54) quoted in para 260 above must be read in context. It does not mean that a company’s only claim against its officers (including in this term its auditor) lies in deceit. It does not mean that a company is always to be equated with its directing mind. It does not address the context of insolvency.</p>
