<p class="para">124.&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Lord Hope (paras 54-56) that the Court of Appeal was wrong in its conclusion that there would be no point in remitting the case to the judge for further consideration.  I would allow the appeal and make the order for remission that he proposes.</p>
<p class="para">LORD MANCE</p>
<p class="para">My Lords, </p>
<i><p class="para">Introduction</p></i>
<p class="para">125.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the advantage of reading in draft the speeches of my noble and learned friends, Lord Hope of Craighead, Lord Scott of Foscote and Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe. Subject to points made in paragraphs 137 to 139 below about the issues and the course of proceedings before HHJ McKenna, I gratefully adopt the outline of the factual background given by my noble and learned friend, Lord Hope of Craighead. On returning to a field not myself visited since <i>Wandsworth LBC v. Michalak </i>[2003] 1 WLR 617, I find counsel as heavily engaged in similar exchanges around an extending range of authorities as the opposing armies around the forts of Verdun. One submission by Mr Luba QC for the appellant supported by Mr Sales QC for the Secretary of State is that the House should, in the interests of European peace, remove from their path obstacles raised by two of the strongholds upon which Mr Underwood QC for Birmingham City Council takes his stand: <i>Harrow LBC v. Qazi </i>[2003] UKHL 43; [2004] 1 AC 983 and <i>Kay v. Lambeth LBC </i>[2006] UKHL 10; [2006] 2 AC 465. At the time of the oral hearing, I joined with other members of the House in thinking this inappropriate. </p>
<p class="para">126.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, since that hearing, the European Court of Human Rights has in <i>McCann v. United Kingdom </i>(Application no. 19009/04) made clear (para. 50) that the reasoning in its previous decision in <i>Connors v. United Kingdom </i>(Application no. 66746/01) is not “confined only to cases involving the eviction of gypsies or cases where the applicant sought to challenge the law itself rather than its application in his particular case"; rather, any person at risk of loss of his or her home “should in principle be able to have the proportionality of the measure determined by an independent tribunal in the light of the relevant principles under Article 8 of the Convention, notwithstanding that, under domestic law, his right of occupation has come to an end". While the House is not <i>bound</i> to give effect to <i>McCann</i>, under s.2 of the Human Rights Act 1998 it is its duty to “take into account” the decision in <i>McCann</i>. It is perhaps unfortunate that <i>McCann </i>was decided too late for consideration whether the present appeal should come on before a constitution of more than five members of the House. This appeal nevertheless raises for consideration, among other questions, whether the conclusions in <i>Qazi </i>and <i>Kay</i> should undergo any and if so what revision or modification. </p>
<i><p class="para">The statutory background</p></i>
<p class="para">127.&nbsp;&nbsp;At all relevant times, statutory provisions have existed regulating the termination of any agreement to station and occupy a caravan on a protected site (Caravan Sites Act 1968 s.2 and Mobile Homes Act 1983 s.2(1) and Schedule 1 paras. 1 to 6). In particular, under Schedule 1 paragraph 1 in the 1983 Act any such agreement subsists until determined in accordance with paragraphs 3 to 6. The site occupier is entitled to terminate on four weeks’ notice (para. 3). The site owner is entitled to terminate forthwith for breach if, on his application, the court (a) is satisfied of a breach of the agreement not remedied after notice and (b) considers termination reasonable (para. 4). The owner is also entitled to terminate forthwith on satisfying the court that the occupier is not occupying the home as his only or main residence (para. 5) and at the end of any five year period on satisfying the court that the caravan is having a detrimental effect on the site’s amenity or is likely to do so within the next five year period (para. 6). However, under s.5 of the 1983 Act “protected site” is stated not to include any land occupied by a local authority as a caravan site providing accommodation for gypsies (a provision to be removed from a date to be determined by s.318 and Schedule 16 of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008).</p>
<p class="para">128.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under s.3(1) of the 1968 Act it is an offence for an owner, after the expiry or determination of a residential contract, to enforce any right to exclude the occupier from the protected site or from any such caravan, or to remove or exclude the caravan from the site, otherwise than by proceedings in the court; and by s.4(1) a court making any such order is given power to suspend its enforcement for such period not exceeding twelve months from the date of the order as it may think reasonable. However, under s.4(6) of the 1968 Act it was at the relevant times provided that the court should not suspend the enforcement of an order made in proceedings taken by a local authority providing caravan sites within the meaning of s.24 of the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960. S.24 of the 1960 Act gives to local authorities power to provide such sites within their area and to manage or lease them; s.4(6) was removed with effect from 18 January 2005 by the Housing Act 2004, s.211(1).</p>
<i><p class="para">Kay - gateway (a)</p></i>
<p class="para">129.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary to analyse the two-gateway formula to which all members of the majority subscribed in paragraph 110 of <i>Kay</i>. Gateway (a) of paragraph 110 concerns, as I see it, only statutory law. It refers in part (i) to section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998 and in part (ii) to a potential compatibility issue. Gateway (a) does not therefore address what would happen in the case of a right to possession of a home deriving from the common law alone. This would have raised a question as to the possible impact on the court as a public authority of section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act to which my noble and learned friend, Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe, adverts in paragraphs 98 and 99 of his speech. Had the House had such a question in mind in paragraph 110 in <i>Kay</i>, the House could have been expected to address it.  However, if one does hypothesise a right to possession deriving from common law alone, there are difficulties in seeing how a court could create or grant in an occupier’s favour a possessory right which the common law does not confer, or could either deny or postpone a private owner’s entitlement to possession by reference to a supposed duty on the part of the court to act inconsistently with the parties’ rights inter se. Courts after all exist to administer the law as between the parties before them. </p>
<p class="para">130.&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority took a similar view of the court’s role on the facts in <i>Qazi</i>: see per Lord Hope (para. 79), Lord Millett (para. 108) and Lord Scott (paras. 142-4). In that case, it was common ground that a valid notice to quit had been served by one co-tenant (an estranged wife) which brought to an end the whole joint tenancy of the house of which the other joint tenant, the husband, still remained in occupation (see per Lord Bingham of Cornhill at paragraph 2 and Lord Hope of Craighead at paragraph 74). The only issue was whether the court should, under s.6(1), refrain from making a possession order to give effect to the housing authority’s legal right to possession against the occupier husband. The majority held that, save perhaps in a wholly exceptional case (see Lord Hope at para. 97 and Lord Millett at paras. 107 and 109), the court’s role was to enforce a right to possession which existed under national law. Lord Hope at paragraph 79 contemplated as a “wholly exceptional case” in which article 8 issues might be raised in the county court a case “where proceedings for possession were being taken following the service of a notice to quit by the housing authority, bearing in mind as Lord Millett points out that its decision to serve the notice to quit would be judicially reviewable …..".  In <i>Kay </i>at paragraphs 98 and 111, Lord Hope noted that <i>Qazi </i>should not be regarded as authority for an extreme proposition that the exercise by a local authority of an unqualified right to possession would <i>never </i>constitute an unjustified interference under article 8 of the Convention with the occupier’s right to respect for his home. Once again, however, that appears to be a point relating to the local authority’s rather than the court’s duty, one to which I shall return.</p>
<p class="para">131.&nbsp;&nbsp;Be all that as it may, the background to the Council’s present claim to possession of the site occupied by Mr Doherty and his co-defendants included Parliament’s deliberate choice to exclude, from the concept of “protected site” under the 1983 Act, land occupied by a local authority as a caravan site providing accommodation for gypsies, and to exclude, from the power to suspend otherwise granted to the court under s.4(1) of the 1968 Act, any order for possession made in proceedings taken by a local authority providing caravan sites within s.24 of the 1960 Act. The Council thus submits that there was a statutory law within the meaning of gateway (a), that the situation falls within s.6(2) of the Human Rights Act and that the court can do no more than, at most, declare incompatible under s.4 of that Act any aspect of the statutory legal scheme which it concludes is incompatible.</p>
<p class="para">132.&nbsp;&nbsp;I see force in those submissions. The exclusions in the statutory regime of the 1983 and 1968 Acts are unequivocal and cannot be re-interpreted or qualified under s.3 of the 1998 Act. The exclusions made clear that the court’s duty was to give effect to the common law entitlement which would exist apart from the 1983 and 1968 Acts, and in my view (subject to whatever may be the effect of gateway (b)) precluded the court from acting differently within the meaning of s.6(2)(a) of the 1998 Act. The cases of <i>Connors </i>and <i>McCann </i>before the European Court of Human Rights show that (in circumstances where that court considered that relief on judicial review grounds could not assist the occupiers) such a regime is in principle incompatible with the Convention rights which are given domestic effect by the Human Rights Act 1998, in particular because any person at risk of loss of his or her home “should in principle be able to have the proportionality of the measure determined by an independent tribunal in the light of the relevant  principles under Article 8 of the Convention, notwithstanding that, under domestic law, his right of occupation has come to an end” (see <i>McCann</i>, para. 50 quoted in paragraph 126 above). However, I would add that this may be irrelevant, and that (quite apart from the fact that the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 will remove any incompatibility from a future date to be determined) it may not justify a declaration of incompatibility, if in the particular case the incompatibility has no relevance because of the impact of gateway (b).</p>
<i><p class="para">Kay - gateway (b)</p></i>
<p class="para">133.&nbsp;&nbsp;Gateway (b) provides, with reference to <i>Wandsworth LBC v. Winder </i>[1985] AC 461, that, if a defendant has a seriously arguable point that the decision of a local authority to recover possession is an improper exercise of its powers at common law, he should be permitted to raise this by way of defence to its claim to possession.  My noble and learned friend, Lord Scott, indicates in paragraphs 69 and 84 to 88 of his speech that, in deciding whether to terminate an agreement by notice to quit, a local authority must under s.6(1) of the Human Rights Act act in accordance with the Convention rights, and that a decision contrary to such rights would be unlawful and the notice to quit devoid of effect. I agree with this conclusion, although I would myself arrive at it by a different route. Gateway (b), as expressed in paragraph 110 in <i>Kay </i>was, as I see it, phrased so as to exclude any direct application of the Convention rights or of the Strasbourg Court’s test of proportionality, and to confine attention to common law grounds for judicial review, informed though they may increasingly be by ideas of fundamental rights: see also per Baroness Hale of Richmond at paragraph 190 and Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood at paragraphs 208-211, and contrast the approach of the minority as set out in paragraph 39 of Lord Bingham of Cornhill’s speech in <i>Kay</i>. </p>
<p class="para">134.&nbsp;&nbsp;The general distinction which thus emerges is recognised and described in <i>R (Daly) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department </i>[2001] UKHL 26; [2001] 2 AC 532, per Lord Steyn (para. 27) and Lord Cooke of Thorndon (para. 32, recognising though regretting the distinction) and in <i>R (ABCIFER) v. Secretary of State for Defence </i>[2003] EWCA Civ 473; [2003] QB 1397, paragraphs 32 to 37, where Dyson LJ, giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal, said that any abandonment of the common law’s <i>Wednesbury </i>unreasonableness test for a proportionality test was a step which could only be taken by this House. Other potential differences between conventional (or “domestic”) judicial review were discussed in <i>R (SB) v. Governors of Denbigh High School </i>[2006] UKHL 15; [2007] 1 AC 100 (see in particular per Lord Hoffmann at para. 68) and <i>Belfast City Council v. Miss Behavin’ Ltd. </i>[2007] UKHL 19; [2007] 1 WLR 1420. </p>
<p class="para">135.&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference in approach between the grounds of conventional or domestic judicial review and review for compatibility with Human Rights Convention rights should not however be exaggerated and can be seen to have narrowed, with “the ‘<i>Wednesbury’ </i>test … moving closer to proportionality [so that] in some cases it is not possible to see any daylight between the two tests” (<i>ABCIFER</i>, para. 34, citing an extra-judicial lecture by Lord Hoffmann).  The common law has been increasingly ready to identify certain basic rights in respect of which  “the most anxious” scrutiny is appropriate: see  <i>R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p Bugdaycay </i>[1987] AC 514, 531 per Lord Bridge of Harwich, quoted in <i>R v. Ministry of Defence, Ex p. Smith </i>[1996] QB 517, 554D-556A; and see <i>R v Secretary of State for Education and Employment, Ex p Begbie</i>[2000] 1 WLR 1115, 1130B-C per Laws LJ (“the <i>Wednesbury </i>principle itself constitutes a sliding scale of review, more or less intrusive according to the nature and gravity of what is at stake.” My noble and learned friends Lord Hope and Lord Walker draw on this theme in paragraphs 55 and 108 to 109 of their speeches. Even so, as the subsequent history of <i>ex p. Smith </i>demonstrates, the result may not always achieve the degree of protection for Convention rights which the Strasbourg Court requires: <i>Smith and Grady v. United Kingdom </i>(1999) 29 EHRR 493. So there remains room in another case to reconsider how far conventional or domestic judicial review and Convention review can be further assimilated, and in particular whether proportionality has a role in conventional judicial review. This was not, however, argued on the present appeal, and, in common I understand with the majority of your Lordships, I do not consider that it is appropriate to embark on such a review on this appeal. </p>
<p class="para">136.&nbsp;&nbsp;On this basis, in circumstances such as those in <i>Kay</i>, the only question under gateway (b) as expressed in <i>Kay</i> is whether the public authority’s decision can be challenged on domestic judicial review grounds, in particular as having been based on material misconceptions or improper considerations or as unreasonable, either in the <i>Wednesbury </i>sense or in a more relaxed sense which takes full account of the basic interest which any occupant has in his or her home. In other words, in circumstances such as those in <i>Kay</i>, a full Convention review is not, at least nominally, possible on the majority view taken in <i>Kay</i>. </p>
<p class="para">137.&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, however, it becomes important to consider whether the present circumstances are the same as those in <i>Kay</i>. I start by identifying the local authority decision or decisions here in issue. Again, I agree with the way in which my noble and learned friend Lord Scott has identified this in his paragraphs 76 and 84. Mr Doherty and his co-defendants denied in their defence that there had been any valid notice to quit or to determine their licence, tenancy or other interest; and, as HHJ McKenna recognised, any challenge by way of judicial review would be in the first instance to the “fairness and legality of the decision taken by the [Council] to terminate” by the notice to quit served on 4 March 2004 (judgment paras. 43 and 46).  The circumstances in <i>Qazi </i>and <i>Kay </i>were very different in respects to which I shall return (paragraphs 157 et seq below).</p>
<p class="para">138.&nbsp;&nbsp;The present case was in fact transferred from the County Court and heard by HHJ McKenna sitting as a High Court judge in the Birmingham District Registry. Before HHJ McKenna, Mr Doherty and his co-defendants submitted that there were factual disputes which made judicial review inappropriate. HHJ McKenna did not agree that any factual disputes which existed made judicial review inappropriate. In that respect, his view finds considerable support, subject to certain qualifications, in the detailed analysis by the Court of Appeal in <i>E v. Secretary of State for the Home Department </i>[2004] QB 1044. I agree with the observations made in paragraph 68 of the speech of my noble and learned friend, Lord Scott, about the possibility of adjusting judicial review procedure in appropriate circumstances to cover any necessary factual investigation and determination.</p>
<p class="para">139.&nbsp;&nbsp;Deciding the case in December 2004, 15 months before the House’s decision in <i>Kay</i>, HHJ McKenna went on to offer to Mr Doherty and his co-defendants the opportunity of applying for judicial review, although they were already some five months out of time. They did not take up that opportunity, but maintain that they should, if nothing else, have been allowed to defend the proceedings in the County Court on conventional or domestic judicial review grounds under gateway (b).  In <i>Wandsworth LBC v. Winder</i> the local authority had under s.40 of the Housing Act 1980 the right to vary terms of the tenancy unilaterally by notice. The tenant contended that certain rent increases were unreasonable in the <i>Wednesbury </i>sense, and as such <i>ultra vires</i>. The House held that the tenant was entitled to raise this contention by way of defence in the County Court in answer to the local authority’s claim for the increased rent, and was not required to challenge the local authority’s decisions to increase the rent by judicial review (for which the tenant had in fact already been refused leave as being out of time). In paragraph 110 in <i>Kay </i>the House expressly equated a challenge to the reasonableness of a local authority’s decision to recover possession with the situation in <i>Wandsworth LBC v. Winder</i>. So, if a local authority’s decision to serve notice to quit is invalid because unreasonable, it is clear that <i>Wandsworth LBC v. Winder </i>would enable this to be raised by way of defence. It follows that, even under gateway (b) as expressed in paragraph 110 in <i>Kay</i>, I would (in common I understand with all of your Lordships) hold that there was an arguable defence based on conventional or domestic common law grounds, and that the matter should be remitted to the High Court for its determination on the facts and in the light of the common law principles of judicial review discussed in paragraphs 133 to 136 above.</p>
<p class="para">140.&nbsp;&nbsp;The question thus arises, on the way I approach this appeal, whether the House should now, after <i>McCann, </i>reconsider and expand gateway (b) in <i>Kay</i>. Should gateway (b) now permit judicial review on full Human Rights Convention grounds (effectively adopting the minority approach in <i>Kay</i>)?  If gateway (b) in <i>Kay </i>is understood in the more limited sense indicated in paragraphs 133 to 136 above, and if the view be taken which I understand the majority of your Lordships to take, that the House should (<i>McCann</i> notwithstanding) apply <i>Kay</i>, then it follows that any remission to the High Court must be limited to reconsideration of whether the decision to serve notice to quit was invalid on conventional or domestic judicial review grounds. On this approach, that <i>Kay</i> is simply binding, it is unnecessary to go into the reasons which may or may not lie behind <i>Kay</i>, and in particular unnecessary to consider s.6(2)(b) of the Human Rights Act. </p>
<i><p class="para">Human Rights Act s.6(2)(b)</p></i>
<p class="para">141.&nbsp;&nbsp;S.6(2)(b) raises difficult and important issues, which were not fully or adequately addressed either in the parties’ written cases or in oral argument and on which I would have wished to hear further argument had it been critical to the outcome to decide them. S.6(2) was mentioned only briefly and very generally in the parties’ written cases, and it was only after Mr Ashley Underwood QC for the respondents had indicated the nature of the respondents’ reliance on s.6(2) during the morning of the second and last hearing day that Mr Luba QC and Mr Sales QC asked the House after the midday adjournment for permission for Mr Sales to make further submissions specifically directed to it. Mr Sales’s submissions, made with the benefit of the midday adjournment, were well focused but in the circumstances brief. They included a submission that s.6(2)(b) of the 1998 Act should be narrowly interpreted (particularly having regard to s.3 of that Act) and that otherwise the protection intended by the 1998 Act would be radically cut down. They included a reference to <i>R v. Kansal (No. 2)</i> [2001] UKHL 62; [2002] 2 AC 69, a very different case from the present on any view as my noble and learned friend, Lord Hope, indicates in paragraph 39 of his speech. No reference was made to any other relevant authority on the scope of s.6(2)(b), and in particular none to <i>R (Wilkinson) v. Inland Revenue Commissioners </i>[2002] STC 347 (Moses J); [2005] UKHL 30; [2005] 1 WLR 1718 or to <i>R (Hooper) v. Secretary of State for Work and Pensions </i>[2005] UKHL 29; [2005] 1 WLR 1681, authorities which only came to the attention of the House during the preparation of the present speeches. There was no analysis of any role that s.6(2)(b) may have played in the reasoning of the majority in <i>Kay</i>. In these circumstances, the ambit of s.6(2)(b) must, I think, await further examination and determination in a case where this arises squarely for determination and is fully argued. My own following observations on the subject, made without the benefit of submissions on these and other authorities or texts, must be seen as tentative and provisional. </p>
<p class="para">142.&nbsp;&nbsp;Logically, the first question ought perhaps to be whether the reasoning in <i>Kay </i>binds the House to conclude that s.6(2)(b) covers the present situation (although the House heard no submission from counsel that <i>Kay</i> turned on s.6(2)(b)). In my opinion it does not.  My noble and learned friend, Lord Hope, was the only member of the House mentioning s.6(2)(b) (see in particular paragraphs 86 and 114). S.6(2)(b) is not mentioned in paragraph 110 (the one paragraph around which the majority all grouped) or in counsels’ reported arguments on any side in <i>Kay</i> (see Mr Arden QC’s argument reported at p.478 and Mr Sales QC’s argument at p.480B-G) and it was not addressed by any member of the minority (see Lord Bingham of Cornhill in para.39, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead in para. 59 and Lord Walker in para.176).  Further, although they subscribed to paragraph 110, Lord Scott in paragraph 171 and Baroness Hale in paragraphs 189 to 193 did not identify article 8 as legally irrelevant, but concluded that it was irrelevant on the facts of the cases before them. </p>
<p class="para">143.&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the basis on which a majority was able to subscribe to paragraph 110 in <i>Kay </i>was that, as a matter of pragmatism and policy and in the light of <i>Qazi</i>, the more sensitive Convention grounds were to be regarded as satisfied by Parliament when devising the statutory scheme, while a local authority’s actual decision to seek possession was only to be reviewable under gateway (b), i.e. only if it could be seen to be palpably wrong on the more restrictive “conventional common law” grounds of judicial review. That is what I understand my noble and learned friend Lord Scott to have been saying at paragraphs 170 to 173, Baroness Hale at paragraphs 190 to 193 and Lord Brown at paragraphs 203 to 211.</p>
<p class="para">144.&nbsp;&nbsp;The background to <i>Hooper</i> is summarised by my noble and learned friend, Lord Walker, in paragraphs 110 and 111 of his speech. In <i>Hooper</i>, [2002] EWHC 191 (Admin), Moses J, after considering previous authority, drew a distinction between (a) situations where compatibility of outcome with the Convention could only be achieved by exercising a statutory discretion one way in every case, as in<i> Kansal (No. 2) </i>and <i>R (Holding &amp; Barnes plc) v. Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions </i>[2001] JPL 291; [2001] 1 All ER 929 (later overruled on another ground under the title <i>R (Alconbury Developments Ltd.) v. Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions</i> [2001] UKHL 23; [2003] 2 AC 295) and (b) situations where whether the discretion had to be exercised in a particular way in order to ensure a Convention-compatible result would depend on the particular factual circumstances, as in <i>R (Friends Provident Life &amp; Pensions Ltd.) v. Secretary of State for Transport </i>[2001] EWHC 820. </p>
<p class="para">145.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moses J held in <i>Hooper </i>(para. 183) that </p>
<p class="paraleft">“the fatal flaw in the claimants’ argument is that its effect is to convert the power to make an extra-statutory payment into a duty. It destroys the power altogether. There are no circumstances in which the defendant could exercise a power not to give a benefit.” </p>
<p class="para">146.&nbsp;&nbsp;He went on in paragraph 185:</p>
<p class="paraleft">“The claimants’ submissions as to s.6 come ….. perilously close to a submission that the court should impose a duty to grant benefits where Parliament has chosen not to do so. The defendant gives effect to the primary legislation by declining to recognise that duty.”</p>
