<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;144.&nbsp;&nbsp;The paragraph 11C allegations about investing and making savings were either denied by the Revenue or were not admitted.  The Revenue said they were required by statute to place their revenue receipts in a Bank of England account over which the Treasury had control (see para.7D of the Re-Amended Defence).  Park J, in his judgment, examined the interest issue solely from the point of view of Sempra (see paras.31 to 43).  He asked himself, in effect, what Sempra<i> </i>had lost by its loss of use of the ACT.  He took the view that the ECJ judgment required interest to be awarded in respect of that loss whether the claim was for compensation or was a restitutionary claim. This, in my respectful opinion, was a misreading of the <i>Metallgesellschaft/Hoescht </i>judgment.  Because of this the judge did not ask himself whether a benefit <i>had</i> been obtained by the Revenue from the mistaken ACT payments, whether that benefit was quantifiable in money terms, and, if so, how it should be quantified.  The same features are apparent in Chadwick LJ's judgment in the Court of Appeal.  In paragraph 49 he said, by way of summary, this -</p>
<p></p><ul>"In my view the judge was correct to hold that the task of the national court was to give effect to the decision of [the ECJ] by providing the remedy in respect of <i>the loss suffered by the taxpayer </i>by reason of the premature payment of [ACT] which Community law requires.  That remedy is <i>full compensation for the loss of the use </i>of money.  The measure of <i>compensation </i>is interest accrued on the money over the premature payment period" (emphasis added).<p></p></ul>
<p>This may be unexceptional and correct in relation to an action for compensation.  It is not, in my opinion, in the least apt in an action for restitution.  In an action of restitution it is the position of the recipient of the mistaken payment, and the benefit, if any, that the recipient has obtained from the money, on which attention should be concentrated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;145.&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of your Lordships have taken the view that the Revenue's unjust enrichment consists of the benefit of having had Sempra's money available for use for the period between payment of the ACT and set-off (see Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead para 66) and that the domestic law on restitution should be developed so as to allow a restitutionary claim for interest, including compound interest, in order to place an objective value on that benefit. My Lords I find myself unable to accept the premise on which this proposed development is based, namely that the mere possession of mistakenly paid money - and accordingly the ability to use it if minded to do so - is sufficient to justify not simply a restitutionary remedy for recovery of the money, but a remedy also for recovery of the wholly conceptual benefit of an ability to use the money. Why should a restitutionary remedy be concerned with a benefit that is no more than conceptual? The mistake that had been made and on which the restitutionary claim is based was the mistake of the payer, Sempra in the instant case. The restitutionary claim is not based on any wrongdoing on the part of the recipient, the Revenue in the instant case. If it were so based it would be a compensation claim attracting a different limitation period. So it is not so based. I therefore repeat the question, differently phrased - why should an innocent recipient of a payment that the claimant has made by mistake be required to restore to the claimant anything additional to the amount of the payment and any actual benefit that the recipient has obtained from the payment?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;146.&nbsp;&nbsp;My noble and learned friend Lord Nicholls, in paragraphs 116 to 118 of his opinion, has treated the "time value of money, measured objectively." (para 117) as the measure of a benefit of which restitution should be made and, accordingly, as the basis on which the Revenue should be required to make restitution to Sempra of the benefit of receiving the "huge interest free loan constituted by Sempra's payment of ACT" (para 118). But what is the value of a loan if the recipient has done nothing with it, has derived no actual benefit from it and has paid it back to the lender? An additional payment required to be made by the payee in those circumstances is not restitution; it is compensation to the payer for being out of his money. The cases referred to by Lord Nicholls in paragraph 116, and referred to also by Lord Mance in paragraph 230 of his opinion, all concerned compensation to the victim for a wrongful act that had caused no actual loss to the victim but had provided a benefit to the wrongdoer. They were cases where the compensation held to be payable to the victim was measured by the value of the benefit taken by the wrongdoer. These cases established a valuable and coherent principle of compensation for cases in which the victim of a wrong had suffered no actual loss but, in my respectful opinion, have nothing to do with cases where there is no wrongdoer, no case for compensation, but simply the need for restitution of the extent of an unjust enrichment that has been received. If there has been no enrichment, the mistaken payment having been restored, the question of what is just or unjust does not arise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;147.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, the inquiry that should have been made in the present case was whether the Revenue had derived any actual benefit from the premature receipt of Sempra's money. The rate at which the Government can borrow in the market at the relevant times would be, in my opinion, irrelevant unless there were evidence to justify the conclusion that the Government's borrowing in the market was less because of that premature receipt than it would otherwise have been. There was no such evidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;148.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, in my opinion, this is not a case in which, on the evidence before Park J, any interest, whether simple or compound, should be ordered to be paid by the Revenue as part of a restitutionary remedy to Sempra for its mistaken payment of ACT. I agree that, in relation to Sempra's cause of action in tort, Sempra is entitled to recover its losses brought about by the Revenue's unlawful demand for ACT and that those losses could well include compound interest on the sums paid. But, as is common ground, Sempra's tort remedy is, for Limitation Act reasons, abbreviated.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summary</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;149.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion the remedy which enables Sempra<i>, </i>and other subsidiaries in the same position, to be compensated for the loss caused by premature payment of ACT is a remedy in tort or for breach of statute.  That remedy complies fully with the requirements of domestic law demanded by the ECJ in the <i>Metallgesellschaft/Hoechst </i>case.  A remedy for recovery of money paid under a mistake of law cannot lead to compensatory damages unless it is also based on a wrongful act.  To the extent that it is so based it will be an action in tort or for breach of statute.  The claim to recover interest based upon the interest that would have been earned if the money used to pay the ACT had instead been placed on deposit with a bank, or upon the interest that would have been saved if the money had been used to repay borrowings, is a claim for compensatory damages.  To dress that claim up as a restitutionary remedy for money paid under a mistake of law is unacceptable. To alter the claim to one requiring disgorgement by the Revenue of the benefit it has derived from the premature payments is, in principle, acceptable but fails for the want of any evidence that the Revenue did derive any benefit from the payments. A benefit cannot be simply assumed. Mere possession of money for a period is not a benefit to be valued and disgorged.  I would, therefore, dismiss the appeal so far as it relates to Sempra's claim in tort but allow the appeal so far as it relates to Sempra's claim in restitution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;150.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a final point to which I should refer, namely, whether, if the law does allow Sempra a claim to interest as a restitutionary remedy, the remedy should be regarded as a remedy as of right or as an equitable, and therefore discretionary, remedy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;151.&nbsp;&nbsp;The discussion about whether interest on money paid by mistake can be recovered as part of a restitutionary remedy has led your Lordships to consider claims to interest on debts, on contractual damages, and on tortious damages as well as on money paid by mistake.  I concur with your Lordships in concluding that interest, whether simple or compound, can represent an item of contractual damages or tortious damages, subject to the normal rules applicable to such claims.  I take the view that a claim to interest as part of a restitutionary remedy for money paid by mistake can and, subject to change of position defences should be, accepted if the interest has actually been earned, but not otherwise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;152.&nbsp;&nbsp;As to interest on debts, Parliament has, in section 35A of the Supreme Court Act 1981, provided a discretionary power for the court to award simple interest where proceedings are brought for the recovery of the debt, or for the recovery of contractual or tortious damages.  This power enables interest to be awarded notwithstanding that the interest could not, for remoteness of damage or other reasons, qualify for award as an item of damages.  As Lord Mance has pointed out (para. 221 of his opinion), the Arbitration Act 1996 conferred a discretionary power on arbitration tribunals to award, unless the parties had otherwise agreed, simple or compound interest on sums awarded in the arbitration and the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998 provided, in certain circumstances, a right to simple interest on certain commercial debts.  Moreover, where statutory debts are concerned - fiscal debts owing to the Revenue and council tax owing to local authorities are obvious examples but there are many others - payment of interest on debts that are overdue for payment is either provided for by statute or cannot be recovered.  In these circumstances it seems to me that it would be inappropriate for your Lordships, acting judicially, to seek to improve on what Parliament has enacted regarding the payment of interest on unpaid debts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;153.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Mance has made clear in his opinion that recovery in a claim in restitution for money had and received of interest on the sum of money in question should be "contingent upon proof of actual benefit acquired by the recipient".  I respectfully agree, but am unable to agree that that recovery should be regarded as discretionary.  The recovery is, under established common law rules, subject to change of position defences.  What, in a particular case, would constitute a sufficient change of position to enable the recipient to resist an order for recovery of interest actually earned, or of the value of some other benefit acquired by the recipient by use of the principal money, would be a subject of judgmental decision in each case.  The decision might, in the ordinary use of language, depend on where the judge thought the equities lay, what the judge thought was fair (see the discussion about change of position in Goff &amp; Jones The Law of Restitution<i> </i>7th ed (2007) Chap. 40).  But this would not turn the remedy into a discretionary one.  In my opinion, the restitutionary remedy, a common law remedy, has all the ingredients for a fair and just result to be reached.  I can see no need for an ancillary equitable jurisdiction and your Lordships should not, in my opinion, construct one.</p>
<p><b>LORD WALKER OF GESTINGTHORPE</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<i><p><i></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
</i><p><i><i>Introduction</i></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;154.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the privilege of reading in draft the opinions of my noble and learned friends Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead and Lord Hope of Craighead.  I am essentially in agreement with them, and I too would dismiss this appeal, largely for the reasons which they give. But because of the importance of the issues before the House I add some observations of my own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;155.&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue in this appeal is the principles to be applied in quantifying the award to be made to Sempra Metals Ltd ("Sempra"), by way of damages or restitution, for the detriment that Sempra suffered as a result of the United Kingdom's corporation tax regime being contrary to EU law. That the regime did contravene EU law was established by the Court of Justice ("the ECJ") in a judgment delivered on 8 March 2001 in <i>Metallgesellschaft Limited v IRC</i> and <i>Hoechst AG v IRC </i> (joined cases C-397/98 and C-410/98) ("<i>Hoechst</i>") reported at [2001] Ch 620.  Sempra is the same company, under a new name, as Metallgesellschaft Limited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;156.&nbsp;&nbsp;The precise issue originally before the Court is set out in para 9(ii) of a Group Litigation Order ("the GLO") made by the Chief Chancery Master on 26 November 2001. The issue is subdivided into two elements: </p>
<p></p><ul>"(A)&nbsp;&nbsp;Where an amount of advance corporation tax ["ACT"] has been set off against a UK company's corporation tax liability or has been surrendered to another group company or has been carried back and set off against the UK company's corporation tax liability arising in an earlier year, at what rate and for what period and on what basis is interest due in calculating the damages and/or restitution in respect of the loss of use of the sum paid as ACT?<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(B)&nbsp;&nbsp;At what rate and for what period and on what basis is interest due on the amount calculated in accordance with (A) above?"<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said at once that the answer to the second element of the issue is not in dispute. Park J decided that the interest should be simple interest under section 35A of the Supreme Court Act 1981 (as inserted by the Administration of Justice Act 1982), leaving the rate or rates to be determined later if the parties could not agree. There is no appeal from that (though I agree with Lord Nicholls' observation, in para 129 of his opinion, that Sempra might have challenged it).  It is the first element of the issue that has given rise to acute controversy.  Park J decided ([2004] STC 1178) that the calculation should be effected on the basis of compound interest (with the rate or rates and appropriate rests to be determined later if the parties could not agree) and his decision was upheld (subject to a small drafting amendment) by the Court of Appeal ([2005] STC 687).  That is the issue which is now before your Lordships' House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;157.&nbsp;&nbsp;The quantification issue is only one of several important issues, with far-reaching financial implications, that have been or are being litigated under the GLO.  There are also other group litigation orders raising similar points in connection with Article 43 or Article 56 of the Treaty.  The background of the statutory material as to various group reliefs (and in particular group income elections postponing liability for payment of ACT) is by now very familiar to practitioners in this field.  It has been covered in many judgments, the most recent being the speeches in this House in <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Group plc v IRC</i> [2007] 1 AC 558 ("<i>DMG</i>").  It is unnecessary to repeat the statutory material in any detail. For present purposes the essential point is that a United Kingdom subsidiary which paid a dividend to a holding company established in another member state was deprived of the opportunity of making a group income election and so deferring payment of ACT until mainstream corporation tax ("MCT") became payable on the subsidiary's profits.  This period would normally be between eight and a half and seventeen and a half months in duration (Peter Gibson LJ gave a full explanation of this in <i>Pirelli Cable Holding NV v IRC</i> [2004]  STC 130, para 8) but the deferment might be longer if (because of double taxation relief or for some other reason) the subsidiary had insufficient taxable profits to attract liability to MCT at least as great as the ACT already paid.  When sufficient MCT did sooner or later become payable (and was paid before the issue of any writ) what the subsidiary lost was the time value of what it had paid in ACT for a period which had a minimum duration of eight and a half months, but could in exceptional circumstances continue for several years.  In this case the shortest period was just under one year and the longest was almost ten years (the details are set out in paras 62 and 63 of Lord Nicholls' opinion).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;158.&nbsp;&nbsp;The hearing before Park J occupied three days.  This may seem a surprisingly short period since (as your Lordships were told) there was a very large volume of evidence in the form of witness statements from expert and non-expert witnesses and copious documentary evidence of a financial nature.  In the event, however, the expert witnesses were not cross-examined, and oral evidence from the non-expert witnesses was deferred.  That was because the judge, at the urging of Mr Glick QC for the Revenue, and without strong opposition from Mr Rabinowitz QC for Sempra, decided that the amount of any damages or restitutionary award should be computed on what Mr Glick called a "conventional" basis—that is, on general principles rather than by reference to the particular financial circumstances of the claimant (or the financial circumstances, so far as they sensibly admit of enquiry, of the Revenue): see [2004] STC 1178, paras 13 and 18 to 22.  It seems that the judge may have been given an over-estimate of the number of other cases which raise this issue: between 50 and 70 was, your Lordships were told, much too high a figure.  The judge's decision that the award should be quantified on a "conventional" basis was not a ground of appeal before the Court of Appeal.  But this point has to some extent been reopened before your Lordships.</p>
<i></i><p><i><i>Should there be another reference under Article 234 EC?</i></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;159.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first matter that your Lordships have to consider is whether to make a reference to the ECJ under Article 234 EC.  At the beginning of the appeal hearing the House decided not to make an immediate reference but to proceed to hear argument on the substantive issues raised in the appeal.  Having heard the argument I feel sure that was the right decision, and that your Lordships should resolve this appeal without a further reference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;160.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have already noted, Sempra is the same company, under a new name, as Metallgesellschaft Ltd, the plaintiff in the proceedings (Ch 1995 M 7327) commenced by writ on 23 November 1995.  On 2 October 1998 Neuberger J referred five questions to the ECJ under Article 234 EC.  The ECJ's judgment of 8 March 2001 ([2001] Ch 620) provided detailed answers to the first, second and fifth questions.  The answer to the second question (in paras 77 to 96 of the judgment) has already given the ECJ's considered view on the central issue in this appeal.  This part of the judgment is not without its difficulties, as the argument before your Lordships has amply demonstrated.  It will be necessary to make detailed reference to the ECJ's judgment at a later stage.  But I venture to suggest that its general thrust is that causes of action and remedies for any breach of EU law are matters for national law and the national courts, subject always to the very important EU principles of equivalence and effectiveness.  The ECJ spelled out some of the implications, in relation to remedies, of the principle of effectiveness.  In my opinion it would serve no useful purpose to make a further reference seeking fuller elucidation of the principles stated in paras 77 to 96 of the judgment, or practical guidance as to how those principles should be implemented.  I think it is predictable that on a further reference the answer would amount to <i>quod scripsi, scripsi.</i></p>
<i>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;161.&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate that the questions put to the ECJ in <i>Hoechst</i> did not refer in terms to compound interest.  But had they done so the answer would surely have been that any choice between simple and compound interest was for the national court, subject always to the principles of equivalence and effectiveness.  There is the complication that the Court of Appeal has on 6 February 2006 made a reference to the ECJ in a value added tax case, <i>British Telecommunications plc v Commissioners for HM Revenue and Customs</i> C-185/06, raising three questions in relation to tax paid by mistake but voluntarily (and not as a result of any unlawful demand or an unlawful tax regime) in circumstances where the tax authority did not contribute to the mistake and had no reason to be aware of it (the mistake was in BT's accounting software).  The third of the questions relates specifically to simple or compound interest.  However your Lordships were told (in the course of the further oral argument on 16 May 2007) that the reference is likely to be withdrawn.  In any case it is speculative whether the ECJ's answer to the third question (if it arises, which is far from certain) will assist in the resolution of the appeal now before your Lordships, because both the facts and the legal issues are so different.  In my opinion we must make what we can of the guidance already given by the ECJ in this very case.</p>
<i></i><p><i><i>Interest under national law</i></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;162.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is common ground, since this House's decision in <i>DMG</i> [2006]  3 WLR 781, that domestic law offers Sempra three possible causes of action in respect of its premature payments of ACT under a tax regime which contravened EU law.  These are</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;an action for damages (in the nature of an action for breach of statutory duty: see <i>R v Secretary of State for Transport ex parte Factortame Ltd (No. 7)</i> [2001] 1 WLR 942, paras 143-158);</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;a restitutionary claim for repayment of tax unlawfully exacted; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;a restitutionary claim for money paid under a mistake of law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these claims are put forward in Sempra's much-amended statement of claim.  The ECJ has made clear in <i>Hoechst</i> that the appropriate remedy is to be determined by the national court (and therefore, so far as national law permits a claimant to choose between different causes of action available to him, by the claimant).  The Revenue's position is that whichever of the three roads Sempra chooses to follow, it cannot lead to an award of more than simple interest.  Nothing in the ECJ judgment, the Revenue argues, requires compound interest.  The Revenue argues with particular vigour that compound interest cannot be awarded if Sempra follows the mistake of law route.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;163.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Hoechst</i> the ECJ deliberately avoided taking up any position as to the content of national law (the Advocate-General had in his opinion, paras 12 and 46, referred to <i>President of India v La Pintada Compania Navigacion SA</i> [1985]  AC 104 —"<i>La Pintada</i>"—but the ECJ did not go into any of that detail).  But it is impossible to apply the principles of equivalence and effectiveness without first considering the present state of English law as to the award of interest (either as interest on a principal sum, or as damages, or as a restitutionary remedy).  So in my view your Lordships have no alternative but to embark on that burdensome task.  The burden is to some extent lightened since your Lordships have the benefit of counsel's careful and wide-ranging researches, reflected in the judgments below in this case, and also in the judgments given in the Court of Appeal in <i>NEC Semi-Conductors Ltd v Inland Revenue Commissioners</i> [2006] STC 606 (especially Mummery LJ at paras 163-175). It is nevertheless an unwelcome task.  The Law Commission has recently expressed the view (Pre-Judgment Interest on Debts and Damages Law Com. No. 287, para 1.15) that:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The current system of awarding interest is muddled and out-of-date.  It is difficult to justify to litigants, and gives the impression that the legal system is living in the past."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also some pertinent observations by Lord Goff of Chieveley in <i>Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington LBC</i> [1996] AC 669, 684  ("<i>Westdeutsche</i>"):</p>
<p></p><ul>"One would expect to find, in any developed system of law, a comprehensive and reasonably simple set of principles by virtue of which the courts have power to award interest … . Sadly, however, that is not the position in English law."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;164.&nbsp;&nbsp;In his opinion Lord Nicholls has traced the history of the rule in <i>Page v Newman </i> (1829)  9 B&amp;C 378 since it was first stated, in wide and blunt terms, by Lord Tenterden CJ (at 380):</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is a rule sanctioned by the practice of more than half a century, that money lent does not carry interest."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My noble and learned friend has described how this questionable rule survived reviews by this House in <i>London, Chatham and Dover Railway Co v South Eastern Railway Co.</i> [1893] AC 429, <i>La Pintada</i> [1985] 1 AC 104 and <i>Westdeutsche </i>[1996] AC 669, but has been progressively eroded by statutory intervention and by judicial recognition that the rule does not exclude the award of interest as special damages.  The point was aptly expressed by Ward LJ in <i>Hartle v Laceys</i> [1999]  Lloyds Reports PN 315, 327:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The issue here is not about interest <i>on</i> damages but about interest as damages."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thrust of Lord Nicholls' observations on interest benefits and restitution (paras 101 et seq of his opinion) might be encapsulated similarly as being 'not about interest <i>on</i> restitution but about interest <i>as</i> restitution.'  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;165.&nbsp;&nbsp;I respectfully agree with Lord Nicholls that the distinction which Lord Brandon drew in <i>La Pintada</i> between damages under the two limbs in <i>Hadley v Baxendale</i> (1854) 9 Exch 341 is unsound, and should no longer be used (see the observations of Mason CJ and Wilson J in the High Court of Australia in <i>Hungerfords v Walker</i> (1989) 171 CLR 125, 141-142).  I cannot usefully add anything about interest as damages.  But I wish to add something about interest on (or as) a restitutionary award.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;166.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a topic which has until recently attracted relatively little attention from English restitution scholars.  The most extensive treatment may be the chapter entitled "Interest" by Professor Francis Rose in Birks &amp; Rose, eds. <i>Lessons of the Swaps Litigation</i>, (2000) pp291-328.  There is also a useful survey by Professor Andrew Burrows in his <i>The Law of Restitution</i> (2nd ed, 2002) pp53-56.  English and Australian authorities on the topic are considered in chapter 28 of <i>Mason &amp; Carter, Restitution Law in Australia</i> (1995) pp945-967, and in part 1 of <i>Edelman and Cassidy, Interest Awards in Australia</i> (2003) pp92-115.  Like Lord Hope I have been assisted by an article by Steven Elliott, "Rethinking Interest on Withheld and Misapplied Trust Money" (2001) 65 Conv.313.  I gratefully acknowledge my debt to all these materials.</p>
