<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nervous shock forms a particular chapter of the law.  A defendant may owe a duty of care not only to the person whom he injures but also to that person's parents or spouse who suffer nervous shock through seeing or hearing the event or its immediate aftermath:  <i>McLoughlin v O'Brian </i>[1983] 1 AC 410.  Medical mishaps can give rise to such a duty.  So, for example, where doctors negligently failed to carry out a Caesarean section and the baby died two days later, the health authority were liable to the parents who developed a psychiatric illness as a result of the shocking and direct impact of the delivery and of the baby's struggle for life:  <i>Tredget and Tredget v Bexley Health Authority </i>[1994] 5 Med LR 178.  Similarly, in <i>North Glamorgan NHS Trust v Walters </i>[2003] Lloyd's Rep Med 49, a mother recovered damages for the pathological grief reaction which she suffered as a result of witnessing, experiencing and participating in the events leading up to her baby's death due to the defendants' negligent failure to diagnose his condition.  In the present cases, however, the appellants do not allege that they suffered nervous shock in that way and so their claims do not come within the reach of that distinct line of authority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108.&nbsp;&nbsp;That being so, on the assumption that the appellants are claiming the same duty of care as was owed to their children, it seems to me that there would have to be some factor, over and above the foreseeable harm which the parents suffered, before the law would hold that the doctors and parents were in sufficient proximity to give rise to a duty of care.  Mr Langstaff suggested that the necessary degree of proximity could be found in the fact that the parents themselves had taken the children to see the doctor.  That is indeed what happened in these cases.  But in itself this can hardly be a criterion for attaching liability to the defendants.  For example, there is nothing in the nervous shock cases to suggest that taking the child to the hospital would, in itself, create the necessary proximity for a successful claim by her parents.  Something more, by way of actually experiencing the critical event, is required.  More generally, it would in my view be unacceptable for a doctor to be liable in damages to a father who took his daughter to the surgery, but not to a father whose daughter happened to be taken by someone else who was looking after her for the day when her symptoms developed.  If that supposed distinction is rejected, I am unable to see why it would be fair, just and reasonable for the doctors to owe the parents a duty of care of this kind when, for instance, a defendant who negligently injures a child travelling in his car owes no duty of care to the parents who may foreseeably develop a psychiatric illness as a result of the strain of caring for her.  I would therefore reject the appellants' submission that the defendants owed substantially the same duty of care to the parents as to the children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, counsel for the appellants was anxious to present their case as one where the duty to the child and the duty to the child's parents in effect coincided.  In this way he sought to outflank the objection that there is a potential conflict of interest between the child and the parents in a case of alleged child abuse.  But this bland version of the supposed duty of care underplays, if it does not eliminate, what I would regard as the most powerful element in the case for the appellants:  that by concluding that the children had been the subject of abuse or deliberate harm, the doctors simultaneously indicated that the appellants <i>themselves</i> had been responsible for the abuse or harm.  It was, one might suppose, this devastating suggestion which caused the appellants the distress that resulted in their illness.  As the High Court of Australia put it in <i>Sullivan v Moody </i>(2001) 207 CLR 562, 581, para 54, "the core of the complaint by each appellant is that he [or she] was injured as a result of what he [or she], and others, were told."  It is precisely this very personal defamatory wound which distinguishes their claims from, say, the claims of parents who become ill due to the strain of caring for a child who has become disabled as a result of a surgeon's negligence.  On this more focussed approach the health authority would be under a specific duty to take reasonable care to avoid causing a parent psychiatric injury by concluding that he had abused or harmed his child.  Viewed in isolation, much might indeed be said for a duty of this kind which would mean that, when deciding how to proceed where they suspected that a child had been abused, the doctors would have to take account of the very real risk of harming the parents in this way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110.&nbsp;&nbsp;In considering whether it would be fair, just and reasonable to impose such a duty, a court has to have regard, however, to all the circumstances and, in particular, to the doctors' admitted duty to the children.  The duty to the children is simply to exercise reasonable care and skill in diagnosing and treating any condition from which they may be suffering.  In carrying out that duty the doctors have regard only to the interests of the children.  Suppose, however, that they were also under a duty to the parents not to cause them psychiatric harm by concluding that they might have abused their child.  Then, in deciding how to proceed, the doctors would always have to take account of the risk that they might harm the parents in this way.  There would be not one but two sets of interests to be considered.  Acting on, or persisting in, a suspicion of abuse might well be reasonable when only the child's interests were engaged, but unreasonable if the interests of the parents had also to be taken into account.  Of its very nature, therefore, this kind of duty of care to the parents would cut across the duty of care to the children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111.&nbsp;&nbsp;The need to put the interests of the child first in any case of suspected abuse is a theme which runs through the guidance in <i>Working Together </i>(1991) which was issued under section 7 of the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970.  Doctors and social workers must be alert to possible signs of abuse.  If they suspect that a child is suffering, or is at risk of suffering, significant harm, they should refer their concern to the appropriate agency (para 5.11.1).  They are specifically warned, moreover, that the interests of parents and children may conflict and that in such cases the child's interests should be the priority (para 6.12).  The real dangers of such a potential conflict are more than amply vouched by the statements of Professor Sir Alan Craft and Mary Marsh which my noble and learned friend, Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood, has quoted.  I see no basis whatever for brushing them aside.  On the contrary, the appropriate response of the law is to recognise and minimise these dangers.  It does so by holding that in these cases the doctors do not owe a duty of care to the parents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112.&nbsp;&nbsp;That was indeed the response of Sir Thomas Bingham MR in <i>X (Minors) v Bedfordshire County Council </i>[1995] 2 AC 633, 665G - H, where he held that the psychiatrist owed a duty of care to the child whom she was examining, but no duty of care to the child's mother:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The psychiatrist would in my view have recognised the mother as someone foreseeably likely to be injured if, as a result of her advice, the child were to be taken away from the mother.  But the mother was not in any meaningful sense the psychiatrist's patient.  The psychiatrist's duty was to act in the interests of the child, and that might very well mean acting in a way that would be adverse to the personal interests of the mother;  she was concerned with those interests only to the extent that they could have an impact on the interests of the child.  In this situation of potential conflict, I do not think the psychiatrist can arguably be said to have owed a duty of care to the mother, whose claim it was accordingly right to strike out."<p></p></ul>
<p>This House, of course, went further and held that the psychiatrist owed no duty of care to the child.  But there is nothing in the speech of Lord Browne-Wilkinson which would cast any doubt on Sir Thomas Bingham's analysis, on the assumption that such a duty was in fact owed to the child.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113.&nbsp;&nbsp;The High Court of Australia came to a similar conclusion in <i>Sullivan v Moody </i>(2001) 207 CLR 562.  Parents had been suspected of abusing their children.  They asserted that the doctors and social workers, operating under a statutory scheme for protecting children, owed them a duty of care.  Rejecting that argument, their Honours noted, p 582, para 60, that while someone might be under duties to more than one person, nevertheless "if a suggested duty of care would give rise to inconsistent obligations, that would ordinarily be a reason for denying that the duty exists."  They went on to note that the statutory scheme required the medical practitioners to treat the interests of the children as paramount.  In these circumstances, they said, p 582, para 62:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It would be inconsistent with the proper and effective discharge of those responsibilities that they should be subjected to a legal duty, breach of which would sound in damages, to take care to protect persons who were suspected of being the sources of that harm.  The duty for which the appellants contend cannot be reconciled satisfactorily, either with the nature of the functions being exercised by the respondents, or with their statutory obligation to treat the interests of the children as paramount.  As to the former, the functions of examination, and reporting, require, for their effective discharge, an investigation into the facts without apprehension as to possible adverse consequences for people in the position of the appellants or legal liability to such persons.  As to the latter, the interests of the children, and those suspected of causing their harm, are diverse, and irreconcilable.  That they are irreconcilable is evident when regard is had to the case in which examination of a child alleged to be a victim of abuse does not allow the examiner to form a definite opinion about whether the child had been abused, only a suspicion that it <i>may </i>have happened.  The interests of the child, in such a case, would favour reporting that the suspicion of abuse has not been dispelled;  the interests of a person suspected of the abuse would be to the opposite effect."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114.&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, in <i>B and others v Attorney General of New Zealand </i>[2003] 4 All ER 833, para 30, my noble and learned friend, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, giving the judgment of the Privy Council, pointed out that in an investigation of alleged child abuse, the father, as the alleged perpetrator of the abuse, stood in a very different position from the child, as the alleged victim of that abuse.  To impose a common law duty of care in favour of the alleged victims and, at one and the same time, in favour of the alleged perpetrator would not be satisfactory.  The Board accordingly eliminated the risk of any potential conflict of interests by holding that those investigating alleged abuse owed no common law duty of care to the father.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unnecessary to multiply these citations.  They constitute powerful support for the Court of Appeal's conclusion, [2004] QB 558, 591, para 86, that there are cogent reasons of public policy for holding that no common law duty of care should be owed to the parents.  I respectfully agree with their view and would accordingly hold that it is not fair just and reasonable to impose such a duty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sake of completeness, I add two points.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, if, contrary to my view, a duty of care were to be imposed in favour of the parents in these cases, I could see no proper basis for then failing to extend it to other members of the family, to friends of the family, to teachers and to child-minders - in short, to anyone who might come under suspicion of having abused the child.  The potentially wide range of this supposed additional duty could only add to the risk that it would compromise the key duty of care to the children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118.&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, since the relevant events occurred before the Human Rights Act 1998 came into force, the appellants could not seek damages for any possible breach of their rights under article 8(1).  Especially in view of the decisions in <i>Wainwright v Home Office </i>[2004] 2 AC 406, 423, para 34, and <i>R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p  Greenfield </i>[2005] UKHL 14; [2005] 1 WLR 673 I should wish to reserve my opinion as to whether, in such a case, it would be appropriate to modify the common law of negligence, rather than to found any action on the provisions, including section 8, of the Human Rights Act.  Cf <i> Fairlie v Perth and Kinross Healthcare NHS Trust </i>2004 SLT 1200, 1209L, para 36 per Lord Kingarth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, as well as those given by my noble and learned friends, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead and Lord Brown of Eaton-Under-Heywood, with whose speeches I am in entire agreement, I too would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p><b>LORD BROWN OF EATON-UNDER-HEYWOOD</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appellants in these cases are parents who were wrongly suspected of child abuse through the misdiagnosis of their children by doctors.  Each in consequence suffered psychiatric disorder.  In each case the true explanation for the child's condition was not discovered until regrettably late.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first case a five-year old child with multiple severe allergies was wrongly thought instead to have been mistreated by his mother, misdiagnosed as suffering from Munchausen's Syndrome by Proxy.  In the result the child was placed on the "at risk register" for some months.  In the second case a nine-year old child presenting with discoloured skin patches, caused in fact by Schamberg's Disease, was instead provisionally diagnosed as having been sexually abused so that for some weeks her father was prevented from seeing her.  In the third case a two month old child suffered a spiral fracture of the femur whilst being lifted from a settee, an injury wrongly regarded by the doctor as non-accidental although in fact resulting from osteogenesis imperfecta (brittle bone disease), a condition only diagnosed some eight months later when the child suffered bilateral femoral fractures whilst in the care of an aunt under an interim care order.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122.&nbsp;&nbsp;In each case it is to be assumed for the purposes of these appeals that the respective doctors failed in their investigation and diagnosis of the child's condition to exercise reasonable and proper professional care, failures which would render them liable in damages for injuries suffered by anyone to whom they owed a duty of care.  If, indeed, the allegations made in these cases are well-founded (as for present purposes is to be assumed) the doctors appear to have displayed an egregious over-confidence in their own opinions and a marked reluctance to test them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is easy in these circumstances to understand the appellants' evident sense of grievance at their treatment and impossible not to sympathise with them in their plight.  It does not follow, however, that the law should in these circumstances create a right of redress in the parents by imposing upon the doctors a duty of care never previously recognised to exist, a duty not to the child as the patient but rather to the parents in their own right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;124.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said in favour of creating such a duty that the doctor will not thereby be required to act any differently from the way he must already act.  In his care of the child he is bound to consider and investigate any reasonable suspicion that the child may have been abused.  That is a duty which it is now accepted the doctor owes to the child and in discharging it he is required to exercise all reasonable and proper professional care.  If he breaches that duty—whether by negligently failing to recognise the risk of child abuse so that the child is left unprotected against it (which for convenience may be called the negligent non-diagnosis of risk) or by negligently finding a child to be at risk so that he or she is needlessly removed from home (the negligent diagnosis of risk)—the child will have a cause of action for whatever loss he or she may have suffered.  Postulate then, as these appeals do, that the doctor's negligence has been of the second kind, the negligent diagnosis of risk, and that, whether or not the child has suffered loss, the parent forseeably has, in the form of psychiatric injury.  Why should not the doctor be additionally liable for that?  There are, submit the appellants, no sufficient policy considerations militating against such a conclusion; on the contrary "the public policy consideration which has first claim on the loyalty of the law is that wrongs should be remedied"—Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <i>X (Minors) v Bedfordshire County Council</i> [1995] 2 AC 633, 749, approving Sir Thomas Bingham MR's words in the Court of Appeal ([1995] 2 AC 633, 663).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first difficulty with this argument is its apparent irreconcilability with a consistent stream of authority from <i>X v Bedfordshire</i> onwards holding that no duty of care is owed in these circumstances to parents (whatever may be the child's position).  I confine myself to citations from three cases only (each deciding, or at least assuming, that, contrary to the conclusion reached in <i>X v Bedfordshire</i> itself, a duty of care is indeed owed to the child).  First, the opinion of the Privy Council given by my noble and learned friend Lord Nicholls in <i>B v Attorney General of New Zealand</i> [2003]  4 All ER 833, 841: </p>
<p></p><ul>"[T]heir Lordships consider no common law duty of care was owed to the father.  He stands in a very different position.  He was the alleged perpetrator of the abuse.  In an inquiry into an abuse allegation the interests of the alleged perpetrator and of the children as the alleged victims are poles apart.  Those conducting the inquiry must act in good faith throughout.  But to impose a common law duty of care on the department and the individual professionals in favour of the alleged victims or potential victims and, at one and the same time, in favour of the alleged perpetrator would not be satisfactory.  Moreover, a duty of care in favour of the alleged perpetrator would lack the juridical basis on which the exercise of the common law duty of care was largely founded in <i>Prince's</i> case [of the New Zealand Court of Appeal].   The decision in <i>Prince's</i> case rests heavily on the feature that the duty imposed [by the New Zealand legislation] is for the benefit of the particular child.  Self-evidently this statutory duty was not imposed for the benefit of alleged perpetrators of abuse.  To utilise the existence of this statutory duty as the foundation of a common law duty in favour of perpetrators would be to travel far outside the rationale in <i>Prince's </i>case."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;126.&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the present case [2004] QB 558, 591, at para 86:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The Strasbourg cases demonstrate that failure to remove a child from the parents can as readily give rise to a valid claim by the child as a decision to remove the child.  The same is not true of the parents' position.  It will always be in the parents' interests that the child should not be removed.  Thus the child's interests are in potential conflict with the interests of the parents.  In view of this, we consider that there are cogent reasons of public policy for concluding that, where child care decisions are being taken, no common law duty of care should be owed to the parents."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;127.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Hale LJ's judgment in <i>A v Essex County Council</i> [2004]  1 WLR 1881, 1900 :</p>
<p></p><ul>"A balance has to be struck between the interests of all three parties to the adoption triangle, the prospective adopters, the birth parents and the child.  But the agency's first duty is towards the child.  If, therefore, there is to be any duty of care in tort, it should be towards the child.  The child is the most vulnerable person in the whole transaction; the one who is most likely to suffer lasting damage if things go wrong; who rarely has much choice in the matter; and is least able to protect his own interests.  His interests may well conflict with those of any of the adult parties to the triangle."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;128.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is Mr Langstaff QC's submission on behalf of the appellants that these judgments are all founded on a false premise; in truth, he submits, there is no conflict or even potential conflict between the interests of the child and those of the parent.  The child's interests are always paramount.  If the child's interests dictate that the parent be suspected of abuse and the child removed from home, so be it.  There can be no countervailing interest in the parent capable of outweighing the child's interests. Recognising, however, that, if the doctor were to form a wholly unreasonable suspicion of child abuse and in this way negligently cause the child's removal from home he is thereby likely to injure the parent too, the doctor should be liable for that injury no less than for any injury to the child.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;129.&nbsp;&nbsp;The argument, though at first blush plausible, is to my mind unsustainable.  If the doctor is to be held liable in law for any injury to the parent occasioned by the taking of his child into care, that can only be because the doctor, in fulfilling his primary duty to safeguard the child against abuse, also owed the parent a separate duty to take account of his, the parent's interest, in not being unreasonably suspected of child abuse.  I find it impossible to see how such a duty could fail to impact upon the doctor's approach to his task and create a conflict of interest.  Of course, if he acts within the bounds of proper professional skill and care he is liable to no one.  But if he were to act negligently he would know that whereas a negligent non-diagnosis of child abuse would expose him to liability only to the child, a negligent diagnosis based on suspicions unreasonably held would render him liable also to the parent. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;130.&nbsp;&nbsp;Were it possible to harbour doubts on the matter, the evidence now before your Lordships in the form of statements from Professor Sir Alan Craft of the Department of Child Health at Newcastle University and Mary Marsh of the NSPCC must surely resolve them.  Child abuse, it appears, is appallingly prevalent in our society and all too often, alas, undetected.  As Professor Craft explains:</p>
<p></p><ul>"[T]he diagnosis depends upon the doctor rejecting the history that is given.  The small child cannot describe the history, the older child is too frightened and the carer is commonly the perpetrator and gives a false history.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul> … [I]t is something for which paediatricians must always be on the lookout.. . .At the end of the consultation the doctor may well be able to say no more than 'This does not feel quite right'.  . . .[I]t often depends upon a piecing together of a mosaic of evidence from a number of different sources.  The individual professional may feel that there is something 'not quite right' about a case without having the sort of evidence which would convince a court that it is in the child's interest to be taken away from home.  The doctor then has to make a judgment either to share the information with other professionals or to take the easy option and to send the child home, accepting the limitations imposed by his inability to test what the parents have said against other evidence.  Only if the information is shared will it be seen beside other parts of the mosaic so that the picture will emerge. . . . If harm to children is to be reduced, the inevitable implication of this must be that a number of referrals will be made when the evidence of child abuse is at best tentative and where further investigation demonstrates that the concern was ill-founded. … In those cases the child could suffer some damage as a result of the investigations necessary to allay the concern.  However this damage should be temporary and marginal if the matter is properly handled, and comparatively easy to justify if a doctor is not acting irrationally.  By contrast many parents will suffer embarrassment and real distress if the allegation is made, whether it is justified or not and however sensitively it is put.  If a duty of care is imposed in relation to the parent then the risk to the child may increase.  The interests of the child and the parent do not coincide.  In attempting to discharge a duty owed to the parent the paediatrician may decide not to refer a case to the local authority.  If in that case the parent is harming the child then in attempting to discharge the duty to the parent the child will be put at risk of further harm.  In order to discharge their obligations to the child, to protect it from further harm and to protect siblings, a doctor must be allowed to raise what sometimes may be no more than a suspicion with the relevant authorities without fear of litigation from the child's parents."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;131.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary Marsh states:</p>
<p></p><ul>"[T]he work of the NSPCC and others concerned with the protection of children depends crucially on the courage and expertise of doctors.  It is all too easy for the doctor to accept that the evidence presented in a busy Out Patient Clinic was caused as the parent says, and to ignore the subtle signs that should make it clear that returning this child to the home risks life as well as health.  The line of least resistance could easily be more attractive for the doctor: quite apart from the parental pressures, the investigation of such suspicion will self-evidently increase the pressure on cots, waiting lists and the doctor's own time. … We believe that doctors should have a duty to share their suspicions, to say when things do not feel right.  They may have nothing specific to support that feeling, but the one small piece of information they have may when taken with others, reveal the whole picture. ... No-one should be sued for raising the possibility if they are acting bona fide in the interests of the child as they see it. … It is particularly important that the professional, of whatever discipline, recognises that the paramount duty is to the child patient and not the parent.  For most children, happily, there is a congruity of interest between the child and his/her parents.  The parents are the gatekeepers to the child's future.  But for children at risk of abuse, especially those at the most ominous risk, there may not be congruity of interest but rather conflict of interest.  That is why the welfare needs and interests of the child must be paramount."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;132.&nbsp;&nbsp;Those comparatively brief passages from the evidence highlight what in any event seems plain.  Doctors have a vital part to play in combating the risk of child abuse.  Nothing must be done to discourage them in that task.  "The easy option" (Professor Craft), "the line of least resistance" (Mary Marsh), will always be for the doctor to accept the explanations given and to suppress his doubts.  What is needed, however, is that doctors should act with "courage" (Mary Marsh), when they feel that something "is not quite right" (Professor Craft), although there is "nothing specific to support that feeling" (Mary Marsh), and when "the evidence of child abuse is at best tentative." (Professor Craft).  In these cases "the interests of the child and the parent do not coincide" (Professor Craft); "for children at risk of abuse, especially those at the most ominous risk, there may not be congruity of interest but rather conflict of interest." (Mary Marsh)</p>
