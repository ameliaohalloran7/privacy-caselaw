<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78. It was suggested during the hearing that questions about sexual behaviour with the accused would be less distressing and humiliating than questions about such behaviour with third parties.  But to assent to that proposition would, I think, risk developing rules by reference to stereotypes.  Each case is different, and there are sound reasons for thinking that complainants are likely to find evidence and questions about their sexual history distressing or humiliating whatever their subject matter.  The only proper test is whether the evidence and questions relate to a relevant issue in the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79. Paragraph (a) of subsection (3) sets out the first qualifying condition. This is that the issue to which the evidence or question relates is not an issue of consent.  The justification for enabling leave to be given in such cases was powerfully argued by McLachlin J in <i>R v Seaboyer, </i>at pp 613E-615B.  The distinction which she drew was between impermissible generalisations about consent and specific inferences pointing to guilt or innocence.  Examples of issues which will fall within this paragraph because the evidence of sexual behaviour is proffered for specific reasons are (a) the defence of honest belief, which McLachlin J defined for the purposes of her examination of the Canadian legislation as resting on the concept - which I consider to be consistent with that described in <i>Director of Public Prosecutions v Morgan</i> [1976]  AC 182 - that the accused may honestly but mistakenly (but not necessarily reasonably) have believed that the complainant was consenting to the sexual act; (b) that the complainant was biased against the accused or had a motive to fabricate the evidence; (c) that there is an alternative explanation for the physical conditions on which the Crown relies to establish that intercourse took place; and (c) especially in the case of young complainants, as in the Scottish case of <i>Love v H M Advocate</i> 1999  SCCR 783, that the detail of their account must have come from some other sexual activity before or after the event which provides an explanation for their knowledge of that activity.  The fact that leave may be given for evidence and questions directed to these and similar specific issues under this paragraph is an important protection of the accused's right to a fair trial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80. Paragraph (b) sets out the second qualifying condition.  This is the first of the two qualifying conditions that relate to issues which are issues of consent.  To qualify under this condition the evidence or questions must relate to sexual behaviour which is alleged to have taken place "at or about the same time" as the event which is the subject matter of the charge against the accused.  The inclusion of the words "or about" give some, but not very much, latitude to the condition imposed by the paragraph.  The overall effect is similar to that of the phrase "at or near his own place of work" in section 15(1) of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974, as substituted by section 16(1) of the Employment Act 1980, which was considered in <i>Rayware Ltd v Transport and General Workers' Union </i>[1989]  1 WLR 675.  Nourse LJ said, at p 683C-D, that the word "near" is an expanding word, to be extended so far as to give effect to the intention of the legislature.  As May LJ said in the same case, at p 682A-B, the question is in the end one of fact and degree.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81. As for the intention of the legislature in the case of section 41 of the 1999 Act, extensive reference was made to statements made by the Home Office ministers as reported in Hansard when the legislation was undergoing examination in Parliament.  For the reasons which I explained in <i>R v Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, Ex p Spath Holme Ltd</i> [2001]  2 WLR 15, 48C-E,  I consider that the effect of the exception to the rule that resort to Hansard is inadmissible for the purpose of construing an Act which was recognised in <i>Pepper v Hart</i> [1993]  AC 593 is that, strictly speaking, this exercise is available for the purpose only of preventing the executive from placing a different meaning on words used in legislation from that which they attributed to those words when promoting the legislation in Parliament.  In expressing that view I wish to acknowledge the debt which I owe to my noble and learned friend Lord Steyn's valuable discussion of this point in "Pepper v Hart: A re-examination" (2001) 21 Oxford Journal of Legal Studies 59.  But that situation does not arise in this case.  In answer to a question which was put to him by my noble and learned friend in the course of the hearing counsel for the Secretary of State said in terms that he was not relying on this material as an aid to construction.  So the proper course is to construe the words used according to their ordinary meaning without reference to what the ministers said about them in the course of the debates in Parliament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82. But I think that it is legitimate to refer for the purposes of clarification to the notes to this section in the explanatory notes to the Act prepared by the Home Office.  I would use it in the same way as I would use the explanatory note attached to a statutory instrument: see <i>Coventry and Solihull Waste Disposal Co Ltd v Russell (Valuation Officer)</i> [1999]  1 WLR 2093, 2103D-G.  The relevant note states that it is expected that the phrase "at or about the same time" will generally be interpreted no more widely that 24 hours before or after the offence.  The use of the words "or about" avoids the trap of placing a straightjacket around a matter that has to be determined according to the facts and circumstances of each case.  It is sufficient for the purposes of this case to say that the previous sexual behaviour of the complainant, including acts of sexual intercourse, about which the respondent wishes to ask questions and lead evidence falls outwith the scope of the phrase "at or about the same time" according to the ordinary meaning of those words.  The last act of consensual sexual intercourse which he alleges took place about one week before the alleged rape.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83. Paragraph (c) sets out the third qualifying condition.  It is the second of the two qualifying conditions that relate to issues which are issues of consent.  The broad concept to which it is addressed is that of similar fact evidence.  As the cases of <i>R v Boardman</i> [1975]  AC 421 and <i>Director of Public Prosecutions v P</i> [1991]  2 AC 447 demonstrate, the principle on which the admissibility of similar fact evidence is based is that evidence which falls into this category may so strongly support the truth of the offence charged that it is fair to admit it notwithstanding its prejudicial effect: per Lord Mackay of Clashfern LC in <i>Director of Public Prosecutions v P,</i> at pp 462H-463A.  This qualifying condition recognises that the accused may wish to rely on the same principle in order to support his defence of consent.  The similarities which it permits are expressed in two alternatives, which are best examined separately.  But very precise limits are set on the extent to which the principle may be used in this context.  These are indicated by the concluding words of the subsection, which provides that the condition will not be satisfied unless the similarity "cannot reasonably be explained as a coincidence."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84. The first alternative is that on which the respondent seeks to rely in this case.  It relates to the complainant's sexual behaviour on some other occasion which is alleged to have been so similar to any sexual behaviour of the complainant which took place as part of the event charged that it cannot reasonably be explained as a coincidence.  In two respects the scope which is given by this provision for the giving of leave to put questions or adduce evidence is quite wide.  The alternative is widely enough expressed to cover sexual behaviour with third parties as well as with the accused.  And it is widely enough expressed to cover sexual behaviour after as well as before the event charged.  To this extent the condition avoids the risk of unfairness to the accused.  But the requirement that the similarity cannot reasonably be explained as a coincidence imposes a precisely expressed restriction which is significantly tighter than that which the Crown must satisfy under the rule established in <i>Director of Public Prosecutions v P</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85. On the limited version of the facts of this case which has so far been made available, no similarity is alleged as to the complainant's sexual behaviour with the respondent on previous occasions to any behaviour on her part which took place as part of the event charged except for the bare fact that it included occasions when she is alleged to have had consensual sexual intercourse with him.  Mr Rook did not seek to suggest to the Court of Appeal that there was such a similarity as would enable evidence to be adduced or questions asked under section 41(3)(c): see para 19 of the Court of Appeal's judgment.  No attempt appears to have been made to investigate the facts to the level of detail that section 41(3)(c) demands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86. For this reason the respondent's allegations seem to me to invite the criticism that they are based on one of the two evils which lie at the heart of the mischief which the section seeks to address: the myth that simply because the complainant consented to sexual intercourse on previous occasions she was more likely to have consented to sexual intercourse on this occasion.  The scope of the requirement that the similarity cannot reasonably be explained as a coincidence is therefore not, as matters stand, the critical issue in this case.  In my opinion the application fails on the ground that no similarity other than the bare fact of alleged previous consensual intercourse with the respondent has been demonstrated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87. On the other hand the question whether the requirement that any similarity that may be alleged cannot reasonably be explained as a coincidence may yet arise in this case, if the respondent is given an opportunity to explain the basis for his application in greater detail.  So I would add these comments.  The test which this phrase lays down appears to have been taken from <i>R v Boardman </i> [1975]  AC 421 and in particular from Lord Salmon's observations where he said, at p 462C-D: </p>
<p></p><ul>"It has, however, never been doubted that if the crime charged is committed in a uniquely or strikingly similar manner to other crimes committed by the accused the manner in which the other crimes were committed may be evidence upon which a jury could reasonably conclude that the accused was guilty of the crime charged.  The similarity would have to be so unique or striking that common sense makes it inexplicable on the basis of coincidence."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88. It is not easy to see how that dictum, which is taken from the context of criminal sexual conduct, can be applied to conduct on which the accused wishes to rely as a defence to the charge which has been laid against him.  I do not think that it is helpful to speculate as to what kinds of sexual conduct will satisfy this test.  Each case will have to be approached on its own facts. But on any view it has been deliberately framed in such a way as to indicate, according to the ordinary meaning of the words used, that it will not be easy to satisfy.  It has been modified slightly from the strict test which Lord Salmon described because the phrase "cannot be explained as a coincidence" is qualified by the word "reasonably".  Nevertheless it leans strongly in favour of the protection of the complainant.  I shall deal in the next section of this judgment (see paragraph 90 et seq, post) with the question whether it leans too far.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89. The second alternative in paragraph (c) relates to the complainant's sexual behaviour on some other occasion which is alleged to be so similar to any other sexual behaviour of the complaint which took place "at or about the same time" as the event charged that it cannot reasonably be explained as a coincidence.  The scope to be given to this phrase, according to the ordinary meaning of the words used, is the same as that to be given to the same phrase in paragraph (b).  As in the case of the first alternative, the sexual behaviour is not limited to sexual behaviour with the accused before the event charged.  It can include within its scope sexual behaviour with third parties as well as sexual behaviour with the accused or with third parties which took place after the event. But, as in the case of the first alternative, the scope to be given to this alternative is qualified by the requirement that the similarity cannot reasonably be explained as a coincidence.</p>
<i><p>The Convention right to a fair trial</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90. The right of an accused under article 6(1) of the Convention is to a fair trial.  As I observed in <i>Brown v Stott </i>[2001]  2 WLR 817, 851C, this is a fundamental and absolute right, to which the rights listed in articles 6(2) and 6(3) are supplementary.  The rights listed in article 6(3) include the accused's right to examine or have examined witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against him: see paragraph (d).  There is no doubt that Parliament, by placing restrictions on the questions that may be asked and the evidence that may be adduced by or on behalf of the accused was entering upon a very sensitive area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91. But article 6 does not give the accused an absolute and unqualified right to put whatever questions he chooses to the witnesses.  As this is not one of the rights which are set out in absolute terms in the article it is open, in principle, to modification or restriction so long as this is not incompatible with the absolute right to a fair trial in article 6(1).  The test of compatibility which is to be applied where it is contended that those rights which are not absolute should be restricted or modified will not be satisfied if the modification or limitation "does not pursue a legitimate aim and if there is not reasonable proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved": <i>Ashingdane v United Kingdom</i> (1985)  7 EHRR 528, 547, para 57.  A fair balance must be struck "between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual's fundamental rights": <i>Sporrong and Lönnroth v Sweden </i>(1982)  5 EHRR 35, 52, para 69.  The general principles described in the <i>Ashingdane</i> case were restated in <i>Lithgow v United Kingdom</i> (1986)  8 EHRR 329, 393, para 194 and again in <i>Fayed v United Kingdom</i> (1994)  18 EHRR 393, 429, para 65; see also <i>Brown v Stott</i> [2001]  2 WLR 817, 851.  The question whether a legitimate aim is being pursued enables account to be taken of the public interest in the rule of law.  The principle of proportionality directs attention to the question whether a fair balance has been struck between the general interest of the community and the protection of the individual.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92. In my opinion the placing of restrictions on evidence or questions about the sexual behaviour of complainants in proceedings for sexual offences serves a legitimate aim.  The prevalence of sexual offences, especially those involving rape, which are not reported to the prosecuting authorities indicates a marked reluctance on the part of complainants to submit to the process of giving evidence at any trial.  The rule of law requires that those who commit criminal acts should be brought to justice.  Its enforcement is impaired if the system which the law provides for bringing such cases to trial does not protect the essential witnesses from unnecessary humiliation or distress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93. It seems to me that the critical question, so far as the accused's right to a fair trial is concerned, is that of proportionality.  The points of particular concern which I have identified in my analysis of section 41 are (a) the exclusion by section 41(4) of evidence and questions for the purpose of impugning the credibility of the complainant as a witness (see paragraph 76, ante) and (b) the requirement in section 41(3) that any similarity cannot reasonably be explained as a coincidence (see paragraph 83, ante).  The impact of these provisions on the right to a fair trial is highlighted by the fact that they are binding on the trial judge.  They are mandatory.  He has no discretion to admit the evidence or to allow the questioning if he thinks that it is in the interests of justice to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94. The question is whether these provisions have achieved a fair balance.  This will be achieved if they do not go beyond what is necessary to accomplish their objective.  That is the essence, in this context, of the principle of proportionality.  Furthermore, to ask oneself whether they are fair to the defendant is to address one side of the balance only.  On the other side there is the public interest in the rule of law.  The law fails in its purpose if those who commit sexual offences are not brought to trial because the protection which it provides against unnecessary distress and humiliation of witnesses is inadequate.  So too if evidence or questions are permitted at the trial which lie so close to the margin between what is relevant and permissible and what is irrelevant and impermissible as to risk deflecting juries from the true issues in the case.  The high rate of acquittals in rape cases before section 41 was introduced suggests that juries are not immune from temptation, and that they are quite likely to draw inferences from evidence about a complainant's sexual behaviour on occasions other than that of the alleged rape which the law now recognises they should not draw.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95. A prohibition of evidence and questions about the complainant's sexual behaviour on other occasions whose purpose, or main purpose, is to elicit material to impugn the credibility of the complainant as a witness seems to me to strike the correct balance.  If the sole purpose is to impugn credibility, the defendant has no rights in the matter at all.  The complainant's sexual behaviour on other occasions is irrelevant.  No inferences can properly be drawn about her credibility from the mere fact that she has engaged in sexual behaviour on other occasions.  I would hold that the words "or main purpose" which qualify the words "the purpose" in section 41(4) do not widen the prohibition to an extent which, when regard is had to the public interest, is unfair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96. The effect of the requirement in section 41(3)(c) that any similarity cannot reasonably be explained as a coincidence is more difficult to assess.  It seems to me that the assessment might best be approached in stages by asking these questions: (1) does a proportionate response to the legitimate aim entitle the legislature, in principle, to restrict the extent to which evidence may be adduced and questions asked about the complainant's other sexual behaviour where the issue is one of consent?  (2) if so, are the restrictions in section 41(3)(c) so unfair that it can be said that no defendant who wishes to adduce such evidence or ask such questions can ever have a fair trial because its effect is to exclude relevant evidence whose probative value is not clearly outweighed by the prejudice which it may cause?  (3) if not, has it been shown that it will cause such unfairness in this case?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97. It is not necessary to dwell on the first or on the last of these three questions.  Some limit must be placed on the extent to which evidence may be adduced and questions asked if the legitimate aim is to be achieved.  That point is not in dispute.  As far as this case is concerned, I have already mentioned the fact that no attempt appears yet to have been made to investigate the facts to the level of detail that section 41(3)(c) demands.  It is not yet possible to say that there is any relevant evidence about similar sexual behaviour by the complainant which would be excluded by the restrictions.  So I do not think that it can yet be said that, if the restrictions are not caught by the second question, they are so unfair in this case as not to be proportionate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98. There remains the second question.  I agree with Mr Pannick QC for the Home Secretary that if the restrictions are likely to cause unfairness in isolated cases only, of which this is not one, the better course is to deal with them later and one by one as they arise.  The point of the second question is that if it is answered in the affirmative the incompatibility which will result will be capable of being invoked by every defendant whose defence is directed to the issue of consent.  That, in effect, is the position which the respondent adopts.  He says that there is no point in attempting the exercise required by section 41(3)(c) because the restrictions are so tightly drawn that there is no reasonable prospect of overcoming them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99. It is plain that the question is in the end one of balance.  Has the balance between the protection of the complainant and the accused's right to a fair trial been struck in the right place?  As I indicated earlier in this judgment (see paragraph 58, ante), I think that, if any doubt remains on this matter, it raises the further question whether Parliament acted within its discretionary area of judgment when it was choosing the point of balance indicated by section 41.  The area is one where Parliament was better equipped than the judges are to decide where the balance lay.  The judges are well able to assess the extent to which the restrictions will inhibit questioning or the leading of evidence.  But it seems to me that in this highly sensitive and carefully researched field an assessment of the prejudice to the wider interests of the community if the restrictions were not to take that form was more appropriate for Parliament.  An important factor for Parliament to consider was the extent to which restrictions were needed in order to restore and maintain public confidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100. Some assistance in finding an answer to this question may be gained by looking at the solutions that have commended themselves to other jurisdictions.  Rape-shield legislation in the United States has been classified into four different models: H Galvin "Shielding Rape Victims in the State and Federal Courts:<i> </i>A Proposal for the Second Decade"<i> </i>(1986) 70 Minn L Rev 763; see also the helpful summary in Neil Kibble's paper, at pp 25-26.  The Michigan model is the one followed most widely in the United States.  It has been adopted in New South Wales (section 409B(3) of the Crimes Act 1900) and was adopted by Canada until it was held in <i>R v Seaboyer</i> [1991]  2 SCR 577 to be unconstitutional.  It imposes a general prohibition on the introduction of evidence of prior sexual behaviour, subject to certain specific exceptions but permits evidence of prior sexual behaviour between the complainant and the defendant.  The New Jersey model leaves the matter almost entirely to the discretion of the trial judge, but it provides for the question whether to admit the evidence to be determined at a pre-trial hearing.  The Federal model follows the Michigan model to the extent that it imposes a general prohibition on the introduction of prior sexual behaviour with specific exceptions one of which relates to the complainant's behaviour with the accused, but it gives the trial judge a general residual discretion to admit the evidence if it would be contrary to the interests of justice to exclude it or to do so would violate the defendant's constitutional rights.  A similar model is in force in Western Australia (sections 36B, 36BA and 36BC of the Evidence Act 1906).  The California model prohibits evidence of prior sexual behaviour to prove consent unless the evidence is of prior sexual conduct between the complainant and the defendant, while evidence with respect to credibility is admissible at the discretion of the court.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101. To these four models there now fall to be added two more.  The first of these is the revised Canadian model.  Section 276 of the Canadian Criminal Code (RSC 1985, c C-46) was redrafted following the decision in <i>R v Seaboyer </i>to give statutory effect to the guidelines which the Supreme Court of Canada laid down in that case for the reception and use of sexual conduct evidence.  It starts by providing that evidence of other sexual activity, whether with the accused or with any other person is not admissible to support an inference that, by reason of the sexual nature of that activity, the complainant is more likely to have consented or is less worthy of belief.  In <i>R v Darrach</i> 191 DLR (4th) 539, 560 the Supreme Court of Canada held that this is an evidentiary rule that excludes such evidence because it is irrelevant.  There are then three exceptions to that rule which allow the evidence to be admitted if the judge determines that the evidence is of specific instances of sexual activity, that it is relevant to an issue at the trial and that it has significant probative value that is not significantly outweighed by the danger of prejudice to the proper administration of justice.  Guidelines are included to assist the judge in determining whether the evidence is admissible.  In <i>R v Darrach</i> the court held that the procedure created by the revised section 276, taken as a whole, was consistent with the principles of fundamental justice and protected the defendant's constitutional rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102. Lastly there is the Scottish model.  It was first enacted by section 36 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1985 and is now to be found in sections 274 and 275 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995.  Questioning designed to show that the complainer is not of good character in sexual matters, that she is a prostitute or that she has at any time engaged with any person in sexual behaviour not forming part of the subject matter of the charge is excluded by section 274.  But section 275 provides that such questioning or evidence may be allowed where the court is satisfied that it is designed to explain or rebut other evidence, is questioning or evidence as to sexual behaviour which took place on the same occasion as the sexual behaviour forming the subject matter of the charge or is relevant to the defence of incrimination (that is, that the crime was committed by some other named individual) or that it would be contrary to the interests of justice to exclude it.  A study  by Dr B Brown "Sexual History and Sexual Character Evidence in Scottish Sexual Offence Trials"<i> </i>(University of Edinburgh, 1992) concluded that, while there were a number of positive features in this legislation, it fell short of achieving its aim in practice.  It was suggested that, while there were other possibilities, a more certain remedy would be to modify the discretionary character of the exceptions and to identify instead specific types of circumstances in which sexual history or character evidence would be relevant to key issues in the trial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103. It is reasonably clear from this brief review that there is no one single answer to the problem as to how best to serve the legitimate aim.  There are choices to be made.  There are indications from the wording and structure of section 41 that close attention was paid to the more recent Canadian and Scottish models.  But in significant ways it has departed from both of them.  The element of judicial discretion has been reduced to the minimum.  There are risks involved in that choice.  It has deprived the judge of the opportunity, in the last resort, of preventing unfairness to the defendant in circumstances where to do this would not significantly prejudice the proper administration of justice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104. But two important factors seem to me to indicate that prima facie the solution that was chosen was a proportionate one.  The first is the need to restore and maintain public confidence in the system for the protection of vulnerable witnesses.  Systems which relied on the exercise of a discretion by the trial judge have been called into question.  Doubts have been raised as to whether they have achieved their object.  I think that it was within the discretionary area of judgment for Parliament to decide not to follow these systems.  The second is to be found in a detailed reading of the section as a whole.  As I have tried to show in my analysis of the various subsections, it contains important provisions which preserve the defendant's right to ask questions about and adduce evidence of other sexual behaviour by the complainant where this is clearly relevant.  While section 41(3) imposes very considerable restrictions, it needs to be seen in its context.  I would hold that the required level of unfairness to show that in <i>every case</i> where previous sexual behaviour between the complainant and the accused is alleged the solution adopted is not proportionate has not been demonstrated.</p>
