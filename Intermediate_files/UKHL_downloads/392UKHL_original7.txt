<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;165. In <i>Hautanemi v Sweden</i> (1996) 22 EHRR CD 155 the applicants were members of a parish of the Church of Sweden who complained of a violation of article 9 of the Convention because the Assembly of the Church of Sweden had prohibited the use of the liturgy of the Finnish Evangelical-Lutheran Church in their parish.  Under reference to the judgment in the <i>Holy Monasteries </i>case, the Commission recalled article 25(1) (now article 34) of the Convention and observed, at p 155, that</p>
<p></p><ul>"at the relevant time the Church of Sweden and its member parishes were to be regarded as corporations of public law.  Since these religious bodies cannot be considered to have been exercising governmental powers, the Church of Sweden and notably the applicant parish can nevertheless be regarded as 'non-governmental organisations' within the meaning of article 25(1)."<p></p></ul>
<p>Having held that, as members of the parish, the applicants could be regarded as victims in terms of article 25(1), the Commission added, at p 156:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The Commission has just found that, for the purposes of article 25 of the Convention, the Church of Sweden and its member parishes are to be regarded as 'non-governmental organisations'.  It follows that the respondent state cannot be held responsible for the alleged violation of the applicants' freedom of religion resulting from the decision of the Church Assembly …..  There has thus been no State interference with that freedom."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;166. In the light of these decisions what matters is that the PCC's general function is to carry out the religious mission of the Church in the parish, rather than to exercise any governmental power.  Moreover, the PCC is not in any sense under the supervision of the state:  under section 9 of the 1956 Measure it is the bishop who has certain powers in relation to the PCC's activities.  In these circumstances the fact that the PCC is constituted as a body corporate under the 1956 Measure is irrelevant.  For these reasons, in respectful disagreement with the Court of Appeal, I consider that the PCC is not a core public authority for purposes of section 6 of the Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;167. This conclusion finds further support in the treatment of certain churches in relation to article 19(4) of the German Constitution or Grundgesetz.  That article provides that, if any person's rights are infringed by "public power" ("öffentliche Gewalt"), recourse to the courts is open to him.  The history of relations between Church and State in Germany is, of course, very different from the history of that relationship in any part of the United Kingdom.  In Germany it has culminated in a declaration that there is to be no State Church (article 137(1) of the Weimar Constitution incorporated by article 140 of the Constitution).  This important difference must not be overlooked.  Nevertheless, as permitted by article 137, certain churches are constituted as public law corporations.  In general, domestic public law entities are regarded as exercising public power in terms of article 19(4), whereas natural persons and private law associations are not.  Despite this, because of their particular (religious) mission which does not derive from the state, the churches that are public law corporations are treated differently from other public law corporations that are organically integrated into the state.  "Church power is indeed public, but not state power" ("ist kirchliche Gewalt zwar öffentliche, aber nicht staatliche Gewalt"):  BVerwGE 18, 385, 386 - 387;  BVerfGE 25, 226, 228 - 229.  So, in relation to these churches, the Administrative Court interprets the phrase "public power" in article 19(4) as being equivalent to "state power".  Since within their own sphere the churches do not exercise state power, even if they exercise public power, the article 19(4) guarantee does not apply.  Despite the rather different context, this interpretation of "public power" tends to confirm the interpretation of "public authority" in section 6 which I prefer.  Moreover, due allowance having been made for the particular position of the Church of England, the reasoning of the Administrative Court also tends to confirm that the mere fact that section 3 of the 1956 Measure makes every PCC a body corporate does not carry with it any necessary implication that the PCC should, on that account alone, be regarded as a public authority for the purposes of section 6.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;168. Of course, if the churches in Germany go outside their own unique sphere and undertake state functions, for example, in running schools, the constitutional guarantee in article 19(4) applies to them:  BVerfGE 18, 385, 387 - 388;  BVerfGE 25, 226, 229.  In much the same way, for example, a Church of England body which was entrusted, as part of its responsibilities, with running a school or other educational establishment might find that it had stepped over into the sphere of governmental functions and was, in that respect, to be regarded as a public authority for purposes of section 6(1).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;169. The Court of Appeal did indeed consider that, even if they were wrong in holding that PCCs are core public authorities, a PCC should be regarded as a public authority when enforcing the common law obligation of lay rectors, who need not be members of the Church, to maintain the chancel of the parish church.  Mr Beloff reinforced this argument by pointing both to the duty of the minister under the relevant canons to hold certain services in the parish church and to the widespread belief, whether particularly well-founded or not, that any resident of a parish was entitled to be married in the church.  These were indications of the public role of the parish church and, accordingly, of the public nature of the PCC's function in relation to the maintenance of the fabric of the church so that the minister could perform those public duties there.  Enforcing the lay rectors' obligation was part of that public function.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;170. For the most part, in performing his duties and conducting the prescribed services, the minister is simply carrying out part of the mission of the Church, not any governmental function of the state.  On the other hand, when in the course of his pastoral duties the minister marries a couple in the parish church, he may be carrying out a governmental function in a broad sense and so may be regarded as a public authority for purposes of the 1998 Act.  In performing its duties in relation to the maintenance of the fabric of the church so that services may take place there, the PCC is doing its part to help the minister discharge his pastoral and evangelistic duties.  The PCC may be acting in the public interest, in a general sense, but it is still carrying out a church rather than a governmental function.  That remains the case even although, from time to time, when performing one of his pastoral duties - conducting a marriage service in the church - the minister himself may act as a public authority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;171. Moreover, the fact that, as part of its responsibilities in relation to the maintenance of the church fabric, the PCC may have to enforce a common law obligation against a lay rector who happens not to be a member of the Church can hardly transform the PCC into a public authority.  Indeed, the very term "lay rector" is a reminder that the common law obligation which the PCC is enforcing is the last remnant of a set of more complex rights and liabilities that were ecclesiastical in origin.  As Ferris J held, at para 23 of his judgment, today the liability to repair the chancel can be regarded as one of the incidents of ownership of rectorial property:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is, of course, an unusual incident because it does not amount to a charge on the land, is not limited to the value of the land and imposes a personal liability on the owner of the land.  But in principle I do not find it possible to distinguish it from the liability which would attach to the owner of land which is purchased subject to a mortgage, restrictive covenant or other incumbrance created by a predecessor in title."<p></p></ul>
<p>I respectfully agree.  There is nothing in the nature of the obligation itself, or in the means or purpose of its enforcement, that would lead to the conclusion that the PCC of Aston Cantlow is exercising a governmental function, however broadly defined, when it enforces the lay rectors' obligation to pay for chancel repairs.  Therefore, even when it is enforcing that obligation, the PCC is not to be regarded as a public authority for the purposes of section 6 of the 1998 Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;172. I should add that I agree with the observations of my noble and learned friend, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, in the final paragraph of his speech.</p>
