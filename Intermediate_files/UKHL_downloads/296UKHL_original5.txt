<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74.&nbsp;&nbsp;Though not included in his core submissions there is a different and I believe more persuasive manner in which Mr Owen could advance his argument on behalf of the appellant. It is alluded to in the case for the appellant (para 31(4)). The argument is clearly set out in a different but parallel context in the speech of Lord Bingham commencing at para 25.  It turns on the need for any significant departure from the normal requirements of a fundamental common law right, such as the right to natural justice, if it is to be lawful, to be authorised expressly by primary legislation or something equivalent thereto. This is so as to give the departure the necessary democratic seal of approval. This is a requirement of domestic law but the existence of the seal of democratic approval is also relevant as to whether there has been compliance with article 5(4).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75.&nbsp;&nbsp;The interpretation of current rule 6 is not totally clear, but I take the view that it is intended to enable the chair of the panel to authorise in <i>appropriate</i> <i>circumstances</i> the withholding of information from the prisoner and his representatives. However this does not mean that the rule should be interpreted in a manner that would be wholly inconsistent with the prisoner's right to a fair hearing before the Board. The statutory power of the Secretary of State to make rules contained in section 32(5) of the 1991 Act cannot properly be construed as authorising the creation of a rule which had such an effect without expressly stating that this was the position. Accordingly to give any broader interpretation to rule 6 would mean the rule would at least in part be ultra vires. It would also inevitably result in conflict with article 5(4) if it was applied in a manner that involved a fundamental breach of a prisoner's rights to a fair hearing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that information is withheld from a prisoner does not mean that there is automatically such a fundamental breach of the prisoner's rights either under article 5(4) or under domestic law.  There can be an infinite variety of circumstances as to the degree of information that is withheld completely or partially without any significant unfairness being caused. The responsibility of the panel is to ensure that any unfairness is kept to a minimum while balancing the triumvirate of interests to which I have already referred. There may need initially to be a total withholding of information, but at an early stage of the hearing the prisoner may be able to be informed of the gist of what is relied on against him. Documents can be edited. There has to be detailed management of the hearing to ensure that the prisoner has the widest information possible. In relation to this management the SAA can have a critical role to play on the prisoner's behalf.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two extreme positions so far as the prisoner is concerned. On the one hand there is full disclosure and on the other hand there is no knowledge of the case against him being made available to the prisoner, so that even with a SAA he cannot defend himself. In between the two there is a grey area and within that grey area is the border which is the parameter between what is acceptable and what is not acceptable. Where that border is situated is fact specific, depending on the all circumstances that have to be balanced. So far as article 5(4) is concerned the need to examine the facts as a whole, including any appellate process, before coming to a decision is critical as Lord Bingham points out in his speech (at para 19). The same is true in domestic law. To make rulings in advance of the actual hearing would be to introduce a rigidity that would make the task of the Board extraordinarily difficult. The position has to be looked at in the round examining the proceedings as a whole with hindsight and taking into account the task of the Board. The Board's existing statutory framework, including the Rules, do not entitle the Board to conduct its hearing in a manner that results in a significant injustice to a prisoner and in view of article 5(4) I do not anticipate that primary legislation can now be introduced that expressly authorises such a result without contravening the Human Rights Act 1998 even if express legislative authority was thought to be desirable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78.&nbsp;&nbsp;For support for this approach I would gratefully adopt the authorities relied on by Lord Bingham and the series of statutory precedents to which he refers in paras 25 et seq of his speech. In particular I refer to  the citations he makes from <i> R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p Pierson </i>[1998] AC 539 and <i>R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p Simms</i> [2000] 2 AC 115.  If a case arises where it is impossible for the Board both to make use of information that has not been disclosed to the prisoner and, at the same time, protect the prisoner from a denial of his fundamental right to a fair hearing then the rights of the prisoner have to take precedence, but we have not in my view reached the stage in this case where we can say this has happened. Certainly we cannot say it has happened without considering at least the closed as well as the open judgment of Maurice Kay J. The appellant has chosen to make the issue that which I identified at the outset. He is saying in no circumstances can a SAA be engaged at a hearing and this is putting the case too high.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having had the advantage of reading my noble and learned friend Lord Steyn's speech in draft, I have been acutely concerned that his conclusions about the outcome of this case are so dramatically different from my own.  As far as I have been able to ascertain, the explanation for our differences of opinion appears to be due to our adopting different approaches. Lord Steyn considers it right to focus primarily on the position of the prisoner. In his opinion the use of a SAA inevitably involves a significant curtailment of the prisoner's rights and for that reason the issue must be determined now in the appellant's favour. On the other hand I consider that it is essential to focus, in addition, on the problem the Board faces in having to protect both the safety of the public and the rights of the prisoner. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80.&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of the public who could be affected by a decision of the Board have human rights as well as the appellant.  If the Board releases a prisoner when it is unsafe to do so, the public's individual rights can be grievously affected.  In addition in a situation where the Board has to consider whether to withhold evidence from a prisoner, for example to protect an individual whose life could be threatened if his identity were revealed, the Board is under a duty to protect this individual's interests.  Not to do so could involve the breach of article 2 or 3 of the ECHR.  The Board can refuse to pay any attention to the information that the individual could provide. This would mean, however, that the Board could be in breach of its express statutory duty. So it is my view that the information should only be disregarded if there is no other way in which the prisoner's fundamental right to be treated fairly can be protected. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81.&nbsp;&nbsp;A situation in which the Board is faced with this dilemma requires most anxious consideration.  The Board in my opinion must be able to reconcile the interests involved wherever this is possible. I cannot conceive that when Parliament entrusted the protection of the public to the Board, Parliament could have had any other intention. It was an essential part of the Board's role.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board when confronted with a situation where a SAA may have to be appointed must balance carefully the conflicting interests involved. If it does not do so in a way which in the end protects a prisoner's rights to be treated fairly then the Administrative Court can quash its decision. In this way the rule of law is upheld.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summary and Conclusion</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore dismiss this appeal for the reasons which I have sought to explain as well as the reasons set out in the speeches of Lord Rodger of Earlsferry and Lord Carswell which I have seen in draft.  My reasons can be summarised as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board has ample express and implied powers to enable the Board in the great majority of situations to give such directions as are needed to ensure that the proceedings before it are conducted fairly and justly having regard to the interests of the prisoner, the public and those who provide it with information to enable it to perform its role.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board has also, under the Rules made since 1992, an express power to give directions and those directions could relate to the non disclosure of information to the prisoner when this is necessary in the public interest. That is as long as those directions together with any mitigating steps, such as the appointment of a SAA, do not mean that there is a fundamental denial of the prisoner's rights to a fair hearing. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;Where there should be, for public interest reasons that satisfy the Board, non disclosure not only to the prisoner but also his representatives, and the Board concludes that the nature of the proceedings and the extent of the non disclosure does not mean that the prisoner's right to a fair hearing will necessarily be abrogated, the Board has either an implicit or express power to give directions as to withholding of information and, if it would assist the prisoner, to the use of a SAA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;In the situation just described, if the Board comes to a decision in favour of the prisoner or reveals at least the gist of the case against the offender, then there may be no injustice to the prisoner, but if this is not what happens at the end of the proceedings the Board will have to consider whether there has been compliance with article 5(4) and the minimum requirements of fairness which are to be implied from the nature of the Board's duty under the 1991 Act. If there has not been compliance then either necessary steps must be taken to ensure compliance or the non disclosed material cannot be relied on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the issue identified at the outset of this judgment is that there can be situations where it is permissible and other situations where it is not permissible for the Board within the powers granted by the 1991 Act and compatibly with article 5(4); (a) to withhold material relevant to the appellant's parole review from his legal representatives, and (b) instead, disclose the material to a SAA. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi)&nbsp;&nbsp;Into which category a case falls can only be identified after examining all the circumstances and cannot be decided in advance as a matter of principle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vii)&nbsp;&nbsp;What will be determinative in a particular case is whether looking at the process as a whole a decision has been taken by the Board using a procedure that involves significant injustice to the prisoner. If there has been, the decision should be quashed. The procedure may not be ideal procedure but it may be the only or the best method of balancing the triangulation of interests involved in the very small number of cases where a SAA may be instructed.</p>
<p><b>LORD STEYN</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>United States v Rabinowitz,</i> 339 U S 56 (1950) at p 69 Justice Frankfurter observed:  "It is a fair summary of history to say that the safeguards of liberty have frequently been forged in controversies involving not very nice people."  Even the most wicked of men are entitled to justice at the hands of the State.  In the comparative league of grave crimes those of Roberts rank at the very top.  Thirty eight years ago he was convicted of the murder in cold blood of three policemen who were on duty and serving the public.  Roberts had two accomplices in a planned armed robbery.  Many will think, as I do, that Roberts is morally not entitled to any sympathy for the fact that after all these long years he is still in prison.  It is an entirely reasonable point of view that for such crimes life imprisonment means exactly that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85.&nbsp;&nbsp;But individual views about the continued detention of Roberts are irrelevant.  His position must be considered objectively and in accordance with settled legal principles.  In accordance with the law at the time when Roberts was sentenced it fell to the Home Secretary to decide on the tariff to be served by him.  The Home Secretary decided that it would be 30 years.  Subject to the issue of the risk of physical harm to others posed by the release of Roberts, the decision of the Home Secretary is determinative.  The issue of risk is squarely within the province of the Parole Board as an independent body.  If the Parole Board determines, in accordance with fair procedures, that because of the risk Roberts poses he ought not to be released his continued detention is inevitable.  On the other hand, if the Parole Board determines in accordance with fair procedures, that if Roberts is released he would not pose a risk, he is entitled to be released as a matter of right not discretion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86.&nbsp;&nbsp;Roberts can, of course, not challenge the sentence imposed upon him.  His case is that he has served his tariff term determined in accordance with due process of law and that he no longer poses a risk if released.  As a matter of legal principle this claim, if it can be established on the facts, is sustainable under both domestic law and under article 5(4) of the European Convention on Human Rights.  It is sufficient to say that the Convention right contained in article 5(4) is directly engaged.  It provides for a right "to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful."  It is common ground that for the purposes of article 5(4) the Parole Board is a court.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parole Board must act wholly independently and impartially.  In considering the release of a prisoner it must act in a procedurally fair way: compare <i>R (West) v Parole Board</i> [2005]  1 WLR 350, para 1.  It is common ground that Roberts is entitled to an oral hearing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parole Board decided to attenuate Roberts' right to a hearing in a drastic manner by imposing upon him, in place of an advocate, who would be able to represent him in the ordinary way, a special advocate.  What this entails is described in careful and measured terms by my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill in para 18 of his opinion.  Under this procedure the prisoner and his legal representatives are not allowed to know anything of the case made against the prisoner.  Once the special advocate becomes aware of the case against the prisoner he may not divulge that information to the prisoner.  It is not to the point to say that the special advocate procedure is "better than nothing".  Taken as a whole, the procedure completely lacks the essential characteristics of a fair hearing.  It is important not to pussyfoot about such a fundamental matter: the special advocate procedure undermines the very essence of elementary justice.  It involves a phantom hearing only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89.&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary question is whether the particular evisceration of the right to a fair hearing directed by the Parole Board was within its powers.  The Parole Board has no inherent jurisdiction.  It is a statutory corporation.  It only has the powers conferred upon it by the Criminal Justice Act 1991.  The 1991 Act contains no express power authorising the special advocate procedure.  It is common ground that if there is a statutory warrant for this procedure it must be found in paragraph 1(2)(b) of Schedule 5 to the Act.  It provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It shall be within the capacity of the Board as a statutory corporation to do such things and enter into such transactions as are incidental to or conducive to the discharge of<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul><ul>"(a) its functions under this Part in respect of long-term and short-term prisoners; and<p></p></ul></ul>
<p></p><ul><ul>(b) its functions under Chapter II of Part II of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 in respect of life prisoners within the meaning of that Chapter."<p></p></ul></ul>
<p>The question is therefore whether the power contained in the words "to do such things . . . as are incidental to or conducive  to the discharge of [the relevant functions of the Board]," properly construed in its setting, is wide enough to cover the Parole Board's decision to take away a prisoner's right to a fair hearing.  If the words of the statute do not authorise the power which the Board exercised, the decision is ultra vires<i>.</i>  In examining this question the starting point is that the persuasive burden rests on the Parole Board to demonstrate that its departure from ordinary fair procedures is authorised by the statute.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90.&nbsp;&nbsp;The operative words - to do such things as are incidental to or conducive to the discharge of its functions - are familiar words in the context of conferring implied powers on public authorities, corporations or companies.  Examples include section 3A of the Companies Act 1985 which relates to the statement of the objects of a company and section 111(1) and (3) of the Local Government Act 1972; and compare <i>Hazell v Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council</i> [1992]  2 AC 1; <i>R v Richmond Upon Thames London Borough Council, Ex p McCarthy &amp; Stone (Developments) Ltd </i>[1992]  2 AC 48.  The issue involves a point of construction.  The relevant statutory words are of extreme generality, intended to serve multiple administrative purposes.  As a matter of first impression one would not expect to find in them a Parliamentary intent to take away fundamental principles of due process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91.&nbsp;&nbsp;The vital question is the meaning of the relevant words in their particular textual setting in the 1991 Act.  It is essential to concentrate on the particular power which must be justified.  For example, a generous approach to the power of the Parole Board to buy stationery, in order to carry on correspondence with interested parties, would be justified.  On the other hand, a less indulgent approach becomes necessary when the power under examination involves a radical interference with fair hearing procedures which may result in the unjust outcome of the prisoner having to remain in custody indefinitely.  In the latter case the test to be applied must of necessity be rigorous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parole Board was aware that (except in the case of Northern Ireland) the procedure of appointing special advocates had so far only been introduced by primary legislation of the Westminster Parliament.  That fact alone ought to have suggested caution before such a radical power was introduced by the Parole Board.  Moreover, it is important to bear in mind that the procedure of using the special advocate system was first introduced in the field of national security.  The present case does not involve issues of national security.  It is also not analogous to such cases.  In a careful and balanced statement dated 24 September 2003 Mr Simon Creighton (a solicitor acting for Roberts) drew attention to the difference between the circumstances of this case and national security cases.  He said, at para 17:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The situation is vastly different from the need for Special Advocates in the context for which they were originally created, as the evidence in national security cases will inevitably be provided by sources who are working in the field of state security and therefore their identities have to remain secret in the interests of national security."<p></p></ul>
<p>This difference cannot be brushed aside.  After debate Parliament may well have decided that an extension of the special advocate system to cases such as the present would not be justified.  But Parliament has never been given the opportunity to consider the matter.  This fact also suggests that the Parole Board's decision to depart from elementary fair procedures in the present case was precipitate.  If the decision of the Parole Board is upheld in the present case, it may well augur an open-ended process of piling exception upon exception by judicial decision outflanking Parliamentary scrutiny.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93.&nbsp;&nbsp;The special advocate procedure strikes at the root of the prisoner's fundamental right to a basically fair procedure.  If such departures are to be introduced it must be done by Parliament.  It would be quite wrong to make an assumption that, if Parliament had been faced with the question whether it should authorise, in this particular field, the special advocate procedure, it would have sanctioned it.  After all, in our system the working assumption is that Parliament legislates for a European liberal democracy which respects fundamental rights.  Even before the Human Rights Act 1998 came into force, and <i>a fortiori</i> since then, the courts have been entitled to assume that Parliament does not lightly override fundamental rights.  That is the context in which the observations of the House in <i>R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p Simms</i> [2000]  2 AC 115, are of great importance.  Lord Hoffmann trenchantly stated, at p 131E-G:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Parliament sovereignty means that Parliament can, if it chooses, legislate contrary to fundamental principles of human rights.  The Human Rights Act 1998 will not detract from this power.  The constraints upon its exercise by Parliament are ultimately political, not legal.  But the principle of legality means that Parliament must squarely confront what it is doing and accept the political cost.  <i>Fundamental rights cannot be overridden by general</i> or ambiguous <i>words</i>.  <i>This is because there is too great a risk that the full implications of their unqualified meaning may</i> <i>have passed unnoticed in the democratic process</i>.  In the absence of express language or necessary implication to the contrary, the courts therefore presume that even the most general words were intended to be subject to the basic rights of the individual."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(My emphasis)</p>
<p>This citation is directly in point because the authority upon which the Parole Board relies is a classic example of general words invoked to override a most fundamental right of due process.  The courts must act on the basis that Parliament would always consider with great care whether it should override fundamental rights.  And that must be particularly the case in circumstances in which the denial of the fair procedure may result in the indefinite detention of a prisoner whose tariff has long ago expired.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94.&nbsp;&nbsp;I accept, of course, that the Parole Board is bound to give preponderant weight to the need to protect innocent members of the public against any significant risk of serious injury:  <i>R v Parole Board, Ex p Watson</i> [1996] 1 WLR 906.  Nobody questions this position.  But in my view Scott Baker LJ (as vice chairman of the Parole Board) acted ultra vires in approving without primary legislation the special advocate procedure in this case.  In my view the decision of the Court of Appeal to the same effect was wrong: <i>R (Roberts) v Parole Board </i>[2005] QB 410.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95.&nbsp;&nbsp;My noble and learned friend Lord Carswell commented that a prisoner against whom unfounded allegations have been made is in a Kafkaesque situation.  That was an apposite reference to <i>The Trial</i> (1925), the masterpiece of Franz Kafka.  A passage in <i>The Trial</i> has a striking resonance for the present case.  Joseph K was informed ". . . the legal records of the case, and above all the actual charge-sheets, were inaccessible to the accused and his counsel, consequently one did not know in general, or at least did not know with any precision, what charges to meet in the first plea; accordingly it could be only by pure chance that it contained really relevant matter.  . . .  In such circumstances the Defence was naturally in a very ticklish and difficult position.  Yet that, too, was intentional.  For the Defence was not actually countenanced by the Law, but only tolerated, and there were differences of opinion even on that point, whether the Law could be interpreted to admit such tolerance at all.  Strictly speaking, therefore, none of the Advocates was recognized by the Court, all who appeared before the Court as Advocates being in reality merely in the position of hole-and-corner Advocates".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96.&nbsp;&nbsp;In its decision of 13 June 2003 the Parole Board observed:</p>
<p></p><ul>". . . Miss Kaufmann [the counsel of Roberts] sets out two respects in which she argues that Mr Roberts would be prejudiced by the special advocate procedure being adopted:<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul><ul>(a) The Board has already found that there can be no disclosure of even a gist to Mr Roberts.  Mr Roberts cannot therefore in any sense whatever answer the case against him.<p></p></ul></ul>
<p></p><ul><ul>(b) It is fair to assume that the material is being placed before the Board because it has an important bearing on Mr Roberts' alleged dangerousness.  If the Board accepts the source's evidence and does not direct Mr Roberts' release as a result, the prejudice to Mr Roberts will not end there.  Just as the Board cannot disclose the gist to him now, it will not be in a position to do so when it comes to provide reasons for its decision.  Mr Roberts will continue to be detained on the basis of allegations about which he remains completely ignorant.  He will not therefore be able to address the concerns underlying his continued detention or take any steps to reduce the risk.<p></p></ul></ul>
<p></p><ul><ul>It is true that it will be the task of the Specially Appointed Advocate to represent the interests of Mr Roberts, but he is in that respect at a serious disadvantage to [Mr Creighton], who have acted for Mr Roberts for a very long period.<p></p></ul></ul>
<p></p><ul><ul>Mr Eadie on behalf of the Secretary of State pointed out on 30 May that although there would be constraints upon the Specially Appointed Advocate in communicating with Mr Roberts or his representatives, there was no objection to Mr Roberts' representatives supplying information to the Specially Appointed Advocate on the basis of their having acted for him for many years.<p></p></ul></ul>
<p></p><ul><ul>There is some merit in Mr Eadie's point, but the Board accepts that there is very considerable force in Ms Kaufmann's arguments and that if the special advocate procedure is adopted this will result in prejudice to Mr Roberts in the respects identified by Ms Kaufmann."<p></p></ul></ul>
<p>My noble and learned friend Lord Woolf, the Lord Chief Justice, has observed inter alia that if the Board reveals at least the gist of the case against the prisoner then there will be no injustice.  But the Board affirmatively found in the present case that there can be no disclosure of even a gist to the prisoner.  I note that the Lord Chief Justice observes that "both under article 5(4) and domestic law [the prisoner's] fundamental right to have a hearing that in all the circumstances at least meets the minimum standards that for reasons of fairness have to be respected".  In my view it is a formalistic outcome to describe a phantom hearing involving a special advocate (as directed by the Board) as meeting minimum standards of fairness.  In truth the special advocate procedure empties the prisoner's fundamental right to an oral hearing of all meaningful content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view the outcome of this case is deeply austere.  It encroaches on the prerogatives of the legislature in our system of Parliamentary democracy.  It is contrary to the rule of law.  It is not likely to survive scrutiny in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since preparing this opinion I have noted a comment on it at para 79 of the opinion of the Lord Chief Justice.  He states:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Lord Steyn considers it right to focus primarily on the position of the prisoner.  In his opinion the use of a SAA inevitably involves a significant curtailment of the prisoner's rights and for that reason the issue must be determined now in the appellant's favour.  On the other hand I consider that it is essential to focus, in addition, on the problem the Board faces in having to protect both the safety of the public and the rights of the prisoner."<p></p></ul>
<p>This statement does not correctly reflect my position.  In para 94 of my opinion I state:</p>
<p></p><ul>"I accept, of course, that the Parole Board is bound to give preponderant weight to the need to protect innocent members of the public against any significant risk of serious injury: <i>R v Parole Board, Ex p Watson</i> [1996]  1 WLR 906.  Nobody questions this position."<p></p></ul>
<p>This is a clear statement of the primacy of the need to protect innocent members of the public.  My opinion speaks for itself and in the interests of economy I will not repeat my reasoning.</p>
