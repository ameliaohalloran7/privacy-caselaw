<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88.&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is whether the jurisprudence of the Strasbourg court now requires us to say that county courts trying a claim for possession must in every case conduct a review of the defendant's personal circumstances before they can be satisfied that the requirements of article 8(2) are met before they make a possession order or, if the proposition for which Mr Luba contends is too wide, how far if at all the decision in <i>Qazi</i> needs to be modified in the light of the decision in <i>Connors</i>.  The question is not made easier by the fact that when <i>Qazi's</i> case reached the Strasbourg court it was dismissed as inadmissible without any reasons having been given, and by the absence of any mention of the House's decision in <i>Qazi</i> in the court's judgment in the <i>Connors </i>case.  Lord Steyn's declaration in <i>Qazi, </i>in para 27, that it would be surprising if the views of the majority on the interpretation and application of article 8 withstood European scrutiny cannot have escaped attention in Strasbourg.  But two opportunities to meet his challenge have now been passed over.  This is not a ground for complacency.  But it does make it all the more important for us to be careful lest taking account of the decision in <i>Connors </i>leads us to breach Lord Bingham's rule that national courts should not outpace the Strasbourg court.  The "no more" part of this rule is just as important as the "no less" part.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89.&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose therefore to examine this issue in three stages: (1) to look again at the Strasbourg cases before <i>Qazi,</i> (2)<i> </i>to look at the Strasbourg cases after <i>Qazi</i> and (3) then to re-examine <i>Qazi </i>itself to see whether that decision should be departed from and, if so, to what extent.</p>
<i></i><p><i><i>The Strasbourg cases before Qazi</i></i></p>
<i><p><i></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that any advantage is to be gained by conducting a fresh review of all the decisions of the Strasbourg institutions that were considered in <i>Qazi</i>.  There was a good deal of common ground between the majority and the minority as to the cases that were relevant and their effect.  It was agreed that article 8 does not in terms give a right to be provided with a home and does not guarantee the right to have one's housing problem solved by the authorities: Lord Bingham, para 6; myself, paras 50, 53, 55.  It was agreed that sufficient and continuous links are required for a house to be considered a "home" for the purposes of article 8: Lord Bingham, para 9; myself, paras 64, 68.  It was accepted by both parties that the Strasbourg jurisprudence did not provide a conclusive answer to the case in the respondent's favour: Lord Bingham, para 13.  Lord Bingham's analysis of the relevant Strasbourg authority was matched step by step in the analysis of it by the majority.  There was only one case about the effect of which there was any real disagreement.  This was <i>S v United Kingdom</i> (1986) 47 DR 274.  In that case the commission, when considering whether a house could be regarded as the applicant's home and whether her right to respect for her home could be regarded as interfered with, attached importance to the fact that she was not entitled in domestic law to succeed to the tenancy of the dwelling house and remain in possession of it on the death of her partner who had been the tenant of it: para 4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91.&nbsp;&nbsp;For reasons which he explained in para 10 and were concurred in by Lord Steyn, Lord Bingham concluded that the ruling in <i>S v United Kingdom</i> no longer offered guidance on the issue of justification as it was made before the formulation of the sufficient and continuing links test in <i>Gillow v United Kingdom</i> (1986) 11 EHRR 335, para 46.  The majority however took a different view on this point: myself, paras 62, 67; Lord Millett, paras 97, 98, 103; Lord Scott of Foscote, paras 126-129, 134.  I recognised that the decisions in <i>S </i>and in <i>Gillow</i> were not entirely consistent with each other.  But I drew support from the commission's approach in <i>S</i>, para 4, to the contractual relations established between the local authority and the deceased partner for the proposition that the purpose of article 8 must be kept firmly in mind when one is considering the question whether the right to respect for the home is being interfered with, and for my conclusion that such interference with that right as flowed from the claim for possession by the public authority landlord did not violate the essence of it: para 83.  Lord Millett and Lord Scott were of the opinion that, although it was clumsily expressed, the commission's decision in <i>S</i>, properly understood,<i> </i>remained authority for the proposition that the applicant's house could no longer be regarded as attracting the protection of article 8 so as to afford a defence to the local authority's claim to possession as she no longer had any right vis-à-vis the landlord to remain there: Lord Millett, para 97; Lord Scott, para 134.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92.&nbsp;&nbsp;I acknowledge Lord Bingham's point that <i>S </i>has not been relied on in any later case: para 19.  This is, of course, not untypical of decisions on admissibility that turn on their own facts.  It must be approached with caution too because its reasoning is not entirely in tune with the view developed in later cases that the real issue in these cases is not whether there is an interference but whether that interference is justified.  Having reflected again on what was said in <i>S </i>in the light of the other pre-<i>Qazi </i>authorities, I remain of the opinion that the commission's decision in that case provides authority for the proposition that the right to respect for the home does not provide the occupier with a defence to the local authority's claim where it was entitled under domestic law to enforce its contractual right to have the property back at the end of the tenancy.  This was, of course, a crucial step in the reasoning of the majority that the Strasbourg jurisprudence shows that contractual and proprietary rights of a person entitled to possession cannot be defeated by a defence based on article 8.  In none of the Strasbourg cases before <i>Qazi</i> was anything said which diminished or detracted from such a person's contractual and proprietary rights, as Lord Scott was careful to emphasise: para 139.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Fitzleet Estates Ltd v Cherry</i> [1977] 1 WLR 1345, 1349D-E Lord Wilberforce said that the best way to resolve a question as to which there are two eminently possible views is by the considered majority opinion of the ultimate tribunal, and that much more than mere doubts as to the correctness of that opinion are needed to justify departing from it.  Assuming, which I would respectfully question, that there were two eminently possible views as to whether the commission's decision in <i>S</i> provides the guidance which was found in it by the majority, the fact is that it was the considered opinion of the majority that it did provide that guidance.  In these circumstances it would only be if the Strasbourg cases after <i>Qazi </i>showed that the majority were wrong that your Lordships would be justified now in departing from what that case decided.  This, of course, leaves open the question whether the present cases are distinguishable on their facts from <i>Qazi</i>, which I shall reserve until later.</p>
<i></i><p><i><i>The Strasbourg cases after Qazi</i></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94.&nbsp;&nbsp;Three cases must be considered under this heading.  The first is <i>Connors v United Kingdom</i> (2004) 40 EHRR 189, which was a decision issued on 27 May 2004.  The second is <i>Blecic v Croatia</i> (2004) 41 EHRR 185.  The third is the decision of the Strasbourg court, issued in March 2004 shortly after the oral hearing in <i>Connors </i>which took place on 22 January 2004, that the application in <i>Qazi's </i>case was inadmissible.  The judgment of your Lordships' House in<i> Harrow London Borough Council v Qazi</i> [2004] 1 AC 983 was delivered on 31 July 2003.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95.&nbsp;&nbsp;The significance of <i>Connors </i>is best judged by examining the court's assessment of the general principles that fell to be applied to the question whether there had been a violation of article 8: paras 81-84.  The parties were agreed that article 8 applied to the circumstances of that case and that the eviction of the applicant disclosed an interference with his right to respect for, among other things, his home: para 68.  They were also agreed that the interference was in accordance with the law and that it pursued a legitimate aim: para 69.  This left for examination by the court the question whether the interference was "necessary in a democratic society": para 70.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96.&nbsp;&nbsp;In its discussion of the general principles bearing on this issue the court dealt with the matter in three stages.  First, there was the scope of the margin of appreciation in cases which give rise to general social and economic considerations.  The scope of this margin depends on the context of the case.  Particular significance is to be attached to the extent of the intrusion into the personal sphere of the individual.  Then there was the question of procedural safeguards which the state has provided when fixing the regulatory framework.  The decision-making process leading to measures of interference must be fair and such as to afford due respect to the interests safeguarded to the individual by article 8.  Finally there was the vulnerable position of gypsies as a minority.  This meant that some special consideration should be given to their needs and their different lifestyle both in the regulatory framework and in reaching decisions in particular cases.  As the court put it in the last sentence of para 84, there is to this extent a positive obligation on the contracting states by virtue of article 8 to facilitate the gypsy way of life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97.&nbsp;&nbsp;The conclusion which the court reached, after examining the facts from this standpoint, was that the eviction of the applicant and his family was not attended by the requisite safeguards: para 95.  The particular defect that was identified was the failure to provide a proper justification for the serious interference with the applicant's rights that resulted from his eviction.  The court had noted in para 85 that the respective merits of the arguments as to whether there had been a breach of the licence conditions were not examined in the county court proceedings.  They were only concerned with the fulfilment of the formal requirements of the eviction, as the council had relied simply on the power to give 28 days' notice to obtain summary possession without proving any breach of licence.  The court held that, in the absence of that justification, the applicant's eviction from the local authority site could not be regarded as justified by a pressing social need or as proportionate to the legitimate aim that was being pursued.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98.&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Court of Appeal's conclusion in the <i>Leeds</i> appeal that the decision in <i>Connors</i> is incompatible with the proposition that the exercise by a public authority of an unqualified right to possession will <i>never</i> constitute an interference with the occupier's right to respect for his home, and that it will <i>always</i> be justified under article 8(2): [2005] 1 WLR 1825, para 26.  Nowhere in my speech in <i>Qazi </i>did I subscribe to a proposition in such extreme terms.  On the other hand, as I read the Strasbourg court's judgment, it did not go so far as to say that the recovery of possession will constitute an interference with that right in every case where the premises are occupied by the person as his home.  <i>Connors</i> was decided, as is usual in that court, on a relatively narrow ground which was related to its own facts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99.&nbsp;&nbsp;As the court said in <i>Connors</i> at the end of para 85, the central issue was whether, in the circumstances, the legal framework applicable to the occupation of pitches on local authority gypsy sites provided the applicant with sufficient procedural protection of his rights.  There is an echo here of the point made in para 84 about the vulnerable position of gypsies as a minority and the need for some special consideration to be given to their needs and different lifestyles.  No mention is made of the general principles or their application to the situation that was discussed in <i>Qazi</i>, where the issue was whether the procedure by which a public authority landlord recovers possession of residential accommodation from a former tenant whose tenancy has come to an end by operation of law by asserting its unqualified right to possession was incompatible with the rights guaranteed by article 8.   It is, of course, possible to envisage special cases other than that of gypsies.  But the fact that special consideration must be given to their needs does not justify the proposition that this must be done in every case.  As the Court of Appeal acknowledged in para 29, a statutory regime may itself achieve the balance required by article 8(2) so that, if the judge complies with it, the requirements of article 8(2) will be satisfied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also criticism in <i>Connors</i> of the procedure that was adopted in the county court, on the ground that it was concerned only with the fulfilment of the formal requirements for the eviction.  The case for the local authority was that it had an absolute and unqualified right to possession, as the applicant's licence had been validly terminated.  But this criticism was made in the context of a case where there was a need to give special consideration to the needs of gypsies and their different lifestyles, which was absent from the local authority's decision that the licence should be terminated and for which the statutory regime then in force did not provide.  There was no request that the possession proceedings should be stayed for judicial review of the question whether the decision to seek possession was arbitrary, unreasonable and disproportionate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101.&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts in <i>Blecic</i> were also unusual.  The applicant was the holder of a specially protected tenancy of a publicly-owned flat in a town in Croatia.  Among the conditions that were applied to a specially protected tenancy by the relevant statutes was the holder's entitlement to purchase it under favourable conditions.  But it was open to the public authority to terminate it if the holder ceased to occupy the flat for an uninterrupted period of six months.  The applicant left the flat in July 1991 to stay with her daughter in Rome for the summer.  As this was intended to be for a short period only she left her furniture and belongings in the flat.  She locked it and asked a neighbour to take care of it during her absence.  But soon after she left it there was an escalation in the armed conflict which made living in the city dangerous and uncomfortable.  Her pension was stopped, she lost the right to medical insurance and her flat was broken into in her absence and occupied by another family.  She decided to stay in Rome and did not return until May 1992, by which date a civil action had been brought against her for the tenancy to be terminated.  After protracted legal proceedings the Supreme Court held in February 1996 that the applicant's non-use of the flat was unjustified as all residents in the town were exposed to the same living conditions as she would have been, had she made the considerable mental and physical effort that would have been required to provide for her basic living needs there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102.&nbsp;&nbsp;The court dealt first with the question whether the flat was the applicant's home within the meaning of article 8 of the Convention.  It held that it was, as it was satisfied that she did not intend to abandon it and had made appropriate arrangements for its maintenance with a view to its return: para 52.  Having found that the termination of the tenancy was an interference with her right to respect for her home, the court then concentrated on the question whether the interference was justified.  It was not disputed that the interference was in accordance with the law, and the court held that a legitimate aim was being pursued by the statutory provision which enabled the public authority to terminate specially protected tenancies held by individuals who no longer lived in the publicly-owned flats that had been allocated to them.  The only point at issue was whether, in applying that provision to the applicant's case, the Croatian courts infringed her right to respect for her home in a manner that was disproportionate: para 58.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103.&nbsp;&nbsp;In its introduction to its judgment on this issue in para 59 the court made the familiar points that the crucial questions were whether there was a pressing social need, whether the measure employed was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and that the scope of the margin of appreciation enjoyed by the national authorities depended not only on the nature of the aim of the restriction but also on the nature of the right involved.  Having examined these issues and decided in para 66 that the decisions of the Croatian courts were based on reasons that were not only relevant but also sufficient for the purposes of article 8(2), the court dealt with the question whether the applicant had been involved in the decision-making process, looked at as a whole, to a degree that was sufficient to provide her with the requisite protection of her interests: para 68.  As it was satisfied on this point too, it held that there had been no violation of article 8: paras 70, 71.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104.&nbsp;&nbsp;The important point which emerges from the court's decision for present purposes is the need for the applicant to be sufficiently involved in the decision-making process leading to her eviction so that she had the opportunity to present the arguments which in her view were decisive for the outcome of the proceedings.  Article 8 contains no explicit procedural requirements, as the court acknowledged at the outset of para 68.  But it said that the decision-making process must be fair and such as to ensure due respect of the interests safeguarded by article 8.  The task which the court set for itself therefore, basing itself on its existing case law, was to determine whether, having regard to the circumstances of the case and the importance of the decision to be taken, the applicant was involved to a sufficient degree in the decision-making process, seen as a whole, to provide her with the requisite protection.  It is also worth noting that the institutions whose actions in the domestic system were under scrutiny in that case were the courts in the contracting state.  This suggests that no relevant distinction can be drawn between cases where the party seeking possession is a public authority and those where it is not.  The court itself has a function to fulfil in all cases where there is an interest under article 8 that needs to be safeguarded, as it too is a public authority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105.&nbsp;&nbsp;That however was a case where, as in <i>Connors</i>, the question whether the interference with the applicant's home was justified under article 8(2) was a live issue.  As I said earlier in this opinion (see para 70, above), the court's only concern as to the question of procedure is that procedures are in place which enable individuals to assert their Convention rights where there is a live question as to whether or not they have been violated.  The circumstances which led to the court's decision that there was an interference with the right to respect for the home that had to be justified were quite different from those in <i>Qazi</i>.  There was a real and substantial issue as to whether the Supreme Court's decision to terminate the specially protected tenancy in the unusual circumstances of that case was proportionate to the legitimate aim which was being pursued by the public authority.  It does not follow that a procedure which enables this issue to be addressed to the extent that was found to be necessary in <i>Blecic</i> must be available in every case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106.&nbsp;&nbsp;This provides the context for an assessment of the significance of the court's decision that the application in <i>Qazi</i> was inadmissible.  This is after all a decision of the Strasbourg court.  The court was provided with the entirety of your Lordships' judgment in that case, as it was submitted as an annexe to the application.  So it had before it in full the two dissenting opinions, including Lord Steyn's observation that it would be surprising if the views of the majority on the interpretation and application of article 8 withstood European scrutiny.  The fact that there was a sharp division of opinion on these issues could not have been put more clearly.  The application was held nevertheless, without detailed discussion, to be inadmissible.  What are we to make of this?</p>
<i><p><i>Conclusions</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would draw the following conclusions.  I think that it is reasonable to think that the court accepted that the applicant had established that the house was his home for the purposes of article 8 and that the enjoyment of his right to respect for his home was interfered with at least to some extent by the order for possession sought by the local authority.  To that extent therefore there was an issue to be considered under article 8(2).  But I think that it is reasonable also to think that the court was satisfied that the requirements of article 8(2) were so obviously met by the law which was applied in that case that there was, as Lord Millett put it in para 103, simply no balance left for the court to strike between the interference with the applicant's right and the legitimate aim that was being pursued by the local authority.  As Lord Scott says, the obvious inference is that the Strasbourg court were satisfied that there was nothing more to be said in Mr Qazi's case.  The tenancy had come to an end, and he no longer had any right to remain in occupation of the premises.  His personal circumstances were irrelevant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108.&nbsp;&nbsp;These conclusions can be fitted into the lessons to be drawn from <i>Connors </i>and from <i>Blecic</i> in this way.  There will be some cases of a special and unusual kind, of which <i>Connors</i> is an example, where the interference with the right to respect for the home which results from the making of a possession order will require to be justified by a decision-making process that ensures that "some special consideration" (the words used in <i>Connors</i>, para 84) is given to the interests safeguarded by article 8.  If there is such a defect the law will need to be amended to provide the necessary safeguards.  But there will be many other cases where there are no such special circumstances - where the person's right to occupy the premises as his home has simply been brought to an end by the operation of law and his eviction is necessary to protect the rights under the law of the landowner.  In these cases it is enough that the eviction is in accordance with what the law itself requires as the case of <i>Blecic</i>, in which it was held that the requirements of the law had been satisfied, demonstrates.  Further consideration of the interests safeguarded by article 8 will be unnecessary.  Cases where the home was occupied under a tenancy, or some other interest falling short of a tenancy, which has been brought to an end in accordance with the relevant law, as in <i>Qazi</i>, will fall into this category.  The interests safeguarded by article 8 will be sufficiently protected by the fulfilment of the formal requirements for the eviction laid down by the relevant statute or by the common law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109.&nbsp;&nbsp;The contrary conclusion, for which the appellants contend, is that procedures must exist in the domestic system for a consideration of the interests safeguarded by article 8 in every case where a person is evicted from his home by the making of a possession order.  A requirement that the article 8 issue must be considered by the court in every case by taking into account the defendant's personal circumstances would go further than a reading of these three cases, taken together and in the light of the prior Strasbourg jurisprudence, will justify.  It would breach Lord Bingham's "no more and no less" rule.  The extent and consequences of this breach should not be underestimated.  It would drive a deep wedge into the domestic system for the handling of possession cases and would be a colossal waste of time and money, as Lord Nicholls indicates.  So I agree with him that judges in the county courts, when faced with such a defence, should proceed on the assumption that domestic law strikes a fair balance and is compatible with the occupier's Convention rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, in agreement with Lord Scott, Baroness Hale and Lord Brown, I would go further.  Subject to what I say below, I would hold that a defence which does not challenge the law under which the possession order is sought as being incompatible with the article 8 but is based only on the occupier's personal circumstances should be struck out.  I do not think that <i>McPhail v Persons, Names Unknown</i> [1973]  Ch 447 needs to be reconsidered in the light of Strasbourg case law.  Where domestic law provides for personal circumstances to be taken into account, as in a case where the statutory test is whether it would be reasonable to make a possession order, then a fair opportunity must be given for the arguments in favour of the occupier to be presented.  But if the requirements of the law have been established and the right to recover possession is unqualified, the only situations in which it would be open to the court to refrain from proceeding to summary judgment and making the possession order are these: (a) if a seriously arguable point is raised that the law which enables the court to make the possession order is incompatible with article 8, the county court in the exercise of its jurisdiction under the Human Rights Act 1998 should deal with the argument in one or other of two ways: (i) by giving effect to the law, so far as it is possible for it do so under section 3, in a way that is compatible with article 8, or (ii) by adjourning the proceedings to enable the compatibility issue to be dealt with in the High Court; (b) if the defendant wishes to challenge the decision of a public authority to recover possession as an improper exercise of its powers at common law on the ground that it was a decision that no reasonable person would consider justifiable, he should be permitted to do this provided again that the point is seriously arguable: <i>Wandsworth London Borough Council v Winder</i> [1985]  AC 461.  The common law as explained in that case is, of course, compatible with article 8.  It provides an additional safeguard.</p>
<i><p><i>The decision in Qazi</i> <i>itself</i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111.&nbsp;&nbsp;How then does the decision of this House in <i>Qazi</i> stand up to examination when it is looked at in the light of the subsequent decisions of the Strasbourg court?  I would hold that there are no grounds for concluding that the decision itself, on its own facts, was unsound.  I would draw support for this conclusion from that fact that the respondent's subsequent application to Strasbourg was held to be inadmissible.  On the other hand I would acknowledge that Lord Scott's observation in <i>Qazi</i>, para 139, that in no case has article 8 been applied to detract from the contractual and proprietary rights of the person entitled to possession is no longer true.  <i>Connors </i>was such a case.  The local authority in that case was relying on its contractual and proprietary rights when it applied for the eviction order.  As I have already said (see para 98, above), I agree with the Court of Appeal's conclusion in the <i>Leeds</i> appeal that the decision in <i>Connors</i> is incompatible with the extreme propositions that the exercise by a public authority of an unqualified right to possession will <i>never</i> constitute an interference with the occupier's right to respect for his home, and that it will <i>always</i> be justified under article 8(2): [2005] 1 WLR 1825, para 26.</p>
