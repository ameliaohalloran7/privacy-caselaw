<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;55. Section 47 shadows the opening provision of section 1, dealing with new deeds of tailzie, by also dealing with deeds dated on or after 1 August 1848.  The aim is to give a person in possession of land under a trust deed dated on or after that day an equivalent power to rid himself of prohibitions which are similar in effect to the fetters in an entail.  Whereas under section 1 the heir of entail is to apply to the court to record an instrument of disentail, under section 47 the party is to apply to the court for an act and decree declaring him to be the fee simple proprietor of the land or estate.  Leaving aside certain other requirements for the moment, under section 1 the procedure is available only to an heir of entail who is in possession and was born "after the date of such tailzie";  similarly, under section 47 the procedure is available only to a party who is in lawful possession of land or estate by virtue of any trust disposition or settlement or other deed of trust and who was born "after the date of such trust disposition or settlement or other deed of trust".  Section 1 is one of the sections that enshrine the policy behind the Act which Lord President Inglis identified in <i>Riddell, Petitioner</i> (1874) 1 R 462, 469.  Holding that an entail executed before 1 August 1848 was an old entail to which section 3 applied, even though the entailer died after that date, he said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The leading principle of the statute is that no man is allowed under a deed of entail dated after 1 August 1848 to impose fetters on a person then unborn.  This is not stated expressly, but everyone who has studied the Act and knows the history of it is aware that the object was that no man should impose fetters on persons unborn.  Now, surely, carrying out this principle, it is much more reasonable that this restriction should take effect when the entailer makes the deed than when he dies."<p></p></ul>
<p>On the same basis it can be said that the policy of section 47 of the 1848 Act was that no man was to be allowed under a trust deed dated on or after 1 August 1848 to impose prohibitions on a person who was unborn at the time when the deed was executed.  This was ultimately recognised in <i>Lord Binning, Petitioner</i> 1984 SLT 18 when the First Division held that, for the purposes of section 47, the date of the relevant trust disposition or settlement or other deed of trust was the date of its execution, with the result that a party born after that date, but before the death of the settlor, could petition for an act and decree declaring him to be the fee simple proprietor.  In the present proceedings it is common ground that a party can petition if he was born after the date of the execution of the trust disposition and settlement.  The dispute between the parties is as to what makes up the settlor's trust disposition and settlement for the purpose of ascertaining its date in terms of section 47.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;56. The settlor, the first Earl of Balfour, executed his trust disposition and settlement on 1 January 1923 ("the 1923 settlement").  This deed included clause In the Seventh Place under the relevant part of which he directed his trustees to hold the residue in trust</p>
<p></p><ul>"And to pay to or apply the whole nett revenue or income thereof for behoof of the following series of heirs in their order successively each for his or her liferent use allenarly, videlicet:-  My brother, the said Gerald William Balfour in liferent, whom failing the heir male of the body of the said Gerald William Balfour in liferent, whom failing the heir male of the body of my brother Eustace James Anthony Balfour (now deceased), in liferent…."<p></p></ul>
<p>The appellant is the fourth Earl of Balfour.  He was born in 1925.  He is the son of the third Earl, who was in his turn the son of the settlor's brother Gerald who became the second Earl on the death of the settlor in 1930.  The appellant became liferenter of the estate on the death of his father in 1968.  It is obvious - and is in any event agreed - that the appellant is in possession of the estate as liferenter in his capacity as "the heir male of the body of the said Gerald William Balfour" under clause In the Seventh Place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;57. It follows that, if the only deed which existed were the 1923 settlement, the appellant would undoubtedly have a right to apply for an act and decree:  he would be in lawful possession of the relevant lands and estate through trustees by virtue of the 1923 settlement; he was born after the date of that settlement and he is of full age.  He would fulfil all the requirements of section 47.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;58. The respondent contends, however, that the appellant has no right to make an application because of changes which the settlor subsequently made by codicil.  In 1927, after the birth of the appellant, the settlor executed a codicil whereby, in order to minimise the liability of his estate to Estate Duty, he cancelled the nomination of his brother Gerald as the first liferenter of the residue and replaced him with "the heir male of his [Gerald's] body".  But "in all other respects" he confirmed the 1923 settlement.  In 1929 the settlor executed a further codicil in which he appointed an additional literary executor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;59. As I have indicated in paragraph 55, the policy behind section 47 is that no man is to be allowed under a trust deed to impose prohibitions on a person unborn at the time when the deed was executed.  Here the settlor included prohibitions in the 1923 settlement.  The policy behind the Act would suggest that they should not bind anyone born after the date when that settlement, embodying the prohibitions, was executed.  Of course, if in some subsequent deed the settlor had "republished" the 1923 settlement, to use the terminology in <i>Miller's Trustees v Miller</i> 1958 SC 125, then it might well be appropriate to hold that the settlement had in effect been made of new and that its date for the purposes of section 47 was accordingly the date of that republication.  But in the first codicil the settlor simply made one change and in all other respects confirmed the 1923 settlement.  That is wholly inconsistent with any idea of republishing the provisions in the 1923 settlement with effect from 1927.  Still less can the second codicil, which simply added a new literary executor, be regarded as republishing the 1923 settlement.  In these circumstances it would seem contrary to the policy of the legislation to hold that the mere making of these codicils incidentally shifted the date of the settlement to 1927 or 1929 for the purposes of section 47, with the result that the appellant became subject to binding prohibitions, even though he belonged to a class whose members would have been free of the prohibitions when the 1923 settlement was executed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60. Again, the position might well be different if the appellant were in possession of the estate by virtue of both the 1923 settlement and a provision in one of the codicils.  The second codicil, however, has no conceivable bearing on his possession, while in the events which actually happened the first codicil has been spent since the death of the second Earl in 1945.  It follows that ever since he became liferenter in 1968 the appellant has possessed the estate through the trustees by virtue only of clause In the Seventh Place of the 1923 settlement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;61. In upholding the respondent's contention, the Extra Division (2002 SLT 981, 984) noted that on the death of the settlor in 1930 the settlement which took effect comprised the 1923 settlement and the two codicils.  In particular, by virtue of the first codicil, the trustees held the estate for Gerald's son as heir male of his body, rather than for Gerald himself, in liferent.  Since the trust settlement by virtue of which the first liferenter came into possession of the estate comprised the 1923 settlement and the first codicil, in the view of the Extra Division that remained for all time the trust settlement containing the directions to the trustees in determining the destination of the residuary estate on the death of the liferenter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;62. In my respectful opinion, their Lordships attached undue importance to the position on the death of the settlor.  Section 47 does not concern itself with the historic position but, rather, with the "trust disposition or settlement or other deed of trust" by virtue of which the land or estate "shall … be in the lawful possession, either directly or through any trustees for his behoof, of a party of full age…" who can apply to the Court of Session.  The use of the future tense tends to indicate that Parliament is prescribing the circumstances that must prevail before it is lawful for the party to make that application.  The whole matter must therefore be considered at the time of the application.  I find support for that approach in the decision of Lord Mackintosh in <i>Earl of Moray, Petitioner</i> 1950 SC 281, 282 - 283.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;63. As a matter of history, it is correct that, since his brother Gerald survived the settlor, the first codicil operated on the settlor's death so that Gerald's son became the first liferenter.  On Gerald's death, however, the first codicil was spent and became inoperative, just as it would have been inoperative if Gerald had predeceased the settlor:  in that eventuality Gerald's son would have been the first liferenter as the heir male of his body by virtue of clause In the Seventh Place alone.  These are simply examples of the common phenomenon that at one time a provision in a trust deed may be relevant and at another time irrelevant as people marry, have children or die.  If one asks, however, what is the trust settlement by virtue of which the appellant possesses the estate today, the answer is the 1923 settlement and nothing else - the two codicils are spent.  In these circumstances it would not only be highly artificial but also contrary to the policy of the enactment to hold that the appellant is in possession under a settlement dated 1927 or 1929 so that he could not free himself of the prohibitions in the 1923 settlement.  On the contrary, the appellant is in possession of the estate by virtue of the 1923 settlement and he was born after it was executed.  He is of full age.  He is therefore entitled to apply for an act and decree under section 47.  It is not suggested that, if he is entitled to present the summary petition, there is any reason why the prayer of the petition should not be granted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;64. For these reasons as well as those in the speeches of my noble and learned friends, Lord Hope of Craighead and Lord Clyde, which I have had the advantage of studying in draft, I agree that the appeal should be allowed and that the orders proposed by Lord Hope of Craighead should be made.</p>
