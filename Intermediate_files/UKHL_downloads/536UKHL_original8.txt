<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;178. The essence of the argument advanced on behalf of the appellant is contained in two propositions.  The first proposition is that the decision of this House in <i>B v DPP</i> [2000]  2 AC 428 established that mens rea was an essential element of every criminal offence unless Parliament expressly or by implication provided to the contrary.  Knowledge on the part of a defendant that the article or substance which he was carrying or had under his control was a controlled drug was an essential ingredient of the offence of possession of a controlled drug with intent to supply contrary to section 5(3) of the 1971 Act.  The second proposition is that subsections 28(2) and (3) transfer the onus of proof to a defendant by requiring him to prove that he neither knew nor suspected nor had reason to suspect that the article or substance which he was carrying was a controlled drug, and therefore the subsections were in breach of Article 6(2) as they reversed the burden of proof in respect of an essential ingredient of the offence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;179. The argument advanced on behalf of the Crown is that the essential ingredients which the prosecution has to prove to establish the offence under section 5(3) in a case such as that against the appellant is possession of the bag and its contents, which required proof that the defendant knew that he had control over the bag and whatever object or substance was inside it, and also proof that the contents of the bag were, in fact, a controlled drug.  Subsections 28(2) and (3) provide a defence which arises only after the prosecution has proved the essential ingredients of the offence, and therefore there is no transfer of the burden of proof which infringes the presumption of innocence set out in Article 6(2).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;180. Before considering these opposing submissions it is necessary to have regard to the authorities in relation to the offences of possession of controlled drugs under section 5(2) and 5(3).  In <i>R v Boyesen</i> [1982]  AC 768, 773G Lord Scarman stated:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The statutory offence may be described as an absolute one in the sense that the prosecution establish it by proving possession without authority:  section 5(1) and section 5(2) of the Act.  Section 28 provides for certain defences which, if they are to succeed, the defendant must prove on a balance of probabilities.  They do not arise for consideration in this appeal.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Possession is a deceptively simple concept.  It denotes a physical control or custody of a thing plus knowledge that you have it in your custody or control.  You may possess a thing without knowing or comprehending its nature:  but you do not possess it unless you know you have it."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>R v McNamara</i> (1988)  87 Cr App R 246, 251 Lord Lane CJ, in considering an appeal against a conviction under section 5(3) stated:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It seems to us, in order to make sense of the provisions of section 28, and also to make as clear as can be possible the decision in <i>Warner v. M.P.C. (supra)</i>, the draftsman of the Act intended that the prosecution should have the initial burden of proving that the defendant had, and knew that he had, in these circumstances the box in his control and also that the box contained something.  That, in our judgment, establishes the necessary possession.  They must also of course prove that the box in fact contained the drug alleged, in this case cannabis resin.  If any of those matters are unproved, there is no case to go to the jury . . . . <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Once the prosecution have proved that the defendant had control of the box, knew that he had control and knew that the box contained something which was in fact the drug alleged, the burden, in our judgment, is cast upon him to bring himself within those provisions."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;181. In my respectful opinion the law in relation to section 5(3) and section 28(2) and (3) was correctly stated by Lord Lane, save that the illuminating analysis of section 28 by the Lord Justice General, Lord Rodger, in <i>Salmon v HM Advocate</i> demonstrates that where a defendant advances the defence that he did not know that the bag or other container which he was carrying contained a controlled drug and believed it contained a different type of article such as a video film,  this defence arises under section 28(2) and not under section 28(3).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;182. It is also relevant to observe that subsections 28(2) and (3) expressly impose not merely an evidential burden on the defendant but a persuasive (or legal) burden.  Therefore the appellant derives no assistance from <i>B v Director of Public Prosecutions</i> as it is clear that Parliament has expressly provided that the prosecution need not prove the mental element of knowledge.  A persuasive burden is one where the matter in question must be taken as proved against the defendant unless he satisfies the jury on the balance of probabilities to the contrary.  An evidential burden is one where the matter must be taken as proved against the defendant unless there is sufficient evidence to raise an issue on the matter but, if there is sufficient evidence, then the burden rests on the prosecution to satisfy the jury as to the matter beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;183. As I have observed, the submission advanced by the Crown is that (a) Parliament has chosen by section 5(3) to create an offence in which knowledge by the defendant that he has custody or control of a controlled drug is not an essential element, and that the issue of lack of knowledge by the defendant only arises as a defence under subsections 28(2) or (3), and (b) accordingly under European jurisprudence there is no violation of the presumption of innocence given by Article 6(2).  Viewed in the context of English law alone I consider that proposition (a) is correct, but I am unable to accept proposition (b) because I think that a similar submission on behalf of the Government of France was not wholly accepted by the European Court of Human Rights in <i>Salabiaku v France</i> [1988]  13 EHRR 379.  In that case a presumption of criminal liability was laid down in Article 392(1) of the French Customs Code for every person who was found in possession of prohibited goods.  Mr Salabiaku complained of a violation of Article 6(2).  The argument advanced on behalf of the French Government was very similar to the argument advanced on behalf of the Crown in the present case.  In paragraph 27 of its judgment the Court recorded the argument on behalf of the French Government as follows:</p>
<p></p><ul>"As the Government and the Commission have pointed out, in principle the Contracting States remain free to apply the criminal law to an act where it is not carried out in the normal exercise of one of the rights protected under the Convention and, accordingly, to define the constituent elements of the resulting offence.  In particular, and again in principle, the Contracting States may, under certain conditions, penalise a simple or objective fact as such, irrespective of whether it results from criminal intent or from negligence."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;184. The Court held that this argument could not be accepted in its entirety and stated in paragraph 28:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Presumptions of fact or of law operate in every legal system.  Clearly, the Convention does not prohibit such presumptions in principle.  It does, however, require the Contracting States to remain within certain limits in this respect as regards criminal law.  If, as the Commission would appear to consider, paragraph 2 of Article 6 merely laid down a guarantee to be respected by the courts in the conduct of legal proceedings, its requirements would in practice overlap with the duty of impartiality imposed in paragraph 1.  Above all, the national legislature would be free to strip the trial court of any genuine power of assessment and deprive the presumption of innocence of its substance, if the words 'according to law' were construed exclusively with reference of domestic law.  Such a situation could not be reconciled with the object and purpose of Article 6, which, by protecting the right to a fair trial and in particular the right to be presumed innocent, is intended to enshrine the fundamental principle of the rule of law<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Article 6(2) does not therefore regard presumptions of fact or of law provided for in the criminal law with indifference.  It requires States to confine them within reasonable limits which take into account the importance of what is at stake and maintain the rights of the defence.  The Court proposes to consider whether such limits were exceeded to the detriment of Mr. Salabiaku."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;185. Therefore, following the jurisprudence of the Court, I consider that the Crown cannot rebut an argument based on a violation of Article 6(2) by simply contending that the Government of the United Kingdom is entitled "to define the constituent elements of the . . . offence", and that a violation of Article 6(2) is avoided because  the 1971 Act makes absence of knowledge of being in possession of a controlled drug a defence rather than making knowledge an ingredient of the offence which the prosecution has to prove.</p>
<i><p>Is the presumption contained within reasonable limits?</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;186. Whether or not there has been a violation of Article 6(2) depends, therefore, upon whether the presumption created by section 28(2) and (3) is confined within reasonable limits which take into account the importance of what is at stake and maintains the rights of the defence. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;187. In <i>X v United Kingdom </i>(19 July 1972) the applicant had been convicted of living on the immoral earnings of a prostitute.  He complained of a violation of Article 6(2) on the ground that the statutory provision under which he was convicted provided that " . . . a man who lives with or is habitually in the company of a prostitute . . . shall be presumed to be knowingly living on the earnings of prostitution unless he proves the contrary."  The Commission held that his complaint was manifestly ill-founded and stated in its decision:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The statutory presumption in the present case is restrictively worded.  It requires the prosecution to prove that the defendant 'lives or is habitually in the company of a prostitute or . . . (that he) exercises control, direction or influence over (her) movements in a way which shows he is aiding, abetting or compelling her prostitution'.  Only when this has been proved is it presumed that he is knowingly living on her earnings and he is then entitled to disprove the presumption.  The presumption is neither irrebuttable nor unreasonable.  To oblige the prosecution to obtain direct  evidence of "living on immoral earnings" would in most cases make its task impossible."<p></p></ul>
<p>In my opinion the reasoning of the Commission can be relied on by the Crown in this case.  In the present case the statutory presumption is restrictively worded in that it requires the prosecution to prove that the defendant is in possession of the container containing the controlled drug and that the substance inside the container is, in fact, a controlled drug.  Only when this is proved is it presumed that he knew that the substance was a controlled drug and he is then entitled to disprove the presumption.  The presumption is neither irrebuttable nor unreasonable.  To oblige the prosecution to prove that the defendant knew that the substance was a controlled drug in many cases would make it very difficult to obtain a conviction (a point to which I will refer in more detail in a later part of this speech).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;188. In <i>AG v Malta</i> (10th December 1991) the applicant complained that he had been deprived of the presumption of innocence guaranteed by Article 6(2) by a statutory provision which provided that a director of a company is presumed guilty of an offence committed by the company unless he proves that the offence was committed without his knowledge and that he exercised all due diligence to prevent the commission of the offence.  The applicant brought an application before the Constitutional Court of Malta claiming that the provision was in conflict with the article of the Constitution of Malta which guaranteed the presumption of innocence.  His application was dismissed by the Constitutional Court and the European Commission also rejected his application and stated in its decision:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The Commission notes that in the present case the legislation provides that a director of a company is presumed guilty of an offence committed by the company unless he proves that the offence was committed without his knowledge and that he exercised all due diligence to prevent the commission of the offence.  The applicant was therefore provided under the legislation with the possibility of exculpating himself.  The Commission does not consider that the conditions, which required the applicant to prove that he had no actual knowledge of the offence and also was not negligent in his duties as an officer of a company, were self-contradictory or imposed an irrebuttable presumption.  The Commission further finds that the Maltese courts enjoyed a genuine freedom of assessment in this area and that there is no indication that Article 13 of the 1975 Act was applied to the applicant in a manner incompatible with the presumption of innocence.<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;189. In a number of judgments the European Court has given guidance as to the extent to which a Convention right may be qualified by national legislation and these judgments were considered by the Privy Council in <i>Brown v Stott</i> [2001]  2 WLR 817.  Lord Bingham of Cornhill stated at p 836B:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The jurisprudence of the European Court very clearly establishes that while the overall fairness of a criminal trial cannot be compromised, the constituent rights comprised, whether expressly or implicitly, within article 6 are not themselves absolute.  Limited qualification of these rights is acceptable if reasonably directed by national authorities towards a clear and proper public objective and if representing no greater qualification than the situation calls for.  The general language of the Convention could have led to the formulation of hard-edged and inflexible statements of principle from which no departure could be sanctioned whatever the background or the circumstances.  But this approach has been consistently eschewed by the court throughout its history."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Hope of Craighead stated at p 851H:</p>
<p></p><ul>"I would hold therefore that the jurisprudence of the European Court tells us that the questions that should be addressed when issues are raised about an alleged incompatibility with a right under article 6 of the Convention are the following: (1) is the right which is in question an absolute right, or is it a right which is open to modification or restriction because it is not absolute?  (2) if it is not absolute, does the modification or restriction which is contended for have a legitimate aim in the public interest?  (3) if so, is there a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised?  The answer to the question whether the right is or is not absolute is to be found by examining the terms of the article in the light of the judgments of the court.  The question whether a legitimate aim is being pursued enables account to be taken of the public interest in the rule of law.  The principle of proportionality directs attention to the question whether a fair balance has been struck between the general interest of the community in the realisation of that aim and the protection of the fundamental rights of the individual."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;190. Therefore in considering whether a rebuttable presumption of</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knowledge created by section 28(2) and (3) is compatible with Article 6(2) a number of factors (which to some extent overlap) have to be considered:</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the presumption created by subsections 28(2) and (3) directed towards a clear and proper public objective?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion it clearly is.  The taking of controlled drugs is a great social evil which causes widespread suffering and the possession of controlled drugs with intent to supply is a grave and frequently committed offence which ensures the continuation of this social evil. </p>
<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the creation of the presumption a reasonable measure for Parliament to take and is there a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In considering this matter it is necessary, as Lord Hope of Craighead stated in <i>Brown v Stott</i>, to assess whether a fair balance has been struck between the general interest of the community and the personal rights of the individual.  In my opinion the threat posed by drugs to the welfare of society is so grave and the difficulty in some cases of rebutting a defence that the defendant believed that he was carrying something other than drugs is so great that it was reasonable for Parliament to impose a persuasive burden as to lack of knowledge on a defendant.  The question whether a fair balance has been struck depends in large measure on whether the creation of an evidential burden as opposed to a persuasive burden on a defendant would be adequate to remedy the problem with which subsections 28(2) and (3) were intended to deal.  That problem can arise in the type of case where the Crown proves that a man was carrying a container such as a bag and that the bag contained a controlled drug, or where the Crown proves that tablets, which were a controlled drug, were on a table in the bedroom of the defendant's house and the defendant raises the defence that he believed that the object in the bag was a video film or that the tablets on the bedroom table were painkillers.  In such cases it will often be very difficult to prove guilt if the prosecution has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew that the bag contained a controlled drug or that the tablets were a controlled drug. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;191. It is clear from the decisions of the European Commission in <i>X v United Kingdom</i> and <i>AG v Malta</i> that the difficulty of proving knowledge on the part of the defendant is one of the factors which can justify the creation of a presumption against a defendant, where the presumption is neither irrebuttable nor unreasonable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;192. I am, with respect, unable to agree with the view that the problem of obtaining a conviction against a guilty person can be surmounted by imposing a evidential burden on the defendant.  All that a defendant would have to do to discharge such a burden would be to adduce some evidence to raise the issue that he did not know that the article in the bag or the tablets on the table were a controlled drug, and the prosecution would then have to destroy that defence in such a manner as to leave in the jury's mind no reasonable doubt that the defendant knew that it was a controlled drug in the bag or on the table.  Blackstone's Criminal Practice (2001) states at para F3.7, page 1996:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Although it is said . . . . that the evidential burden is on the defence, that burden will be discharged <i>whenever</i> there is sufficient evidence in relation to the defence to leave it to the jury . . . . it has been said that . . . . if there is a reasonable possibility on one interpretation of the evidence adduced that the accused may have that defence, the judge should put it to the jury <i>(Watson)</i> [1992]  Crim LR 434)."  <p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion it would be easy for a defendant to raise the defence of lack of knowledge by an assertion in his police statement or by adducing evidence (which could be from a third person), and the Crown would then have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did have knowledge.  Therefore I think that in a drugs case, in practice, there is little difference between the burden of proving knowledge resting throughout on the prosecution and requiring the defendant to raise the issue of knowledge before the burden of proof on that matter reverts to the prosecution. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;193. Support for the appellant's argument is to be found in the opinion of the Criminal Law Revision Committee in paragraph 140 of its Eleventh Report that:  "both on principle and for the sake of clarity and convenience in practice, burdens on the defence should be evidential only."  But in my opinion the threat of drugs to the well being of the community and the peculiar difficulty of proving knowledge in such cases justifies an exception to the general principle advocated by the Criminal Law Revision Committee, and this was clearly the view taken by Parliament in enacting sections 5 and 28 of the 1991 Act.  Moreover the transfer of the burden of proof as to knowledge in drugs cases has the powerful support of Lord Reid and Lord Pearce in <i>Warner v Metropolitan Police Commissioner</i> [1969]  2 AC 256 to which I later refer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;194. The argument advanced against the imposition of a persuasive burden is that it creates the position that where a defendant fails to satisfy the jury on the balance of probabilities that he did not know he was carrying drugs, the jury will or may convict him notwithstanding that they have a reasonable doubt as to whether or not he had that knowledge.  In theory there is force in this argument, but in my respectful opinion there is greater force in the common sense view of Lord Pearce in <i>Sweet v Parsley</i> [1970]  AC 132 where the defendant was charged under section 5(b) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1965 with being concerned in the management of premises used for the purpose of smoking cannabis resin.  Lord Pearce said at p 157D:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Parliament might, of course, have taken what was conceded in argument to be a fair and sensible course.  It could have said, in appropriate words, that a person is to be liable unless he proves that he had no knowledge or guilty mind.  Admittedly, if the prosecution have to prove a defendant's knowledge beyond reasonable doubt, it may be easy for the guilty to escape.  But it would be very much harder for the guilty to escape if the burden of disproving mens rea or knowledge is thrown on the defendant.  And if that were done, innocent people could satisfy a jury of their innocence on a balance of probabilities.  It has been said that a jury might be confused by the different nature of the onus of satisfying 'beyond reasonable doubt' which the prosecution have to discharge and the onus 'on a balance of probabilities' which lies on a defendant in proving that he had no knowledge or guilt.  I do not believe that this would be so in this kind of case.  Most people can easily understand rules that express in greater detail that which their own hearts and minds already feel to be fair and sensible."<p></p></ul>
<p>In my opinion it is not unprincipled to have regard to practical realities where the issue relates to knowledge in a drugs case. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;195. Clayton and Tomlinson in <i>The</i> <i>Law of Human Rights</i> state at para 6.37:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Convention rights are expressed in broad and open textured language.  This means that when construing the Human Rights Act, it will be both appropriate and inevitable that the English courts should put these broad concepts in context: by reflecting domestic legal and cultural values and traditions.  Precisely because the Commission and the Court recognise an interpretative obligation to respect the primacy of domestic states in interpreting the scope and content of rights, the English courts will be afforded a margin of appreciation in developing a human rights jurisprudence to meet domestic conditions."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the heart of the present case is the concept of a fair trial which is enshrined in Article 6.  However the concept of a fair trial has been an integral part of the law of the United Kingdom long before it was set out in the Convention.  It is clear that thirty years ago members of this House considered that it was not unfair for Parliament to place a persuasive burden as to lack of knowledge on the defendant in a drugs case.  In <i>Warner v Metropolitan Police Commissioner</i> the appellant was charged with an offence under section 1(1) of the Drugs (Prevention of Misuse) Act 1964 which provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>" . . . it shall not be lawful for a person to have in his possession a substance for the time being specified in the schedule to this Act unless [being duly authorised]"<p></p></ul>
<p>The prosecution proved that the appellant was driving a van in the back of which there was a case with a plastic bag containing 20,000 amphetamine sulphate tablets.  His defence was that he believed that the case contained scent.  The question certified by the Court of Appeal for the opinion of this House was:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Whether for the purposes of section 1 of the Drugs (Prevention of Misuse) Act, 1964, a defendant is deemed to be in possession of a prohibited substance when to his knowledge he is in physical possession of the substance but is unaware of its true nature."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;196. In the course of their speeches the members of the House considered at length the issue which arises when such an defence is advanced in a drugs case.  In the course of his speech Lord Pearce said at p 307B:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It would, I think, be an improvement of a difficult position if Parliament were to enact that when a person has ownership or physical possession of drugs he shall be guilty unless he proves on a balance of probabilities that he was unaware of their nature or had reasonable excuse for their possession."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Reid also recognised that Parliament might think it right to transfer the onus of proof and said at p 280A:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In a case like this Parliament, if consulted, might think it right to transfer the onus of proof so that an accused would have to prove that he neither knew nor had any reason to suspect that he had a prohibited drug in his possession."<p></p></ul>
<p>In <i>Sweet v Parsley</i> Lord Reid said at p 149F:</p>
<p></p><ul>"One must put oneself in the position of a legislator.  It has long been the practice to recognise absolute offences in this class of quasi-criminal acts, and one can safely assume that, when Parliament is passing new legislation dealing with this class of offences, its silence as to mens rea means that the old practice is to apply.  But when one comes to acts of a truly criminal character, it appears to me that there are at least two other factors which any reasonable legislator would have in mind.  In the first place a stigma still attaches to any person convicted of a truly criminal offence, and the more serious or more disgraceful the offence the greater the stigma.  So he would have to consider whether, in a case of this gravity, the public interest really requires that an innocent person should be prevented from proving his innocence in order that fewer guilty men may escape.  And equally important is the fact that fortunately the Press in this country are vigilant to expose injustice and every manifestly unjust conviction made known to the public tends to injure the body politic by undermining public confidence in the justice of the law and of its administration. . . . . <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>The choice would be much more difficult if there were no other way open than either mens rea in the full sense or an absolute offence;  for there are many kinds of case where putting on the prosecutor the full burden of proving mens rea creates great difficulties and may lead to many unjust acquittals.  But there are at least two other possibilities.  Parliament has not infrequently transferred the onus as regards mens rea to the accused, so that, once the necessary facts are proved, he must convince the jury that on balance of probabilities he is innocent of any criminal intention.  I find it a little surprising that more use has not been made of this method:  but one of the bad effects of the decision of this House in <i>Woolmington v Director of Public Prosecutions</i> [1935]  AC 462 may have been to discourage its use."<p></p></ul>
