<p align="right"><a href="pretty-5.htm">(back to preceding text)</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115. The response of the Crown Prosecutor on behalf of the Director to the letter of 27 July 2001 was:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Successive Directors - and Attorneys General - have explained that they will not grant immunities that condone, require, or purport to authorise or permit the future commission of any criminal offence, no matter how exceptional the circumstances.  I must therefore advise you that the Director cannot provide the undertaking that you seek."<p></p></ul>
<p>This was a proper reply.  Indeed, any other reply would almost certainly have been improper.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116. In exceptional circumstances it may be proper for a member of the public to bring proceedings against the Crown for a declaration that certain proposed conduct is lawful and name the Attorney-General as the formal defendant to the claim.  But that is not what occurred here and, even then, the Court would have a discretion which it would normally exercise to refuse to rule upon hypothetical facts.  Had the case raised by the appellant been one where it was appropriate to grant a declaration as to legality or compatibility, the court would no doubt have adopted that approach.  Indeed, the judgment of the Divisional Court and the speeches of your Lordships on the human rights questions will no doubt provide in practice the appropriate guidance to all those concerned in this matter as to the correct understanding of the law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117. The request for the undertaking was a request for the grant of an immunity from prosecution equivalent to the grant of a dispensation from the operation of the criminal law or an anticipatory pardon.  Even if there was a power to grant a pardon, it could not be exercised in advance.  As Lord Bridge said in <i>A-G of Trinidad and Tobago v Phillip</i> [1995]  1 AC 396 at 411:</p>
<p></p><ul>"However while a pardon can expunge past offences, a power to pardon cannot be used to dispense with criminal responsibility for an offence which has not yet been committed.  This is a principle of general application which is of the greatest importance.  The state cannot be allowed to use a power to pardon to enable the law to be set aside by permitting it to be contravened with impunity."<p></p></ul>
<p>Likewise any purported Executive power to suspend or dispense with a law or the execution of a law, save under an express statutory authority, has been unlawful since at least 1688.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118. The intentions stated in the solicitor's letter were wholly unparticularised, save that the second person who was to assist was to be the appellant's husband not any independent or medically qualified person.  This has remained the position throughout these proceedings.  The point was raised in a witness statement dated 19 September filed on behalf of the Director.  The Divisional Court were told by Mr Havers that no further information would be forthcoming and that they had been told all that they needed to know (paragraph 6 of the judgment).  In the same context it was also stated that any non-availability of appropriate palliative care was not part of the appellant's case.  This lack of detail demonstrates that even if he had had the power to do so the Director could not properly have given any advance undertaking or assurance.  He had not got the information, let alone the evidence, which would be needed to make any decision upon the question of consent in accordance with the s.10 Code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119. But this lack of information illustrates two further points.  The first is that any undertaking or other advance assurance would inevitably give rise to the need for a later investigation whether the death of the appellant had in truth been by suicide and what, in the event, had been the actual participation of Mr Pretty (in all probability, the sole surviving witness).  It would then have to be decided whether what had occurred had or had not been covered by the undertaking.  Further proceedings for judicial review would then no doubt ensue.  This is a wholly impractical and objectionable scenario.  Issues of fact which should be left to be tried in a criminal court on a criminal prosecution conducted in accordance with the criminal law would be being raised in satellite litigation which would be directly contrary to the guidance given in <i>Kebilene</i> (<i>sup</i>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120. Secondly, it demonstrates the highly unsatisfactory character of the approach adopted by the appellant and her advisers.  If assisted suicide is to be permitted, it is essential that the permission include suitable safeguards of an appropriate rigour and specificity.  The Dutch scheme includes an elaborate medically supervised and executed procedure.  The minority judgments in <i>Rodriguez v A-G of Canada</i> [1994]  2 LRC 136 which favoured legalising assisted suicide treated the formulation of satisfactory conditions as a necessary first step and attempted to do so: see 76 BCLR (2d) 145, at 168-9 and [1994] 2 LRC at 147-8.  The reasoning of the majority decision included the view that the proposed safeguards were inadequate and impractical.  The conclusion is inescapable that both the nature of the questions raised by assisted suicide and the formulation of any new policies must under our system of parliamentary democracy be a matter for the Legislature not the Judiciary.  For the time being, Parliament has spoken by including s.2 in the Suicide Act 1961.  Any amendment of that section and its terms would be a matter for Parliament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121. This leads on to a further matter, also covered by <i>Kebilene</i>.  The Director is governed by the existing law.  He must exercise his discretion in accordance with the law.  If there are disputes as to what the law is he should, provided that they are real disputes, leave them to the criminal courts to decide.  It is no part of the Director's function himself to decide arguable questions of law.  Nor is it acceptable (save, perhaps, in the most exceptional circumstances which I cannot at present visualise) to seek to use an application for the judicial review of the Director's decision to prosecute as a means of challenging in advance some proposition of law upon which the prosecution will rely at the trial.  The observations of my noble and learned friend Lord Steyn in <i>Kebilene</i> at p.371, from which he has already drawn in his speech on this appeal, are pertinent and their wisdom is further demonstrated by the present case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122. Some reliance was placed by the appellant, as has been noted by some of your Lordships, upon the fact that on some occasions the Director in England and the Lord Advocate in Scotland have made statements that in certain circumstances they would not authorise prosecutions.  Upon examination, these have turned out to be examples of the application of the guidance given in the Code or similar principles applicable in Scotland.  The main example relied upon in relation to the Director (and replicated in Scotland) concerned breathalyser evidence using Home Office approved devices.  The devices (or some of them) had been found to be unreliable below a certain level of breath alcohol.  The effect of what the Director said, confirmed by the Home Office, was that in view of this unreliability, prosecutions would not be authorised where the evidence relied upon was unreliable, <i>ie</i> would fail the "Evidential Test".  The instances referred to by the appellant thus provided no analogy for the present case nor any justification for the approach which her advisers adopted to the role of the Director.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123. In conclusion therefore, in agreement with what my noble and learned friend Lord Steyn has said on this topic both in this case and in <i>Kebilene</i>, I would stress that the procedure of seeking to by-pass the ordinary operation of our system of criminal justice by raising questions of law and applying for the judicial review of 'decisions' of the Director cannot be approved and should be firmly discouraged.  It undermines the proper and fair management of our criminal justice system.</p>
<p><b>LORD SCOTT OF FOSCOTE</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;124. I have had the advantage of reading in advance the opinions of my noble and learned friends Lord Bingham of Cornhill, Lord Steyn and Lord Hope of Craighead.  I am in complete agreement with them and, for the reasons they give, would dismiss the appeal in this sad case.</p>
