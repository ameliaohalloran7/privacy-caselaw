<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115. A further argument was advanced by Mr O'Connor on behalf of Looseley that the request to him for drugs by the police officer was a violation of his right to respect for his private life under article 8 of the European Convention.  I consider for the reasons given by my noble and learned friend, Lord Hoffmann, that that argument is without substance.  Accordingly I would answer the certified question in the negative and would dismiss Looseley's appeal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116. In the case giving rise to the Attorney General's Reference I respectfully differ from the view taken by the Court of Appeal and I consider that the judge was right to rule that the prosecution should be stayed on the ground that the police officers had instigated the offence.  It was clear on the facts that the reason why the acquitted person had supplied heroin to the officers was because they repeatedly offered to supply, and did supply to him, cut-price cigarettes and he wished to continue to benefit from that supply.  When he was interviewed by the police after his arrest he said that he was not interested in heroin, but that he had become involved because two men had approached him offering to sell him cheap cigarettes.  He said it was "a favour for a favour".  Therefore the officers did more than give him the opportunity to commit the offence of supplying heroinâ€” they instigated the offence because they offered him inducements that would not ordinarily be associated with the commission of such an offence.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117. I would answer the point of law referred by the Attorney General by stating that in relation to the exercise of the judicial discretion conferred by section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and the exercise of the power to stay proceedings as an abuse of process of the court, the principles of English law as set out in the authorities to which reference has been made in this speech are in conformity with article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights and do not require modification.</p>
<p><b>LORD SCOTT OF FOSCOTE</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118. I have had the advantage of reading in advance the opinions of my noble and learned friends, Lord Hoffmann, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead and Lord Hutton, and am in complete agreement with their analysis of the nature of an entrapment defence in criminal proceedings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119. In <i>R v Sang</i> [1980]  AC 402 this House made clear that there was no defence of "entrapment" known to English law (see Lord Diplock at pp 432B and Lord Salmon at p 443B/C).  If "defence" is restricted to meaning a contention that if accepted would negative guilt, the proposition that there is no defence of entrapment remains as true today as it was in 1980.  If the act done by an individual constitutes the actus reus of the crime and the individual has the requisite mens rea it is no defence for him to say that he did the act at the invitation or instigation or with the encouragement of someone else.  And if the "someone else" turns out, unbeknownst to the individual at the time, to be a police officer or  some other representative of the executive, the ingredients necessary to constitute the commission of the offence are as much present as they would be if the "someone else" had no connection at all with the authorities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120. Neither section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 nor article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights has elevated "entrapment" to the status of a defence in the sense described above.  Section 78 gives the court a discretion to exclude evidence if "the evidence would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the court ought not to admit it".  Where evidence has been obtained by entrapment this condition for its exclusion may in some cases be satisfied.  Where the evidence is excluded the consequence in some cases may be that the prosecution cannot succeed.  But the entrapment circumstances that will have brought about this result will not have constituted a defence in the sense described above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121. The entrapment circumstances may in some cases be such that a prosecution would be "an affront to the public conscience" (Lord Steyn in <i>R v Latif</i> [1996]  1 WLR 109, 112) or "deeply offensive to ordinary notions of fairness" (Lord Bingham of Cornhill CJ in <i>Nottingham City Council v Amin</i> [2000]  2 WLR 1071, 1076).  In cases of that sort the court has an inherent jurisdiction to stay the prosecution (see <i>R v Horseferry Road Magistrates' Court Ex p Bennett</i> [1994]  1 AC 42).  A successful application to stay a prosecution on the ground of entrapment enables the accused to escape from the charge.  But the entrapment still cannot be properly described as a defence.  It does not negative any of the ingredients requisite for guilt.  The court's decision to allow the accused to go free is based upon its disapproval of the behaviour of the police officers, not upon the prosecution's failure to establish those ingredients.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122. Article 6 entitles an accused to a fair trial "in the determination â€¦ of any criminal charge against him â€¦".  This re-states what was already English law.  It is a fundamental principle of English law that the court is under the duty to ensure the accused a fair trial (see <i>R v Sang</i> [1980] AC 402).  The fairness of a trial may be compromised if the prosecution is allowed to rely on evidence obtained by unfair means.  The court's discretion under section 78 of the 1984 Act to exclude evidence (see <i>R v Khan (Sultan)</i> [1997]  AC 558) provides the remedy in domestic law and, in my opinion, enables the domestic law to accord with what is required for compliance in this area with article 6 (see <i>Khan v United Kingdom</i> (2000) 8 BHRC 310).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123. In <i>Teixeira de Castro v Portugal</i> (1998)  28 EH RR 101, the European Court of Human Rights considered entrapment in the context of article 6.  The facts of the case and the relevant paragraphs of the court's judgment are set out in the opinion of my noble and learned friend, Lord Hutton.  I need not repeat them.  The court concluded, at p 116, para 39, that the intervention of the police officers and their instigation of the offence with which the accused had been charged "meant that, right from the outset, the applicant was definitively deprived of a fair trial" and that, consequently, there had been a violation of article 6(1).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;124. My Lords, I confess that I have found it rather difficult to follow why the facts recited in the European Court's judgment rendered the trial unfair.  But, on the footing that in the particular circumstances of that case it would have been unfair to Mr de Castro to allow the prosecution to put in evidence the facts that had followed the police officers' intervention and instigation, the application in English law of section 78 would have produced the same result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125. It is, in my opinion, important to keep clear and distinct, whether under domestic law or for article 6 purposes, matters which constitute a defence properly-so-called and matters which may provide a reason for excluding particular evidence.  It is well established that documents and information held by the prosecution which may prove the accused's innocence should be disclosed (see <i>R v Keane</i> (1994) Cr App R 1).  If the prosecution is unwilling to disclose them, for example because they may disclose the identity and place in danger an informant, the prosecution will usually have to be abandoned.  But documents and material which relate only to the question whether the admission of particular evidence would be unfair need not lead to so stark a conclusion.  In considering whether police officers had sufficient existing grounds for suspecting an individual of involvement in crime in order to justify their undercover involvement in the commission of the offence charged, the police should not, in my opinion, be expected to disclose the source of their suspicions if to do so would reveal the identity of an informant or prejudice their ability to obtain similar information in the future.  Entrapment allegations in resisting a prosecution must not be allowed to achieve the status of a true defence.  Otherwise the balance to which my noble and learned friend, Lord Hutton, referred in paragraph 19 of his opinion would, I fear, tilt unacceptably towards those who commit crimes and to the detriment of the public at large.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;126. I agree with my noble and learned friends that for the reasons they have given the certified question in the Looseley case should be answered "No" and that the appeal should be dismissed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;127. In the case giving rise to the Attorney General's reference I am less clear that the police officers' conduct was such as to require the section 78 discretion to be exercised so as to exclude the evidence of the undercover police officers.  I doubt whether the conduct of the police officers was out of the line of what might have been expected of many purchasers of contraband cigarettes.  The inducements offered to the accused in order to persuade him to supply heroin do not seem to me to correspond with what would be necessary to cause the prosecution to be an affront to the public or to offend ordinary notions of fairness.  This was, however, a matter for the discretion of the trial judge, and it may be that his value judgment was one that he was entitled to reach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;128. I respectfully agree with the answer proposed by Lord Hutton to the point of law referred by the Attorney General.</p>
