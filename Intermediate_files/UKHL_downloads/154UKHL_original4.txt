<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the notion that a subjective intention is enough to defeat a presumed dedication under section 31(1) leads to difficulties. Despite the submission of Mr Simpson, for the interveners Yattendon Estates Ltd, to the contrary, it would be unattractive and surprising, as Mr Mould QC, for the Secretary of State, accepted, if a landowner could simply rely, after the expiry of the twenty years, on his statement (e.g. at an inquiry such as those held in the present cases) that he had no intention to dedicate. To meet that point, the courts have developed a theory which appears to me to be unjustified, whether it is a principle of law or a practical rule. That theory is that, in the absence of some contemporary overt act or statement, a fact-finding tribunal cannot, or is unlikely to, find a sufficient intention not to dedicate merely on the basis of the landowner's subsequent statement to that effect (see e.g. per Auld LJ in this case in the Court of Appeal at [2006] QB 727 at paragraph 64). Why should that be so? It would not be justified by the statutory wording, even if it had the meaning that the respondents allege. In many, I suspect most, cases it would be easy to believe that a landowner would not want to have a highway, even it is only a public footpath, over his land. Further, in the light of the way the proviso to section 31(1) is expressed ("sufficient evidence that there was no intention"), it appears to me that, on the respondents' case, a landowner could defeat a claim simply on the basis that he was unaware of the effect of the main part of section 31(1).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, the cogent and clear analysis of Denning LJ in <i>Fairey v Southampton County Council </i>[1956] 2 QB 439 at 458, quoted by Lord Hoffmann, clearly indicates that the intention referred to in the proviso to section 1(1) of the 1932 Act was intended to be a communicated intention. That analysis was accepted and recorded in textbooks, and it was followed and applied in cases identified by Lord Hoffmann by High Court Judges and by the Court of Appeal for the subsequent forty years. Further, it appears to have been an analysis which was acceptable to the legislature, given that section 1(1) of the 1932 Act was re-enacted in section 34(1) of the Highways Act 1959 and again in section 31(1) of the 1980 Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixthly, I turn to the crucial question of the effect of the words of the proviso to section 31(1). I do not agree with the Court of Appeal that construing the word "intention" in the section as carrying with it the notion of communication involves placing an unjustifiable gloss on the statutory wording.  At least outside the criminal law, the word is often used by lawyers in a way which carries with it a requirement to communicate, as well as to possess, the relevant intention. Indeed, sometimes, an uncommunicated intention is irrelevant, as when one speaks of the intention of the parties when construing a contract. Further, the proviso does not require "no intention" but "sufficient evidence that there was no intention". If the respondents were correct, there would have been no need for that longer phrase. The notion that the "evidence" referred to in the proviso must be contemporaneous and communicated is further supported by the fact that a very similar phrase (including both "evidence" and "intention") is used at the end of section 31(3) to describe the effect of a notice erected on the way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85.&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventhly, the provisions of section 31(3) to 31(6) seem pretty extraordinary if an uncommunicated intention suffices to satisfy the proviso. Why bother with such potentially time-consuming and expensive procedures if, for instance, a simple and clear letter from the landowner to his solicitor, confirming that he has no intention to dedicate, will do?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86.&nbsp;&nbsp;Eighthly, Mr Laurence QC, for the appellants, raised the spectre of a landowner being able to defeat a claim under section 31(1), if the respondents are correct, by sending such a letter, and only some time thereafter calling the right into question by challenging its use. If such a device worked, it would be another reason for allowing this appeal. It may be that the point can be answered by the letter being treated as an act calling the right into question under section 31(2). However, to treat such a private declaration as having that effect seems to me to fly in the face of the natural meaning of the expression "brought into question". </p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other issues: the meaning of "during", and manifesting the intention</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is whether the phrase "during that period" in the proviso to section 31(1) means "during the whole of that period", as the appellants argued, or "at some point during that period", as was contended by the respondents. As a matter of ordinary language, it is clear that the phrase could easily bear either meaning. In the present context, it appears to me clear that it has the latter meaning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the former interpretation would lead to wholly unrealistic results. It would mean that signs referred to in section 31(3) (combined, where appropriate, with the documents referred to in section 31(5)), and the documents referred to in section 31(6), would be ineffective unless they were in place for the whole of the twenty year period. Mr Laurence was forced to concede that it would therefore be necessary to imply some sort of period of grace, based on reasonableness, but that is not warranted by the wording of the section, and it would be a recipe for uncertainty and dispute.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89.&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it is clear that an interruption of the user at some point during the relevant twenty year period, such as the landowner locking a gate and preventing access, will defeat an argument based on user "as of right" under section 31(1) during that period. Traditionally, one day a year is the norm - see for instance <i>Merstham Manor Ltd v Coulsdon and Purley UDC </i>[1937] 2 KB 77 at 85. However, it may depend on the facts of the particular case whether this is enough to amount to a sufficient interruption; that was the view taken by the Court of Appeal in <i>Lewis v Thomas </i>[1950] KB 438. Whatever the position, it is clear that, to be effective, the interruption need not last long in the context of twenty years in order to defeat user as of right. It would be inconsistent if the sign contemplated by section 31(3), or any other action or communication invoked as evidence of lack of intention, had to be in place for the whole of the twenty years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the occasion to discuss how long a sign would have to be present, or when the documents referred to in sections 31(5) and (6) would have to be lodged, during the twenty years relied on in any particular case. It is conceivable that one day in twenty years would be enough in a particular case, and it even may be the case, I suppose, that it would be enough as a matter of principle, but it may well be that what constitutes a sufficient period will depend on the facts of the particular case - see the discussion in <i>Lewis</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is fair to add that this conclusion can, at any rate at first sight, be said to sit a little uneasily with the procedures set out in sections 31(5) and (6). They appear to contain somewhat elaborate requirements if all that is needed is, for instance, the erection of a notice for a relatively short period under section 31(3). The answer, I think, is this. A landowner who wishes to protect his position over many decades may be concerned that he or his successors will forget to keep checking that a section 31(3) notice remains intact, and that, following a defacing of a notice, he may let twenty years uninterrupted use occur. Such a landowner may be glad to be able to protect his position by taking advantage of section 31(5). As to section 31(6), it appears to be aimed primarily at large estates, and enables a landowner to protect himself, <i>inter alia</i>, in relation to potential rights of way which he may not even know are in the process of being acquired under section 31(1).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there is the appellants' argument that the only means by which a landowner can bring himself within the proviso are those contained in section 31(3) to (6). That is simply not what section 31 provides as a matter of language, it is inconsistent with the words "or otherwise" in section 31(2), and it does not seem to me to lead to a sensible result. I can see no reason why a landowner who has made his objections sufficiently clear orally to those using the way should be debarred from contending that he has thereby sufficiently manifested his lack of intention to dedicate to bring himself within the proviso. Again, this is not the occasion to consider how often or to how many people or with what words the objection would have to be made to bring the case within the proviso.</p>
