<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of his submissions Mr Hodge repeatedly emphasised the central rôle of the register and the consequent need to maintain the rule that a prospective purchaser or heritable creditor is entitled to rely on the title as revealed in the deeds on the register.  Hence he is not to be affected by personal rights that are not recorded there.  As my noble and learned friend, Lord Hoffmann, observed during the hearing, however, it was not always clear exactly how these somewhat general submissions applied to the circumstances of this case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing in the pleadings to suggest that Mrs Burnett's personal creditors ever had regard to her title to the flat when initially deciding to contract with her.  Of course, at the time of Mrs Burnett's sequestration the register would have shown her as being infeft as owner of the flat but would not have revealed that she had sold it to the Graingers.  But, when he recorded the notice of title, the respondent was not relying on the register for his information:  from other sources he already knew that she had sold the flat and delivered the disposition to the Graingers.  In this respect his situation was by no means unique:  from time to time purchasers will be aware of such a previous transaction and disposition by the seller.  If so, they are not entitled to ignore that information on the ground that the disposition is not recorded in the register.  If, knowing of the previous transaction and disposition, they record their disposition, they are not in good faith and will not obtain a valid title - the offside goals rule applies.  Here, by contrast, the respondent says that, being aware of the Graingers' rights under their disposition, he could legitimately ignore them and obtain the real right to the flat as an asset for Mrs Burnett's creditors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81.&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows that, in a case like the present, the fact that the disposition is not recorded in the register had no bearing on the creditors' initial decision to contract with Mrs Burnett.  Nor did it mislead the trustee.  For him the critical question is simply whether, by granting the disposition, Mrs Burnett has prevented him from ultimately acquiring the real right to the flat.  For, if granting the disposition were to have that effect, then any notice of title recorded by the trustee would mislead <i>purchasers from the trustee</i> into believing that they could acquire a valid title from him when in fact they could not.  The reliability of the register would thus be compromised.  It was, partly at least, in order to preserve the integrity of the register from that kind of threat that, in the great case of <i>Bell v Gartshore</i> (1737) M 2848;  2 Ross's LC 410, the Court of Session adopted the principle that unrecorded personal deeds, such as a disposition, could not affect feudal rights.  In two further important cases, <i>Douglas v Adjudging Creditors of Kelhead</i> (1765) 3 Ross's LC 169;  sub nom <i>Douglas v Stewarts </i>M 15616 and <i>Mitchells v Ferguson</i> (1781) M 10296;  Hailes 879;  3 Ross's LC 120 the court went on to hold that this principle applied even in cases, like the present, where the creditors had not relied on the register when contracting with the debtor.  I examine these cases in detail below.  Though important, the principle is not, of course, sacrosanct.  Deriving, as it does from legislation rather than from the common law, it is subject to any qualifications in the relevant legislation, such as the provision on trusts in section 33(1) of the 1985 Act and the provisions on floating charges in the Companies Act 1985.</p>
<i>Sharp v Thomson
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82.&nbsp;&nbsp;The disputed interpretation of section 31(1) of the 1985 Act therefore brings up certain more fundamental issues of Scottish property and bankruptcy law.  Like his predecessor in <i>Sharp v Thomson</i>, however, counsel for the appellants was at pains to stress that he did not question these more basic aspects of the law:  they stood inviolate, but were of no relevance if, on the proper interpretation of section 31(1), the flat was not part of Mrs Burnett's estate and so did not vest in the respondent.</p>
<i>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Sharp v Thomson</i> concerned a floating charge which a company had granted over the whole of its property which might from time to time be "comprised in our property and undertaking".  The terms of the charge echoed the terms of section 462(1) of the Companies Act 1985 which allows a company to create a charge "over all or any part of the property … which may from time to time be comprised in its property and undertaking."  The company had sold a flat, which was part of its property, and had delivered the relevant disposition to the purchaser.  Before the purchaser's agents recorded the disposition, however, the floating charge crystallised.  The question was whether, at the time of crystallisation, the company's rights to the flat still formed part of "our property and undertaking" in terms of the charge and, by implication, in terms of section 462(1).  The Court of Session held that the rights were caught by the floating charge, but your Lordships' House allowed the purchasers' appeal on the basis that the term "property" in section 462(1) was not being used in any technical sense and was not intended to include the company's bare title to the flat which the purchasers could have defeated at any moment by recording their disposition.  Lord Jauncey and Lord Clyde gave the only two full speeches, with which the other members of the House agreed.  It is possible to detect differences between the two speeches, as Lord Hamilton demonstrated in his careful analysis in this case in the court below:  2002 SLT 699, 708K - 709E, para 8.  As he also pointed out, however, at p 708J, for the House the essential question in <i>Sharp v Thomson</i> concerned the construction of the words "property and undertaking" in the instrument of charge and, by implication, in section 462(1).  See, for instance, Lord Clyde's identification of the issue, 1997 SC (HL) 66, 79H, and his emphasis, at p 82A - D, on the need to construe the term "property" as part of the phrase "property and undertaking".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84.&nbsp;&nbsp;In these circumstances I respectfully agree with the Extra Division that <i>Sharp v Thomson </i>is distinguishable from the present case.  In itself that does not mean, of course, that the approach to interpretation which was identified in that case should not be applied here.  Admittedly, the two expressions in question are rather different:  "property and undertaking" in <i>Sharp</i>, "the whole estate" in the present case.  But, again, that difference would not of itself be enough to show that the approach adopted in <i>Sharp</i> should not be applied, with suitable modifications, in this case.  Indeed Lord Jauncey appears to have assumed that a permanent trustee in bankruptcy could not obtain a real right by recording a notice of title before the uninfeft proprietors recorded their disposition:  1997 SC (HL) 66, 77F - G.  The cases differ fundamentally, however, in another respect.  The words which the House had to interpret in <i>Sharp </i>were relatively new, having first entered Scots law in the Floating Charges and Receivers (Scotland) Act 1961.  Since there was little prior authority to indicate how they should be interpreted in the circumstances of that case, the House was relatively free to adopt its own interpretation.  Here, by contrast, the provision that the House has to interpret is only the latest embodiment of a measure with a history stretching back for 200 years or more.  Moreover, the very wording of section 31(1), which speaks of adjudication in implement of sale and adjudication for payment and in security of debt, imports by reference a body of law regulating these matters.  In this case it is therefore simply not possible to interpret and apply the relevant words without regard to a considerable body of authority which underlies and surrounds the bankruptcy legislation.</p>
<i><p>Mrs Burnett not a trustee for the appellants</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85.&nbsp;&nbsp;As Lord Clyde noted in <i>Sharp v Thomson</i> 1997 SC (HL) 66, 83E - F, the focus is not so much on the position of the purchasers as on the position of the debtor who has granted the disposition and, hence, of the permanent trustee in whom her estate has vested.  It is worth emphasising, therefore, that Mr Gale did not submit that prior to her sequestration Mrs Burnett had held the title to the flat in trust for the appellants.  It respectfully appears to me, despite the observations of my noble and learned friend, Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough, that he was right to do so, for the reasons explained by my noble and learned friend, Lord Hope of Craighead.  Modern Scots law does indeed recognise that a person can make himself a trustee of his own property for trust purposes.  But, as Lord Reid held in <i>Allan's Trs v Lord Advocate </i>1971 SC (HL) 45, 54, the truster must have an intention to make himself trustee of his own property and must also do something equivalent to delivery or transfer of the trust fund.  In the present case there is no declaration of trust or anything else to suggest that Mrs Burnett ever intended to make herself trustee of her property in the flat for the benefit of the appellants.  So no question of trust arises.  This case is accordingly distinguishable from <i>Heritable Reversionary Company Ltd v Millar</i> (1892) 19 R (HL) 43.  There the House held that, where the bankrupt had been the trustee of property, the bare legal title to that property did not form part of "the whole property of the debtor" and so did not vest in the permanent trustee in bankruptcy under section 102 of the Bankruptcy (Scotland) Act 1856.  Here, by contrast, the appellants' case is not that Mrs Burnett was actually a trustee and had the bare title of a trustee but that, having delivered the disposition, she had only a bare title which no more formed part of her "estate" for the purposes of section 31(1) of the 1985 Act than the bankrupt trustee's bare title in the <i>Heritable Reversionary Company </i>case formed part of his "property" for the purposes of section 102 of the 1856 Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86.&nbsp;&nbsp;The tenure of moveable property in Scotland is, and always has been, allodial.  Craig, <i>Jus Feudale </i>1.9.25, says that all moveables are allodial and we have full ownership in them and can use or abuse them as we wish:  <i>mobilia autem omnia allodialia sunt, in quibus dominium plenum habemus, ut iis uti, vel abuti, pro arbitrio nostro possimus</i>.  By contrast, with certain exceptions, the tenure of land in Scotland is feudal.  This remains the position until 28 November 2004 when the feudal system is due to be abolished by section 1 of the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc (Scotland) Act 2000.  While the rights of the feudal superior are still important in controlling certain uses that the vassal can make of his property, in other respects they have for the most part dwindled in significance.  Moreover, the radical reforms that were progressively introduced between 1845 and 1874 swept away most of the technicalities of feudal conveyancing.  To lawyers of today a discussion of those technicalities may seem even more sensational than a chapter on the fall of the rupee in a political economy textbook.  Since, however, the law of bankruptcy in Scotland developed at a time when they still had to be observed, the underlying principles must be recovered by penetrating the technicalities that encrust them.</p>
<i><p>Real, personal and feudal rights</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87.&nbsp;&nbsp;Drawing on Roman law, Scots law distinguishes between real rights, rights <i>in rem</i>, and personal rights, rights <i>in personam</i>.  In <i>Sharp v Thomson</i> 1995 SC 455, 461G - 475E Lord President Hope went into the Scottish authorities in detail.  Since his analysis has not been challenged, I can deal quite briefly with the point.  The distinction between the two kinds of rights has never been explained more clearly or concisely than in B Nicholas, <i>An Introduction to Roman Law</i> (1962), p 100:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Any claim is either <i>in rem</i> or <i>in personam</i>, and there is an unbridgeable division between them.  An action <i>in rem</i> asserts a relationship between a person and a thing, an action <i>in personam</i> a relationship between persons….  The Romans think in terms of actions not of rights, but in substance one action asserts a right over a thing, the other a right against a person, and hence comes the modern dichotomy between rights <i>in rem</i> and rights <i>in personam</i>.  Obviously there cannot be a dispute between a person and a thing, and therefore even in an action <i>in rem</i> there must be a defendant, but he is there not because he is alleged to be under any duty to the plaintiff but because by some act he is denying the alleged right of the plaintiff.  In a <i>rei vindicatio</i> he is denying the plaintiff's ownership by being in possession of the thing claimed."<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>As is apparent from the summary of counsel's submissions, this unbridgeable division between real and personal rights is central to the respondent's case.  He claims that, since Mrs Burnett retained the real right of ownership in the flat, under section 31(1) of the 1985 Act her right was disponed to him as trustee, unqualified by any rights of the appellants against Mrs Burnett which were purely personal, existed solely between them and were of no concern to him.  By recording the notice of title, the respondent says, he acquired the real right of property in the flat that the appellants are denying - originally, by possessing the flat.  He therefore asks the court to pronounce a declarator of that right.<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88.&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is often made that in Scots law the real right of ownership in things is transferred by giving possession and not by mere agreement: <i> traditionibus non nudis pactis rerum dominia transferuntur</i>.  While that rule does not apply to the economically most significant transactions in moveable property, sales under the Sale of Goods Act 1979, it does apply to the passing of title in corporeal moveables in other circumstances.  In the case of land, however, the position is more complicated.  If I grant you a disposition of a piece of land that I own, or you acquire the land under a court order having the effect of a disposition, and then you enter into possession, you do not acquire a real right of ownership in the land.  This is because the feudal estate in the land is not transferred merely by giving you possession.  The feudal estate is transferred only by the disponee becoming invested or infeft in it.  At common law this required the purchaser to be given sasine, viz feudal possession, in a special symbolic ceremony performed on the land on behalf either of the feudal superior or of the disponer - depending on whether the chosen method was resignation <i>in favorem</i> and regrant or base infeftment followed by a charter of confirmation.  Hence the brocard quoted by Stair, <i>Institutions of the Law of Scotland </i> 2.4.18:  <i>nulla sasina, nulla terra</i>, no sasine, no land.  In the case of land the rule is:  the real right of ownership in lands is transferred by the giving of sasine not by mere agreement.  That remains the theoretical position.  Nowadays it would, however, be more realistic to say that ownership in lands is transferred by recording the disposition, not by mere agreement.</p>
<i><p>Registration</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89.&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided that there was a disposition of the lands from the true infeft proprietor and sasine was given and duly witnessed, at common law nothing more was required for the disponee to acquire a real right in the lands.  This created opportunities for fraud since the owner might sell the lands and grant sasine to more than one person, there being no effective way for the victims to discover the existence of any other grant.  After a number of unsuccessful attempts, the Registration Act 1617 ("the 1617 Act") laid the foundations of the system of registration of deeds which has existed ever since and which has proved largely effective in preventing such frauds.  It provided that all instruments of sasine should be registered within sixty days of their date, failing which, they should</p>
<p></p><ul>"make no faith in judgment by way of action or exception in prejudice of a third party who hath acquired a perfect and lawful right to the said lands and heritages;  but prejudice always to them to use the said writs against the partie maker thereof, his heirs and successors."<p></p></ul>
<p>The effect of this Act and of the later Act 1696 c 18 was to make it compulsory for disponees to register the relevant instrument of sasine within 60 days.  In other words, even though all the necessary elaborate requirements of the common law had been completed, the disponee would not be able to rely on his instrument of sasine against a third party "who hath acquired a perfect and lawful right" to the land unless he had registered the instrument of sasine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the requirement for registration had been introduced, various problems emerged.  One was how to determine the priority of infeftments on which sasines were taken and duly registered.  The Real Rights Act 1693 gave the answer:</p>
<p></p><ul>"That All Infeftments whether of property or annual-rent or other Reall Rights whereupon Sasines for hereafter shall be taken shall in all Competitions be preferable and preferred according to the date and priority of the Registrations of the Sasines without respect of the distinction of Base and publick Infeftments or of being clad with possession or not clad with possession in all time coming."<p></p></ul>
<p>This statute remains in force today and is central to the case for the respondent.  He says that, by recording his notice of title in the register, he took sasine on his infeftment of the property in the flat and this infeftment is to be preferred to the infeftment of the appellants who did not record their disposition in the register until some weeks later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91.&nbsp;&nbsp;The obligation to record the instrument of sasine in the register within sixty days remained in force until section 3 of the Infeftment Act 1845 provided that the instrument could be competently recorded at any time during the lifetime of the party in whose favour it had been expede.  One might have thought that, with the removal of the time-limit, the incentive to register the instrument of sasine would have vanished and the problems which had prompted the 1617 Act would have re-emerged.  This did not happen, however, because the removal of the time-limit was only part of a much larger package of reforms that did away with the need actually to go to the lands and perform the sasine ceremony.  It was enough to record an instrument of sasine, saying that sasine had been given in the lands.  Not surprisingly, this new method of taking sasine proved popular because it saved a lot of time and trouble.  But it worked only if the instrument of sasine was actually recorded.  So convenience became the compulsitor for registration.  Some years later, under sections 1 and 2 of the Titles to Land Act (Scotland) 1858, now sections 15 and 16 of the Titles to Land Consolidation (Scotland) Act 1868, the same effect could be achieved by recording the disposition or a notarial instrument, without any need to expede and record an instrument of sasine.  So in most cases recording the conveyance became the equivalent of taking infeftment by receiving sasine.  Finally, under section 4(2) of the Conveyancing (Scotland) Act 1874, infeftment by registration came to imply entry with the nearest feudal superior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1874, therefore, registration has been the means by which the disponee has become infeft and has been entered with the feudal superior.  In other words, it is the means by which the disponee obtains a real right or feudal right in the subjects - and he does so without the need for any further involvement on the part of the disponer.  Under the modern system, once the disponer has delivered the disposition, his work is done:  he need do no more than refrain from interfering.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93.&nbsp;&nbsp;Feudal investiture is necessary not only for the creation of a real right of ownership in land, but also for the creation of certain lesser real rights.  In particular, subject to an exception that is no longer relevant, if a creditor adjudges land in security of his debt, then, to complete a real right that will be effective against other adjudgers or voluntary disponees, such as purchasers, he must become infeft - formerly by going through much the same procedures as were used for transferring ownership and recording the instrument of sasine in the register, nowadays by recording the decree of adjudication:  section 62 of the Titles to Land (Consolidation)(Scotland) Act 1868, as substituted by section 62 of the Conveyancing (Scotland) Act 1874.  Recording is what makes an adjudication "effectual" for the purposes of the Diligence Act 1661 and the Adjudication Act 1672.  Moreover, under the Real Rights Act 1693 in any competition the date of registration of the decree determines priority.</p>
<i><p>Failure to register</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since registration is now the means of taking sasine, it follows that any disponee who fails to record the disposition has not taken sasine and is not infeft.  His position is therefore distinguishable from that of a purchaser before 1845 who had taken sasine, but who had failed to record the instrument of sasine within the sixty days prescribed by the 1617 Act.  The relevant wording of the Act was extremely obscure and so, for more than two hundred years, the effect of a failure to register the instrument of sasine remained doubtful.  In <i>Young v Leith</i> (1844) 6 D 370;  (1847) 9 D 932;  (1848) 2 Ross's LC 81, however, it was finally settled that unrecorded instruments of sasine were nullities, but the granter of the sasine was not entitled to plead the nullity.  Lord Campbell concluded his speech in your Lordships' House with this flourish, 2 Ross's LC 81, 108:</p>
<p></p><ul>"... I am very glad that the result is such as my noble friend proposes, and that now, on the authority of this House, it will be clearly taken as the law of Scotland, that unrecorded sasines are a nullity."<p></p></ul>
<p>Mr Hodge placed considerable emphasis on Lord Campbell's words as demonstrating the central rôle which recording deeds in the register plays in Scots law.  In my respectful opinion, however, this statement is of no conceivable relevance in the law of today and reference to it can only serve to introduce confusion.  Under the modern law there are, for all practical purposes, no separate grants of sasine and so the problem of the status of an unrecorded sasine, which Lord Campbell was so happy to see resolved, no longer exists.  Today infeftment is taken - and is only taken - by the very act of recording the disposition or notice of title, which is regarded as the equivalent of taking sasine.  The appellants' problem is simply that they did not record the disposition, and so are not to be regarded as having taken sasine, until after the respondent had recorded his notice of title.  The true issue today is what effect, if any, is to be given to rights, such as those of uninfeft proprietors, which do not appear on the register.</p>
<i><p>The position of the uninfeft proprietor</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time when Mrs Burnett was sequestrated, the appellants were disponees to whom the disponer had delivered the disposition but who had not yet recorded it in the register and were accordingly not yet infeft.  Even if only for a short period, this is a stage through which all purchasers of land must pass and so the nature of their rights is of some importance.  Sometimes, as in section 31(3) of the 1985 Act, such a person is simply said to hold an "uncompleted title" to the land;  or, more fully, he may be described as a person having an interest in land "but whose title thereto has not been completed by recording":  section 12(1) of the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform Act 1970.  Writers may try to capture the nature of his position by saying that he holds a "personal title" (eg Craigie, <i>Scottish Law of Conveyancing:  Heritable Rights</i> (3rd edition, 1899), p 434), while it has long been common practice to describe him as "proprietor", as opposed to "heritable proprietor", of the lands:  eg Erskine, <i>Institute of the Law of Scotland</i> 2.6.51;  Craigie, <i>Heritable Rights</i>, p 436, dealing with the drafting of deeds.  In <i>M'Adam v M'Adam </i>(1879) 6 R 1256, 1258 Lord President Inglis referred to "the owner of a personal right to land".  The fluctuations in terminology are suggestive of a certain instability in the thinking about the uninfeft proprietor's position.  In recent years the question has prompted both academic and judicial analysis.  The opinions of the judges of the First Division in <i>Sharp v Thomson </i>1995 SC 455 discuss the matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than go over the same ground, I draw particular attention to certain observations of the Whole Court in <i>Earl of Fife v Duff</i> (1862) 24 D 936 on the "personal fee", as they call it, of the uninfeft proprietor. Although in <i>Sharp v Thomson </i>1997 SC (HL) 66, 70, 84, both Lord Jauncey and Lord Clyde alluded to these observations in passing, for some reason they have tended to be given less prominence than might have been expected in discussions of the topic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Fife and his trustees sought a declarator that they had power to sell certain lands and to receive the price and use it at their pleasure.  The defenders included the heirs called to the succession by various deeds.  Some of the heirs contended that the lands in question were subject to an entail and so could not be sold.  The First Division rejected the contentions for the Earl and his trustees and assoilzied the defenders:  <i>Earl of Fife v Duff</i> (1861) 23 D 657.  The pursuers appealed to this House which instructed that the case should be argued before the whole judges and that their opinions should be reported to the House.  This was done and a single opinion was returned by the Whole Court with the exception of Lord Mackenzie, who was absent due to illness: <i> Earl of Fife v Duff</i> (1862) 24 D 936.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98.&nbsp;&nbsp;The opinion of the Whole Court began by setting out the well-established rules relating to the transmission of the ownership of feudal subjects.  They explained that voluntary transmission of such subjects was effected by a dispositive act followed by tradition of the subject to the transferee.  To explain the nature of the dispositive act, they cited Stair, <i>Institutions of the Law of Scotland</i> 3.2.3, including his comment - apparently directed at the natural law position - that the words of conveyance "express something presently done, and not engaged to be done;  and so can be nothing else but the alienation or transmission of the right itself."  Their Lordships observed, at p 941:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Thus the legal effect of such a disposition, even before it is followed by tradition of the subject disponed, is twofold.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>In the first place, it operates as an actual alienation of the subject to the disponee;  and it vests in him most of the essential attributes of ownership. In particular it vests in him not only a right to possess the subject and to reap its fruits but also a power to sell it;  to dispone it for either onerous or gratuitous causes;  and to settle the estate by mortis causa dispositions and deeds of entail.  The right so created is transmissible from one person to another by voluntary disposition;  and on the death of any person, in whom it is vested, it is transmissible to his heir by general service;  and each person in whom it is vested successively has the powers and privileges of ownership above mentioned.  This right is usually called a personal fee - a denomination importing not that the subject of it is moveable, for it is truly heritable, but that it is not feudal, and indicating at the same time that, even while not followed by solemn tradition or infeftment, the right is still sua natura a right of fee.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Secondly, such dispositive act, although it operates as a <i>de praesenti</i> alienation, and not merely as an obligation to alienate, does farther by implication impose upon the disponer an obligation of a different kind - viz a consequent obligation (as Lord Stair calls it) - as to delivery or tradition of the subject disponed."<p></p></ul>
<p>Having described in some detail the two modes of feudal "tradition" by which the disponer could perform his obligation as to the delivery or tradition of the land, the court continued, at p 942:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Although the personal fee, thus vested in a disponee before he is infeft, confers upon him such powers and privileges of ownership, it is, while in that state, attended with some risks and disadvantages.  One of them is, that the owner is not the entered vassal of the feudal superior.  Another is, that as his right is not clothed with infeftment, and published in the Register of Sasines, it is of no effect against third parties who may attach the estate by legal execution for the debts of the disponer, or who may in bona fide purchase it from him, and be first infeft.  And still another disadvantage (which may often be of moment in cases relating to the titles of entailed estates) is, that when the disposition is granted under conditions intended to burden or restrict the disponee's right in favour of third parties, as creditors, or as heirs of entail, these conditions cannot be rendered real burdens upon the estate without being embodied in the infeftment of the disponee.  But a personal fee, while in these and some other respects is not equivalent to a fully feudalised fee, still leaves the person to whom it belongs vested with the important powers and privileges of ownership formerly mentioned, and with a right, in addition, to call upon the disponer, or his heir, to grant a proper warrant for clothing the personal fee with feudal tradition."<p></p></ul>
