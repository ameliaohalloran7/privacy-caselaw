<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 6(2) mitigates the effect of section 6(1).  Subsection (1) says that it is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right.  But subsection (2) disapplies subsection (1) in respect of any case which falls within paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of subsection (2) ie if the case falls within paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) it is not unlawful for the Secretary of State to act in a way incompatible with a Convention right. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92.&nbsp;&nbsp;As my noble and learned friends have pointed out, subsection (2) is intended to preserve the supremacy of Parliament.  A sovereign Parliament has power to legislate in a manner incompatible with Convention rights if it chooses to do so.  If Parliament does do so, the legislation is effective and must take effect accordingly.  There are not, under English domestic law, any fundamental constitutional rights that are immune from legislative change.  So paragraph (a) says that if as a result of a provision of primary legislation the Secretary of State could not have acted differently, it is not unlawful for him to act in a way incompatible with a Convention right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93.&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows, in my opinion, from paragraph (a) that the act of the Secretary of State in authorising payment of the section 36, section 37 and section 38 statutory benefits to widows who satisfy the requisite statutory conditions and in refusing to authorise payment of those benefits to widowers, or for that matter to widows who do not satisfy the statutory conditions, cannot be categorised as a section 6(1) unlawful act.  The act is discriminatory but it is not unlawful.  The widowers, and the widows who do not satisfy the statutory conditions, are not entitled to the statutory benefits.  So the Secretary of State cannot authorise the payment to them of the statutory benefits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94.&nbsp;&nbsp;For my part I regard the conclusion expressed in the previous paragraph as determinative of these appeals.  But reliance is placed by the widowers not on the failure of the Secretary of State to authorise payment to them of the statutory benefits - they recognise that they cannot bring themselves within the statutory language - but on his failure to exercise his common law power to make them extra-statutory payments corresponding in amount to the statutory benefits.  My noble and learned friends Lord Hoffmann and Lord Hope of Craighead have expressed the conclusion that this way of putting the widowers' case is met by paragraph (b) of subsection (2) - the Secretary of State, in declining to exercise his extra-statutory common law power, "was acting so as to give effect to or enforce" the relevant provisions of the 1992 Act.  My noble and learned friend Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood, however, has expressed some doubts about the applicability of section 6(2)(b) to an exercise by the Secretary of State of his common law<i> </i>power (see paras 112 and 113 of Lord Brown's opinion).  But, nonetheless, my noble and learned friend rejects the widowers' reliance on the common law power.  He does so on the ground that an exercise of the common law power so as to subvert the intentions of Parliament as expressed in the 1992 Act would be an abuse of that power (see paras 119 and 120) and expresses a preference for paragraph (a) rather than paragraph (b) as the torpedo that sinks the widowers' reliance on the Secretary of State's refusal to exercise the common law power.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95.&nbsp;&nbsp;I, too, if forced to a choice, would prefer the paragraph (a) to the paragraph (b) route; but I regard the difference between them, when applied to a case such as the present, as immaterial.  Whether one is looking at paragraph (a) or paragraph (b), it is the provisions of sections 36, 37 and 38 of the 1992 Act that make it inappropriate for the Secretary of State to create, via his common law power, a scheme entitling widowers to the same benefits as those which the parliamentary enactment has confined to widows and withheld from them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96.&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, however, I would reject the widowers' claims for a reason that has nothing to do with section 6(2).  The widowers' claims are article 14 discrimination claims.  They cannot claim to be entitled to statutory benefits.  The statutory language bars them.  So they claim that the Secretary of State should have exercised his common law power in their favour.  But where is the discrimination?  Leaving aside for the moment the payments made to the Strasbourg claimants, to which I must return, what discrimination has the Secretary of State perpetrated in failing to make extra-statutory payments to these widowers?  Who are the comparators?  The widows are not apt comparators for they are the statutory beneficiaries under a statutory scheme that does not include widowers (section 6(2)(a)).  The fact of the matter is that, bar the Strasbourg claimants, the Secretary of State has not made comparable extra-statutory payments to anyone.  His failure to make extra-statutory payment to these widowers cannot, therefore, be categorised as discriminatory.  It is, of course, true that he has declined to exercise a power available to him to place the widowers in possession of sums of money comparable to the statutory benefits of widows.  But I would, for my part, reject the proposition that a failure to make an extra-statutory payment to match the benefits to which widows are entitled under a discriminatory statutory scheme is itself an act of discrimination.  If that were not so it would be an act of discrimination to decline to make extra-statutory payments to widows who had not claimed in time, or to widows whose husbands had not paid the requisite contributions.  The widowers' concentration on the common law power that enables the Secretary of State to make extra-statutory payments to all sorts of people in all sorts of circumstances must not be allowed to divert attention from the only discriminatory feature in this case, namely, the statutory scheme itself.  I would reject the widowers' claims on the ground that the Secretary of State's failure to make the extra-statutory payments was not discriminatory as between widows and widowers.  The widows, as statutory beneficiaries under the statutory scheme, were not apt comparators.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally I come to the widowers' argument based on the extra-statutory ex-gratia payments made to the Strasbourg claimants.  The Secretary of State's refusal to make comparable payments to widowers who had not instituted proceedings in Strasbourg was, I would accept, discriminatory as between them and the Strasbourg claimants.  But the refusal cannot, in my opinion, be categorised as an "unlawful act" for section 6(1) purposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, whatever may be the justification for regarding the discrimination under the 1992 Act in favour of widows and against widowers as discrimination falling within the ambit of either or both of article 8 or article 1 of Protocol No.1, I can see no possible justification for regarding the discrimination in favour of Strasbourg claimants and against widowers who had not instituted proceedings in Strasbourg as within the ambit of either article.  Article 14, I repeat, is not a free-standing prohibition against discrimination.  Second, I would regard the desirability of settling the claims instituted before the Strasbourg court as constituting an eminently reasonable objective justification for the payments to those claimants.  For both reasons I would reject the widowers' reliance on the payments made to the Strasbourg claimants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reasons I have given I would allow the Secretary of State's appeals and dismiss the widowers' appeals.  On all points I have not expressly mentioned I am in full agreement with the opinions expressed by my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann.</p>
<p><b>LORD BROWN OF EATON-UNDER-HEYWOOD</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the advantage of reading in draft the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann and (subject to this opinion) for the reasons he has given I too would allow the Secretary of State's appeals and dismiss the widowers' cross appeals.  Since, however, I have found some considerable difficulty with regard to the application here of section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 ("the 1998 Act") I prefer to express my conclusion on this issue in my own words.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most materially section 6 provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right.  <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection (1) does not apply to an act if—<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;as the result of one or more provisions of primary legislation, the authority could not have acted differently; or<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;in the case of one or more provisions of, or made under, primary legislation which cannot be read or given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights, the authority was acting so as to give effect to or enforce those provisions."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102.&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to the Secretary of State's argument based on <i>Walden v Liechtenstein</i>  (Application No 33916/96) (16 March 2000) (which fails for the reasons given in paras 60-63 of Lord Hoffmann's speech), it is common ground, first, that the payment to widows but not to equivalent widowers, during the relevant period, of a widow's payment and widowed mothers' allowance pursuant respectively to sections 36 and 37 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 was incompatible with the widowers' Convention right under article 14 read with article 8 (and/or with article 1 of Protocol 1); and, secondly, that, by virtue of section 6 (1) of the 1998 Act, this would be unlawful under domestic law unless section 6 (1) is disapplied here by section 6 (2).  The critical question arising with regard to these two benefits, therefore, is whether the Secretary of State can rely on section 6 (2).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103.&nbsp;&nbsp;If and insofar as the widowers' complaint relates to the payment of the benefits to widows, clearly the Secretary of State can rely on section 6 (2) (a): he had no option but to make these payments: sections 36 and 37 required it.  To meet that difficulty the widowers, therefore, complain, not of the payment to the widows, but rather of the non-payment of equivalent benefits to themselves.  The first question which a complaint in this form raises is whether the Secretary of State could have acted differently in this regard: could he, had he wished, have made matching payments to widowers?  He contends that he could and let it be assumed for present purposes that he is right, at any rate to this extent: that the Crown has a general common law power to make extra-statutory payments whenever it thinks it right to do so—as, for example, when the Criminal Injuries Compensation scheme was first set up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104.&nbsp;&nbsp;The bulk of the argument, therefore, has focused on section 6 (2) (b) and it is this provision which to my mind gives rise to particular difficulty in a case like this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105.&nbsp;&nbsp;The essential role of section 6 (2) in the 1998 Act is, of course, clear.  It is, just as section 6 (6) is, a necessary corollary to the cardinal principle enshrined in the Act—exemplified too by sections 3 (2) (b) and (c) and 4 (6) (a)—that of the sovereignty of Parliament.  If the legislation cannot, despite the Court's best efforts pursuant to section 3 (1), "be read and given effect in a [Convention compatible] way," and if the authority "could not have acted differently" (section 6 (2) (a)) and/or "was acting so as to give effect to or enforce" legislative provisions "which cannot be read or given effect in a [Convention compatible] way" (section 6 (2) (b)), then the complainant cannot succeed in his claim: the authority will not have acted unlawfully under domestic law.  The most the complainant can attain is a declaration of incompatibility pursuant to section 4 (2)—the last thing most complainants want since it carries with it no redress (save as to costs) although of course it unlocks the door to a successful application in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106.&nbsp;&nbsp;All this, of course, is clear.  What is altogether less clear is precisely what is meant by an authority "acting so as to give effect to or enforce" incompatible legislative provisions within the meaning of section 6 (2) (b).  It is useful to start with three authoritative illustrations of such instances, the decisions of this House respectively in <i>R (Anderson) v Home Secretary</i> [2002] UKHL 46; [2003] 1 AC 837 ("<i>Anderson")</i>, <i>Aston Cantlow and Wilmcote with Billesley PCC v Wallbank</i> [2004]  1 AC 549 <i>("Aston Cantlow")</i> and <i>R v Kansal (No 2)</i> [2002] 2 AC 69 ("<i>Kansal"</i>)—although none of them, it is worth pointing out at once, were discrimination cases. </p>
<i>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Anderson</i> concerned the Secretary of State's power under section 29 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 to refer the cases of mandatory life prisoners to the Parole Board and, if so recommended by the board, then to release such prisoners on licence.  The claimants sought, not a declaration that section 29 was incompatible with their article 6 rights, but rather a declaration that the Secretary of State must exercise his discretion under the section so as not to exceed the tariff recommended by the judiciary.  They succeeded only in getting a declaration of incompatibility.  As Lord Bingham of Cornhill put it, at para 30:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Since … the section leaves it to the Home Secretary to decide whether or when to refer a case to the Board and he is free to ignore its recommendation if it is favourable to the prisoner, the decision on how long the convicted murderer should remain in prison for punitive purposes is his alone."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Hutton alone referred specifically to section 6 of the 1998 Act, at para 82:</p>
<p></p><ul>" … [I]n forming his own view whether to accept the recommendation of the judiciary as to tariff or to fix a longer tariff period and when to refer a case to the Parole Board, the Home Secretary is acting in accordance with the intention of Parliament expressed in section 29.  In deciding for himself when to release a prisoner the Home Secretary is, for the purposes of section 6 (2) (b) 'acting so as to give effect to' section 29."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Aston Cantlow</i> concerned the PCC's power under section 2 (2) of the Chancel Repairs Act 1932 to bring proceedings to recover from those liable as lay rectors monies for the repair of the chancel.  The House held that, even assuming the PCC would otherwise have been acting unlawfully under section 6 (1), they would have been protected by section 6 (2) (b).  Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, at para 19, approved what was noted in <i>Grosz, Beatson &amp; Duffy</i>, <i>Human Rights: the 1998 Act and the European Convention</i> (2000), p72: a public authority is not obliged to neutralise primary legislation by treating it as a dead letter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough, at para 93, said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Incontrovertibly the PCC were seeking to give effect to and enforce provisions of [the 1932 Act].  On the above-stated assumption, the PCC's Act in suing the Wallbanks comes squarely within the exception.  Paragraph (b) of the subsection [6 (2)] is to be contrasted with paragraph (a) which is manifestly intended to cover cases where the public authority did not have any alternative but to act as it did (ie it was compelled to do so).  Paragraph (b), on the other hand, covers situations where the public authority was empowered by legislation to act as it did and the intention of the legislation, whilst leaving open a measure of discretion, was that it should use the power provided."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Kansal</i> concerned a prosecutor's power under section 433 of the Insolvency Act 1986 to use evidence obtained by compulsory questioning.  The House rejected the appellant's contention that compatibility with his Convention rights could be, and therefore had to be, achieved by refraining from ever exercising this power.  As Lord Hope of Craighead pointed out, at para 88, in deciding to adduce this evidence the prosecutor was giving effect to the legislation:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Section 433 authorised [the prosecutor] to lead and to rely on that evidence.  He was entitled also to give effect to section 433 by asking the judge to hold that in terms of that section the evidence was admissible."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moses J in the present case, at para 178, described <i>Kansal </i>as "an example of a case where exercise of the power conferred by the statutory provision would inevitably lead to incompatibility with the Convention."  He gave as another example the Divisional Court's decision in <i>R (Alconbury Developments Ltd) v Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport &amp; the Regions</i> [2001]  2 All ER 929  (<i>"Alconbury"</i>) (unaffected in this respect by the House of Lords subsequent decision allowing the Secretary of State's appeal), holding that since every exercise of the Secretary of State's power to call in planning applications under section 77 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1999 would inevitably breach article 6 of the Convention, section 6(2) (b) was engaged: "We do not think it is legitimate to read down a legislative provision so as to extinguish it (para 104)."  Moses J contrasted that with Forbes J's decision in <i>R (Friends Provident Life Office) v Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport &amp; the Regions</i> [2001] EWHC Admin 820; [2002] 1 WLR 1450 where, following the House of Lords' ruling in <i>Alconbury</i> that the exercise of the section 77 call in power was not after all incompatible with article 6, it was unsuccessfully argued instead that a <i>refusal</i> to call in a planning application under section 77 would necessarily be incompatible with article 6.  Forbes J concluded that the obligation to call in a planning application to ensure compliance with article 6 would only arise in some cases, for example where there were significant issues of fact to be decided and because, therefore, the discretion remained largely intact, section 6 (2) (b) did not apply.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112.&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the present case, Moses J recognised that it differs from <i>Alconbury</i> and <i>Kansal</i>—cases where compatibility could only be achieved by refraining from any exercise of the power—because here the widowers' contention is that the power (the common law power to make matching payments) <i>must</i> be exercised.  He concluded, however, that the three cases share an important feature, namely that compatibility could only be achieved by converting a power into a duty.  He applied the identical process of reasoning in the parallel case of <i>R (Wilkinson)</i> <i>v Inland Revenue Commissioners</i> [2002] STC 347 where the argument was that the commissioners were bound to exercise their power under section 1 of the Taxes Management Act 1970 to allow widowers an equivalent allowance to the widows bereavement allowance enjoyed by widows under section 262 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.  Having concluded in each case that the effect of the widowers' argument was "to destroy the power altogether", he decided in both that the section 6 (2) (b) defence applied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal disagreed with Moses J about the application of section 6 (2) (b) in both cases.  Their decision on the point in <i>Wilkinson</i> [2003] 1 WLR 2683 was strictly unnecessary since they had already concluded (rightly, as Lord Hoffmann's speech in that case makes clear) that the commissioners did not in fact have the power the widowers contended they had under section 1 of the 1970 Act, so that the section 6 (2) (a) defence applied without complication. It is nevertheless instructive to see what the Court of Appeal said in each case, and most convenient to start with their judgement in <i>Wilkinson</i>:</p>
<p></p><ul>"52&nbsp;&nbsp; … It seems to us that section 6 (2)(b) addresses the grant by Parliament of a statutory power which, regardless of the circumstances in which it is exercised, will inevitably be incompatible with Convention rights.  In such circumstances the power cannot be given effect to in a way which is compatible with the Convention, and thus section 6 (2) (b) enables the exercise of the power without breach of section 6 (1).<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>53.&nbsp;&nbsp;We appreciate the argument that if a failure to exercise a statutory power will inevitably involve a breach of Convention rights, section 6 (2) (b) is engaged, because implicit in the statutory power is the right to refrain from exercising the power.  We make no comment as to whether that argument is sound or unsound.  We simply observe that it has no application to the facts of this case.  Section 1 of the 1970 Act is a wide general power.  In most circumstances exercising that power will involve no incompatibility with the Convention.  Equally, in most circumstances failing to exercise the power will involve no incompatibility with the Convention.  If circumstances arise under which it is necessary to exercise the power in order to avoid a breach of Convention rights, we can see no basis upon which the commissioners can rely upon section 6 (2) (b) to justify a refusal to exercise the power."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114.&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words the Court of Appeal in <i>Wilkinson</i> was saying that the commissioners' section 1 power (just as the Secretary of State's  section 77 call in power in <i>Friends Provident</i>) [2002] 1 WLR 1450 would only sometimes, not invariably, have to be exercised to achieve Convention compatibility and in that situation the section 6 (2) (b) defence does not apply.  True, the (postulated) section 1 power would have had to be exercised in every case where a widower was claiming a matching allowance; but so too the section 77 power would have had to be exercised in every case where a substantial factual issue arose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115.&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn then to the Court of Appeal's reasoning in the present case [2003] 1 WLR 2623:</p>
<p></p><ul>"116 … We shall set out, in stages, the [Secretary of State's] argument as we understand it. (1) Section 6 (2) (b) provides an authority with a defence when a statute <i>requires</i> the authority to Act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right; section 6(2)(b) provides an authority with a defence where a statute confers on an authority <i>a power </i>which, if exercised, will necessarily involve infringement of a Convention right. (2) The 1992 and 1999 Acts, on their true construction, leave unfettered the Secretary of State's common law power to pay benefits to widowers if he chooses so to do.  (3) Each Act might, for the avoidance of doubt, have provided 'this Act is without prejudice to the Secretary of State's common law power to pay benefits to widowers, if he chooses so to do.'  The position would still have been precisely the same as (2).  (4) Each Act might have stated: '(i) The Secretary of State may pay benefits to widowers if he chooses so to do; (ii) The Secretary of State may refrain from making payments to widowers if he chooses so to do.'  The position would still have been precisely the same as in (2) and (3).  (5) Had the Acts expressly authorised the Secretary of State to refrain from paying benefits to widowers, the exercise of that statutory power would necessarily have involved infringing their Convention rights.  In such circumstances section 6(2)(b) would have provided him with a defence.  (6) Parliament cannot have intended that, by leaving implicit what could have been expressed, the Secretary of State's discretion should be fettered by the 1998 Act.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>117. We accept the starting point of this argument.  If a statute confers an express power which can only be exercised in a manner which infringes a Convention right, then Parliament has expressly authorised a breach of the Convention.  Section 6(2)(b) preserves the supremacy of Parliament by permitting an authority to exercise the power granted by Parliament.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>118. The chain of reasoning that follows is, however, fallacious.  If the 1992 and 1999 Acts do not restrict a common law power enjoyed by the Secretary of State to make payments to whomsoever he pleases, it does not follow that Parliament has thereby authorised the Secretary of State to ignore the requirements of the 1998 Act when deciding whether or not to exercise that power.  A duty in certain circumstances to make payments to widowers is in no way incompatible with a general common law power to make payments to anybody.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>119. The 1992 and 1999 Acts expressly require the Secretary of State to pay benefits to widows in accordance with their terms.  If he retains a common law power to make payments to widowers, we cannot see how a decision not to exercise that power can be said to be necessary in order to give effect to the provisions, express or implied, of either Act.  The decision of Moses J on this point was in error."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here too, it appears, although less explicitly than in <i>Wilkinson</i> [2003] 1 WLR 2683 the Court of Appeal were pointing out that the general common law power to make payments to anyone will not, contrary to Moses J's suggestion, be "destroy[ed] altogether" by a conclusion that it <i>must</i> be exercised to make matching payments to widowers.  There will be many other situations in which the power, including in particular the discretion to refuse payment, will be available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117.&nbsp;&nbsp;For my part I find the Court of Appeal's reasoning on this part of the section 6 (2) argument compelling.  Indeed I would go further: I would reject entirely the suggested analogy between cases (like <i>Kansal</i> [2002] 2 AC 69 and <i>Alconbury</i> [2001] 2 All ER 929) where an express statutory power can only ever be exercised in a manner which infringes a Convention right, and cases like the present (and <i>Wilkinson</i>) where it is contended rather that any <i>refusal</i> to exercise the power would infringe a Convention right.  The suggestion is, of course, that by the same token that <i>Kansal</i> and <i>Alconbury</i> decided that the section 6 (2)(b) defence is available if otherwise any exercise of the power would inevitably lead to incompatibility, so too it is available if otherwise any non-exercise of the power would breach the Convention.  Superficially the similarity is clear and the suggested analogy at first blush plausible.  But in my judgment it would be wrong to extend <i>Kansal</i> in this way.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118.&nbsp;&nbsp;Plainly it is not the case that section 6 (2)(b) applies whenever a statutory discretion falls to be exercised in a particular way to ensure compliance with a Convention right.  This occurs in a host of different situations and, so far as I am aware, no one has ever suggested that, had the discretion not been exercised compatibly, the public authority would nevertheless have been protected against a domestic law claim by the section 6 (2)(b) defence on the basis that otherwise a power would be turned into a duty.  So much I take to be clear.  Why, then, should it make all the difference if the statutory discretion is one which, to secure Convention compliance, will have to be exercised in every case and not merely in some cases?  Why should the section 6 (2)(b) defence apply if the discretion would otherwise always have to be exercised in a particular way, but not when this is only sometimes the case?  Still on occasions the power is being treated as a duty.  Why should the issue turn on how narrowly the power is conferred, or whether, perhaps only exceptionally, the power can be exercised compatibly with the Convention—essentially chance matters?</p>
