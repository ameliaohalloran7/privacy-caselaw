<p align="right"><a href="custom-3.htm">(back to preceding text)</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;71.&nbsp;&nbsp;Arguably the last fifteen years have seen some modest progress in the direction recommended by Professor Stapleton.  The increasingly clear recognition that the three-fold test (first stated by Lord Bridge of Harwich in <i>Caparo Industries plc v Dickman</i> [1990]  2 AC 605, 617-618) does not provide an easy answer to all our problems, but only a set of fairly blunt tools, is to my mind progress of a sort.  I respectfully agree with the observation of Kirby J. in <i>Perre v Apand Pty Ltd</i> (1999)  198 CLR 180, 284: </p>
<p></p><ul>"As against the approach which I favour, it has been said that the three identified elements are mere 'labels'.  So indeed they are. . . . Labels are commonly used by lawyers.  They help steer the mind through the task in hand."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(It would be an unnecessary distraction to go into the more recent jurisprudence in the High Court of Australia, noted by Christian Witting, The Three-Stage Test Abandoned in Australiaâ€”or Not? (2002) 118 LQR 214.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72.&nbsp;&nbsp;This House had indeed, in <i>Caparo</i> itself, recognised both that the elements of the three-fold test are labels, and that their usefulness is limited: see the observations of Lord Bridge [1990] 2 AC 605 at p 618 B-D and Lord Roskill at p628 C-E, both quoted in para 6 of the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would add a footnote in relation to the notion of "voluntary assumption of responsibility."  So far as the modern law is concerned, this expression seems to be traceable mainly to the speeches of Lord Reid and Lord Devlin in <i>Hedley Byrne</i> [1964]  AC 465 at p486 ("held to have accepted some responsibility") and p529 ("a voluntary undertaking to assume responsibility").  Earlier in his speech Lord Devlin had referred (at p526) to early authority going back as far as <i>Coggs v Bernard</i> (1703)  2 Ld Raym 909,  the case of the broken cask of brandy, in which the motion in arrest of judgment had relied on the fact (at p 912) that the defendant "is neither laid to be a common porter, nor that he is to have any reward for his labour."  This quotation reflects the fact that there are (at any rate for a lawyer) two threads of meaning in the word "voluntary": without compulsion and without remuneration.  A common carrier would have been under an obligation to undertake the task of moving the brandy cask, and would have been remunerated.  The old cases show liability being imposed <i>despite</i> the defendant's conduct having been (in one or both senses) voluntary.  As the law has developed (and in the field of pure economic loss) liability is imposed <i>because of</i> the voluntary assumption of responsibility.  But in the modern context the word "voluntary" is being used, it seems to me, with the connotation of "conscious", "considered" or "deliberate".  That appears, for instance, in <i>White v Jones</i> [1995] 2 AC 207, both in the speech of Lord Browne-Wilkinson at p274 and in the dissenting speech of Lord Mustill at pp286-287.  That is particularly important in considering whether the defendant has undertaken responsibility for economic loss towards anyone other than the person or persons with whom he is in an obviously proximate relationship.  In such cases the voluntary assumption of responsibility towards others, judged objectively, may provide the necessary proximity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case the appellant bank has not, in any meaningful sense, made a voluntary assumption of responsibility.  It has by the freezing order had responsibility thrust upon it.  But in any case it is not proximity that is the respondents' problem in this case.  The duty of care for which the respondents contended successfully in the Court of Appeal, and which they seek to maintain in this House, is not a duty leading to "liability in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class" (in the very well-known words of Cardozo CJ in <i>Ultramares Corporation v Touche</i> (1931)  174 NE 441, 444). It would be a liability in a known maximum sum (in respect of a precisely identified account), for a brief period, to a single known body corporate.  The respondents' problem is whether it is fair, just and reasonable to impose on a bank a novel and substantial liability (on top of its potential liability for contempt of court) if it carelessly fails to comply with a freezing order.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the point on which I have found this appeal more difficult than the rest of your Lordships.  If this issue affected only banks, I would be slow to conclude that there could never be liability for carelessly failing to comply with a freezing order.  Banks are already subject to strict regulation and potential sanctions in connection with money-laundering and similar activities.  They are enjoined to know their customers.  They become liable for breach of fiduciary duty if they shut their eyes to dishonest dealings by their customers.  VAT (and PAYE) collected on behalf of HM Revenue and Customs by trading companies is not trust money, but banks cannot be unaware that VAT (and PAYE) collected in this way is often not properly accounted for, through fraud or mismanagement.  There is a public interest in banks responding with particular care, promptness and vigilance to any freezing order obtained by HM Revenue and Customs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also rather disinclined to put much weight on the litigation context.  A bank whose customer is a party to litigation may occasionally be joined as a party to the litigation, either for the purposes of a freezing order or in the pursuit of a proprietary remedy.  But that is unusual, and it did not happen in this case.  The bank's duty to its customer was overridden and suspended by the freezing order.  Its position was a neutral position.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Sales, appearing for the Commissioners, realistically acknowledged that if in these circumstances a duty of care is to be imposed on a bank, it must also be imposed on any other person affected by notice of a freezing order.  In many cases that would produce unfair, unjust and unreasonable results.  I too would allow this appeal and make the order which Lord Bingham proposes.</p>
<p><b>LORD MANCE</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78.&nbsp;&nbsp;The short question on this appeal is whether a bank served with notice of a non-proprietary freezing order (in yesterday's terms a <i>Mareva</i> injunction) owes a duty of care to the claimants who obtained the order against defendants in civil proceedings. The bank is Barclays Bank plc, the claimants are the Commissioners of Customs and Excise and the defendants are two companies, Brightstar Systems Limited ("Brightstar") and Doveblue Limited ("Doveblue"), who have allegedly defaulted in payment of large sums of VAT. The order against Brightstar was made on 26 January 2001 in the sum of Â£1,800,000 and notice of it was served on the bank by fax at about 12.33 pm on 29 January 2001. The order against Doveblue was made on 30 January 2001 in the sum of Â£3,928,130 and notice of it was served on the bank by fax at about 11.38 am on that day. The effect of each order was to suspend the bank's mandate in respect of any payment instructions from its customers which would reduce such customers' assets within the jurisdiction to below those sums: cf <i>Z Ltd v A-Z and AA-LL </i>[1982]  QB 558, per Lord Denning MR (at p 574C) and Kerr LJ (at p 586D)<i>.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of each order about two hours after the bank received such notice, the relevant defendant used the bank's Faxpay system to give direct payment instructions to the bank's payment centre, as distinct from the branch where the relevant accounts (No 70845302 in the case of Brightstar and No 10902284 in the case of Doveblue) were held. The instructions were for payments totalling Â£1,240,570 (Brightstar) and Â£1,064,289 (Doveblue). The instructions were on their face in breach of the freezing orders, but the bank in each case met them. For the purposes of the present preliminary issues, it is assumed that the bank failed to act with reasonable competence. The Commissioners, unable to recover the full outstanding VAT in any other way, claim damages from the bank in the sums thus paid out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80.&nbsp;&nbsp;The orders were in standard Commercial Court form. They prohibited the defendant companies from removing, disposing of, dealing with or diminishing the value of any of their assets in England and Wales up to the values frozen and included "the following assets in particular", specifying the above-numbered accounts with the bank. They provided</p>
<p></p><ul>"<i>Variation of [sic] discharge of this Order</i><p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>The Defendant (or anyone notified of this Order) may apply to the Court at any time to vary or discharge this Order (or so much of it as affects that person), but anyone wishing to do so must first inform the Claimants' legal representatives.<p></p></ul>
<i><p></p><ul>Parties other than the Claimants and Defendant<p></p></ul>
<p></p></i><ul><i>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Effect of this Order:-</i><p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>It is a Contempt of Court for any person notified of this Order knowingly to assist in or permit a breach of this Order. Any person doing so may be sent to prison, fined or have his assets seized.<p></p></ul>
<i><p></p><ul>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Set off by Banks:-<p></p></ul>
</i><p></p><ul>This injunction does not prevent any bank from exercising any right of set off it may have in respect of any facility which it gave to the Defendant before it was notified of this Order.<p></p></ul>
<i><p></p><ul>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Withdrawals by the Defendant:-<p></p></ul>
</i><p></p><ul>No bank need enquire as to the application or proposed application of any money withdrawn by the Defendant if the withdrawal appears to be permitted by this Order."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orders further recited that the Judge had "accepted the undertakings set out in Schedule B at the end of this Order", which provided:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Schedule B<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Undertakings given to the Court by the Claimants:-<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>â€¦..<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(7) The Claimants will pay the reasonable costs of anyone other than the Defendant which have been incurred as a result of this Order including the costs of ascertaining whether that person holds any of the Defendant's assets and if the Court later finds that this Order has caused such person loss, and decides that such person should be compensated for that loss, the Claimants will comply with any Order the Court may make."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81.&nbsp;&nbsp;The covering sheets to the faxes notifying of the orders to the bank show that the relevant officer acting for the Commissioners knew and had already spoken to the bank's legal adviser to whom such notices were directed. The first notice relating to Brightstar requested that the attached freezing order be "put into effect with immediate effect", while the second relating to Doveblue said "Many thanks for your assistance in this matter". However, neither in the pleadings nor in argument has anything been sought to be made of the informal preceding conversations. What is relied upon, as a fall-back and in relation to the Brightstar claim only, is the bank's response by letter dated 29 January 2001 written by its Retail Financial Services - Legal department. This said inter alia "We confirm that the Bank will abide by the terms of the Order â€¦", drew attention to the costs which it would incur so doing and to its entitlement under the order to reimbursement and set out on the reverse an explanation of their nature and concluded:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Almost all of the time expended on service of an Order is by staff of Managerial status and has been carefully costed. Our <i>minimum</i> costs for dealing with this Freezing Order are in excess of Â£150, but we are prepared to round our costs down to this amount".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that this letter was not received by the Commissioners before the Bank's error in making the payment out of Brightstar's account, so that the Commissioners cannot have relied on it. But it may have been sent before the error and, if so, Mr Philip Sales for the Commissioners suggests that the Bank might by the time of the error be regarded as having assumed responsibility for the task and/or towards the Commissioners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82.&nbsp;&nbsp;The conceptual basis on which courts decide whether a duty of care exists in particular circumstances has been repeatedly examined. Three broad approaches have been suggested, involving consideration (a) whether there has been an assumption of responsibility, (b) whether a three-fold test of foreseeability, proximity and "fairness, justice and reasonableness" has been satisfied or (c) whether the alleged duty would be "incremental" to previous cases. Mr Michael Brindle QC for the bank argues that in cases of economic loss the only relevant question is whether there has been an "assumption of responsibility". Mr Philip Sales for the Commissioners submits that the primary approach should be through the three-fold test of foreseeability, proximity and "fairness, justice and reasonableness" and that assumption of responsibility and incrementalism are no more than potentially relevant factors under that test.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83.&nbsp;&nbsp;All three approaches may often (though not inevitably) lead to the same result. Assumption of responsibility is on any view a core area of liability for economic loss.  All three approaches operate at a high level of abstraction. What matters is how and by reference to what lower-level factors they are interpreted in practice, see eg <i>Caparo Industries plc v Dickman</i> [1990] 2 AC 605, per Lord Bridge of Harwich (at pp 617H-618D) and Lord Oliver of Aylmerton (at p 633B-D). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84.&nbsp;&nbsp;As to incrementalism, I note that the House's support for this approach in <i>Caparo</i> was given with reference to a passage in Brennan J's judgment in <i>Sutherland Shire Council v Heyman </i>(1985) 157 CLR 424, 481, where he was rejecting the House's approach in <i>Anns v Merton London Borough Council</i> [1978] AC 728, from which the House itself resiled five months after <i>Caparo</i> in <i>Murphy v Brentwood District Council </i>[1991] 1 AC 398. Brennan J said of <i>Anns</i>:</p>
<p></p><ul>"I am unable to accept that approach. It is preferable, in my view, that the law should develop novel categories of negligence incrementally and by analogy with established categories, rather than by a massive extension of a prima facie duty of care restrained only by indefinable 'considerations which ought to negative, or to reduce or limit the scope of the duty or the class of person to whom it is owed".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incrementalism was therefore viewed as a corollary of the rejection, now uncontroversial, of any generalised liability for negligently caused economic loss, rather than as necessarily inconsistent with the development of novel categories of negligence. Having said that, caution and analogical reasoning are generally valuable accompaniments to judicial activity, and this is particularly true in the present area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85.&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of assumption of responsibility derives from the fountain of most modern economic claims, <i>Hedley Byrne &amp; Co Ltd v Heller &amp; Partners Ltd</i> [1964] AC 465. The concept appears most clearly in the speech of Lord Devlin, who (at pp 528-529) founded himself on the proposition that a duty of care might arise in relationships</p>
<p></p><ul>"which are â€¦.. 'equivalent to contract', that is, where there is an assumption of responsibility in circumstances in which, but for the absence of consideration, there would be a contract".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Devlin went on to emphasise (at p.529) that, in the light of the bank's disclaimer in that case,  the claim failed because:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Responsibility can attach only to the single act, that is, the giving of the reference, and only if the doing of that act implied a voluntary undertaking to assume responsibility".<p></p></ul>
<p>Where there has been an assumption of responsibility in the core sense considered in <i>Hedley Byrne</i>, questions of "foreseeability", "proximity" and "fairness, justice and reasonableness" tend to answer themselves (cf <i>Henderson v Merrett Syndicates Ltd </i>[1995] 2 AC 145, per Lord Goff of Chieveley at p 181C).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Hedley Byrne</i> the concept was one of assumption of responsibility by the defendant towards the claimant. Lord Devlin's contractual analogy also indicates, and Mr Brindle accepts, that whether there has been an assumption of responsibility is to be assessed objectively: see <i>Henderson v Merrett Syndicates Ltd</i>, per Lord Goff (at p 181B-C), with whose speech all other members of the House agreed. Similarly, an assumption of responsibility may arise from the provision not merely of information or advice, but also of services: see per Lord Goff (at p 180E-F).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it has been said on a number of occasions that it is artificial or unhelpful to insist on fitting all claims for breach of a duty of care to avoid economic loss within the conception of assumption of responsibility, and there are several cases involving economic loss where the three-fold test and incrementalism have been preferred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus in <i>Smith v Eric S Bush; Harris v Wyre Forest District Council  </i>[1990] 1 AC 831 valuers engaged by the mortgagee council were held to owe a duty of care to house buyers, despite an express disclaimer stating that their report was "intended solely for the benefit of" that council and advising the house buyers to obtain independent advice. Apart from the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 the disclaimer would have negatived any duty of care, in the same way as the disclaimer in <i>Hedley Byrne</i>. But, since the disclaimer was unreasonable and so void under the 1977 Act, the valuer was held to owe a duty of care to the buyers. Lord Templeman (at p 847C-D) explained this on the basis that the valuer had "assumed responsibility" to both mortgagee and purchaser, knowing that the latter has paid the fee and would probably rely on the report. But Lord Griffiths (at p 862B-E) thought that assumption of responsibility was not "a helpful or realistic test for liability", and explained its use in <i>Hedley Byrne </i>by reference to the disclaimer which there existed. He went on to say that</p>
<p></p><ul>"The phrase 'assumption of responsibility' can only have any real meaning if it is understood as referring to the circumstances in which the law will deem the maker of the statement to have assumed responsibility to the person who acts upon the advice".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle took a similar view at p 871C-F. Lord Keith of Kinkel and Lord Brandon of Oakbrook (at p 840D-F) agreed with both Lord Templeman and Lord Griffiths.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Caparo Industries plc v Dickman </i>[1990] 2 AC 605, Lord Bridge of Harwich (at p 623C-D) found it unnecessary in the context of that appeal to address any difference between an approach based on assumption of responsibility and the three-fold test. But Lord Roskill (at p 628F-G) echoed Lord Griffiths' words in <i>Smith v Eric S Bush; Harris v Wyre Forest District Council</i> and Lord Oliver of Aylmerton (at p 637E-G) said of "the voluntary assumption of responsibility" that </p>
<p></p><ul>"This is a convenient phrase but it is clear that it was not intended to be a test for the existence of the duty for, on analysis, it means no more than that the act of the defendant in making the statement or tendering the advice was voluntary and that the law attributes to it an assumption of responsibility if the statement or advice is inaccurate and is acted upon. It tells us nothing about the circumstances from which such attribution arises."<i><p></p></i></ul><i>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier in his speech (at p 633B-D), Lord Oliver had also expressed doubt about the value of the three-fold test, saying that:</p>
<p></p><ul>"â€¦ although the cases in which the courts have imposed or withheld liability are capable of an approximate categorisation, one looks in vain for some common denominator by which the existence of the essential relationship can be tested. Indeed it is difficult to resist a conclusion that what have been treated as three separate requirements are, at least in most cases, in fact merely facets of the same thing, for in some cases the degree of foreseeability is such that it is from that alone that the requisite proximity can be deduced, whilst in others the absence of that essential relationship can most rationally be attributed simply to the court's view that it would not be fair and reasonable to hold the defendant responsible. 'Proximity' is, no doubt, a convenient expression so long as it is realised that it is no more than a label which embraces not a definable concept but merely a description of circumstances from which, pragmatically, the courts conclude that a duty of care exists."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Jauncey took as his approach the three-fold test (p 655A-G). The House also expressed its support for Brennan J's preference in <i>Sutherland Shire Council v Heyman </i>157 CLR 424, 481 for development of novel categories of negligence incrementally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Spring v Guardian Assurance plc </i>[1995] 2 AC 296, the issue was whether a company giving a reference owed a duty of care to the subject of the reference, its former employee, who by virtue of the content of the reference had not been appointed to the new post which he was seeking elsewhere. While Lord Goff would have decided in favour of such a duty on the ground of assumption of responsibility, all three other members of the majority proceeded (as Lord Goff recognised at p 316F), on a broader basis, applying the three-fold test of foreseeability, proximity and fairness, justice and reasonableness: see per Lord Lowry (at p 325E-H), Lord Slynn of Hadley (at pp 333C-E, 334H and 336F) and Lord Woolf (at p 342B).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>White v Jones</i> [1995] 2 AC 207 the general approach was revisited. Lord Goff (at p 257A) referred to assumption of responsibility as the test which "as a general rule" determined whether there could be liability for purely financial loss, but he recognised that the testator's solicitor could not be said actually to have assumed responsibility towards a disappointed beneficiary (pp 262B-C and 268A-B). It was only because there would otherwise be a lacuna in the law leading to injustice that he concluded that the House</p>
<p></p><ul>"should in cases such as these extend to the intended beneficiary a remedy under the <i>Hedley Byrne</i> principle by holding that the assumption of responsibility by the solicitor towards his client should be held in law to extend to the intended beneficiary who (as the solicitor can reasonably foresee) may, as a result of the solicitor's negligence, be deprived of his intended legacy in circumstances in which neither the testator nor his estate will have a remedy against the solicitor".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Browne-Wilkinson (at pp 273G-274G) addressed the doubts expressed by Lord Griffiths in <i>Smith v Bush</i> and Lord Roskill in <i>Caparo Industries plc v Dickman </i>by explaining assumption of responsibility as "assumption of responsibility for the task not the assumption of legal responsibility". He said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"If the responsibility for the task is assumed by the defendant he thereby creates a special relationship between himself and the plaintiff in relation to which the law (not the defendant) attaches a duty to carry out carefully the task so assumed." <p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this basis he explained <i>Smith v Bush </i>and <i>Caparo </i>as cases where there had been "the conscious assumption of responsibility for the task" (p 274B), and said that, although the categories of cases of special relationship were not closed, the only two hitherto identified were</p>
<p></p><ul>"(1) where there was fiduciary relationship and (2) where the defendant has voluntarily answered a question or tenders skilled advice or services in circumstances where he knows or ought to know that an identified plaintiff will rely on his answers or advice. In both these categories the special relationship is created by the defendant voluntarily assuming to act in the matter by involving himself in the plaintiff's affairs or by choosing to speak."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He recognised that neither of these categories covered the circumstances in <i>White v Jones </i>(p 275C). But he considered a duty of care in <i>White v Jones </i>to be justified<i> </i>because "the law in this area has not ossified", because Lord Devlin in <i>Hedley Byrne</i> had himself envisaged that there might be other sets of circumstances in which it would be appropriate to find a special relationship giving rise to a duty of care, and because the case fell within Lord Bridge's statement in <i>Caparo</i> that novel categories of negligence could be developed "incrementally and by analogy with established categories". A duty owed by the negligent solicitor to the disappointed beneficiary was closely analogous with existing categories of special relationship (p 275F). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93.&nbsp;&nbsp;This review of authority confirms that there is no single common denominator, even in cases of economic loss, by which liability may be determined. In my view the three-fold test of foreseeability, proximity and fairness, justice and reasonableness provides a convenient general framework although it operates at a high level of abstraction. The concept of assumption of responsibility is particularly useful in the two core categories of case identified by Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <i>White v Jones</i> (at p 274F-G), when it may effectively subsume all aspects of the three-fold approach. But if all that is meant by voluntary assumption of responsibility is the voluntary assumption of responsibility for a task, rather than of liability towards the defendant, then questions of foreseeability, proximity and fairness, reasonableness and justice may become very relevant. In <i>White v Jones </i>itself there was no doubt that the solicitor had voluntarily undertaken responsibility for a task, but it was the very fact that he had done so for the testator, not the disappointed beneficiaries, that gave rise to the stark division of opinion in the House. Incrementalism operates as an important cross-check on any other approach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94.&nbsp;&nbsp;The present cannot be regarded as a case of assumption of responsibility. The involuntary nature of the bank's involvement with the Commissioners makes it impossible to regard the situation as one "akin to contract"; it is also difficult in any meaningful sense to speak of the bank as having voluntarily assumed responsibility even for the task in relation to which it was allegedly negligent, let alone responsibility towards the Commissioners for the task. In a very general sense any bank, indeed anyone carrying on any activity during the course of which they might have cause to hold the monies or possessions of another, might be said to accept the risk that a third party might obtain a freezing order in respect of such monies or possessions. But that is to assign to the concept of voluntary assumption of responsibility so wide a meaning as to deprive it of effective utility. Further, I do not consider that it can make any difference to the above analysis in the case of Brightstar if the bank's letter of 29 January 2001 was posted before the bank's error. The letter was itself written simply to reflect and acknowledge the legal obligation which the freezing order imposed on the bank. To analyse the situation (as Lord Denning MR did in <i>Z Ltd v A-Z and AA-LL</i> [1982]  QB 558, 575A-D) in terms of a request to freeze the account in consideration of payment of the relevant expenses is in my opinion artificial.</p>
