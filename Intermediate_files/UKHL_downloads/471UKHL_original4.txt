<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80. Second, there is the European Convention of Human Rights ("the ECHR") to which the United Kingdom has been a signatory since 1950 but which now, under the Human Rights Act 1998, has become part of our domestic law.  Every person within the jurisdiction of a signatory state is entitled to require that State to secure to him the rights and freedoms provided for in the Convention.  These rights and freedoms are broader than the refugee's right to life and to freedom protected under Article 33 of the Geneva Convention.  And a person need not be a Geneva Convention refugee in order to claim entitlement to the ECHR rights and freedoms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81. The third Convention is the Dublin Convention, signed in June 1990 by each member of the European Union.  The purpose of the Dublin Convention was to identify which of the Member States of the European Union ought to take the responsibility of dealing with an asylum application.  The recitals to the Convention refer to the need</p>
<p></p><ul>"…. to ensure that applicants for asylum are not referred successively from one Member State to another without any of these states acknowledging itself to be competent to examine the application for asylum."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82. The Convention recitals might have referred also to the need to ensure that asylum applicants did not abuse the asylum application system by making applications in successive Member States without disclosing in the later application that the earlier one had failed and without indicating in what respect it was contended that the earlier failure had failed to give effect to the applicant's Geneva Convention rights or ECHR rights, as the case might be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83. The Dublin Convention is expected to be soon replaced by a Dublin Regulation intended to cure some of the perceived shortcomings of the Convention but nothing, for the purposes of these appeals, turns on those shortcomings or the proposed changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84. The Dublin Convention sets out criteria to be applied for the purpose of identifying the Member State which should take responsibility for dealing with an asylum application.  A Member State which is the recipient of an asylum application, but which is not the state with the responsibility, according to the Convention criteria, of dealing with the application, can, if it wishes, deal with it but, if it does not wish to do so, can require the responsible Member State to take charge of the applicant.  It can, without going into the merits of the application, send the applicant to the responsible Member State.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85. The Member State which originally received the asylum application must, however, if it wishes to avail itself of its Dublin Convention right to require some other Member State to deal with the application, satisfy itself that that Member State will deal with the applicant in a manner consistent with the Geneva Convention and with the ECHR.  This should ordinarily present no difficulty since every Member State is a signatory to the Geneva Convention and to the ECHR and can be expected to deal with asylum applicants in a manner consistent with the two Conventions.  But special circumstances in particular cases may raise doubts.  And, in particular, Germany takes a different view about what constitutes "persecution" for Geneva Convention purposes from the view taken in the United Kingdom and most other states.  The German view is that Geneva Convention persecution is persecution emanating from a State or from a quasi-State authority or, at least, persecution that is tolerated or encouraged by the State.  If the persecution feared by the asylum applicant emanates from a non-State entity, neither tolerated nor encouraged by the State but from which the State is for some reason unable to offer effective protection, the applicant is not, in the German view, a Geneva Convention refugee.  Or, at least, that has appeared in the past to be the German view (see <i>Ex parte Adan </i>[2001]  2 AC 477).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86. The United Kingdom view, however, shared by a majority of the signatory States (see ibid. at p 519) is that refugee status is established if the applicant can satisfy the "fear" test and the "protection" test.  If the fear test is satisfied and "…. the state in question is unable to afford protection against factions within the state, then the qualifications for refugee status are complete".  (<i>Adan v Secretary of State for the Home Department</i> [1999] 1 AC 293, 306 per Lord Lloyd of Berwick).    </p>
<p>The United Kingdom asylum legislation</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87. Section 6 of the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993 prohibits the removal from the United Kingdom of an asylum applicant until the Secretary of State has given him notice of the decision on his asylum claim.  But section 2(1) of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 qualifies that prohibition.  It provides that section 6 of the 1993 Act does not prevent the removal of an asylum applicant if the Secretary of State has given a certificate certifying that the conditions mentioned in sub-section (2) are fulfilled, unless the certificate is under appeal.  The sub-section (2) conditions are</p>
<p></p><ul>"(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;that the person is not a national or citizen of the country or territory to which he is to be sent; <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;that his life and liberty would not be threatened in that country or territory by reason of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion;  and<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;that the government of that country or territory would not send him to another country or territory otherwise than in accordance with the Convention."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88. It is plain enough that these statutory provisions were designed to accommodate the Dublin Convention and to enable an asylum applicant to be sent to the responsible Member State without the need for his application to be dealt with on its merits in this country.  But the Secretary of State has to be satisfied that the applicant would not be at risk in the responsible Member State (condition (b)) and that the responsible Member State would not send him back to his country of origin otherwise than in accordance with the Convention (condition (c)).  The effect of these provisions is underlined by rule 345 of the Immigration Rules (made by the Secretary of State pursuant to section 3(2) of the Immigration Act 1971).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89. Rule 345(1) repeats the 1996 Act section 2(2) conditions.  Rule 345(2) says that</p>
<p></p><ul>"The Secretary of State shall not remove an asylum applicant without substantive consideration of his claim unless:<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;the asylum applicant has not arrived in the United Kingdom directly from the country in which he claims to fear persecution and has had an opportunity at the border or within the third country or territory to make contact with the authorities of that third country or territory in order to seek their protection; or<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;there is other clear evidence of his admissibility to a third country or territory.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>…."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90. These are the statutory provisions that apply to Mr Yogathas.  The Secretary of State certified that the 1996 Act section 2(2) conditions were satisfied and directed Mr Yogathas' removal to Germany, the responsible Member State under the Dublin Convention criteria.  Mr Yogathas sought judicial review of the Secretary of State's decision to certify.  He lost before Richards J and before the Court of Appeal.  The issue is whether the Secretary of State was entitled to form the view that if Mr Yogathas were sent to Germany for his application to be dealt with there, Germany would not send him back to his country of origin otherwise than in accordance with the Geneva Convention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91. The 1996 Act regime that applies to Mr Yogathas' asylum application has been replaced by provisions in the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.  The 1999 Act regime applies to Mr Thangarasa's asylum application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92. Section 11 of the 1999 Act provides that—</p>
<p></p><ul>"(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining whether a person in relation to whom a certificate has been issued under subsection (2) may be removed from the United Kingdom, a Member State [of the European Union] is to be regarded as—<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;a place where a person's life and liberty is not threatened by reason of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion;  and<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;a place from which a person will not be sent to another country otherwise than in accordance with the [Geneva] Convention.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in section 15 prevents a person who has made a claim for asylum ('the claimant') from being removed from the United Kingdom to a Member State if—  <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;the Secretary of State has certified that—<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;the Member State has certified that, under standing arrangements, it is the responsible State in relation to the claimant's claim for asylum;  and<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;in his opinion, the claimant is not a national or citizen of the Member State to which he is to be sent;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;the certificate has not been set aside on an appeal under section 65."<p></p></ul>
<p>Section 15 (referred to in subsection (2) above) has replaced and is to the same effect as section 6 of the 1993 Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93. It follows from section 11(1) of the 1999 Act that a challenge to the Secretary of State's decision to send an asylum applicant to the Member State responsible under the Dublin Convention criteria for dealing with the application cannot be based on the allegation that that Member State would, or might, send the applicant back to his country of origin otherwise than in accordance with Article 33 of the Geneva Convention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94. Under section 65 of the 1999 Act, however, the applicant can challenge the decision on the ground that the decision is in contravention of the applicant's rights under the ECHR (see section 65(1) and (2)).  But this right of challenge is limited by section 72(2) of the Act.  Section 72(2) provides that—</p>
<p></p><ul>"A person who has been, or is to be, sent to a Member State …. is not, while he is in the United Kingdom, entitled to appeal—<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;under section 65 if the Secretary of State certifies that his allegation that a person acted in breach of his human rights is manifestly unfounded;  or<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;…. "<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95. The Secretary of State directed the removal of Mr Thangarasa to Germany, the Member State responsible for dealing with his asylum application.  Mr Thangarasa alleged that the decision to send him to Germany was in breach of his human rights.  The Secretary of State certified that the allegation was manifestly unfounded.  Accordingly Mr Thangarasa's ability to appeal under section 65 was blocked (see section 72(2)). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96. Mr Thangarasa applied for judicial review of the Secretary of State's section 72(2) certificate.  He contended that the Secretary of State had erred in law in concluding that his allegation that his removal to Germany would be in breach of his human rights was manifestly unfounded.  He lost before Collins J and before the Court of Appeal.  The issue is whether it is clear that sending him to Germany would not constitute a breach of his human rights. That depends on whether a decision by Germany to refuse his asylum application and to send him back to his country of origin would be a breach of his human rights.</p>
<i><p>The Facts</p>
</i>
<p>Mr Yogathas</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97. Mr Yogathas is a Tamil citizen of Sri Lanka.  He was born in 1979 and lived in Point Pedro in the north of Sri Lanka.  In 1996 the Sri Lankan army captured Point Pedro from the LTTE (the Tamil Tigers) and Mr Yogathas was arrested by the army on suspicion of involvement with the LTTE.  He says he was detained and tortured and bears scars from the torture.  In fear of the Sri Lankan army he moved to an area under LTTE control but then came under pressure from the LTTE to join them as a fighter.  Unwilling to do so and fearing LTTE reprisals he left Sri Lanka, via Colombo, and on 1 March 1999 arrived in Germany where he claimed asylum as a Geneva Convention refugee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98. His application for asylum was refused.  He was asked to leave Germany but was allowed to remain until 12 November 1999.  He then entered the United Kingdom clandestinely on 27 November 1999 at Dover.  He applied for asylum here, falsely stating that he had not previously applied for asylum in any other European Union State.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99. The United Kingdom Immigration authorities ascertained, by means of the Eurodac computer system, that Mr Yogathas had entered Germany on 1 March 1999 and had unsuccessfully applied for asylum there.  Germany was the country responsible, under the Dublin Convention criteria, for dealing with Mr Yogathas' asylum application, the German authorities agreed that that was so and that he was readmissible to Germany under the Dublin Convention provisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100. Accordingly by letter dated 20 July 2000 from the UK Immigration Service Mr Yogathas was informed that he would be sent to Germany for his application to be dealt with there.  The letter contained, also, the Secretary of State's certificate under section 2(2) of the 1996 Act certifying, in particular, that Germany would not send him to another country or territory otherwise than in accordance with the Geneva Convention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101. Mr Yogathas' judicial review proceedings were commenced on 4 August 2000.  The ground relied on was that Mr Yogathas feared persecution by non-state actors, namely, the LTTE, and that since Germany's approach to the risk of persecution from non-state actors was not in accordance with the Geneva Convention, there was a real risk that the German authorities would return him to Sri Lanka in breach of the Convention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102. A letter dated 18 September 2000 to Mr Yogathas' solicitors from the UK Immigration Service set out in full the Secretary of State's reasons for deciding to send Mr Yogathas back to Germany.  The letter is a lengthy one and the reasons are summarised in paragraph 11 of Richards J's judgment.  It is not necessary to repeat them.  The reasons were further explained in a witness statement by Mr Taylor, a senior executive officer in the Immigration Service, dated 31 January 2001.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103. The Secretary of State had become aware, via the Eurodac computer system, that Mr Yogathas had made an unsuccessful asylum application in Germany before coming to the United Kingdom.  But the details of the application and the way in which it had been dealt with in Germany were confidential.  So by letter dated 21 January 2001 the Secretary of State asked Mr Yogathas to agree to the Secretary of State approaching the German authorities for information about the application.  By letter dated 1 March 2001 Mr Yogathas' solicitors replied that </p>
<p></p><ul>"Our client does not give his authority for the Secretary of State to approach the German authorities for information about his asylum claim."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104. Mr Yogathas was, of course, within his rights in declining to agree to information about his German asylum application being disclosed to the Secretary of State.  But the position reached is an odd one.  Mr Yogathas is resisting his removal from this country to Germany on the ground that Germany cannot be relied on to deal with his current asylum application in accordance with the Geneva Convention.  He has already made an asylum application in Germany.  It might have been thought that the manner in which the German authorities had dealt with that application and their reasons for refusing it would give a good indication of how they would be likely to deal with the current application.  But Mr Yogathas has refused to allow the relevant information to be disclosed.  I shall return to this oddity when considering whether Mr Yogathas' current application is an abuse of the asylum procedure.</p>
<p>Mr Thangarasa</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105. Mr Thangarasa, too, is a Tamil Sri Lankan.  He was born in 1974 in northern Sri Lanka.  In 1989 he was detained and ill-treated by the Indian Peacekeeping Forces.  He bears scars from the ill-treatment.  After the departure from Sri Lanka of the Indian troops he was harassed by the LTTE.  He was unwilling to join the LTTE and in 1991 to escape their harassment he fled to Colombo where he lived for about a year.  However in September 1992 he was arrested and detained in Colombo for about a week during which period he was beaten and questioned about his links with the LTTE.  So he fled from Colombo to Germany, where he arrived on 29 September 1992 and applied for asylum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106. Although initially unsuccessful, Mr Thangarasa's asylum application in Germany succeeded on appeal and he was granted refugee status.  But in December 1999, after several years in Germany, he was informed by the German authorities that in their view it would be safe for him to return to Sri Lanka and that his refugee status would be withdrawn.  There is nothing necessarily inconsistent with the Geneva Convention in such a decision.  Refugee status is a temporary status for as long as the risk of persecution remains.  Mr Thangarasa appealed against the decision that he should return to Sri Lanka but his appeal failed and he was asked to make arrangements to return.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107. Mr Thangarasa is fearful that in Sri Lanka he would be identified as a member of a family some of whose members support the LTTE and that he would for that reason still be at risk of persecution by the Sri Lanka authorities who had detained and beaten him in the past.  He fears also that even in Colombo he may be at risk of reprisals from the LTTE on account of his failure to join them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108. So, in order to avoid return to Sri Lanka, Mr Thangarasa left Germany and travelled to the United Kingdom, arriving on 25 November 2000.  He claimed asylum in this country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109. At his interview with Immigration Service officials after his arrival, the so-called Dublin screening interview, it became apparent that Germany was the responsible state under the Dublin Convention criteria.  The German authorities agreed that that was so.  Accordingly, on 12 December 2000 the Secretary of State gave a certificate under section 11(2) of the 1999 Act and directed Mr Thangarasa's removal to Germany.  Mr Thangarasa indicated an intention to appeal under section 65 of the 1999 Act, alleging that the decision to send him back to Germany was in breach of his human rights under the ECHR.  But the Secretary of State certified under section 72(2) that the allegation was "manifestly unfounded", thereby barring the section 65 appeal.  Mr Thangarasa's judicial review application challenges the "manifestly unfounded" certificate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110. Mr Thangarasa did not disclose any details of the proceedings in Germany resulting from the decision of the German authorities to withdraw the refugee status that he had initially succeeded in obtaining.  He has not disclosed why it was that the German authorities thought, if they did, that it had become safe for him to return to Sri Lanka.  He has not disclosed his grounds of appeal against that decision nor the grounds on which his appeal was dismissed.  To be fair to him, there is nothing in the papers before your Lordships to indicate that he was ever asked to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "internal relocation" alternative</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111. Both appeals raise issue about the "internal relocation" alternative (I respectfully agree with my noble and learned friend Lord Hope of Craighead that "internal relocation" is a more apt description than the expression "internal flight" used in the courts below).  The internal relocation alternative arises where an asylum applicant has a well-founded fear of persecution in one part of the country of his nationality but would be safe in other parts of the country.  The possibility that internal relocation may be an answer to a claim for asylum is implicit in the requirement in the Article 1A (2) definition of 'refugee' that the person with the well-founded fear of persecution "…. is unable or, owing to such a fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112. The evidence before the court on the Yogathas case led Richards J to conclude that there were differences between the United Kingdom approach and the German approach to the internal relocation alternative (see para 50 of his judgment).  In the United Kingdom the question would be whether it would be unreasonable or unduly harsh to return the applicant to the area of relocation, whereas in Germany the question would be whether the return of the applicant to the area of relocation  would be in breach of section 53(6) of the Aliens Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Aliens Act is a German statute.  Section 53(6) says that—</p>
<p></p><ul>"Deportation of a foreigner to another state can be avoided if there exists for this foreigner a considerable definite danger for body, life, or liberty in that state …<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113. Richards J said that</p>
<p></p><ul>"In practice essentially the same social and economic issues are considered in each country, in each case looking at the individual circumstances of the applicant; but in Germany the test of economic survival is such that more extreme social and/or economic difficulties are required in order to avoid a finding that the internal flight alternative applies."<p></p></ul>
<p>and that</p>
<p></p><ul>"The applicant's civil and political rights do not appear to be taken into account in Germany, save to the extent that political rights are considered under the safety limb of the internal flight alternative, ie whether there would be a sufficiency of protection from the state in the area of relocation.  Such matters may, however, be taken into account in the United Kingdom in considering the reasonableness of relocating …. "<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114. Laws LJ in the Court of Appeal referred to these passages (and others) and commented:</p>
<p></p><ul>"As it seems to me, if Germany applied the same interpretation of refugee as the United Kingdom does in relation to non-state agents, and therefore in a case like the present were to consider the question of internal flight in the context of the Convention rather than that of section 53(6), these differences in approach would not debar the Secretary of State from certifying under section 2(2)(c).  If that is right, I see no reason why he should be so debarred by virtue of the fact that Germany in truth considers the matter in the context of section 53(6) …. " (para 51 of the Court of Appeal judgment).<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115. My Lords, I think Laws LJ's approach is the right one.  The question whether an asylum applicant is excluded from refugee status because of his unwillingness to avail himself of the protection of his country by relocating in some other part of that country is not a question of interpretation of the Convention.  It requires a judgment as to the reasonableness in all the circumstances of the unwillingness.  In different countries, all being signatories to the Convention, different weight may be attached to different elements of the social and economic circumstances pertaining in the area of relocation.  The fact that country A applies a stricter test of reasonableness than country B does not mean that one country is acting otherwise than in compliance with the Convention.  No doubt there may come a point at which a country's refusal to regard as reasonable a person's unwillingness to re-locate may itself appear so unreasonable as to be outwith the Convention.  But Germany's approach to re-location, via section 53(6) of the Aliens Act, requiring attention to be paid to potential "danger for body, life,  or liberty" cannot, in my opinion, possibly be regarded as outwith the Convention.  Moreover, the standards required for compliance with the Convention are minimum standards.  A country's approach to internal relocation may be more liberal than is strictly required for compliance with the Convention.  It is arguable that the United Kingdom approach is of that character.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116. For these reasons I would reject the appellants' contention that because Germany approaches the question of internal relocation in the context of section 53(6) of the Aliens Act rather than in the context of the Convention, its approach is not in accordance with the Convention.  And I would reject also the contention that because the United Kingdom's approach to internal relocation may be more liberal than that of Germany, the German approach, when considering these appellants' asylum applications, will not be in accordance with the Convention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117. It follows that, in my opinion, the challenge to the section 2(2) certificate given by the Secretary of State in the Yogathas case fails.  But there remains the question whether it is arguable that the decision to send the two appellants back to Germany is in breach of their ECHR rights.  In the case of Mr Thangarasa this is the critical issue to be addressed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118. The case of breach is based on the proposition that if sent back to Colombo, these Tamil Sri Lankans will face harassment from the Sri Lankan police because of their Tamil associations and danger from the LTTE because of their refusal to join the LTTE and fight with them.  There is evidence to suggest that both these dangers might be present.  The question is whether it is permissible, from an ECHR viewpoint, for the Secretary of State to send the appellants back to Germany so that the German authorities can assess the weight of the evidence and decide whether to send them to Sri Lanka would be in breach of their human rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119. This issue has, in a very similar case, been considered by the European Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg.  The case is <i>TI v United Kingdom</i> [2000]  INLR 211.  The case is fully discussed in paragraphs 52 and 53 of the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Hope of Craighead and it suffices for me to refer to the court's conclusion that—</p>
<p></p><ul>"…. on the basis of the assurances given by the German Government concerning its domestic law and practice, the court is satisfied that the applicant's claims, if accepted by the authorities, could fall within the scope of section 53(6) and attract its protection."<p></p></ul>
<p>and that</p>
<p></p><ul>"There is … no basis on which the Court could assume in this case that Germany would fail to fulfil its obligations under article 3 of the [ECHR] to provide the applicant with protection against removal to Sri Lanka if he put forward substantial grounds that he faces a risk of torture and ill-treatment in that country." (p 231).<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120. Similarly, in the present cases, no evidence has been adduced that justifies the assumption that Germany would send these appellants back to Sri Lanka to face torture or ill-treatment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121. For these reasons, and for those contained in Lord Hope's opinion, and in the opinions of Lord Bingham of Cornhill and Lord Hutton, with all of which I am in full agreement, the courts below came, in my opinion, to the correct conclusions and these appeals should be dismissed.</p>
