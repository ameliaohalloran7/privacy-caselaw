<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102.&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of Court of Appeal cases have, however, sought to supplement, and in effect have de facto replaced, the statutory disregards.  The first of these is <i>Camrose v Basingstoke Corporation </i> [1966]  1 WLR 1100.  The corporation was the acquiring authority.  Basingstoke was being expanded under the Town Development Act 1952 to receive overspill population from London and the corporation contracted to purchase about 550 acres from a landowner on terms that the price would be assessed as though the land had been compulsorily acquired under the 1952 Act.  About 383 of the 550 acres were, in the town development plan, designated for residential development.  The question was whether the increase in the value of the intended residential land brought about by the town development scheme should be reflected in the compensation.  The relevant Act for assessment of compensation purposes was the Land Compensation Act 1961, a consolidating Act, in which section 5 reproduced section 2 of the 1919 Act, and section 6 replaced section 9 of the 1959 Act.  Such differences as there are between the 1961 Act and its statutory predecessors are not material for present purposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 6 of the 1961 Act has been subjected to a good deal of deserved criticism prompted by the lack of lucidity in its drafting.  The first question which arose in <i>Camrose</i> was whether the case fell within one of the new statutory disregards.  Lord Denning MR, with whose judgment Davies LJ agreed, held that, on a literal reading of the statutory provisions, any increase in value of the relevant land attributable to the development, or the prospect of development, of the rest of the land in the town development plan was to be excluded, but that any increase in value of the relevant land due to its own inclusion in the town development plan was not excluded.  But Lord Denning described this conclusion as "contrary to commonsense".  He then sought, at p 1107, to explain section 6:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The explanation of section 6(1) is, I think, this:  The legislature was aware of the general principle that, in assessing compensation for compulsory acquisition of a defined parcel of land, you do not take into account an increase in value of that parcel of land if the increase is entirely due to the scheme involving the acquisition.  That was settled by [the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> case] where the Privy Council disallowed the $15,000 increase in value of the quarry â€¦. which was due to the scheme for a naval base.  That decision has since been approved by the House of Lords in <i>Davy v Leeds Corporation</i>.  It is left untouched by section 6(1).  But there might be some doubt as to its scope.  So the legislature passed section 6(1) and the First Schedule in order to make it clear that you were not to take into account any increase due to the development of the other land, namely, land other than the claimed parcel.  I think that the decision in the <i>Pointe Gourde </i>case covers one aspect:  and section 6(1) covers the other:  with the result that the tribunal is to ignore any increase in value due to the Town Development Act, both on the relevant land and on the other land."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think Lord Denning's approach was correct.  First, it was not accurate to say that <i>Davy v Leeds Corporation</i> [1965] 1 WLR 445 had approved <i>Pointe Gourde</i>.  Viscount Dilhorne (and Lord Cohen) said that section 9(2) of the 1959 Act (the predecessor of section 6(2) of the 1961 Act) had given "statutory expression" to the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> principle.  Approval or disapproval was not in point.  Second, Lord Denning's reference to a "scheme <i>involving</i> the acquisition" (emphasis added) stretches the concept of the "scheme" much further than Lord MacDermott could have had in mind.  The <i>Point Gourde</i> scheme was simply the purchase of land, including the quarry land, for a US naval base.  The word "involving" introduces an elasticity into the concept of "scheme" that does not derive from <i>Pointe Gourde</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105.&nbsp;&nbsp;Russell LJ, agreeing in the result, said, at p 1110:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The argument [for the landowner] I take to be this.  Since the relevant land is excepted [from the s.6(1) disregards] the section accepts that the prospect of <i>its</i> development in the course of the town development scheme <i>does</i> contribute to its valuation, though not the prospect of such development of other land.  The only merit of this argument is that, like most fallacies, it can be simply and briefly stated, and has a surface plausibility.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>The objection to it lies in the history of compensation for compulsory acquisition, in which it has long been judicially established that the prospect of the direct impact of the relevant scheme on the land to be acquired is to be ignored.  It is not possible against that background to construe the section as tacitly or by implication altering the law.  Rather is the exclusion of the relevant land a recognition of a well-known situation for which legislation was not necessary."<p></p></ul>
<p>Here, too, I must respectfully disagree with the reasoning.  Over the years 1947 to 1959, compensation had had to be assessed on an existing use basis.  The question at issue in <i>Camrose</i> would not have arisen while compensation continued to be restricted to existing use value.  Pre 1947, as I have endeavoured to show, the only relevant compensation principles that had been judicially established were that the value of land for compensation purposes was its value to the seller and that any special suitability of the land for the purposes for which the acquiring authority was acquiring the land was to be ignored.  These principles had been incorporated into the statutory regime prescribed by the 1919 Act.  The need to extend in 1959 the statutory disregards was surely attributable, first, to the abandonment of the "existing use" restriction and, second, to the special planning considerations brought about by the advent of slum clearance schemes, town development plans, schemes for new towns and the like.  Compensation in the pre 2nd World War era had been based on market value, subject to the two principles, value to the seller and the 1919 Act disregards.  There was, in my opinion, no justification after the 1959 Act for depriving landowners whose land had been compulsorily acquired of any part of the value of that land to the sellers save such part as fell within one or other of the statutory disregards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>Camrose</i> land that had been designated for residential use had to be valued on the footing that it had planning permission for residential development (see section 15 of the 1961 Act).  Since the existence of the town development plan in relation to all the land comprised therein other than the <i>Camrose</i> land had to be ignored, its relevance to the <i>Camrose</i> land itself would, I suspect have been minimal.  The valuer would have had to estimate when the various parts of the <i>Camrose</i> land would have been wanted for actual development, and attribute value accordingly.  He would have had to assume that the infrastructure incorporated into the development of the other land was non-existent.  This is very like the process of valuation that the valuer in fact undertook, a process that was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.  But on the points of principle laid down by the Court of Appeal I think the decision was wrong and should be overruled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Wilson v Liverpool Corporation</i> [1971]  1 WLR 302 a similar valuation issue arose as that which had arisen in <i>Camrose</i>.  The claimants owned 74 acres of an area of 391 acres in Liverpool which the Corporation wanted to acquire for residential development.  The compensation award included a reduction, estimated by the tribunal, attributable to the corporation's "scheme" underlying the acquisition.  Lord Denning MR said, at p 309:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is suggested that that provision [ie section 6(1) and Schedule 1, Part 1, in the 1961 Act] contains a code which defines exhaustively the increases which are <i>not</i> to be taken into account:  so that any other increase <i>is</i> to be taken into account:  and accordingly there is no room for the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> principle.  But this court has rejected that argument.  In [the <i>Camrose</i> case] we held that the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> principle still applies to development which is not mentioned in the Schedule to the Act of 1961.  Mr Pigot recognises that that decision is binding on this court but he may desire to challenge it in the House of Lords."<p></p></ul>
<p>Lord Denning then went on to amplify the concept of a "scheme".  He said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"A scheme is a progressive thing.  It starts vague and known to few.  It becomes more precise and better known as time goes on.  Eventually it becomes precise and definite and known to all.  Correspondingly, its impact has a progressive effect on values.  At first it has little effect because it is so vague and uncertain.  As it becomes more precise and better known, so its impact increases until it has an important effect.  It is this increase, whether big or small, which is to be disregarded at the time when the value is to be assessed."<p></p></ul>
<p>Widgery LJ and Megaw LJ agreed.  Widgery LJ, at p 310, said that:</p>
<p></p><ul>"â€¦. the purpose of the so called <i>Pointe Gourde</i> rule is to prevent the acquisition of the land being at a price which is inflated by the very project or scheme which gives rise to the acquisition."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, my objections in principle to treating <i>Pointe Gourde</i> case as an authority justifying these dicta in <i>Wilson</i> are the same as those I have already expressed.  If the "scheme" underlying a compulsory acquisition has become known and has increased the value of the land to the seller (not being attributable to something that would only be of value to the acquiring authority), and if none of the statutory disregards applies, the seller is, in my opinion, entitled in principle to compensation that reflects that increase in value.  There is no principled basis entitling the courts to authorise the expropriation without compensation of that element of the land's value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Myers v Milton Keynes Development Corporation</i> [1974]  1 WLR 696 the Court of Appeal again applied <i>Pointe Gourde</i> and the <i>Camrose</i> case.  The particular issue was whether the required disregard of any increase in value attributable to the "scheme" meant that the valuer should disregard the scheme altogether or permitted him to have regard to it when identifying the "proposals of the acquiring authority" in accordance with which the valuer had to assume planning permission would be granted (see section 15 of the 1961 Act).  In other words, was there a conflict between section 15 and the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> rule as it had been interpreted and applied?  Lord Denning MR gave the judgment of the court.  He said, at p 704:</p>
<p></p><ul>"What is to be assumed about the Walton Manor Estate itself?  Here again one thing is clear.  You are not to assume that it would have been developed in accordance with the proposals of the development corporation.  You are to disregard any increase by reason of the estate itself being developed in accordance with their proposals.  see <i>Camrose (Viscount) v Basingstoke Corporation </i> [1966]  1 WLR 1110.  But you are to assume that after 10 years planning permission would be available for development as a residential area."<p></p></ul>
<p>The 10 years was the period that, according to the development maps that had been prepared by the corporation, would elapse before the development of the area that included the Walton Manor Estate would commence.  So the valuation <i>was</i> to be carried on the basis of an assumed planning permission for residential development "in accordance with the proposals of the acquiring authority" (s. 15(1)).  The rest of the development scheme was to be disregarded.  But it should have been disregarded, I suggest, not because of some extant rule deriving from the <i>Point Gourde</i> case but because any enhancement of value attributable to the development scheme as it affected the land other than the Walton Manor Estate fell within one or other of the section 6 statutory disregards.  The case was correctly decided but, I suggest, for the wrong reason.  The judgment of Lord Denning in this case demonstrates how the judicial development of the so-called <i>Pointe Gourde</i> principle had, de facto, ousted and become a substitute for the statutory disregards enacted by Parliament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Bird v Wakefield Metropolitan District Council </i>(1978)  37 P &amp; CR 478   the Court of Appeal further developed the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> principle.  Browne LJ, with whose judgment Shaw LJ and Megaw LJ agreed, said, at p 487:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is true that [the scheme] did not provide for the compulsory acquisition of any land for industrial development.  I do not, however, think it necessary for the scheme to provide for the acquisition;  it is enough that it 'underlies' it."<p></p></ul>
<p>This amplification of the "scheme" principle may be logical enough if it is right to abandon the statutory disregards in favour of the judicially developed <i>Pointe Gourde</i> disregard.  The complexities inherent in the amplification are obvious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Batchelor v Kent County Council</i> (1989)  59 P &amp; CR 357 was a case in which the Council had compulsory acquired a plot of land for highway improvement purposes.  The plot was within a larger area shown on the town map as scheduled for residential development.  Outline planning permission for the residential development of land to the south and east of the plot had been granted but the development could not proceed until the road improvements, including the construction of a roundabout, had been carried out.  The compulsorily acquired plot was the site of the roundabout.  The Lands Tribunal assessed the compensation for the plot on the basis that it was the key to the residential development.  The Court of Appeal held that the value of the plot had to be assessed by reference to its value prior to the acquisition and disregarding any increase in value attributable to the residential development.  On the facts, however, the court took the view that there was no ground for holding that the tribunal had failed to have regard to the principle that any such increase in value had to be disregarded (see Mann LJ at p 361).  Mann LJ considered also the section 5 rule (3) disregard and the meaning of the statutory words "special suitability".  The tribunal had found that "the most suitable access to the land to the south [ie. part of the land to be residentially developed] is that which has been formed on the order land [ie. the roundabout]", but found also "it was unable to find that the order land would have been the only access to the land to the south" (p 362).  Mann LJ said that those findings were "decisive against a finding of special suitability".  He said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The order land may have been the most suitable land for access to the south but it was not specially suitable for that purpose.  Most suitable does not correspond with specially suitable."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, while I would accept that "most suitable" may not be an apt synonym for "specially suitable" it is not necessary, in my opinion, for the land in question to have a unique suitability.  The second rule (3) requisite must be borne in mind.  Either the special suitability must be for a purpose that can only be achieved with statutory powers or the purpose must be a purpose for which only an authority with compulsory purchase powers would want to acquire the land.  In the case of the compulsorily acquired plot, it seems to me that neither alternative would have been satisfied.  The suitability of the plot to provide access to unlock the residential development could have been exploited by a private developer;  and a private developer might well have been in the market to acquire the plot for that purpose.  If an over strict and narrow meaning is attributed to "special suitability", rule 3 will be excluded in many cases in which one or other of the second criterion alternatives is satisfied and in which the "special suitability" of the acquired land is a suitability not available for exploitation by anyone other than the acquiring authority.  In these cases, rule 3 should in principle be applied.  The rule 3 disregard is not, in my opinion, looking for a unique suitability that is not shared with any other land;  it is looking for a particular suitability that only the acquiring authority, or an authority with statutory powers, is able to exploit.  Your Lordships should, in my opinion, overrule the <i>Batchelor </i>interpretation of "special suitability".</p>
<i><p><i>The compensation principles</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal jurisprudence to which I have referred has, in my opinion, done no favours either to landowners or to acquiring authorities.  A compulsory acquisition will always be in pursuance of some scheme or other.  A compulsory purchase order may sometimes be self-contained but often is the final stage in the evolution over years of some public project.  The project may have different limbs, interlinking but in important respects separate.  Each limb may have added some value to land in the vicinity of the project.  Lord Denning's comments in <i>Wilson</i> show very clearly how inchoate the concept of a "scheme" may be.  But my objection to this jurisprudence is not based upon the complexities it has generated, and is likely, unless curbed, to continue to generate.  It is based on its lack of any sound foundation.  It is statute that authorises compulsory acquisition;  and it does so on the footing that compensation in accordance with the prescribed statutory regime will be paid for what is being taken from the landowner.  The statutory compensation regime is based upon an assessment of the value of the land to the expropriated owner.  He must be taken to be a willing seller.  He is entitled to be compensated for all commercially valuable attributes possessed by the land while in his hands, subject only to the statutory disregards.  The statutory disregards properly construed and applied would, I think, produce very much the same answers as those produced in most of the cited cases by application of the judicially constructed <i>Pointe Gourde</i> disregard.  But if, and to the extent, that the statutory disregards do not go as far as the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> disregard, the former should rule.  A landowner is entitled to be compensated for his expropriated land on the basis of disregards enacted by Parliament and not disregards constructed by judges in substitution for the statutory disregards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114.&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposition that Parliament enacted the 1961 Act on the basis that the statutory disregards would be supplemented by the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> disregard is not a tenable one.  First, the 1961 Act was a consolidating Act,  re-enacting provisions of the 1919 Act and the 1959 Act.  Second, the authorities purporting to establish the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> rule as a continuing disregard supplementing the statutory disregards are Court of Appeal authorities post-dating the 1959 Act, and also, for that matter, post-dating the 1961 Act.  Third, it is not believable that Lord MacDermott in his short ex tempore judgment thought that he was doing other than applying the valuation principles set out in the 1919 Act and adopted in the local Trinidad Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, the present case is, in my opinion, a simple one in which the President of the Lands Tribunal and the Court of Appeal came to the correct conclusion.  But they did so after an extensive and laborious trawl through the case law in order to decide whether the "scheme" that "underlay" the CPO of 15 January 1997 was a scheme that fell within the judicially developed <i>Pointe Gourde</i> rule and whether the assumed enhancement of value of the appellants' land brought about by the government's need for that land in order to comply with its obligations under European law had to be left out of account under that rule.  The President and the Court of Appeal had no alternative, given the content of the earlier Court of Appeal decisions that were binding on them and to which I have referred.  But I wish to make a plea for simplicity.  That trawl should not have been necessary.  All that was necessary, since it was clear that the section 6 disregards were irrelevant to the case, was to ask, first, whether the case fell within rule (3) of section 5 and, second, if it did not, to ask whether the alleged enhancement of value was part of the value of the land to the seller.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116.&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the first question, the President held, following the ruling given by Mann LJ in <i>Batchelor v Kent County Council</i> 59 P&amp;CR 357 that the enhancement was not ruled out of account by rule (3) of section 5.  This point was not appealed.  But since, for reasons I have already given, Mann LJ's rule was, in my opinion, in error, it follows that I think the President was wrong on the rule (3) point.  The appellants' land was specially, not uniquely but specially, suited to constitute part of the compensatory nature reserve that the government had to provide to comply with its obligations under the Directives.  Only the government, or some other state authority acting on behalf of the government, could exploit that particular suitability and so only the government would have been in the market to acquire the land for that particular purpose. I think the case falls squarely within rule (3).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not necessary, however, for the WDA to rely on rule (3).  If it is right that the government's need to provide an adequate nature reserve to compensate for the damage to the Taff/Ely Estuary SSSI means that the land at Uskmouth is worth more to the government than its normal nature reserve value or agricultural value, that extra value is not part of the value of the land to the seller.  It is a value only to the government.  If it really is a commercial attribute of the land it is an attribute that could not have been exploited by any purchaser other than the government and could only have been realised by a sale to LAW or some other state authority.  On the facts of this case the "value to the seller" principle and rule (3) march hand in hand and produce the same result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, for these reasons, dismiss this appeal.</p>
<p><b>LORD BROWN OF EATON-UNDER-HEYWOOD</b></p>
<i><p><i></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
</i><p>My Lords,</p>
<i><p><i>Introduction</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gwent Levels Wetlands Reserve occupies some 1,000 acres of low-lying farmland along the Severn Estuary near Newport in Gwent.  The land on which it was created was compulsorily acquired by the Land Authority for Wales (LAW), now the Welsh Development Agency (WDA), early in 1998 and immediately then transferred successively to the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation (CBDC) and the Countryside Council for Wales (CCW) who undertook the necessary development work: the creation of saline pools, seedbeds and managed grassland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120.&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary reason for the acquisition and creation of this new nature reserve was to compensate for the loss of inter-tidal mudflats some fifteen miles away in Cardiff Bay upon the impoundment of the water there following the construction of the Cardiff Bay Barrage.  Some such compensatory measure had long been recognised to be an essential element of the barrage scheme and as the years passed the government came under ever-increasing pressure, in particular from the European Commission, to provide it.  The Gwent Levels land, by the date of its compulsory purchase, appeared the most suitable site for what by then had become an urgently needed compensatory nature reserve.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some 225 acres of the land belonged to the appellants and at issue before your Lordships is the correct approach to its valuation. The appellants have been offered the land's agricultural value or, if they can show it to be higher, its value as a nature reserve.  What, however, they seek is substantially more than this.  They say that its acquisition was indispensable to the realisation of the Cardiff Bay barrage project and that its valuation must recognise and reflect this fact.  They claim, in short, what is sometimes called the land's 'ransom' or 'key' valueâ€”the value of land needed to unlock the development potential of a linked siteâ€”called in the court below the land's "barrage inhibition value".  Are they entitled to it?  That fundamentally is the question raised in these proceedings. </p>
<i><p><i>The proceedings thus far</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was originally sought to resolve the question by reference to two preliminary issues identified for determination by the Lands Tribunal.  The first was concerned with whether rule 3 of section 5 of the Land Compensation Act 1961 (the 1961 Act) applies in the circumstances of this case:</p>
<p></p><ul>"(3)  The special suitability or adaptability of the land for any purpose shall not be taken into account if that purpose is a purpose to which it could be applied only in pursuance of statutory powers, or for which there is no market apart from the requirements of any authority possessing compulsory purchase powers."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123.&nbsp;&nbsp;The President of the Lands Tribunal, applying the restricted approach adopted by Mann LJ in <i>Batchelor v Kent County Council</i> (1989)  59 P &amp; CR 357, 362â€”"Most suitable does not correspond with specially suitable"â€”held that the subject land has no special suitability or adaptability for the purpose of providing a compensatory nature reserve: "There are other areas along the Severn Estuary that could have performed the same function".  He indicated, however, that, had it been relevant, he would have found for WDA on the other aspect of rule 3: he thought there would have been no market for a nature reserve apart from the requirements of an authority possessing compulsory purchase powers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;124.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second preliminary issue was formulated in these terms:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Whether the scheme underlying the acquisition is the intended use of the land taken as a nature reserve or the construction of the Cardiff Bay Barrage; and whether or not it is necessary to discount for the purposes of valuation any increase in the value of the land taken as being due to the need to acquire the land taken as a palliative measure necessary as a result of the environmental consequences of the construction of the Cardiff Bay Barrage, following <i>Pointe Gourde Quarrying and Transport Co. Ltd</i>  v <i>Sub-Intendent of Crown Lands</i> 1947 AC 565".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Pointe Gourde </i>has long been regarded as authority for the principle that compensation for compulsory purchase "cannot include any increase in value which is entirely due to the scheme underlying the acquisition"â€”the so-called <i>Pointe Gourde rule</i> or "no-scheme rule".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;126.&nbsp;&nbsp;This second issue the President resolved in favour of WDA: he held that the scheme underlying the acquisition was the construction of the barrage and that accordingly it is necessary to disregard any increase in value resulting from the need to acquire the subject land as a palliative measure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;127.&nbsp;&nbsp;The issues developed before the Court of Appeal were somewhat different.  Since WDA had not cross-appealed on the rule 3 issue, this was discussed only insofar as it bore upon the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> rule.  As for the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> issue, the appellants advanced two main contentions:   first, that "the scheme underlying the development" was simply the nature reserve project itself and not the construction of the barrage; secondly, that on a true understanding of the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> rule, WDA must in any event pay the price that it would have been willing to pay in friendly negotiations having regard to the barrage scheme, a price which would include the land's key value.  This second submission, as I shall come to explain, rested heavily upon the Privy Council's decision in the so-called Indian case: <i>Vyricherla Narayana Gajapatiraju v Revenue Divisional Officer, Vizagapatam</i> [1939]  AC 302 .</p>
