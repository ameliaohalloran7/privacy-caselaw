<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;68.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way both Houses of Parliament have unequivocally and repeatedly recognised the validity and effectiveness of the 1949 Act.  Both Houses have recognised that the procedure prescribed by the 1911 Act was effectually amended by the 1949 Act.  Both Houses have acted on this footing.  In the ordinary course the enactment of legislation on the basis of a particular interpretation of earlier legislation does not preclude the courts from ruling that the parliamentary understanding was mistaken: see <i>West Midland Baptist (Trust) Association Inc v Birmingham Corporation</i> [1970] AC 874, 898, per Lord Reid.  But in the present case the involvement of the legislature goes much deeper.  In the present case the later legislation, for instance, the legislation amending the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000, simply could not have had effect if the earlier legislation was not validly enacted.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;69.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, and importantly, the Attorney General was right when he submitted that the impact of the 1949 Act has been much wider than its use on four specific occasions. For the last half century legislative business has been conducted in both Houses against a background awareness that the 1911 Act procedure as amended in 1949 is available to be used should this become necessary and be appropriate.  This general understanding of the effect of the 1911 Act, coupled with the actual use of the amended procedure on several occasions, is a strong pointer away from the claimants' interpretation of the 1911 Act.  (There is, I might add, an analogy here with the use of parties' subsequent conduct as an aid to the interpretation of their contract.  In principle such conduct is, or should be, admissible for this purpose: see (2005) 121 LQR 577, 588-589.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons I agree with all your Lordships that this appeal must fail.  The Bill to the Parliament Act 1949 was within the scope of section 2 of the 1911 Act.  From this it follows that the legal challenge to the enactment of the Hunting Act 2004 also fails.</p>
<p><b>LORD STEYN</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<i><p>1.  The Dominance of the Government.</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;71.&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of a government with a large majority in the House of Commons is redoubtable.  That has been the pattern for almost 25 years.  In 1979, 1983 and 1987 Conservative governments were elected respectively with majorities of 43, 144 and 100.  In 1997, 2001 and 2005 New Labour was elected with majorities of respectively 177, 165 and 67.  As Lord Hailsham explained in <i>The Dilemma of Democracy </i>(Collins, London, 1978), 126 the dominance of a government elected with a large majority over Parliament has progressively become greater.  This process has continued and strengthened inexorably since Lord Hailsham warned of its dangers in 1978.</p>
<i>II.  The Hunting Act 2004.</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72.&nbsp;&nbsp;The New Labour government decided that it would abolish the ancient liberty of the British people, regularly exercised by a great many individuals up and down the land, to take part in fox hunting.  It was a deeply controversial measure.  Bills passed by the House of Commons were rejected by the House of Lords.  The government decided to use the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 to enact this measure.  That is how the Hunting Act 2004 came to be enrolled as a statute passed by the United Kingdom Parliament.</p>
<i></i><p><i>III.  Is the Hunting Act 2004 valid?</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73.&nbsp;&nbsp;The central question on this appeal is whether the Hunting Act 2004 is a valid Act of Parliament.  It is important at the outset to explain what this appeal is about and what falls beyond the issues presently before the House.  There is a clear distinction between two questions: (1) what Parliament may do by legislation, and (2) what the constituent elements of Parliament must do to legislate.  The first question involves the domain of the supremacy or sovereignty of Parliament.  It is a question to which I will return at the end of this opinion.  It is, however, not directly in issue on this appeal.  The focus of this appeal is the second question, namely what the constituent elements of Parliament must do to legislate.</p>
<i>
</i><p><i>IV.  Did the 1949 Act validly amend the 1911 Act?</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74.&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon closer examination the question before the House resolves itself into the issue whether the Parliament Act 1949 validly amended the 1911 Act, and therefore whether the Hunting Act 2004 was a valid statute having been enacted under the Parliament Act procedure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody doubts that Parliament as ordinarily constituted, involving the House of Commons, House of Lords and the Monarch, validly enacted the 1911 Act.  This statute created a new method of ascertaining the declared will of Parliament.  It restated the manner and form in which laws may be made in respect of what I will call "delayed Bills", i.e. Public Bills passed three times by the House of Commons and rejected on each occasion by the House of Lords.  In respect of such Public Bills the new method of making law involved, subject to the precise conditions of the 1911 Act, the elimination of the House of Lords as a constituent element of Parliament.  In the words of the 1911 Act, upon its conditions being fulfilled the "Bill shall, on its rejection for the third time by the House of Lords, unless the House of Commons direct to the contrary, be presented to His Majesty and become of an Act of Parliament on the Royal Assent being signified thereto, notwithstanding that the House of Lords have not consented to the Bill . . .".  While it will be necessary to examine how this new method of expressing the will of Parliament should, as a matter of constitutional law and statutory interpretation be categorised, and what the limitations upon its use are, its essential validity is not disputed.</p>
<i><p>V.  The 1911 Act.</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76.&nbsp;&nbsp;The attack on the validity of the Hunting Act 2004 asserts that the limitations contained in the 1911 Act were ignored.  The restrictions on the powers of the House of Lords in the 1911 Act, and the limitations on the use of the 1911 Act, must be set out.  Before doing so I would make a general comment on the 1911 Act.  The 1911 Act bears the hallmark of precise drafting.  First Parliamentary Counsel explained in 1997 the unique function of legislation:</p>
<p></p><ul>"a Bill is not there to inform, to explain, to entertain or to perform any of the other usual functions of literature.  A Bill's sole reason for existence is to change the law.  The resulting Act <i>is </i>the law.  A consequence of this unique function is that a Bill cannot set about communicating with the reader in the same way that other forms of writing do.  It cannot use the same range of tools.  In particular, it cannot repeat important points simply to emphasise their importance or safely explain itself by restating a proposition in different words.  To do so would risk creating doubts and ambiguities that would fuel litigation. As a result, legislation speaks in a monotone and its language is compressed."<p></p></ul>
<p>See: An Extract from a Note from First Parliamentary Counsel to the Select Committee on the Modernisation of the House of Commons: Second Report, HC 389 (3 December 1997), Appendix, p 2, Annex A, para 35.  The 1911 Act was drafted in this traditional style.  This factor makes it <i>prima facie </i>likely that the 1911 Act contains all the material provisions relevant to its operation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 2 of the 1911 Act provides in part as follows:</p>
<p></p><ul>"(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;If any Public Bill (other than a Money Bill or a Bill containing any provision to extend the maximum duration of Parliament beyond five years) is passed by the House of Commons in three successive sessions (whether of the same Parliament or not), and, having been sent up to the House of Lords at least one month before the end of the session, is rejected by the House of Lords in each of those sessions, that Bill shall, on its rejection for the third time by the House of Lords, unless the House of Commons direct to the contrary, be presented to His Majesty and become an Act of Parliament on the Royal Assent being signified thereto, notwithstanding that the House of Lords have not consented to the Bill:  Provided that this provision shall not take effect unless two years have elapsed between the date of the second reading in the first of those sessions of the Bill in the House of Commons and the date on which it passes the House of Commons in the third of those sessions.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;When a Bill is presented to His Majesty for assent in pursuance of the provisions of this section, there shall be endorsed on the Bill the certificate of the Speaker of the House of Commons signed by him that the provisions of this section have been duly complied with."<p></p></ul>
<p>Section 5 provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In this Act the expression 'Public Bill' does not include any Bill for confirming a Provisional Order."<p></p></ul>
<p>Section 7 provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Five years shall be substituted for seven years as the time fixed for the maximum duration of Parliament under the Septennial Act, 1715."<p></p></ul>
<i>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Prima facie </i>the 1911 Act applies to "any Public Bill".  But it is a matter of controversy what the limitations on the use of the 1911 Act are.  Three points must be mentioned.  First, by long standing arrangement Money Bills were specially provided for by placing it beyond the power of the House of Lords to delay them: <i>Erskine May, The Constitutional History of England since the Accession of George The Third, 1760-1860, </i>11th ed (1896), Vol II,<i> </i>Chapter VII, pp 98-99.  Section 1 of the 1911 Act provides that if a Money Bill is sent up to the House of Lords in due time and not passed by them, it is to be presented to His Majesty and become an Act of Parliament on the Royal Assent being signified, "notwithstanding that the House of Lords have not consented to the Bill."  Secondly, the status of the limitation on the duration of Parliament is a matter of controversy in these proceedings.  Thirdly, it is common ground that the 1911 Act could not be used for the purpose of "confirming a Provisional Order".  This refers to a bill to confirm a provisional order issued by a Minister under the authority of an Act of Parliament: <i>Wilding &amp; Laundy, An Encyclopaedia of Parliament, </i>4th ed (1972), 619.  This procedure has now fallen in disuse:  <i>Companion to the Standing Orders and Guide to the Proceedings of the House of Lords, </i>(2005), para 7.68.  But its place in the scheme of the 1911 Act is still relevant to issues of interpretation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two possible views about the limitation on the duration of Parliament.  First, it may be a strict condition which must be complied with at all times.  Secondly, it may be possible, by use of the 1911 Act to eliminate this limitation albeit in two stages.  It is a point of construction.  In the context of a Parliamentary democracy the language of section 2(1) and section 7 supports the former interpretation.  I would so rule.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VI.  Is modification of the conditions of the 1911 Act permissible only by Parliament as ordinarily constituted?</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is argued by those who challenge the 2004 Act that inherent in the 1911 Act there is another fundamental limitation on its use, namely that the Parliamentary intendment reflected in the 1911 Act precludes modification of the conditions specified in it without the consent of Parliament as ordinarily constituted.  In other words Parliament as specially constituted under the 1911 Act may not alter the conditions prescribed for its use.  This is an argument of substance, powerfully presented to the House by Sir Sydney Kentridge QC.  Before I examine it directly it may be useful if I tried to state what is involved in the concept of Parliament as ordinarily constituted legislating for its own reconstitution for specific purposes.</p>
<i><p>VII.  What is Parliament?</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81.&nbsp;&nbsp;The word Parliament involves both static and dynamic concepts.  The static concept refers to the constituent elements which make up Parliament: the House of Commons, the House of Lords, and the Monarch.  The dynamic concept involves the constituent elements functioning together as a law making body.  The inquiry is: has Parliament spoken?  The law and custom of Parliament regulates what the constituent elements must do to legislate: all three must signify consent to the measure.  But, apart from the traditional method of law making, Parliament acting as ordinarily constituted may functionally redistribute legislative power in different ways.  For example, Parliament could for specific purposes provide for a two-thirds majority in the House of Commons and the House of Lords.  This would involve a redefinition of Parliament for a specific purpose.  Such redefinition could not be disregarded.  Owen Dixon neatly summarised this idea in 1935:</p>
<p></p><ul>". . . The very power of constitutional alteration cannot be exercised except in the form and manner which the law for the time being prescribes.  Unless the Legislature observes that manner and form, its attempt to alter its constitution is void.  It may amend or abrogate for the future the law which prescribes that form or that manner.  But, in doing so, it must comply with its very requirements."<p></p></ul>
<p>See: <i>The Law and the Constitution, </i>51 LQR 590, 601.  This formulation can be traced to the majority judgment in <i>Attorney General for New South Wales v Trethowan</i> (1931)  44 CLR 394, and in particular to the judgment of Dixon J at 424.  The Parliament of New South Wales had amended the Constitution to require that any Bill to abolish the Upper House had to be approved at a referendum before being presented for Royal Assent, and that any Bill to remove this requirement also had to be submitted to a referendum.  A non-conforming statute was held to be void.</p>
<i></i><p><i>VIII.  The practical application of the theory.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82.&nbsp;&nbsp;So far I have discussed a possible theoretical approach to this case in terms which are a little abstract.  In formulating it I have drawn on the incisive analysis of <i>Professor D V Cowen, Parliamentary Sovereignty and the Entrenched Sections of the South Africa Act (1951).</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83.&nbsp;&nbsp;The circumstances of some important constitutional cases, and the decisions in them, give some actuality to the analysis.  In <i>Taylor v Attorney General of Queensland</i> (1917)  23 CLR 457 the Parliamentary Bills Referendum Act of 1908 in respect of Queensland provided that when a Bill passed by the Legislative Assembly in two successive sessions had in the same two sessions been rejected by the Legislative Council, it might be submitted by referendum to the electors, and if affirmed by them, would require the Governor to seek the assent of the King, and upon receiving such assent, the Bill would become an Act of Parliament as if passed by both Houses of Parliament.  The Australian High Court held unanimously in several judgments that there was power to abolish the Legislative Council by an Act passed by the Legislative Assembly and affirmed by the electors in accordance with the Parliamentary Bill Referendum Act 1908.  The decision of the Australian High Court in <i>Clayton v Heffron</i>, (1960) 105 CLR 214 (which involved a referendum to abolish the Upper House of New South Wales) is in the same line of authority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84.&nbsp;&nbsp;Possibly even more instructive are the trilogy of cases associated with the South African constitutional crisis in the 1950s.  Under the South Africa Act there was a provision entrenching the right of Cape Coloured voters to be on the same voters roll as white voters.  The entrenchment was achieved by sections 63 and the proviso to section 152 of the South Africa Act which provided that the voting rights of Cape Coloured voters could only be removed by a two-thirds majority of both Houses of Parliament sitting together.  In furtherance of its racist ideology the Nationalist government decided to abolish this right.  Its attempt to do so was contested.  In <i>Harris v Minister of the Interior </i>1952 (2) 428 (AD) the issue came before the Appellate Division, as it was then known.  The court had in mind (at 431C) the clear distinction between what Parliament may do by legislation and what the constituent elements must do to legislate.  Ruling unanimously that the government's attempt to by-pass the entrenched provisions was invalid, Centlivres CJ speaking for the Appellate Division observed (at 464E-F):</p>
<p></p><ul>"A State can be unquestionably sovereign although it has no legislature which is completely sovereign.  As Bryce points out in his <i>Studies in History and Jurisprudence </i>(1901 ed, vol II, p 53) legal sovereignty may be divided between two authorities.  In the case of the Union, legal sovereignty is or may be divided between Parliament as ordinarily constituted and Parliament as constituted under section 63 and the proviso to section 152.  Such a division of legislative powers is no derogation from the sovereignty of the Union and the mere fact that that division was enacted in a British Statute (viz, the South Africa Act) which is still in force in the Union cannot affect the question in issue."<p></p></ul>
<p>Subsequently, a further attempt to elide the entrenched provisions by the charade of a High Court of Parliament was rejected in <i>Minister of the Interior v Harris </i>1952 (4) 769.  Although not strictly relevant to the matter under discussion the Nationalist government then achieved its objective by packing the Senate and the Appellate Division itself: <i>Collins v Minister of the Interior </i>1957  (1) 552 (AD).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85.&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision of the Privy Council in <i>Bribery Commissioner v Ranasinghe </i> [1965] AC 172 is also important.  It was an appeal from Ceylon.  An Act was passed but not in conformity with the constitutional legislative procedure.  Lord Pearce delivered the judgment of the Privy Council.  He observed, at pp197-198:</p>
<p></p><ul>"A legislature has no power to ignore the conditions of law-making that are imposed by the instrument which itself regulates its power to make law.  This restriction exists independently of the question whether the legislature is sovereign, as is the legislature of Ceylon, or whether the constitution is 'uncontrolled,' as the board [in <i>McCawley's</i> case [1920] AC 691] held the constitution of Queensland to be.  Such a constitution can, indeed, be altered or amended by the legislature, if the regulating instrument so provides and if the terms of those provisions are complied with: and the alteration or amendment may include the change or abolition of those very provisions.  But the proposition which is not acceptable is that a legislature, once established, has some inherent power derived from the mere fact of its establishment to make a valid law by the resolution of a bare majority which its own constituent instrument has said shall not be a valid law unless made by a different type of majority or by a different legislative process."<p></p></ul>
<p>This dictum is consistent with the analysis already explained.</p>
<i>
</i><p><i>IX.  A prima facie view.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliament Act 1911 spells out when it may be used and what must be done in order to legislate under it.  Parliament as ordinarily constituted enacted the 1911 Act.  Acting in accordance with the conditions appearing on the face of the 1911 Act Parliament as redefined in that Act for limited and specific purposes enacted the Parliament Act 1949.  <i>Prima facie </i>the Parliament Act 1949 is valid.</p>
<i></i><p><i>X.  The Alleged Limitation on the Use of the Parliament Act 1911.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Sydney submits, however, that the route of the procedure under the 1911 Act could not be used to secure an amendment of the 1911 Act.  He contends that this is so because of an express limitation on the use of the 1911 Act.  Although he eschews reliance on an implication, I suppose the argument could alternatively be based on a constructional implication.  If such a limitation on either basis is established, the effect would indeed be that the Parliament Act 1949 could not be used to enact the Hunting Act 2004.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88.&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is whether such a construction, express or implied, is permissible.  In my view there is no such limitation in the 1911 Act.  Sir Sydney emphasises the conditionality of the language of section 2(1) introduced by the word "If …".  That feature cannot, however, by itself support the suggested limitation.  The existence of express limitations in respect of Money Bills, the duration of Parliament, and Provisional Orders make it impossible to accommodate the further limitation suggested.  Mention of these three limitations by necessary implication excludes any other limitation.  Moreover, the duty placed on the Speaker under section 2(2) to certify that "the provisions of this section have been duly complied with" militates against a construction requiring the Speaker to act in accordance with unstated limitations.  The printed case for the League Against Cruel Sports brought out the force of this point (para 6(3)):</p>
<p></p><ul>"It would be very surprising were Parliament to have intended other than that 'the provisions' there referred to are those <i>expressly</i> stated in section 2(1) (as amended from time to time).  Parliament cannot have intended that the Speaker should ask himself whether there are <i>implicit</i> provisions relevant to the validity of legislation enacted under section 2(1).  His task is simply to identify whether the Act complied with the express words of section 2(1).  The 1949 Act did so comply: it amended the 1911 Act by following the procedure specified in section 2(1) of the 1911 Act.  Any obligation on the Speaker to consider other matters would introduce a degree of uncertainty into the operation of the Act that cannot have been intended."<p></p></ul>
<p>In my view the substantive provisions of the 1911 Act rule out the limitation contended for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Sydney also relies on the preamble of the 1911 Act.  He suggested that in the second preamble the legislature's use of the word "Parliament" denoted Parliament as ordinarily constituted.  It follows, he submitted, that any legislation to restrict the powers of the House of Lords would have to be passed by Parliament as ordinarily constituted.  In my view this contention is convincingly answered by the fact that in section 1(2), in the context of Money Bills, reference is made to "money provided by Parliament".  This contemplates money provided by Parliament in its reduced form.  Moreover, by section 2(1) itself, a Bill thereby enacted becomes "an Act of Parliament".  In any event, arguments based on the preamble cannot possibly prevail against the clear language of the substantive provisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, therefore, rule that the limitations put forward by Sir Sydney are not sustainable.</p>
<i>
</i><p><i>XII.  The conclusion of Maurice Kay LJ.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91.&nbsp;&nbsp;In a precise judgment Maurice Kay LJ in the Administrative Court summarised his central conclusion as follows ([2005] EWHC 94 (Admin), para 24):</p>
<p></p><ul>"In my judgment, the correct way to describe the 1911 Act is as a statute which redefined or remodelled the legislature in such a way that there were thenceforth two routes through which Acts of Parliament could be enacted - the traditional way involving the Sovereign, the House of Commons and the House of Lords and the 1911 Act way emanating from the Sovereign and the House of Commons provided that the conditions imposed by the 1911 Act are met."<p></p></ul>
<p>In a separate judgment Collins J expressed general agreement with the reasoning of Maurice Kay LJ.  And it is clear from his reasons that he specifically endorsed the passage from the judgment of Maurice Kay LJ which I have cited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Sydney did not accept this analysis.  It would have been near fatal to his case if he had done so.  Subject to what I have said about the proper construction of the provisions of the 1911 Act, I do not, however, detect a logical flaw in the reasoning of the Administrative Court.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would respectfully endorse this way of analysing the problem before the House.</p>
<i>
</i><p><i>XII.  Delegated legislation?</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Sydney had another string to his bow.  He relied on eminent legal scholars who described legislation under the 1911 Act as a species of delegated legislation.  If this is right, it would tend to support his submission that the 1949 Act may not be used to enact the Hunting Act 2004.  On the other hand, other eminent lawyers have taken the opposite view.  The 1911 Act does not use the language of delegated legislation.  It has none of the attributes or trappings of delegated legislation.  Functionally, there was no reason for Parliament as ordinarily constituted to force the Bill in question into the mould of delegated legislation.  In any event, in manner and form the 1911 Act simply provides for an alternative mode by which Parliament, as reconstituted for specific purposes, may make laws.  Constitutionally, it is an authentic and authoritative expression of the will of Parliament.  It is contrary to the very essence of this legislative objective of Parliament as ordinarily constituted to describe the 1949 Act as delegated legislation.  It is also wrong to describe Parliament as redefined as a subordinate legislature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not surprisingly, A V Dicey, our greatest constitutional lawyer, writing a few years after the events which led to enactment Parliament Act 1911 stated that the House of Lords "cannot prevent the House of Commons from, in effect, passing under the Parliament Act [1911] any change of the constitution, provided always that the requirements of the Parliament Act [1911] are complied with":  <i>The Law of the Constitution,</i> 8th ed (1915), p xliii.  I would respectfully follow Dicey on this point.  The method of enacting legislation authorised by Parliament, as ordinarily constituted, by section 2(1) of the 1911 Act was validly used in the 1949 Act to amend section 2(1) of the 1911 Act.</p>
<i></i><p><i>XIII.  The decisions of the Administrative Court and the Court of Appeal.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96.&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows that I am in agreement with the decision of the Administrative Court on the principal point.  The Court of Appeal approached the matter differently.  It held:</p>
<p></p><ul>"98&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reasons we have given we have accepted that there was power to amend the 1911 Act to the extent of the amendment contained in the 1949 Act.  We have not been prepared to go further than that.  This is because, to an extent, we have been prepared to accept part of the argument that Sir Sydney advanced so eloquently.  Once the 1911 Act had made the fundamental change of allowing the consent of the House of Lords to be dispensed with as long as the conditions in section 2(1) of the 1911 Act were complied with, the reduction of the period referred to in section 2(1) in its original form to those contained in the 1949 Act, was a relatively modest and straightforward amendment.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>99&nbsp;&nbsp;However, accepting a power of amendment of this nature exists is quite different to allowing the power of amendment to extend to making changes of a fundamentally different nature to the relationship between the House of Lords and the Commons from those which the 1911 Act had made.  The 1949 Act left the relationship between the House of Lords and the House of Commons substantially the same as it was before the 1949 Act.  It reduced the length of the period for which the House of Lords could delay legislation proposed by the Commons.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>100&nbsp;&nbsp;What, if any, further power of amending the 1911 Act that Act authorises should not be determined in advance of an attempt to make a more significant amendment than that contained in the 1949 Act.  It is, however, obvious that, on our approach, the greater the scale of the constitutional change proposed by any amendment, the more likely it is that it will fall outside the powers contained in the 1911 Act.  Our decision is limited to indicating that if what is involved is properly described as a modification of the 1911 Act it is legally effective.  We dismiss the appeal."<p></p></ul>
<p>This reasoning is not supported by either side.  In my view the distinction between modest and fundamental constitutional changes cannot be achieved by a process of interpretation of the statute.  In agreement with other members of the House I also cannot accept it.</p>
