<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75. In paragraph 20 the members are told that when the opening formalities are complete:</p>
<p></p><ul>"20.&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge advocate may then publicly warn the court not to talk to anyone else about the case for as long as it continues.  That includes family, friends, work associates, the prosecutor, defence counsel and, most importantly, the accused and anyone who may be a witness.  To that end, other than when the judge advocate is sitting alone, members are not to leave the court-room during the trial except to go to the lavatory, and for any overnight or luncheon adjournment;  and are not to associate with formation or unit personnel either professionally or socially until the trial is over.  Refreshments will be brought into the court-room as required.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"21.&nbsp;&nbsp;The president and members must not at any time, including when sitting alongside the judge advocate, look at papers lying on the desks of the judge advocate, prosecutor or defence counsel.  Such papers might include information which the court must not see under any circumstances."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76. Although it appeared to be doubtful from counsel's submissions whether the practice was uniform, paragraph 30 of the briefing notes, reflecting rule 62(2), envisages that the president and members of the court may only put questions to a witness through the judge advocate.  If at the end of the witness's evidence the member feels that he must know the answer to a particular question in order to decide the guilt or innocence of the accused, then he should pass it in writing to the judge advocate who can put it to the witness in the correct way.  In paragraph 33 the members are told that they must never take it upon themselves to visit the scene of the alleged crime before or during the trial.  If there is a need for such a visit the whole court, counsel and the accused will go to see the scene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77. In paragraph 35 (drawing on rule 69) the members are told that, following the addresses by counsel, the judge advocate will sum up the evidence and direct the other members of the court on the law relating to the case.  He will also summarise the main points of the evidence (paragraph 29).  The members are not to ask the judge advocate any questions during his summing up, but they can ask in writing for further directions which the judge advocate must give in open court.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78. Paragraph 36 (reflecting rule 70) deals with the members' deliberations on their verdict:</p>
<p></p><ul>"While the court is deliberating on the findings, no-one is to be present except the president, members and officers under instruction.  The president and members are not to separate until the finding has been reached, unless the judge advocate directs that in the interests of justice they may separateâ€¦.  If any person has to leave the court room for personal reasons, he must be told by the president not to speak to any person on any account, i e, on the telephone, by letter or any other means.  If the court wish to hear again evidence recorded by the VCR, the judge advocate must be told and, on his direction, the court must be reopened and the passage read in open court."<p></p></ul>
<p>Further guidance is given in paragraph 39:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The president will normally initiate the discussion on the issue of guilt or innocence.  The president should ensure that every court member present gives his opinion as to the finding on each charge separately, in ascending order of seniority commencing with the junior member.  A unanimous decision is preferable, but a majority of votes will decide the issue, and the finding of the majority will be recorded as the finding of the court.  The president should write down the finding(s) on the record of findings sheet and sign it.  Prior to reopening the court, the president should remind any members overruled by the majority that they must now adopt the finding of the court.  This is important if it becomes necessary to consider the sentence, as their personal feelings regarding guilt or innocence should not influence their decisions."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79. Paragraph 40 explains that, when the court is reopened and the judge advocate returns, he looks at the record to check that the findings are not contrary to law.  If he is so satisfied, the findings are announced.  If he is not so satisfied, then he gives the members further directions in open court.  The court will then be closed once more and the members of the court will have to reconsider its findings in the light of his directions (rule 72(3) and (4)).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80. Paragraph 25 explains what is to happen when sentence is being considered, either after a guilty plea or following conviction:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The court will close to deliberate on sentence.  No-one will be present save for the members (including, of course, the judge advocate) and any person under instruction.  The judge advocate will initiate discussion on the sentence and will inform the members about maximum punishments and the principles to be observed.  Sentence will be determined by a majority of votes if necessary and the opinions of the officer member will be given orally in ascending order of seniority, commencing with the junior member.  The judge advocate will decide where he votes in the order.  In the case of an equality of votes, the president has a second or casting vote which is exercisable once, i e, he has a final, determining vote.  When sentence has been decided, it is entered on the record of sentence which the judge advocate holds.  The president and judge advocate will sign that record."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81. Once the trial has been completed, whether with an acquittal or with conviction and sentence, the president announces that the trial is concluded and the judge advocate dissolves the court (paragraph 42).  Thereafter the court orderly is to be instructed to burn or shred all scrap paper (paragraph 45).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82. The various provisions which I have quoted from the briefing notes for the members of courts-martial reinforce significantly the message, proclaimed in any event by the oath and the directions of the judge advocate, that the members are to act independently and impartially.  In order to be seen to avoid local unit influences, the members are not to stay in public accommodation at the accused's unit.  They are not to speak to unit personnel and especially not to any officer who may be attending the trial - at the risk of being debarred from the trial or indeed of the trial being prejudiced.  They are not to associate either professionally or socially with such personnel until the trial is over.  There is a veto on the president briefing the other members of the court in the absence of the judge advocate.  The members are to tell the court administration officer if they know something about the accused which could prejudice their impartiality or if they know someone who might be a witness in the case.  The members are warned not to talk to anyone else about the case as long as it continues.  They are not to look at any papers which are before the judge advocate, prosecutor or defence counsel, for fear of seeing something which they ought not to.  When they deliberate on conviction or sentence, the most junior member is to give his opinion orally first - again, obviously, with the aim of ensuring that the junior members express their own personal view, uninfluenced by the more senior members.  In terms of the members' oath their deliberations are to be kept secret and this secrecy is further ensured by the instruction to the court orderly at the end of the proceedings to burn or shred all scrap paper.  Again, the object is to prevent the members feeling, or coming under, any outside pressure during or after the trial by reason of their participation in the decision in the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83. Lord Thomas did not suggest that these were other than genuine instructions to the members which they were intended to observe.  Nor was it suggested that the instructions were in practice ignored or that they had been ignored in these particular cases.  But if they are indeed observed, I find it hard, if not impossible, to see how anyone either in the court or, more particularly, outside the court could improperly influence the members' decision either on conviction or on sentence.  Certainly, it is hard to see what more could be done to ensure that, while sitting in the court-martial, the officers act not as officers subject to command but as independent and impartial members of the court, reaching the verdict and determining the sentence according to law but according also to their own individual conscience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84. Of course, the members of a court-martial are not just an ordinary jury.  The difference shows itself in at least two different respects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85. First, the routines, the periods of boredom and the pleasures, pains and pressures of Service life would be unknown to most jurors today, although they would have been familiar to many of their fathers and grandfathers.  By contrast, members of a court-martial know all about them and about the society in which the accused lives and works.  Lord Thomas suggested that officers on a court-martial, imbued by their training with notions of rank and discipline, would always tend to believe the evidence of a fellow officer or a non-commissioned officer rather than the evidence of a private.  By contrast, he said, members of a jury, who carried no such burden of preconceptions, would be able to see more clearly and judge purely on the evidence before them.  Of course, this submission was really just a matter of assertion.  There was, and could be, no evidence to back it up.  Indeed, it was somewhat undermined by the conviction of the appellants, Lance Sergeant Spear and Lance Sergeant Hastie in <i>R v Spear</i>.  Their conviction was based on the evidence of Guardsman Lane and Guardsman Bright.  In accepting the guardsmen's evidence, the court-martial must have disbelieved the evidence of their superiors in rank, the two sergeants.  In any event, it is possible to fashion an argument - equally a matter of assertion - that officers who are familiar with Service life and who are in close contact with Service personnel of all ranks may well be less impressed by mere rank and better able to gauge the underlying realities than jurors confronted for the first time with officers or non-commissioned officers telling an apparently plausible tale.  Viewed in this light, the specialised knowledge and experience of the members of a court-martial could be seen as a positive advantage rather than as a disadvantage.  However that may be, I see no reason to think that, when duly directed by the judge advocate, officers on a court-martial cannot properly assess the evidence and return a true verdict based on it.  I therefore reject the appellants' argument on this point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86. The members of a court-martial perform a role in deciding sentence which is no part of a jury's function in the United Kingdom.  I accept that, in determining sentence, the members will indeed have regard to such issues as the impact of the offence on Service morale and discipline.  They will, inevitably, be more aware of these effects than a civil judge would be.  Therefore, while the safeguards of the independence and impartiality of the members should mean that they approach their verdict in much the same way as jurors in a civil trial, it cannot be assumed that, when passing sentence, the court-martial will necessarily give exactly the same weight to these Service factors as would a Crown Court judge.  The sentences which a court-martial passes may therefore not coincide exactly with the sentences which a civil judge would pass on the same facts.  In my view that does not call the decisions of the courts-martial into question, either generally or in terms of article 6.  Any difference in sentencing does not mean that the members are not independent or impartial, but merely that, though both independent and impartial, they may assess the various factors differently.  Even in the civil system it is recognised that judges or magistrates may use their knowledge of local conditions, such as the prevalence of a particular crime in a given area, in determining sentence.  Similarly, in the sphere of professional discipline the courts acknowledge that a tribunal made up of senior members of the profession will have advantages in determining the appropriate penalty.  It could not be suggested that, for this reason alone, in these cases the judge, magistrates or tribunal members are lacking in independence or impartiality.  There is no more reason to accept such a suggestion in the case of the members of courts-martial.  There are, besides, two additional points to bear in mind.  The first is that the judge advocate advises the other members on sentence and also has a vote on sentence.  He will be able to bring to bear his informed view as a lawyer on what sentence would be suitable.  The second safeguard is that any sentence imposed by the court-martial is subject not only to review by the reviewing authority but also to appeal, on the ground that it is not appropriate, with the leave of the Appeal Court.  The members of the Appeal Court are civil judges and are in a position to correct any inappropriate punishment that the court-martial may impose by reason of the members' military background.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87. All these matters must be kept in mind when considering the particular characteristics of the members of the court-martial to which the European Court attached importance in <i>Morris v United Kingdom </i>34 EHRR 1253.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88. The first was that the officer members had no legal training.  That applies also in the present cases and indeed must apply in virtually all cases.  As the briefing notes show, officers who may be called upon to sit on courts-martial are given some training by being allowed to sit and observe proceedings, including the members' deliberations.  This should mean that, when they are eventually asked to sit, they should not find the procedures wholly unknown or strange, but it goes no further than that.  While in <i>Morris v United Kingdom</i> the Third Chamber seem to have regarded the lack of formal legal training as a significant defect, as I have already noted, in <i>Engel v The Netherlands</i> <i>(No 1)</i> 1 EHRR 647 the European Court held that the Dutch Supreme Military Court was an independent and impartial tribunal, even though four of the six members were military officers with no legal training.  Given the other safeguards which were in place in the present cases, I see no reason to conclude that the absence of legal training undermined the members' independence and impartiality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89. The European Court attached importance to the fact that the officers, other than the permanent president, remained subject to Army discipline and reports.  In so far as the members of the courts-martial in the present cases also remained subject to Service discipline, they simply shared the characteristic of all serving members of the armed forces.  It must have been equally true of the military members of the Dutch Supreme Military Court in <i>Engel v The Netherlands</i>.  Moreover, the fuller information available to the House about the safeguards in place to protect the independence of the members of courts-martial shows clearly, in my view, that, just like the Dutch officers in the <i>Engel </i>case, the officers in these cases would not have been under the command of any higher authority in their function as members of the courts-martial.  Indeed, as Mr Havers pointed out, contrary to the assumption of the European Court, there was even a formal legal bar to any superior officer trying to influence their decision, since this would have constituted the criminal offence of attempting to pervert the course of justice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90. It is true, of course, that, as in <i>Morris v United Kingdom</i>, so also in these cases, leaving aside the permanent presidents, the officers sitting on the courts-martial would have remained subject to reports.  Lord Thomas indeed drew attention to a number of such reports where mention is made of the fact that, during the year in question, the officer concerned had sat as a member of a court-martial.  In itself that must be unobjectionable since the information that the particular officer has had this experience may be relevant at some future date if, for instance, consideration is being given to appointing a permanent president.  What would be objectionable would be any report which made reference, whether favourable or unfavourable, to an officer's decisions when sitting on a court-martial.  But Lord Thomas could point to no report where this had been done.  The only report which referred to an officer's performance in relation to a court-martial was one relating to Flight Lieutenant Hudson:  "Her foray into the court-martial arena has brought particular accolades for her thoughtful and incisive contribution to the legal process".  The report showed that Flight Lieutenant Hudson had acted not only as junior member on several courts-martial but also as assistant defending officer to an airman tried by a general court-martial.  It appears that the comment may well have related to this second role.  In any event the report makes no comment on any decision reached by Flight Lieutenant Hudson when sitting as a member of a court-martial.  Indeed counsel for the respondents showed the House a number of statements from officers concerned with personnel matters who had read thousands of annual reports and had never seen mention of such a thing.  That being so, again with the benefit of this more detailed information, I would not share the view of the European Court in <i>Morris v United Kingdom</i> that the independence and impartiality of officers sitting on courts-martial are compromised by the fact that they remain subject to the system of annual reports.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91. For all these reasons I consider that those charged with administering the system of courts-martial have been at pains to put in place a series of practical safeguards which are designed to secure the independence and impartiality of those sitting on these courts.  Nor is this surprising.  There is not a little force in the point made by the Appeal Court in <i>R v Saunby</i>, para 44 that, if Service factors are to be seen as an aspect or function of the public interest, they will themselves require that the court-martial process should be, and should be seen to be, fair and impartial and, so far as possible, to achieve accurate results.  Otherwise both servicemen and the public would lose confidence in it, with consequential effects on good order and discipline.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92. Having regard in particular to the additional information which was not before the European Court, I would therefore hold that the safeguards built into the system are indeed such that no fair-minded and informed observer who had considered them would conclude that there was a real possibility that the courts-martial in these cases lacked independence or impartiality in this respect.  In other words they were, objectively, independent and impartial.  I would accordingly reject the article 6 challenge based on the role of the officer members.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93. In <i>Morris v United Kingdom</i> (2002) 34 EHRR 1253, 1278-1279, paras 73-77 the European Court went further, however, and held that the role played by the reviewing authority was in itself a reason for saying that the court-martial in that case had not been an independent and impartial tribunal:</p>
<p></p><ul>"73.&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to the applicant's complaints about the role played by the 'reviewing authority', the court recalls that the power to give a binding decision which may not be altered by a non-judicial authority is inherent in the very notion of 'tribunal'.  The principle can also be seen as a component of the 'independence' required by article 6(1).  In <i>[Findlay v United Kingdom</i> 24 EHRR 221], the role played by the 'confirming officer' under the pre-1966 Act court-martial system was found to be contrary to this well-established principle.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"74.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, the applicant's sentence and conviction were subject, under changes introduced by the 1996 Act, to automatic review by the 'reviewing authority'.  The court notes that the authority was empowered to quash the applicant's conviction and the sentence imposed by the court-martial.  More importantly, it had powers to reach any finding of guilt which could have been reached by the court martial and to substitute any sentence which would have been open to the court-martial, not being in the authority's opinion more serious than that originally passed.  Any substituted verdict or sentence was treated as if it had been reached or imposed by the court-martial itself.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"75.&nbsp;&nbsp;The court considers that the very fact that the review was conducted by such a non-judicial authority as the 'reviewing authority' is contrary to the principle cited at paragraph 73 above.  The court is particularly concerned by the fact that the decision whether any substituted sentence was more or less severe than that imposed by the court-martial would have been left to the discretion of that authority.  The court's concerns are not answered by the Government's argument that the existence of the review serves the interests of convicted soldiers such as the applicant, nor by the essentially fair procedure followed by the authority when conducting its review.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"76.&nbsp;&nbsp;The court is of the view that the fundamental flaws which it has identified were not corrected by the applicant's subsequent appeal to the Courts Martial Appeal Court, since that appeal did not involve any rehearing of the applicant's case but rather determined, in the form of a decision which ran effectively to two sentences, that leave to appeal against conviction and sentence should be refused.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"77.&nbsp;&nbsp;For all these reasons, the court considers that the applicant's misgivings about the independence of the court-martial and its status as a 'tribunal' were objectively justified."<p></p></ul>
<p>Although Lord Thomas referred the House to this aspect of the Court's decision in <i>Morris v United Kingdom</i> and submitted that it, too, would constitute a basis for allowing the appeal, he said, frankly, that he had difficulty in supporting the reasoning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94. The reviewing authority is, admittedly, an unusual institution.  It does not operate like an ordinary court and, at a certain level of abstract theory, its existence could seem to be inconsistent with the charge against an accused being determined by only a system of "tribunals".  That appears to be the way in which the European Court has treated it.  But if, as the court indicates, the issue can also be characterised as relating to the independence of the court-martial, I find it difficult to see how the existence of this body affects that independence.  It might, of course, be different if there were any suggestion that the decisions of the courts-martial were influenced by the existence of the reviewing authority, for example, because they tended to convict more readily or to impose heavier sentences in the knowledge that the reviewing authority could always quash them.  But Lord Thomas made no such submission and there is nothing whatever in the information before the House that would support it.  On the contrary, Lord Thomas accepted that the provision for review could only be to the benefit, and not to the detriment, of someone who had been convicted.  In particular, it could provide a quick and simple means of correcting a mistaken decision by a court-martial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95. The reviewing authority is a creation of the 1996 Act to replace the role of the confirming officer and of the reviewing authorities to whom a convicted person could formerly present a petition.  The procedure adopted by the new reviewing authority is more transparent:  the convicted person is informed of the advice of the judge advocate and is given not only the decision of the reviewing authority but the reasons for it (rule 83).  Moreover, the powers of review are particularised in the statute and, unlike the position before 1997, the convicted person can appeal against sentence.  Formerly, he could appeal only against conviction, with the result that the final say on sentence lay with a non-judicial body which did not give reasons for its decisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96. In reaching its conclusion on this point the European Court was particularly concerned by the fact that the decision as to whether any substituted sentence was more or less severe than that imposed by the court-martial would have been left to the discretion of the reviewing authority.  When making this observation the court does not appear to have been  referred to, or to have had in mind, the coda to section 71(1) of the Acts which establishes, as a matter of law, the relative positions of particular punishments in the hierarchy of punishments set out in the subsection and which deals specifically with how detention and imprisonment are to relate to one another.  Particularly when these provisions are taken into account, it is hard to see how, in reality, there is likely to be any scope for the reviewing authority to exercise the kind of discretion that appears to have troubled the European Court.  In truth, counsel could refer to no case where any problem as to the relative severity of two punishments had arisen.  If, by chance, however, the reviewing authority were to go wrong on the point, the person affected could ask the Appeal Court for leave to appeal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97. In all the cases under appeal except that of Dodds, the reviewing authority did not intervene, but the appellants were granted leave to appeal to the Appeal Court.  Where they had other arguable grounds of appeal relating to conviction or sentence, the Appeal Court dealt with them, as well as with the article 6 grounds, in their reasoned judgments.  In these circumstances I am, with due respect to the decision of the European Court in <i>Morris v United Kingdom </i>34 EHRR 1253, unable to see why the mere existence of the reviewing authority, or the reduction of Dodds' period of detention, should lead to the conclusion that the determination of the charges against the appellants was not reached by a "tribunal" that was "independent and impartial" for the purposes of article 6.  I would therefore reject the appellants' article 6 argument based on the role of the reviewing authority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98. Lord Thomas originally presented a separate argument to the effect that the decisions of the prosecuting authority to prosecute the appellants before a court-martial were themselves an infringement of the appellants' article 6 rights.  In their judgment in <i>R v Saunby</i> paras 34-37, the Appeal Court rejected that argument and accepted the respondents' opposing argument that such decisions by a prosecutor lie outside the scope of article 6(1).  Before the House Lord Thomas modified the appellants' contention and argued that the infringement of article 6 arose out of the congruence of unfair factors influencing the decision to prosecute and unfair factors influencing the court-martial's decisions on conviction and sentence.  He therefore accepted that he could not succeed on the prosecution point unless he succeeded in persuading the House that the courts-martial had not themselves been independent and impartial - in which event, of course, on his own submission, the appeals would have to be allowed anyway.  On that approach any point relating to the decision to prosecute was subsumed in the issue relating to the fairness of the court-martial proceedings.  That being so, since I have found that the court-martial proceedings did not infringe the appellants' article 6 rights, I would also reject the appellants' article 6 argument relating to the decisions to prosecute them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99. In these circumstances it is unnecessary to consider in these appeals to what extent article 6 applies to the decision to prosecute.  In this connection Mr Havers drew the attention of the House to certain passages in the opinions in <i>Montgomery v HM Advocate</i> [2001] 2 WLR 779, but any consideration of the point would need to take account also of what was said in <i>Brown v Stott</i> [2001] 2 WLR 817 and <i>Millar v Dickson</i> [2002] 1 WLR 1615.  I would wish to reserve my opinion on the point.  Certain remarks of the Appeal Court in <i>R v Saunby </i>, when dealing with it in paragraph 36 of their judgment, might be open to the interpretation that fairness, independence and impartiality were more readily to be expected of courts than of prosecutors for whom the sufficiency of the evidence and the public interest would be the guiding values.  An unduly narrow approach of that kind to what is expected of a prosecutor would not, however, sit easily with the familiar requirement that he should act fairly and as "a minister of justice":  <i>Randall v The Queen</i> [2002] UKPC 19, para 10, per Lord Bingham of Cornhill citing <i>Boucher v The Queen</i> (1954) 110 Can CC 263, 270 per Rand J.  In reserving my opinion on the merits of the argument as to the scope of article 6, I would therefore not wish to be thought to have silently endorsed the observations of the Appeal Court in this regard.</p>
