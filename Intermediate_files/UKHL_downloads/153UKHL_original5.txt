<p class="para">95.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>R (Razgar) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </i>[2004] 2 AC 368, 383, para 9, commenting on the reference in <i>Pretty </i>to the right to “personal development” and to establish relationships,<i> </i>my noble and learned friend, Lord Bingham of Cornhill, spoke of “private life” in article 8 “extending to those features which are integral to a person’s identity or ability to function socially as a person.”</p>
<p class="para">96.&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the appellants, as the Divisional Court found, at para 135, are people for whom “hunting is a core part of their lives and perhaps has been a core part of the community in which they have lived all their lives.” For them at least, should hunting be regarded as integral to their identity and so as part of their “private life” for purposes of their article 8(1) Convention right?</p>
<p class="para">97.&nbsp;&nbsp;It happens to be hunting that lies at the core of their lives. For other people some completely different interest or activity fills that place. When pursuing that interest or activity, they really “come alive". It is crucial to their sense of their own identity. Some will be fortunate enough to find this kind of fulfilment in their job, but others will pursue it in their leisure hours. They may even choose an undemanding job in order to have more time and energy to devote to, say, playing a musical instrument or singing. Mountaineering, too, has many devotees. But talents and interests come in many different forms. For example, Michael Ventris was an architect by profession, but the animating obsession of his life was his “hobby” of using his linguistic and puzzle-solving skills to decipher Linear B. It shaped who he was and how he felt he had to live his life.</p>
<p class="para">98.&nbsp;&nbsp;The activities which I have mentioned are simply examples of “features which are integral to a person’s identity", of ways in which people give expression to their individuality - in which you can see what really makes them tick. For many people the right to express themselves in these ways may be of far more practical importance than, for instance, the right to express some aspect of their sexual identity. It would be strange indeed if such activities were not regarded as part of an individual’s private life and worthy of respect in terms of article 8(1), when they are central to the individuals’ lives and often determine how they relate to their families, their friends and the outside world. Could Parliament really ban an activity such as mountaineering without infringing its devotees’ article 8(1) rights?</p>
<p class="para">99.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes the individuals can pursue the activity by themselves in their own home. But many activities involve other people. An amateur violinist may find the best outlet for her talents in playing in an amateur string quartet, the singer in being a member of a choir. These occasions may also be the ideal setting for forming relationships with congenial companions. While that may be an additional reason for saying that the activities form part of the individuals’ private life for purposes of article 8(1), the position of the pianist who plays by herself is surely equally deserving of respect. Indeed, for that very reason, it seems to me, article 11 can add nothing for present purposes.</p>
<p class="para">100.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, some solo activities may be hard to conduct in private. An organist in his organ loft, for example, may well find it difficult to practise without being heard by casual visitors to the church or hall. A skilled and dedicated ice skater will often have to share the rink with others who are just out for a bit of fun. That can't be helped and is really irrelevant. Even though other people are present, when pursuing their passion, the organist and skater may well be “in a world of their own", “dans un monde à part". All they ask is to be left alone to get on with it.</p>
<p class="para">101.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, in choosing these examples of people who give expression to their personality in different ways and arguing that article 8(1) is engaged in those circumstances, I have taken my cue from the idea that article 8(1) protects those features of a person’s life which are integral to his identity. For those for whom it is a core part of their lives, hunting, too, can be said to be integral to their identity. Therefore, but for one point, to which I shall return shortly, I would have held that the legislation banning hunting did interfere with their private life for purposes of article 8(1).</p>
<p class="para">102.&nbsp;&nbsp;Confining the protection of article 8(1) to those for whom an activity is a core part of their lives may be to set the bar too high, however. The landmark decision of the European Court in <i>von Hannover v Germany </i>(2004) 40 EHRR 1, which was not cited by counsel, suggests that the scope of the protection afforded by article 8(1) is considerably wider.</p>
<p class="para">103.&nbsp;&nbsp;The applicant,<i> </i>Princess Caroline of Monaco, complained that her right to the protection of her private life had been violated by the publication of pictures of her in various German magazines. As the Court explained, 40 EHRR 1, 23, para 49, the pictures showed her, for instance, on horseback, leaving her Paris home on her own, shopping on her own, alone on a bicycle, with her bodyguard at a market, dining in a restaurant with a male actor, and playing tennis with Prince Ernst August von Hannover. According to the Court, at p 26, para 61, the photographs showed her “in scenes from her daily life, thus involving activities of a purely private nature.” The Court held, at p 24, para 53, that “there is no doubt that the publication by various German magazines of photos of the applicant in her daily life either on her own or with other people falls within the scope of her private life.” The Court went on to hold, at p 29, para 80, that German law had not afforded sufficient protection for the applicant’s private life and that there had been a breach of article 8.</p>
<p class="para">104.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the <i>von Hannover </i>case concerned a claim to privacy, to being free from press intrusion. By contrast, the appellants claim a right to be free to hunt without the arbitrary interference of the legislature. But both claims are based on the same essential right to respect for, and protection of, private life in article 8(1). In <i>von Hannover</i>, 40 EHRR 1, 23, para 50, the Court confirmed its jurisprudence that</p>
<p class="qt">“the guarantee afforded by article 8 of the Convention is primarily intended to ensure the development, without outside interference, of the personality of each individual in his relations with other human beings…. There is therefore a zone of interaction of a person with others, even in a public context, which may fall within the scope of ‘private life'.”</p>
<p class="paraleft">Similarly, at p 27, para 69, the Court reiterated:</p>
<p class="qt">“the fundamental importance of protecting private life from the point of view of the development of every human being’s personality. That protection - as stated above - extends beyond the private family circle, and also includes a social dimension.”</p>
<p class="para">105.&nbsp;&nbsp;If, as the European Court held, article 8(1) was engaged so as to give Princess Caroline a prima facie right to protection from the press publishing pictures of her when she was out riding on horseback, or riding a bicycle, or playing tennis or going to the market, then surely the article would have been equally engaged if the legislature had passed a law banning her from pursuing any of these activities? If publishing photographs of her doing these various things was liable to interfere with the “flowering” (épanouissement) of her personality (para 69 in the original French text), a law banning her from riding her horse or her bicycle or from playing tennis or going to the market would constitute an immeasurably greater interference.</p>
<p class="para">106.&nbsp;&nbsp;Princess Caroline wanted to enjoy personal autonomy. Less grandly, she was claiming - and successfully claiming - a right to be herself, to go about in the world, free from the attentions of the paparazzi. Similarly, the appellants say, when they are out on horseback following the hounds, they too have a right under article 8(1) to be themselves, to go about in the world, free from the arbitrary interference of the legislature. Again, but for one aspect of their situation, I would have accepted that contention.</p>
<p class="para">107.&nbsp;&nbsp;Princess Caroline succeeded in her claim for protection for her private life because she was riding or cycling or playing tennis simply for her own enjoyment - for the development of her personality, to put it in formal terms. So, even though she was doing these things “in a public context", they fell within the scope of her “private life": <i>von Hannover</i>, 40 EHRR 1, 23, para 50. In my view, the position would have been different if, say, she and her tennis partner had taken part in a charity tennis tournament where spectators would come to watch them. Even if taking part had given them great pleasure, they would no longer have been doing it for their own fulfilment alone. They would have stepped outside the sphere of their private life in order to pursue a public purpose. The mere fact that a diva may develop her personality singing at Covent Garden does not mean that singing there is part of her private life.  On the contrary, she is putting on a performance for the public - and getting well paid for it. Similarly, at a humbler level, if the amateur choir were giving a concert, or the organist were playing for the pleasure of those in the hall or church, or the skater were performing for the spectators at the rink, in my view the individuals would no longer simply be pursuing the development of their personality. They would have left the sphere in which they would be entitled to the protection of article 8.</p>
<p class="para">108.&nbsp;&nbsp;In giving the judgment of the Second Division in <i>Adams v Scottish Ministers </i>2004 SC 665, 680, para 66, the Lord Justice Clerk listed a number of aspects which, in the court’s view, prevented foxhunting from being part of the private life of the participants. I need only mention his comment that “When followers are taken into account, the hunt takes on the character of a spectator sport. It is also a public spectacle.” Lord Bingham similarly comments, at para 15, that foxhunting “is carried out in daylight with considerable colour and noise, often attracting the attention of onlookers attracted by the spectacle.” These descriptions of hunting reflect the reality. They also explain why there are countless paintings and prints of hunts and, in part at least, why many people, who have never themselves taken part in hunting, feel that any ban tends to impoverish our national life. The huntsmen and women are taking part in what they know is not just a private activity, but a much admired public spectacle. I therefore conclude that they are not entitled to the protection for their private life in article 8(1).</p>
<p class="para">109.&nbsp;&nbsp;For that reason alone, I have come to the view that, whether on a narrower or broader view of the scope of article 8(1), the appellants’ Convention right is not engaged.</p>
<p class="lawlord">BARONESS HALE OF RICHMOND</p>
<p class="mylords">My Lords,</p>
<p class="para">110.&nbsp;&nbsp;"The spirit of liberty is that spirit which is not too sure that it is right; the spirit of liberty is that spirit which seeks to understand the minds of other men and women; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which weighs their interests alongside its own without bias;...” (Learned Hand, ‘The spirit of liberty', in <i>The Spirit of Liberty</i>, <i>Papers and Addresses of Learned Hand</i>, edited by Irving Dilliard, 3rd ed, 1960, p 190). That, it seems to me, is the spirit in which to approach the issues in this case, and particularly those upon which your lordships are not all of exactly the same mind. There are some large questions of principle here which go way beyond the specific question of banning hunting with hounds.</p>
<p class="para">111.&nbsp;&nbsp;When does the freedom to do as one pleases become a human right? How broadly should we construe the scope of the rights and fundamental freedoms guaranteed to us all in the European Convention on Human Rights? How strictly should we approach the justifications for restricting those rights? In my view there is no human right to be left alone to do as one likes; the Convention has defined some specific rights which can only be interfered with in specified circumstances; there is a good deal of flexibility and room for development on both sides of the scales; but the more broadly one construes the right, the greater the latitude one must allow the democratically elected legislature to strike the balance between the interests of those who wish to pursue a particular activity and the interests of those who wish to prevent them.</p>
<p class="para">112.&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a free country, i'n'it?” So say we all if we object to being told what we may or may not do. And so it is. But until the Human Rights Act 1998 came into force, all this meant was that we could do what we liked as long as there was no law forbidding or preventing us. We may have had a national antipathy to regulation. Many of us may agree with John Stuart Mill that “The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant.” (<i>On Liberty</i>, 1859, Penguin 1974, p 68). But many others might take a different view on a particular issue, and if that view prevailed in Parliament, then it became the law and the courts would have to enforce it.</p>
<p class="para">113.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Human Rights Act 1998 has for the first time (outside the particular territory of European Community law, of which more anon) given us all rights against the state. Public authorities and officials must not act incompatibly with our Convention rights: s 6(1). If Parliament makes laws which might be incompatible with our Convention rights, the courts and others applying those laws must, so far as possible, read and give effect to them in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights: s 3(1). If Parliament makes a law which cannot be read compatibly with the Convention rights, the courts and others must still give effect to it, but the higher courts may declare that it is incompatible: that is what we are being asked to do in this case: s 4. Such declarations have proved powerful incentives to Government and Parliament to put the matter right; for if the court is right, the United Kingdom is in breach of its international obligations in maintaining such a law on the statute book.</p>
<p class="para">114.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is all elementary now. But it is worth repeating because the purpose of such human rights instruments is to place some limits upon what a democratically elected Parliament may do: to protect the rights and freedoms of individuals and minorities against the will of those who are taken to represent the majority. Democracy is the will of the people, but the people may not will to invade those rights and freedoms which are fundamental to democracy itself. To qualify as such a fundamental right, a freedom must be something more than the freedom to do as we please, whether alone or in company with others.</p>
<p class="para">115.&nbsp;&nbsp;The right to respect for our private and family life, our homes and our correspondence, guaranteed by article 8, is the right most capable of being expanded to cover everything that anyone might want to do. My noble and learned friend, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, has made a powerful case for article 8 to include almost any activity which is taken sufficiently seriously by the people who engage in it. If any of us were in any doubt about how seriously and deeply some members of the hunting community take their sport, those doubts were dispelled by the eloquence and obvious sincerity of Mr Friend, who appeared as a litigant in person in the related case of<i> Whaley v Lord Advocate</i> [2007] UKHL 53). Many hunt supporters would no doubt share of their sport Bill Shankly’s view of the importance of association football.</p>
<p class="para">116.&nbsp;&nbsp;As yet, however, as my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill has shown, the Strasbourg jurisprudence has not gone so far in its interpretation of the rights protected by article 8; and for the reasons given above, I am not sure that I share the desire of my noble and learned friend Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood that it should. Article 8, it seems to me, reflects two separate but related fundamental values. One is the inviolability of the home and personal communications from official snooping, entry and interference without a very good reason. It protects a private space, whether in a building, or through the post, the telephone lines, the airwaves or the ether, within which people can both be themselves and communicate privately with one another. The other is the inviolability of a different kind of space, the personal and psychological space within which each individual develops his or her own sense of self and relationships with other people. This is fundamentally what families are for and why democracies value family life so highly. Families are subversive. They nurture individuality and difference. One of the first things a totalitarian regime tries to do is to distance the young from the individuality of their own families and indoctrinate them in the dominant view. Article 8 protects the private space, both physical and psychological, within which individuals can develop and relate to others around them. But that falls some way short of protecting everything they might want to do even in that private space; and it certainly does not protect things that they can <i>only</i> do by leaving it and engaging in a very public gathering and activity.</p>
<p class="para">117.&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 11, on the other hand, is very much concerned to protect such gatherings. It is about people getting together, whether in public or in private, in pursuit of a common aim. Why then should it not protect the right of hunting people not only to get together but also to pursue their sport together? It is not enough, it seems to me, to draw a distinction between the activity and the gathering and to say that the one may be banned but the other may not without a good reason. Article 11expressly protects the right of a person “to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests". That must protect, not only the existence of trade unions, and political parties and pressure groups, but also some of the things they do. </p>
<p class="para">118.&nbsp;&nbsp;One answer could be that article 11 should be read along with article 10. Article 9 protects freedom of thought, conscience and religion. It also expressly protects the right to manifest that religion or belief, “either alone or in community with others and in public or in private". Article 10 protects freedom of expression, the freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas. But it does not expressly protect the right to meet or associate with other people in order to do this. This, it might be said, is separately provided for in article 11. It protects the freedom to meet and band together with others in order to share information and ideas and to give voice to them collectively. While democracy values each individual, it also knows that individuals cannot get much done unless they band together. These articles, then, are designed to protect the freedom to share and express opinions, and to try to persuade others to one’s point of view, which are essential political freedoms in any democracy. On this view, the right of the hunt and its followers to gather together publicly to demonstrate in favour of their sport and against the ban, perhaps even by riding over the countryside to demonstrate what they do, is protected by article 11. But the right to chase and kill the fox or the stag or the mink or the hare is not.</p>
<p class="para">119.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am attracted by this view of the relationship between articles 10 and 11 because it seems to me to be consistent with the democratic values underlying this whole group of articles. It is consistent with the observation quoted by Lord Bingham in para 17 above from the case of <i>Chassagnou v France</i> (1999) 29 EHRR 615. However, that case, in protecting the freedom of those who did <i>not</i> want to join a hunting association, might be thought conversely to protect the freedom of those who <i>did</i>. But the essence of the case was a discriminatory interference with the rights of landowners to control the use of their own property, not to stop them from doing something on it which they wanted to do, but to oblige them to do on it something which they did not wish to do. It would probably be unwise to draw too many conclusions from it about the scope of the collective activities protected by article 11. I therefore incline to the view that the ban on hunting with hounds does not engage article 11 at all.</p>
<p class="para">120.&nbsp;&nbsp;If it be the case that the rights protected by article 8 or article 11 are not engaged by the ban, then there is no need to address the particular qualifications to those rights laid down in article 8.2 and article 11.2. Each follows the familiar pattern: the interference with or restriction of the right must be in accordance with or prescribed by law, as this undoubtedly is following the decision of this House in <i>R (Jackson) v Attorney General </i>[2005] UKHL 56, [2006] 1 AC 262; it must pursue one of the legitimate aims listed; and it must be “necessary in a democratic society", that is, it must meet a pressing social need and be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. The aims listed in article 8.2 are “in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others". The aims listed in article 11.2 are identical, except that “the economic well-being of the country” is not included.</p>
<p class="para">121.&nbsp;&nbsp;As Lord Brown points out, these requirements are much stricter and more precise than the “public interest” or “general interest” justifications required by article 1 of Protocol No 1. This reinforces my view of the scope of articles 8 and 11. They are indeed flexible and capable of development as thinking within the Council of Europe also grows and develops. In difficult or borderline cases, there is much to be said for taking a broad view of the scope of the right and requiring the state to justify its interference. But the qualifications in articles 8.2 and 11.2 were drafted in the light of the understanding of the scope of the rights as they were originally drafted. If a right is expanded beyond its original scope it may be necessary also to expand the scope of the qualifications - both as to the meaning of the legitimate aims and as to the requirement that the interference be “necessary in a democratic society". Otherwise it may become difficult to strike a fair balance between the rights of individuals and groups on the one hand and the democratic decisions of the majority on the other.</p>
<p class="para">122.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunting might be a case in point. The most plausible of the legitimate aims listed in articles 8 and 11 is the protection of morals (although there is a certain amount of disorder and crime associated with some of the activities covered by the Act, it is certainly not common to them all). The protection of morals is a difficult and controversial aim, especially when the aim is to protect the morals of the person whose rights are being interfered with (it is less difficult if the aim is to protect the morals of other people). What right have I to thrust my views of morality down the throats of others? Some people take the view that it is wrong to cause an animal any suffering at all. For them the fact that the human race is omnivorous and has always killed animals for food does not justify its going on doing so. Nor would some people accept that animals might be killed for other purposes, such as clothing or shoes. Others might accept that rearing and killing animals humanely for such practical purposes was not immoral. They might also accept the morality of humane pest control. But they might draw the line at methods of pest control which caused more suffering than others. They might also draw the line at causing any sort of suffering for sport rather than for the practical benefits it could bring.</p>
<p class="para">123.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is not suggested that hunting degrades or corrupts the hunters. It is not suggested that they get sadistic pleasure out of causing the quarry to suffer. It cannot be compared with bear-baiting or cock-fighting. The pleasure they get is from the excitement and unpredictability of the chase, the challenge to the horsemanship of the riders, the spectacle for the followers, or in hare coursing gambling on the performance of the dogs. Fox, mink and stag hunters are also contributing, albeit in a comparatively small way, to the control of an undoubted pest. What they are doing is useful to the whole community. They can also plausibly say, as Mr Friend has said, that at the end of the hunt the fox is either dead or free: not wounded or lost.</p>
<p class="para">124.&nbsp;&nbsp;I say all this, not to take sides in the debate which so exercised the members of both Houses of Parliament, but to sympathise with Mr Friend’s difficulty in understanding how the ban could be said to be “necessary in a democratic society” or in pursuit of any of the listed aims. My answer to him would be that when the Convention was written it would not have crossed anyone’s mind that there might be a prima facie right to hunt wild animals with dogs. If the Convention has to be expanded to encompass such a right, then the qualifications have to be expanded too. The concept of what may be “necessary in a democratic society” has to take into account the comparative importance of the right infringed in the scale of rights protected. What may be a proportionate interference with a less important right might be a disproportionate interference with a more important right. The concept of what is “necessary in a democratic society” also has to accommodate the differing importance attached to certain values in different member states. As Lord Bingham has shown, the British have traditionally attached more importance to protecting animals from harm than they have to protecting children from harm (although it is to be hoped that the children have now caught up). This is where the so-called “margin of appreciation” allowed to each Member State comes in. And this is where respect for the recently expressed views of the democratically elected legislature comes in. </p>
