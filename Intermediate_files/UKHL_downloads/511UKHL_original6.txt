<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;144. In the course of his submissions Mr Fitzgerald pointed to other paragraphs in schedule 1 to the 1989 Act in which, he said, the phrase "within the jurisdiction" refers to the territorial, rather than to any wider, jurisdiction of the requesting state.  For the sake of the argument I am prepared to assume that in some of the provisions this is a proper inference to draw from the context.  But, precisely because the interpretation of a flexible term such as "jurisdiction" depends on the particular context in which it is used, other provisions cannot provide a reliable guide to its interpretation in the context of paragraph 20.  That is particularly so where the context is utterly different - for example, the delivery of the fugitive criminal to the requesting state in paragraph 8 and the flight of an aircraft in paragraph 14.  By contrast, in paragraph 20, for the reasons I have given, the context shows that "jurisdiction" must be given a wide rather than a narrow interpretation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;145. Mr Fitzgerald put particular emphasis on paragraph 15.  He argued that any conduct which was made an offence against the criminal law of a state was <i>ipso facto</i> "within the jurisdiction" of that state, in the wider sense of that term.  So, he said, the fact that Parliament had seen fit to deem the crimes in this paragraph to have been committed within the requesting state's jurisdiction showed that "jurisdiction" means "territorial jurisdiction".  A glance at the international conventions lying behind what is now paragraph 15 is sufficient, however, to show that, in this context, making conduct an offence is different from creating jurisdiction over that offence.  See, for instance, articles 2 and 3 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents (1974) (Treaty Series No 3 (1980) Cmnd 7765).  More particularly, since the term "jurisdiction" in its wider sense includes territorial jurisdiction, in paragraph 15 the United Kingdom could conveniently carry out its obligation under article 8(4) of the convention - to treat a crime as if it had been committed within a state's territory - by deeming that it had been "committed within the jurisdiction of that state".  The use of the term "jurisdiction" for that purpose is therefore no indication that the same term means only "territorial jurisdiction" in paragraph 20.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;146. The terms of an extradition treaty cannot be used to construe the Act of Parliament under which the treaty is given effect in our domestic   law.  It is nevertheless worth noting that the language of article I of the 1972 treaty with the United States does not suggest that the parties were treating "territory" and "jurisdiction" as synonymous.  The contracting parties undertake to extradite any person found in their "territory" who has been accused or convicted of any offence within article III of the treaty, "committed within the jurisdiction of the other party."  If the parties had thought that the only offences for which extradition could be sought were those committed within the requesting state's territorial jurisdiction, a reference to "territory" or "territorial jurisdiction" would have been more consistent with the reference to the requested state's "territory".  On the other hand, the very fact that the crimes for which extradition can be requested in terms of article III and the schedule include "piracy, involving ships or aircraft, according to international law" suggests that in article I the use of the term "jurisdiction" was deliberate - to ensure that all the relevant crimes were covered and to avoid the kind of argument that had caused difficulty in the Norwegian case.  Indeed, since the treaty is framed in this way, only the assumption that the term was used in the wide sense in the 1870 Act too justifies what is in effect a conclusive presumption that the arrangement in the treaty complies with schedule 1 of the 1989 Act:  see paragraph 2.  These factors have to be kept in mind when, at this late date, your Lordships' House is asked to put a narrow interpretation on the term "jurisdiction" in paragraph 20 of schedule 1 to the 1989 Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;147. At first sight it might seem that, if "jurisdiction" were given this wide interpretation, extradition could occur even if the requesting state founded its request on an exorbitant assertion of jurisdiction.  Mr Fitzgerald argued that, by using the term "jurisdiction" as an equivalent to "territorial jurisdiction" in paragraph 20, Parliament had intended to guard against this eventuality.  I consider that this argument ignores both the realities of the system of extradition and the protection afforded by the committal proceedings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;148. In the first place it overlooks the fact that neither the 1870 Act, in its day, nor schedule 1 of the 1989 Act today has ever of itself provided for extradition between the United Kingdom and any foreign state.  Extradition arrangements are made by treaty between Her Majesty, as the executive of the United Kingdom, and the sovereign of the foreign state.  What the 1870 and 1989 Acts do is to give the framework within which the extradition arrangements made by the treaties are given effect under our domestic law.  The fact that extradition arrangements are based on treaties provides the first line of defence against the abuse which Mr Fitzgerald envisaged.  In principle, the United Kingdom will have such treaty arrangements only with states adopting what it regards as a proper approach to the prosecution and trial of offenders.  Among the relevant factors to be taken into account in negotiating such treaties will, therefore, be the nature of the jurisdiction exercised by the other state.  If the jurisdiction is exorbitant, then either the United Kingdom will simply not enter into a treaty with the state concerned or else it will ensure that the provisions of the treaty are so drafted as to provide for extradition only in cases where the state exercises an acceptable jurisdiction.  So, in any given case, it is to be assumed that the British Government of the day considered that the matter of the other state's jurisdiction had been settled acceptably at the time when the treaty was concluded.  If, later, the foreign state begins to assert an exorbitant jurisdiction not excluded by the terms of the treaty, then in the last resort the United Kingdom can give notice terminating the treaty.  The fact that it has not done so should, again in principle, indicate that the Government does not regard the state in question as exercising an exorbitant jurisdiction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;149. The exorbitant, or otherwise unacceptable, nature of a foreign state's jurisdiction is therefore a matter for the executive to ponder when considering whether to conclude an extradition treaty and whether to remain bound by it.  Similarly, when dealing with any particular requisition the Secretary of State can take account of the exorbitant nature of the jurisdiction underlying the request.  Whatever the obligations of the United Kingdom under the relevant treaty may be in international law, under paragraph 4(2) of schedule 1 to the 1989 Act, the Secretary of State has a discretion to issue or to decline to issue an order to proceed.  Similarly, under paragraph 8(2) he has a discretion to issue or not to issue a warrant for the surrender of the fugitive criminal.  The Secretary of State could therefore decline to take either of those steps if it appeared to him that the jurisdiction claimed by the requesting state was exorbitant.  This provides a further safeguard.  Yet another safeguard is to be found in the committal proceedings discussed below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;150. Ultimately, issues as to the propriety of the jurisdiction claimed by a foreign state depend on judgments as to comity among states in international law.  By their nature such judgments involve factors which must primarily be for the consideration of the executive who have responsibility for our relations with foreign states.  Provided that the executive exercise their various powers appropriately, I see no reason to fear that persons will in fact be surrendered to states asserting an exorbitant jurisdiction, if the term "jurisdiction" in paragraph 20 has to be interpreted broadly.  It bears repeating that the appellants do not suggest that the jurisdiction which the United States claims in their case is exorbitant.  I deal with the judicial safeguards below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;151. I am accordingly satisfied that the term "jurisdiction" in the definition of "fugitive criminal" is broad enough to include the jurisdiction which the United States asserts over a conspiracy formed abroad to murder United States citizens within the United States and elsewhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;152. For practical reasons, in the hearing before this House the cross-appeal relating to jurisdiction was heard first.  I have also begun with the meaning of "jurisdiction" in the definition of a fugitive criminal in paragraph 20.  But, as I have already explained, this is only one of two important elements in that definition.  The other is that the individual must be accused of an "extradition crime".  It appears to me that this point would, more naturally, come first.  In other words, when considering a requisition, the Secretary of State would, usually at least, first decide whether the crime in the requisition was an extradition crime and, only if he was satisfied that it was, would he go on to consider whether it had been committed within the jurisdiction of the requesting state.  Such an approach presupposes, however, that it is possible to determine whether a crime is an extradition crime without first considering the form of jurisdiction on which the requesting state founds.  The contention for the appellants proceeds on a different basis.  They say that the extraterritorial nature of the jurisdiction claimed by the requesting state has a bearing on whether the crime is to be regarded as an extradition crime.  In particular, they argue that, in making the transposition required by the definition in section 26 of the 1870 Act, it is necessary to transpose into England those actings that are alleged to have taken place in the requesting state but not those actings that are alleged to have taken place outside the territory of the requesting state.  The question then is whether, that qualified transposition having been made, the crime is an extradition crime under section 26.  In this case, for instance, the appellants argue that only the overt acts alleged to have taken place in the United States should be supposed to have taken place in England, while all the other alleged actings of the appellants and their fellow conspirators must be supposed to have taken place abroad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;153. The Administrative Court in effect adopted that approach.  They held, at p 1238E-F, para 11, that, in deciding whether an offence constituted an extradition crime under section 26:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The law of England is applied on the hypothesised basis that the acts that took place in the requesting state, but no other acts, took place in England:  see <i>R v Governor of Pentonville Prison, Ex p Osman </i>[1990] 1 WLR 277, 290 H.  Mr Lewis, counsel for the Government of the United States of America, accepted for present purposes that that decision bound us;  though he wished to reserve for another day the possibility that what is transposed to England is not merely the acts done in the requesting state, but all the acts wherever done that constituted the offence charged."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;154. I would reject that approach.  In doing so, I note that <i>R v Governor of Pentonville Prison,Ex p Osman </i>[1990] 1 WLR 277, 290 and the authorities which Lloyd LJ cites all concern the Fugitive Offenders Act 1967, which differs in certain respects from the Extradition Acts.  None the less, I consider that, when properly understood, these authorities and, in particular, the passage from the speech of Lord Keith of Kinkel in <i>R v Governor of Pentonville Prison, Ex p Tarling</i> (1978) 70 Cr App R 77, 136 are consistent with the approach to transposition in the definition of "extradition crime" which I prefer.  They really deal with the separate matter of the test to be applied by the magistrate in considering the evidence at the committal hearing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;155. As I explained in paragraph 140 above, the phrase "in England or within English jurisdiction" in the definition of "extradition crime" in section 26 of the 1870 Act must have been framed so as to cover actings which <i>could</i> be supposed to have taken place in England and actings which, by their very nature, <i>could not</i> be supposed to have taken place in England because they occurred on the high seas.  On that basis, all the alleged actings in the present case can be supposed, for the purposes of section 26, to have taken place in England.  The simple question then is whether, if they had taken place in England, those actings would have constituted the crime of conspiracy to murder in English law.  For my part, I see no need for any more complex analysis at this stage since the test which I have outlined is sufficient to ensure that extradition is confined to allegations of crimes according to the law of the requesting state which would also be crimes according to English law and in respect of which Parliament has given the Secretary of State power to surrender accused persons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;156. This interpretation of the relevant provisions is straightforward and the provisions when so interpreted are easy to apply.  By contrast the approach advocated by the appellants and adopted by the Administrative Court leads inevitably to a blurring of two questions.  The first is whether the individual concerned is a criminal accused of an "extradition crime".  The second question is whether, even supposing that he is, there is evidence to justify ordering his committal to prison on that charge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;157. When the magistrate is dealing with this second question, he may indeed require to take into account the extraterritorial nature of some of the alleged actings.  As the Administrative Court noted in the <i>Al</i>-<i>Fawwaz</i> case ([2001] 1 WLR 1234, 1243B - E, paragraphs 30 and 31), this was the context in which the Privy Council approached the issues relating to the jurisdiction of the courts of the requested state in <i>Liangsiriprasert (Somchai) v Government of the United States of America</i> [1991] 1 AC 225.  The case concerned a conspiracy in Thailand to supply heroin for importation into the United States.  The appellant went to Hong Kong to collect payment and was arrested.  The United States requested his extradition.  The parties were agreed that a conspiracy of this kind was an "extradition crime" in terms of section 26 of the 1870 Act and the issue for the Board was whether the evidence disclosed a prima facie case against the appellant, upon the assumption that the drugs were to be imported into Hong Kong rather than into the United States (at p 241 G - H).  It was within this context that the Board went on to decide (at p 251 D - E) that:</p>
<p></p><ul>"a conspiracy entered into in Thailand with the intention of committing the criminal offence of trafficking in drugs in Hong Kong is justiciable in Hong Kong even if no overt act pursuant to the conspiracy has yet occurred in Hong Kong."<p></p></ul>
<p>On that basis the Board upheld the magistrate's decision to commit the appellant on the first charge, a charge of conspiring to traffic in dangerous drugs.  In my respectful opinion, although the point was not argued in <i>Liangsiriprasert</i>, the approach which Lord Griffiths adopted was correct.  I note in passing that counsel for the appellants conceded that, if their contention as to the interpretation of "jurisdiction" in paragraph 20 of schedule 1 to the 1989 Act was correct, the decision of the Privy Council upholding the committal of the appellant in <i>Liangsiriprasert</i> must have been in substance wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;158. The approach of the Privy Council was consistent with that of this House, some years earlier, in <i>Tarling (No.1)</i>, where the issues arose out of the evidence led before the magistrate in committal proceedings under the Fugitive Offenders Act.  The Government of Singapore sought Mr Tarling's extradition inter alia on two charges of conspiring in Hong Kong to steal shares in a Hong Kong company, the property of a Singapore Company.  On the law as it stood then, Lord Wilberforce held that a conspiracy in Hong Kong to steal shares in a Hong Kong company, the property of a English company, would not be triable in England.  He therefore held that the charges were not supported (70 Cr App R at pp 110-111)<i>.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;159. During the hearing before the House in the present case it was suggested that deciding the "extradition crime" issue under section 26 by supposing that the whole conduct had taken place in England would weaken the safeguards for accused persons.  I reject that criticism, precisely because the fact that some of the alleged conduct took place abroad will be taken into account by the magistrate when deciding whether to commit the person concerned.  The point is amply illustrated not only by <i>Tarling (No.1)</i> but by the decision in <i>Liangsiriprasert</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;160. The Privy Council first considered whether the evidence justified the appellant's committal on charge 1.  On that matter, they held that a conspiracy to commit a crime in Hong Kong was justiciable in Hong Kong even though there was no evidence of any overt act having been committed there.  The magistrate had accordingly been entitled to order that the appellant should be committed on the first charge.  Had they decided the issue of principle in favour of the appellant, however, the Board would, of course, have allowed his appeal against his committal on that charge.  So the whole issue of the jurisdiction of the court of the requested state could be, and was, duly considered in this context.  The Board then went on to examine charges 2 and 4 which were charges of trafficking, and of doing acts preparatory to trafficking, in dangerous drugs contrary to section 4 of the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance (Laws of Hong Kong, 1988 rev, c134).  The evidence on these charges showed that the alleged activities had all taken place in Thailand.  The Board allowed the appellant's appeal against his committal on these charges on the view that section 4 did not have extraterritorial effect.  This decision gave the appellant all the protection that he could ever have hoped to derive from the fact that the allegations related to extraterritorial conduct.  The Board's prior assumption that the crimes were "extradition crimes" did not impair that protection.  Nor would a prior judicial decision to the same effect impair it.  The committal proceedings and any habeas corpus application therefore provide a full judicial safeguard against extradition based on a wider jurisdiction than is recognised under English law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;161. For these reasons I would respectfully hold that the decision of the Administrative Court was wrong on this point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;162. The appellants accept that, if the test for an extradition crime is applied as I would apply it - or indeed on the basis of a qualified transposition -  the allegations against them in the present cases would amount to allegations of conspiracy to murder in English Law.  That being so, they are persons accused of an extradition crime.  Moreover, they are alleged to have committed the crime within the jurisdiction of the United States.  They are, therefore, fugitive criminals in terms of paragraph 20 of schedule 1 to the 1989 Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;163. The principal remaining question is whether, applying the test in paragraph 7(1), the magistrate was entitled to find that there was such evidence of conspiracy to murder as would have made a case requiring an answer if the proceedings against the appellants had been for trial in England and Wales of an information for conspiracy to murder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;164. In the case of Al-Fawwaz his counsel accepted that there was indeed sufficient evidence to justify his committal if the metropolitan magistrate had been correct to admit the affidavit of the anonymous witness referred to as "CS/1".  So far as that matter is concerned, I am satisfied that, for the reasons given in the opinion of Buxton LJ, the decision of the Administrative Court on this matter was correct.  In particular I agree that, however detailed might be the list of factors to be considered according to <i>R v Taylor (Gary)</i> The Times, 17 August 1994, the decision as to admitting the evidence of an anonymous witness depends on weighing a range of factors and is therefore one for the discretion of the trial judge in all the circumstances.  That was indeed the starting point of the discussion of Evans LJ in <i>Taylor</i>.  The same must apply to the magistrate in the committal proceedings in these cases. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;165. Counsel for the appellants submitted that the approach adopted by the Divisional Court had contravened their rights under article 5(4) of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms which required that basic principles of fairness should be applied to extradition proceedings.  These basic principles would reinforce the common law.  Even assuming that article 5 introduces some new element, it could not be suggested that the requirements of fairness in respect of proceedings for detention for extradition purposes could be higher than those enjoyed by a defendant at his trial under article 6.  In this connexion it is useful to recall the observations of the European Court of Human Rights in <i>Doorson v Netherlands </i>(1996) 32 EHRR 330 where the investigating judge had heard two anonymous witnesses in the absence of the applicant's counsel during the preliminary investigation.  The court held that no issue under the Convention arose in that respect but that the subsequent use of their statements by the trial court to found a conviction was capable of raising an issue under the Convention.  The court observed, at p 358, para 69, that the use of such statements was not under all circumstances incompatible with the Convention and continued, at para 70:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is true that article 6 does not explicitly require the interests of witnesses in general, and those of victims called upon to testify in particular, to be taken into consideration.  However, their life, liberty or security of person may be at stake, as may interests coming generally within the ambit of article 8 of the Convention.  Such interests of witnesses and victims are in principle protected by other, substantive provisions of the Convention, which imply that contracting states should organise their criminal proceedings in such a way that those interests are not unjustifiably imperilled.  Against this background, principles of fair trial also require that in appropriate cases the interests of the defence are balanced against those of witnesses or victims called upon to testify."<p></p></ul>
<p>The court went on to consider the reason why the witnesses' anonymity had been preserved and concluded that the reason was sufficient (paragraph 71).  As Lord Bingham of Cornhill pointed out in <i>Brown v Stott</i> [2001] 2 WLR 817, 827 the European Court of Human Rights have identified their decision in <i>Doorson </i>as a particular example of a situation where there are competing interests which have to be weighed when considering what constitutes a fair trial in criminal proceedings:  <i>Fitt v United Kingdom</i> (2000) 30 EHRR 480,510, paras 44 - 45.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;166. In my view, therefore, even taking account of the appellants' rights under article 5(4), the Administrative Court were entitled to hold that, since the magistrate accepted that there were real grounds to fear for the safety of CS/1 if his identity were revealed, he had been justified in maintaining the anonymity of CS/1 but nevertheless admitting his evidence in the committal proceedings.  On the available information the fear for CS/1's safety was a sufficient reason for adopting that course at this stage.  In reaching that decision the magistrate was entitled to have regard not simply to the interests of the appellants but to the interests of CS/1.  Nor can it be said that in all the circumstances, including the other available evidence, it was irrational for the magistrate to take the evidence of CS/1 into account.  On the contrary it was appropriate for the magistrate to do so in the circumstances, even though he was not satisfied that the creditworthiness of CS/1 had been fully investigated.  Mr Fitzgerald accepts that, when that evidence is taken into account, there was sufficient evidence to justify the committal of Al-Fawwaz.  No point is taken about the adequacy of the reasons given by the magistrate in his case.  It follows that his appeal must be dismissed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;167. In the case of Eidarous and Abdel Bary, so far as CS/1 is concerned, the Administrative Court adopted the approach of the court in the case of Al-Fawwaz and considered the circumstances in the light of that approach.  On that basis the court came to the conclusion that the magistrate had been fully entitled to take the view that the statement of CS/1 had not been shown to be worthless and to hold it to be admissible.  Again I am satisfied that the Administrative Court reached the correct conclusion on this matter.  It follows that it was open to the magistrate to consider the issue of the sufficiency of the evidence against these appellants for the purpose of committal on the basis that it included the evidence of CS/1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;168. Counsel for Eidarous and Abdel Bary sought to persuade us, however, that in their case, even taking the evidence of CS/1 into account, there was not a case to answer in terms of paragraph 7(1).  The evidence was of acts abroad and acts in pursuit of the conspiracy in the United States.  They pointed out that certain of the items in the prosecution evidence were susceptible of an entirely innocent explanation.  So, for instance, the purchase of the satellite telephone was said to be consistent with the appellants and the others concerned being involved in opposition to the government of Saudi Arabia.  The possession of the faxed texts of the fatwahs was similarly said to be insufficient to point to involvement in a conspiracy to murder, not least because those fatwahs had been published.  The explosions in Nairobi occurred at about 7.30 am GMT and the two faxes claiming responsibility, which were recovered from 1A Beethoven Street were timed at 4.45 am.  It was argued that the time marked on the faxes would not show that they had been sent before the attack if that time was not GMT.  So no sinister inference could be drawn from the apparent time when the appellants had received the faxes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;169. Those submissions make the obvious point that, looked at in isolation, these various circumstances could be regarded as neutral.  That is by no means an unusual feature of a circumstantial case such as the present.  The Crown can only rarely lead direct evidence of the formation of a conspiracy, which by its very nature is likely to take place in secret.  The prosecution case will tend to depend on evidence of various circumstances which, viewed severally and in isolation, could well be capable of an innocent explanation but which, taken together, the prosecution contend, point to a conspiracy.  At trial the defence will seek to put forward an innocent explanation for these circumstances, whether in cross-examination or by leading evidence or in argument before the jury.  The proper test of such a prosecution case at committal is not, however, to look at the various items of evidence separately but, as the jury would ultimately be asked to look at them, in relation to one another.  Could the evidence as a whole justify a conviction?  The question for the magistrate in this case was therefore whether, so regarded, the evidence of the circumstances on which the United States Government rely was "capable" of making a case which would require an answer in a trial of an information for conspiracy to murder.</p>
