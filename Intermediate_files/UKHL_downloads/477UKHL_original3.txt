<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;42. Paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the 1978 Act is the only provision in that Act which extends to Scotland.  It provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"For section 5(b) of the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945 (application to Scotland) there shall be substituted -<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"(b) section 3 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1940 (contribution among joint wrongdoers) shall apply in any case where two or more persons are liable, or would if they had all been sued be liable, by virtue of section 1(1) of this Act in respect of the damage suffered by any person."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;43. The effect of paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 is not easy to grasp at first sight, as section 1(1) of the 1945 Act deals with the apportionment of liability between the claimant and the wrongdoer in a case of contributory negligence.  But I think that the reference in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the 1978 Act to section 1(1) of the 1945 Act must be read together with section 1(3) of that Act, which provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Section 6 of the Law Reform (Married Women and Tortfeasors) Act 1935 (which relates to proceedings against, and contribution between, joint and several tortfeasors) shall apply in any case where two or more persons are liable or would, if they had all been sued, be liable by virtue of subsection (1) of this section in respect of the damage suffered by any person."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 1(3) of the 1945 Act was repealed by section 9(2) of and Schedule 2 to the 1978 Act.  But section 10(3) of the 1978 Act provides that that Act, with the exception of paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 thereto, does not apply to Scotland.  I understand this to mean that the repeal of section 1(3) of the 1945 Act does not extend to Scotland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;44. The effect of these provisions would appear to be that section 3 of the 1940 Act, which enables the liability between wrongdoers in Scotland to be apportioned equitably between them, now applies in any case where two or more persons are jointly or severally or both jointly and severally liable for the same damage, whatever the basis in law of the wrongdoers' liability.  It had already been held that the doctrine of joint and several liability applies in cases of breach of contract as well as in delict: <i>Grunwald v Hughes</i>, 1965  SLT 209.  As Lord Justice-Clerk Grant put it, at p 211, the test is the same whether the action is based on delict or on contract.  It is whether the two persons have contributed, albeit in different ways, to cause a single wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;45. In <i>Friends' Provident Life Office v Hillier Parker May &amp; Rowden</i> [1997]  QB 85, 102H-103B Auld LJ referred to the words "any damage suffered by another" and "whatever the legal basis of his liability, whether tort, breach of contract, breach of trust or otherwise".  He said that it was difficult to imagine a broader formulation of an entitlement to contribution and that the 1978 Act was clearly intended to be given a wide interpretation.  Keene LJ followed those observations in <i>Hurstwood Developments Ltd v Motor &amp; General &amp; Andersley &amp; Co Insurance Services Ltd</i> 21 November 2001, para 19, when he said that it is necessary not to be over-influenced by the possibility of formulating the damage for which one party is liable in different language from that which is employed to define or describe that for which another party is liable.  It is clear that the purpose of the 1978 Act was to extend the law to enable a contribution to be recovered in situations where it was not previously available.  In that respect the wording in section 6(1) is undoubtedly very wide.  But I think that it is a misconception to regard the Act as a whole as being open to the widest possible interpretation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;46. I do not detect either in the Law Commission's Report or in the wording of the Act itself an intention to depart from the assumption which has always been made in contribution cases that this relief is available only where two or more persons have contributed, albeit in different ways, to the same harm or damage - that is, where a single harm has resulted from what they have done.  Where this occurs it may be said (loosely, as their liability is not common in the strict sense, as in the case of co-trustees or co-owners) that they share a common liability to pay compensation for having inflicted the same harm.  Prior to <i>Palmer v Wick and Pulteneytown Steam Shipping Co Ltd</i> [1894]  AC 318 it was not settled whether the statement that there shall be no contribution between wrongdoers was part of the law of Scotland: see <i>National Coal Board v Thomson</i> 1959  SC 353, 368 per Lord Patrick.  But Lord Watson said in <i>Palmer,</i> at p 327, that it had been recognised in Scots law that a right of relief inter se was competent to all persons concerned in and responsible for the civil consequences of the same delict.  This was said to be because payment and reparation by one wrongdoer liberates the rest and he ought in equity to have relief against the others proportionately, since by his money the others are freed from their obligation: Bankton, <i>Institute of the Laws of Scotland </i>(1751-1753), I.10, 4.  The words "liable in respect of the same damage", which first appeared in section 6(1)(c) of the 1935 Act and were repeated in section 1(1) of the 1978 Act, confirm that the concept of a common liability remains the basis of the entitlement to contribution in English law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;47. The effect of those words is that the entitlement to contribution applies only where the person from whom the contribution is sought is liable for the same harm or damage, whatever the legal basis of his liability.  But the mere fact that two or more wrongs lead to a common result does not of itself mean that the wrongdoers are liable in respect of the same damage.  The facts must be examined more closely in order to determine whether or not the damage is the same.  As Lord Fraser pointed out in <i>Turnbull v Frame</i> 1966  SLT 24, 25, each utterance of a slander may be said to lead to a common result in the sense that they each cause damage to a man's reputation.  It may be difficult to identify the particular damage caused by each utterance.  But that does not mean that they are not separate wrongs, each of which causes its own damage.  That is equally true of separate physical assaults by different persons at different but closely consecutive times.  Unless they were acting in combination, each would be liable only for the damage caused by his own attack.  Those examples may be contrasted with <i>Arneil v Paterson</i> [1931]  AC 560, where two dogs which were the property of different owners, acting together, attacked a flock of black-faced ewes and killed some of them.  It was held that each of the owners was liable jointly and severally for the whole of the damage done to the flock, as the whole of the damage was the result of the action of the two dogs acting together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;48. In the present case, for the reasons explained by my noble and learned friend Lord Steyn, the Contractor and the Architect did not cause the same damage.  The basis for a finding that this was so is entirely absent.  The harm done by the Contractor's breach of contract was the product of delay in the completion of the contract.  The harm done by the Architect's breach of contract was due to the certificates which the Architect granted to the prejudice of the rights of the Employer under the contract.  I agree that the harm, or the damage, which was done in each case was different.  The conclusion must be that the prerequisite for entitlement to contribution under section 1 (1) of the 1978 Act is not satisfied.</p>
