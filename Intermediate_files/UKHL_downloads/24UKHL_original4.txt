<p class="para">81.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was submitted that this undertaking was admissible as an aid to the construction of section 5 of the 1997 Act under the principle in <i>Pepper v Hart</i> [1993] AC 593. The House in that case approved recourse to Hansard as an aid to construction only where legislation is ambiguous. I have been unable to detect any ambiguity in the terms of section 5. The wording of subsections (3) and (6) is clear and contains no hint that rules providing for closed hearings can only be made insofar as this is necessary in the interests of national security. It was suggested that there is a conflict between subsection (6)(a) and (6)(b) but I can see no incompatibility between them. </p>
<p class="para">82.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule 4 falls fairly and squarely within the power to make rules granted by section 5 of the 1997 Act. Neither the fact that the ECtHR in <i>Chahal</i> envisaged that it would only be necessary to use closed material where the interests of national security required this nor the assurance given to Parliament by the Junior Minister can have the effect of rendering Rule 4 <i>ultra vires.</i> </p>
<p class="para">83.&nbsp;&nbsp;This conclusion makes it unnecessary to consider the implications of the fact that the terms of section 97 of the 2002 Act, coupled with section 2(1) of the 1997 Act, appear to show a clear intention on the part of Parliament that SIAC’s procedures should be available to protect information that in the Secretary of State’s opinion should not be made public not merely in the interests of national security but “in the interests of the relationship between the United Kingdom and another country, or otherwise in the public interest".</p>
<p class="para">84.&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point founded on the statement of Lord Hoffmann in <i>R v Secretary of State for the Home Department,</i> <i>Ex p Simms</i> [2000] 2 AC 115 (‘<i>Simms</i>‘) at 131E:</p>
<p class="qt">“the principle of legality means that Parliament must squarely confront what it is doing and accept the political cost. Fundamental rights cannot be overridden by general or ambiguous words. This is because there is too great a risk that the full implications of their unqualified meaning may have passed unnoticed in the democratic process. In the absence of express language or necessary implication to the contrary, the courts therefore presume that even the most general words were intended to be subject to the basic rights of the individual.”   </p>
<p class="para">It was submitted that article 3 of the Convention recognised a fundamental right that was not qualified or derogable. The use of closed material where this right was at stake was contrary to fundamental principles of fairness and was not acceptable. Section 5 of the 1997 Act should be so interpreted as to preclude this. One way of achieving this would be to adopt the approach of your Lordships’ House in <i>MB and AF </i>and qualify rule 4, or alternatively section 5(3), by adding the following words “save where to do so would be incompatible with an appellant’s Convention rights, or unfair". This submission is best considered in the context of the more general attack that was made of the use by SIAC of closed material, to which I now turn.</p>
<p class="para">85.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rabinder Singh QC submitted on behalf of RB and U that the use that SIAC had made of closed materials in this case was in conflict with the relevant requirements of procedural fairness. As to the precise nature of those requirements he advanced a number of different submissions. First he submitted that the appellants were taking proceedings to determine their civil rights, so that Article 6 entitled them to a fair hearing, applying the standard relevant to civil proceedings. Secondly he submitted that the proceedings were, in part, to determine the lawfulness of the appellants’ detention, so that the requirements of article 5(4) applied. Thirdly he submitted that the right to liberty was itself a civil right, so that Article 6 applied for this reason also. Fourthly he submitted that the appellants’ reputation was at stake and that this was a further reason why Article 6 applied.   </p>
<p class="para">86.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Secretary of State Mr Tam QC submitted that Strasbourg authority established that immigration proceedings did not engage article 6. The applicable article of the Convention was article 13 which simply required the appellants to have “an effective remedy". This requirement was less exacting than that of either article 6 or article 5(4).</p>
<p class="para">87.&nbsp;&nbsp;This last submission is supported by the statement of the ECtHR in <i>Chahal</i> that what article 13 requires in the context of deportation is independent scrutiny of the human rights claim, which need not be provided by a judicial authority. Article 13 is not, however, an article that has been incorporated into English law. No doubt those drafting the Human Rights Act considered that the remedies provided under the Act were enough to satisfy the obligation imposed by article 13. </p>
<p class="para">88.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>In re S (Minors) (Care Order: Implementation of Care Plan</i>) [2002] UKHL 10 [2002] 2 AC 291 at paragraph 71 Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead held that the effect of the Human Rights Act was to convert Convention rights (in that case article 8) into civil rights. It would seem to follow from this that claims brought under the Human Rights Act attract the procedural standard of fairness that article 6 requires in relation to civil proceedings. For myself I have no difficulty with the argument that such a standard should apply in the case of someone who is resisting extradition or deportation on the ground that this will violate fundamental human rights. I would expect no less a standard to be required under the duty of fairness that arises at common law in relation to legal proceedings.</p>
<p class="para">89.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of this finding, the question of whether article 5(4) applied to the appellants’ claims would seem of only academic interest. The basis upon which Mr Singh sought to rely on article 5(4) was that at the time of the hearing before SIAC the appellants were detained with a view to deportation, as permitted by article 5(1)(f), and that, if their deportation was held to be unlawful, the right to detain them would fall away. I do not consider that this argument is sound. In <i>Chahal </i>the ECtHR held that the lawfulness of the detention of a person against whom action was being taken with a view to deportation did not depend upon whether the underlying decision to deport him could be justified nor upon whether it was reasonably considered necessary to prevent the person detained from committing an offence or fleeing. The court added that the lawfulness of detention required that the deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purposes of article 5 and that there had to be proceedings available to challenge the lawfulness of Mr Chahal’s detention and to seek bail. Because the United Kingdom had sought to justify Mr Chahal’s detention on grounds of national security, the proceedings had to enable him to make an effective challenge of that alleged justification.</p>
<p class="para">90.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the proceedings before SIAC neither of the appellants made an independent challenge of his detention as opposed to the decision to deport him. For this reason I do not consider that the procedural requirements of article 5(4) applied to those proceedings. For the same reason there is no merit in the argument that the appellants’ right to liberty was in issue and that, in consequence, article 6 was engaged. </p>
<p class="para">91.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need to say anything of Mr Singh’s fourth point, not strenuously advanced, that because the appellants’ reputations were in issue Article 6 applied. </p>
<p class="para">92.&nbsp;&nbsp;I must confess to some unease at the exercise of attempting to identify, by reference to articles 5, 6 and 13, different tests for the procedural fairness to be looked for in the case of these appellants. In <i>MB </i>Lord Bingham discussed at some length whether the criminal or the civil limb of article 6(1) applied to control order proceedings. He concluded that the civil limb applied, but went on to observe that the civil limb should give rise to an entitlement to such measure of procedural protection as was commensurate with the gravity of the potential consequences - para 24. This seems to me to be the appropriate approach to the use of closed material in deportation proceedings. But it is not merely the potential consequences of deportation to which one must have regard. One must have regard to the justification for the use of closed material, the potential consequences of the use of closed material on the result of the proceedings and the potential consequences of the decision in those proceedings.</p>
<i><p class="para">The justification for closed material</p></i>
<p class="para">93.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was submitted on the part of the appellants that, while there might be justification for the use of closed material where its disclosure would be contrary to the interests of national security, there could be no justification for not disclosing material where disclosure would be contrary to the interests of the relationship between the United Kingdom and another country. I do not accept this submission. Where what is at issue is the safety on return of a deportee, the United Kingdom is likely to have a substantial body of information about conditions prevailing in the country in question, including personal information about public figures and other individuals in that country, that has been obtained in circumstances, or in terms, that could, if made public, cause serious prejudice to relations between the United Kingdom and that country. It is in the public interest that diplomats should be free to make frank reports in the confidence that these will not be put into the public domain. It is also in the public interest that Ministers and officials in this country should be able to exchange information in confidence with their counterparts in other countries. For these reasons I consider that there are cogent considerations of policy that are capable of justifying the use of closed material provided that these considerations are not outweighed by the other relevant factors.</p>
<i></i><p class="para"><i>The potential consequences of the use of closed material on the result of the proceedings.</i> </p>
<p class="para">94.&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be two reasons why the use of closed material is open to objection. The first is that it is objectionable if a party to judicial proceedings is unaware of the case that he has to meet. The second is that it is objectionable if this ignorance prevents that party from meeting the case against him. Both objections are likely to be in play where closed material is used in control order proceedings. The reason for seeking a control order will be that the person affected - I shall call him the suspect - is suspected of being involved in terrorist activity. The closed material is likely to relate to the reasons for this suspicion. The consequence of not disclosing this information may be that the suspect has no idea of the case that is made against him. Insofar as he is the person to whom the information relates, he it is who is likely to be best placed to rebut it if it is untrue.  His ability to defend himself will be seriously impaired, if not totally destroyed, if he is not told the case against him, and his special advocate may well be in no position to rebut the case made against him without obtaining the suspect’s response to the closed material.</p>
<p class="para">95.&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is not true of the position of a deportee. It is true that, if that deportee will be at real risk of a violation of his human rights on return to his own country, this is likely to be because of facts that are personal to him. The difference is that he will normally be aware of those facts and indeed he will be relying on them to establish the risk that he faces on his return. His situation is not that of an individual who is unaware of the case that is made against him. Indeed, so far as safety on return is concerned, the State does not have to make out a case against the deportee. </p>
<p class="para">96.&nbsp;&nbsp;There may of course be circumstances in which the State does have information personal to the deportee of which the deportee is unaware that bears on the question of whether he will be safe on his return. The security services of the receiving State may have informed the security services of this country, in confidence, of reasons why they are anxious to get their hands on the deportee. If this is the case, however, it cannot be said that it is of critical importance to the result of the deportation proceedings that the deportee be aware of the suspicions of the receiving state so that he can rebut them. Whether those suspicions are well-founded or ill-founded will not be of much relevance when considering the safety of the deportee on return to his own country. Even if he is in a position to demonstrate that suspicions held about him by the receiving state are groundless, this will not have significant bearing on the risk that he will face on his return. </p>
<p class="para">97.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons no close comparison can be made between a deportee and a person who has been made subject to a control order. The same is true of another situation in which the propriety of the use of closed material has been an issue - where consideration is being given to the release of a prisoner on licence. Here what is in issue is the risk that the prisoner will pose if released. Once again, however, the facts that will be critical to that risk will be facts personal to the prisoner himself. If he is not aware of factual allegations about himself that bear on the risk that he poses he will not be in a position to rebut them.</p>
<p class="para">98.&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, where safety on return is in issue it is not likely to be critically important for the advocate advancing the case of the deportee to be able to obtain input from the deportee in relation to the evidence that the deporting state wishes to remain closed. Your Lordships heard submissions from Mr Martin Chamberlain, as special advocate, and from Mr Pannick on the prejudice that is caused to a deportee by the use of closed material. So far as safety on return was concerned it was not submitted that it was essential that the deportee should himself be aware of this material in order to be able to respond to it. Rather the point was made that the closed material was likely to include evidence in respect of which the input of an appropriate expert witness was desirable. Because it was not practical to obtain such a witness with security clearance to see the material, the special advocate was not able adequately to counter the material relied on by the Secretary of State.</p>
<i><p class="para">The consequences of the proceedings</p></i>
<p class="para">99.&nbsp;&nbsp;A non-derogating control order places severe constraints on the ability of the person subject to it to enjoy the freedoms normally open to those who live in this country. It interferes seriously with his civil rights, albeit not to the extent of depriving him of his liberty. In contrast the deportation of a person who has no right to remain in this country involves, of itself, no interference with his civil rights. Where, however, the deportee alleges that there is a real risk that his rights under article 3 will be infringed if he is returned, the treatment that he alleges he faces will be more serious than that experienced by the person subject to the control order, and this may also be the case where a deportee alleges that he will be subject to a real risk of a flagrant breach of his right to a fair trial. Certainly Mr Othman faces a lengthy prison sentence if he is convicted on either of the charges that he faces. </p>
<p class="para">100.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the relevant factors are weighed in the balance they do not persuade me that the use of closed material in relation to the issue of safety on return will necessarily render the process unfair or in breach of the principles of legality. Of most significance is the fact that ignorance on the part of the deportee of the closed material is unlikely to prejudice the conduct of his case. Accordingly I do not accept that the use of closed material in relation to the issue of safety on return is automatically precluded and that Rule 4 is <i>ultra vires</i>. </p>
<i><p class="para">Must Rule 4 be read down?</p></i>
<p class="para">101.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was argued on behalf of the appellants that, if the use of closed material in relation to the issue of safety on return was not always unfair and unlawful, in some cases it would be and that, in consequence, it was necessary to follow the example of this House in <i>MB </i>and read down Rule 4 so that it would not apply where incompatible with the right of the deportee to a fair trial. This submission requires consideration of why it was that in <i>MB </i>the House found it necessary to read down the relevant provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005. The opinions in that case have given rise to difficulties that have led the Court of Appeal to give permission to appeal in another series of control order cases - <i>Secretary of State for the Home Department v AF and others</i> [2008] EWCA Civ 1148. The critical issue in those appeals was whether, applying <i>MB, </i>it was always essential that the gist, or irreducible minimum, of the case against the person subject to the control order should be disclosed to him. The Court of Appeal concluded that it was not. I make no comment on that conclusion. It was based, however, on the premise that the most important question was whether disclosure was necessary to enable the subject of the order to meet the case against him. I have considered <i>MB </i>and reached the conclusion that it supports that premise. Thus Lord Bingham at para 35 said that SIAC’s procedures were not a panacea because it did not enable the person subject to the order to brief his advocate on the weaknesses and vulnerability of adverse witnesses and indicate the evidence available by way of rebuttal. Baroness Hale concluded that it was necessary to read down the relevant provisions in order to deal with those few cases where it would otherwise be impossible to disclose to the controlled person the basis of the Secretary of State’s suspicions against him in a way that would enable that person to give such answer as he might have - para 68. Lord Carswell referred to the extreme situation where the sole evidence adverse to the controlled person was closed material, so that his advocate could not take sufficient instructions to mount an effective challenge to the adverse allegations - para 85, and Lord Brown made observations to the same effect - para 90. </p>
<p class="para">102.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it possible to conceive of a situation where the use of closed material will conceal from the deportee the gist of the Secretary of State’s case on safety on return with the result that it may not be possible to meet that case? I have already referred to the fact that the deportee is unlikely to have information to impart that will be critical to meeting the case of the Secretary of State in relation to safety on return. Quite apart from this, when SIAC’s procedure is considered it is hard to conceive of a situation in which the deportee will not be well aware of the issues that relate to safety on return. The significant matters identified by Mr Chamberlain in relation to the appeals before us were the assurances upon which the Secretary of State relied in concluding that the appellants would not be subjected to inhuman treatment on return. This is an area that Ouseley J dealt with expressly in a lengthy interlocutory judgment delivered on 12 July 2006 dealing with applications by Mr Othman and another appellant, Y, in relation to the use of closed material:</p>
<p class="qt">“Nonetheless, we wish to make one point clear, which emerged more clearly during the substantive appeals. It is our view that the SSHD cannot rely on any substantive assurance unless it is put into the open. It may be the case that encouraging or supportive comments, even if described as assurances by the Government’s interlocutors, should remain in closed if for example they are steps en route to an agreement. But the key documents or conversations relied on to show that an Appellant’s return would not breach the UK’s international obligations or put him at risk of a death sentence or death penalty have to be in the open evidence. SIAC could not put weight on assurances which the giver was not prepared to make public; they would otherwise be deniable, or open to later misunderstanding; the fact of a breach would not be known to the public and the pressure which that might yield would be reduced. They must be available to be tested and recorded.” </p>
<p class="para">It follows that an appellant will be informed in some detail of any assurances relied upon by the Secretary of State as establishing that the appellant will be safe on return. </p>
<p class="para">103.&nbsp;&nbsp;Submissions were made to SIAC at this interlocutory hearing that were similar to those that have been made to the House. SIAC dealt at some length with the submission that the use of closed material was unfair. SIAC pointed out that the 2003 Rules, to which I have referred earlier in this judgment, afford a substantial degree of protection to the deportee and are, in one respect, more favourable than those governing discovery in civil and criminal proceedings. The whole of the wide range of exculpatory material is disclosed, though some of it may only be disclosed to the special advocate, whereas in civil and criminal proceedings material protected by public interest immunity is not disclosed at all. Having considered all the relevant procedures I have concluded that they strike a fair balance between the public interest, to which SIAC is required to have regard, and the need to ensure that the hearing is fair. </p>
<p class="para">104.&nbsp;&nbsp;These appeals have been conducted on the basis of the open evidence alone. The open evidence in relation to safety on return that was before SIAC gave detailed information to the appellants as to the Secretary of State’s case in relation to that matter. I have considered the point made by Mr Chamberlain and Mr Pannick that there were practical problems in the way of obtaining expert witnesses to comment on the closed material. I do not consider that this rendered the procedure unfair. As Mr Tam pointed out, the Rules make provision for the special advocate to draw SIAC’s attention to shortcomings in the evidence and invite the Commission to call for additional evidence. SIAC is an expert Tribunal and could be expected to make a realistic appraisal of the closed material in the light of the special advocate’s submissions. </p>
<p class="para">105.&nbsp;&nbsp;For all these reasons I would reject the appellants’ contention that they have been denied a fair trial by reason of the use of closed material. Furthermore no requirement has been demonstrated to read down Rule 4 in order to accommodate situations where the use of closed material in relation to safety on return will conflict with the procedural requirements of the Convention. </p>
<i><p class="para">Reliance on assurances</p></i>
<p class="para">106.&nbsp;&nbsp;This part of the case is concerned with what are sometimes described as ‘diplomatic assurances’. That phrase is capable of misleading if applied to inter-governmental discussions at the highest level and I shall refer simply to assurances.  </p>
<p class="para">107.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary of State accepted that neither Algeria, in the case of RB and U, nor Jordan, in the case of Mr Othman, was a country to which the appellants could safely have been returned had the United Kingdom not received assurances from the respective Governments as to the way in which they would be treated. In the case of RB and U SIAC held that, having particular regard to the assurances that had been given, the individual appellants would not face a real risk of treatment of a kind covered by article 3 (I shall refer to this hereafter as inhuman treatment) if returned to his own country. Before the Court of Appeal RB and U sought to challenge this finding, but the court held that it had no jurisdiction to reconsider it as the finding was one of fact, not law. Nonetheless the Court of Appeal considered the merits of the challenge and expressed the view that the criticism of SIAC’s decision was unfounded. </p>
<p class="para">108.&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture in relation to Mr Othman is more complex. The assurances in his case, which were contained in a Memorandum of Understanding (‘MOU’) covered all human rights but dealt specifically with treatment if detained, promptness of judicial process and fairness of any trial. SIAC’s judgment extends to some 130 pages in length. SIAC referred repeatedly to the influence of the MOU and found this significant, but it does not seem that this was critical to reducing the risk of inhuman treatment to an acceptable level, for SIAC expressed the following conclusion in relation to the effectiveness of the MOU</p>
<p class="qt">“It is in this context that we examine the effect of the MOU and the monitoring provisions. First, the conclusions which we have reached about the treatment which the Appellant would experience on return, and the lack of a real risk of a breach of Article 3 at that stage, are reinforced by their existence. We expect the MOU to have some influence on the way in which the legal procedures pre-trial are carried out. The MOU and monitoring reinforce our conclusions about other risks, although we have not relied on them as the crucial components which make what would otherwise be a real risk of a breach of Article 3 into something less.”  </p>
<p class="para">109.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Othman sought to challenge before the Court of Appeal the reliance that SIAC had placed on the assurances given by Jordan that he would not be subjected to inhuman treatment. The court followed the decision in <i>RB and U </i>in holding that SIAC’s decision was not open to attack as a matter of principle and also summarily dismissed the suggestion that SIAC’s decision was irrational.</p>
