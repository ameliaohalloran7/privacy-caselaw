<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81.&nbsp;&nbsp;Part 9 of the 2003 Act also introduced specific provision for prosecution appeals: under section 58 the prosecution may appeal in relation to a ruling in relation to a trial on indictment made before or after the commencement of the trial (but before the start of the summing up), but the effect of sections 58(8) and (12) and 61(3) is that the defendant will be acquitted of any offence to which the appeal relates if leave to appeal is not obtained or the appeal is either abandoned or fails before the Court of Appeal. Section 58(7) makes clear that, where the appeal relates to a ruling that there is no case to answer, any other ruling that the prosecution may nominate is also to be treated as the subject of the appeal. Sections 62-63 permit a prosecution appeal in respect of any evidentiary ruling (viz. a ruling relating to the admissibility or exclusion of any prosecution evidence) made before or after the commencement of the trial (but before the opening of the defence case), it being however a condition of leave for such an appeal that the ruling(s) in question should "significantly weaken" the prosecution's case in relation to the offence(s) the subject of appeal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1987 Act as it applies to the present proceedings provides as follows:</p>
<p></p><ul>"7 Power to order preparatory hearing<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Where it appears to a judge of the Crown Court that the evidence on an indictment reveals a case of fraud of such seriousness or complexity that substantial benefits are likely to accrue from a hearing (in this Act referred to as a "preparatory hearing") before the jury are sworn, for the purpose of-<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;identifying issues which are likely to be material to the verdict of the jury;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;assisting their comprehension of any such issues;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;expediting the proceedings before the jury; or<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;assisting the judge's management of the trial,<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>he may order that such a hearing shall be held.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;A judge may make an order under subsection (1) above on the application either of the prosecution or of the person indicted or, if the indictment charges a number of persons, any of them, or of his own motion.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)-(5) â€¦<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>8  Commencement of trial and arraignment<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;If a judge orders a preparatory hearing, the trial shall begin with that hearing.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Arraignment shall accordingly take place at the start of the preparatory hearing.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>9  The preparatory hearing<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;At the preparatory hearing the judge may exercise any of the powers specified in this section.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge may adjourn a preparatory hearing from time to time.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;He may determine-<p></p></ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;â€¦
<p></p><ul>(aa)&nbsp;&nbsp;a question arising under section 6 of the Criminal Justice Act 1993 (relevance of external law to certain charges of conspiracy, attempt and incitement);<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;any question as to the admissibility of evidence; and <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;any other question of law relating to the case.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;He may order the prosecution -<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;to supply the court and the defendant or, if there is more than one, each of them with a statement (a "case statement") of the following-<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;the principal facts of the prosecution case;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;the witnesses who will speak to those facts;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;any exhibits relevant to those facts;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;any proposition of law on which the prosecution proposes to rely;  and<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(v)&nbsp;&nbsp;the consequences in relation to any of the counts in the indictment that appear to the prosecution to flow from the matters stated in pursuance of sub-paragraphs (i) to (iv) above;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;to prepare their evidence and other explanatory material in such a form as appears to him to be likely to aid comprehension by the jury and to supply it in that form to the court and to the defendant or, if there is more than one, to each of them;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;to give the court and the defendant or, if there is more than one, each of them notice of documents the truth of the contents of which ought in the prosecution's view to be admitted and of any other matters which in their view ought to be agreed;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;to make any amendments of any case statement supplied in pursuance of an order under paragraph (a) above that appear to the court to be appropriate, having regard to objections made by the defendant or, if there is more than one, by any of them.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;Where -<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;a judge has ordered the prosecution to supply a case statement;  and <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;the prosecution have complied with the order, he may order the defendant or, if there is more than one, each of them-<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;to give the court and the prosecution a statement in writing setting out in general terms the nature of his defence and indicating the principal matters on which he takes issue with the prosecution;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;to give the court and the prosecution notice of any objections that he has to the case statement;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;to inform the court and the prosecution of any point of law (including a point as to the admissibility of evidence) which he wishes to take, and any authority on which he intends to rely for that purpose;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;to give the court and the prosecution a notice stating the extent to which he agrees with the prosecution as to documents and other matters to which a notice under subsection (4)(c) above relates and the reason for any disagreement.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>â€¦â€¦..<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(10)&nbsp;&nbsp;An order or ruling made under this section shall have effect during the trial, unless it appears to the judge, on application made to him during the trial, that the interests of justice require him to vary or discharge it.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(11)&nbsp;&nbsp;An appeal shall lie to the Court of Appeal from any order or ruling of a judge under subsection (3)(b) or (c) above, but only with the leave of the judge or of the Court of Appeal.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(12)&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to rules of court made under section 53(1) of the Supreme Court Act 1981 (power by rules to distribute business of Court of Appeal between its civil and criminal divisions), the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal under subsection (11) above shall be exercised by the criminal division of the court;  and the reference in that subsection to the Court of Appeal shall be construed as a reference to that division.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(13)&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge may continue a preparatory hearing notwithstanding that leave to appeal has been granted under subsection (11) above, but no jury shall be sworn until after the appeal has been determined or abandoned.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(14)&nbsp;&nbsp;On the termination of the hearing of an appeal, the Court of Appeal may confirm, reverse or vary the decision appealed against."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sections 7(1), 9(3)(b) and (c) and 9(11) of the 1987 Act are key to the present appeal. They remain in the form in which they were first enacted in 1987. I refer in paragraph 97 below to the full original text of section 9(3). I state only at this point that there seems to me little room for doubt that the powers stated in section 9 represent the full range of powers intended to be capable of exercise <i>as part of</i> any preparatory hearing. Section 8 merely locates the preparatory hearing and arraignment as a (separate and first) part of the trial. The right of appeal provided by section 9(11) was an afterthought (see paragraph 79 above) which cannot explain the careful delineation of powers in section 9(3), (4) and (5). However, as my noble and learned friends Lord Hope of Craighead and Lord Rodger of Earlsferry also observe, there is nothing to prevent a judge from exercising - in parallel with, though technically outside the ambit of, any such preparatory hearing - any other powers which he might, prior to the trial proper, have either at common law or under statute. </p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court's interpretation of the legislation</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84.&nbsp;&nbsp;After the enactment of the 1987 Act, there was concern about the number of appeals or applications for leave to appeal that sections 7 to 9 might generate: cf<i> Jennings</i> (1993) 98 Cr App R 308, <i>Hunt </i>[1994] Cr. L.R. 747 and<i> Maxwell </i>(No. 94/7352/S2; 9th February 1995). In a series of authorities the Court of Appeal set limits to the powers afforded by section 9 and, in particular, to the right to seek leave to appeal afforded by section 9(11). In <i>Gunawardena </i>[1990] 1 WLR 703, the court refused leave to appeal against a judge's rejection, during the course of a preparatory hearing, of a defence application to stay the proceedings on grounds of abuse of process arising out of prejudice through delay, on the ground that the application and ruling fell outside the ambit of a preparatory hearing (and so outside section 9(11)). Only rulings on applications which could "be said to relate to any of the specified purposes" in section 7(1) fell within section 9 (p.707B). Further:</p>
<p></p><ul>"outside the purposes referred to in section 7(1) are all kinds of issues which are likely to arise in a criminal trial and which at some time or another will have to be determined. Whether application in respect of them can be made usefully and effectively before a trial, in a pre-trial review possibly, we do not in this judgment have to explore. It may be that in respect of many of them they will have to await the time when the jury has been sworn and the defendants are put in charge. That however is certainly not a novel problem. It is a problem which exists in almost every trial outside fraud today and has existed from time immemorial." (p.707C-D) <p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, the Court of Appeal held it insufficient that a "possible incidental effect of the purposes of the application" fell within section 7(1); the word "consequences" was not to be substituted for the word "purpose": see e.g. <i>Moore </i>Nos. 155/S1/91, etc.; 5th February 1991. Rulings on an application to quash one of several counts and on an application seeking an order that the prosecution elect between two counts thus both fell outside section 9. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85.&nbsp;&nbsp;In later authorities, the court developed a more fundamental objection to rulings on applications of the kind in issue in <i>Moore</i>, namely that sections 7 and 9, read together, are concerned with facilitating trial on the charges indicted, rather than with rulings on applications which will preclude or terminate trial on such charges: see <i>Hedworth </i>[1997] 1 Cr App R 421 (an application to quash an indictment, on the grounds that the charges  were not supported by the evidence in the depositions or notices of further evidence - at p.432E, the Court, while acknowledging that an application to quash charges may be made even after arraignment, said that that "does not affect its nature or purpose. Conceptually it precedes the arraignment and therefore the preparatory hearing"), <i>W </i>[1998] STC 550 (an application to quash or stay on the ground that the Revenue had disentitled itself by conduct from prosecuting) and <i>Van Hoogstraaten </i>[2003] EWCA Crim 3642 (where a judge's ruling that, even if the prosecution proved all the facts alleged in their case, the jury would not be entitled to convict, so that the proceedings fell to be dismissed or stayed, was held to be outside the ambit of section 31 of the 1996 Act, treated as identical to section 9 of the 1987 Act - however, Kennedy LJ commented that, apart from the authority of <i>Gunawardena</i>, <i>Moore </i>and <i>Hedworth</i>, the Court might have found it difficult to resist the contrary submission). These cases contrast uneasily with <i>G </i>[2001] EWCA Crim 442; [2002] 1 WLR 200, where leave was granted to appeal a ruling at a preparatory hearing as to the construction of an indictment, which had the effect of limiting the charge to a small part of the much larger conspiracy that the Crown wished to pursue and of rendering irrelevant 80% of the Crown's evidence, on the ground that the ruling was for the purpose of "identifying issues which are likely to be material to the verdict of the jury" within section 7(1)(a).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86.&nbsp;&nbsp;In further contrast, the Court of Appeal has accepted rulings on the admissibility of evidence as falling within the scope of section 9, despite the difficulty of treating their direct purpose, as distinct from consequence, as having been one or more of the purposes in section 7(1). In <i>Claydon </i>[2001] EWCA Crim 1359; [2004] 1 WLR 1575 (decided in June 2001), and (it appears) <i>R </i>(22 February 2000), to which reference is made in <i>Claydon,</i> applications were made at a preparatory hearing first to stay proceedings and second to exclude certain evidence under section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 ("PACE"), in each case on the ground of entrapment. There was, as Henry LJ put it in <i>Claydon</i>, "a substantial overlap between the two grounds of application: they were effectively two routes to the same end" (p.1582G-H). In each case, the Court held, following <i>Gunawardena</i>, that the ruling on the application to stay fell outside the preparatory hearing, but went on to hold that the ruling on admissibility fell within the preparatory hearing and could be appealed. In <i>Claydon</i>, the Court concluded that the making of a ruling on admissibility (which in <i>Claydon </i>itself involved a voire dire during which the judge heard evidence from some 22 police officers and one of the defendants) should be treated as being for the purpose of "expediting the proceedings before the jury" within section 7(1)(c), even though the Court observed that this did not fit well with the approach in <i>Gunawardena </i>(p.1586B) or in <i>Moore</i> (p.1586D).  The correctness of the Court of Appeal's decisions in <i>R </i>and <i>Claydon </i>was not questioned before the House on the present appeal, and I would endorse the Court of Appeal's willingness to treat issues of admissibility of evidence under section 78 of PACE as falling within section 9. The preparatory hearing would otherwise be unable to cover issues of a kind likely to occupy much time at trial in the absence of the jury.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87.&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn to the area in issue on this appeal: disclosure. In <i>Tariq</i> [1991] 1 WLR 101 (decided ten months after though without reference to <i>Gunawardena</i>, but before <i>Moore</i>), the Court of Appeal heard without objection and allowed an appeal against a judge's ruling at a preparatory hearing ordering defendants to disclose statements of their defence to each other as well as to the court and the Crown. However, after <i>Moore </i>the Court took a different attitude, applying the distinction between purpose and consequences in <i>Maxwell</i> (No. 94/7352/S2; 9 February 1995), and <i>R v. CPS</i> [2005] EWCA Crim 2342 (although the subject-matter of that case may be viewed as no more than case-management).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88.&nbsp;&nbsp;These cases need to be considered in the light of dicta in <i>Shayler</i> [2002] UKHL 11; [2003] 1 AC 247 on sections 29-31 of the 1996 Act. The principle in <i>Gunawardena </i>was acknowledged in the judgment of the Court of Appeal ([2001] EWCA Crim 1977; [2001] 1 WLR 2206, para. 86) and the case was cited in argument in the House of Lords (cf p.250C). But in both courts the value of the preparatory hearing procedure was emphasised. Lord Bingham of Cornhill said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"16. As section 29 makes clear, resort to this procedure is only permissible where the case appears complex or likely to lead to a lengthy trial. But in such cases the procedure can be highly beneficial. The process of disclosure can be conducted, and the marshalling of evidence prepared, with direct reference to the live issues in the case. Jurors and witnesses, summoned to court for the trial, can be spared hours or days of frustrating inaction while issues of law are argued out in their absence. The risk of sudden adjournments to deal with unforeseen contingencies can be reduced. And, perhaps most important of all, the risk that the trial will be conducted on what an appellate court later rules to be a mistaken legal basis, leading to the necessarily undesirable consequence of a retrial, can be minimised if not eliminated. â€¦.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>17. â€¦.. It is however important to stress that the judge's power under section 31(3)(b) is limited to ruling on questions of law 'relating to the case'. This limitation must be strictly observed. Here, the issues of law before the judge were whether the sections under which the appellant was charged, on a proper construction, afford him a public interest defence; whether, if not, those sections are compatible with article 10 of the European Convention; and whether, if they are not, they can or should be read conformably with the Convention or a declaration of incompatibility made. The appellant's case before the judge did not raise any question of necessity or duress of circumstances, and it is a little unfortunate that the judge ventured into this vexed and uncertain territory not 'relating to the case'.<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>H </i>[2003] EWCA Crim 2847; [2003] 1 WLR 3006 (CA) and [2004] UKHL 3; [2004] 2 AC 134 (HL), the judge had ruled at a preparatory hearing that, first, the Crown's public interest immunity application should take place in secret and, second, special independent counsel should be appointed. An appeal was pursued with leave and was dismissed in respect of the first but allowed in respect of the second ruling. No comment was made about lack of jurisdiction in either appellate court. The House at paragraphs 14-17 underlined the importance attaching to disclosure of material which weakens the prosecution's or strengthens a defendant's case, and traced the development of domestic practice from prior to the issue of the Attorney General's Guidelines in December 1981 (<i>Practice Note (Criminal Evidence: Unused Material) </i>[1982] 1 All ER 734), to the case of <i>Ward (Judith) </i>[1993] 1 WLR 619, to the statutory provisions of sections 3-7 of the 1996 Act and to date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>G </i>[2004] EWCA Crim 1358; [2004] 1 WLR 2932 and<i> Goldstone </i>[2005] EWCA Crim 2461, the Court of Appeal rejected submissions that the questions as to disclosure raised before it fell outside the ambit of a preparatory hearing, adopting in each case a relaxed approach which is difficult to reconcile with <i>Moore</i> and cases following it such as <i>Maxwell, Clowes </i>[1992] 3 All ER 440 and<i> R v. CPS</i>.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analysis</p>
</i>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Sections 7 and 9</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, it is necessary to return to first principles, and take a fresh look at the legislation. I consider that courts have to date failed to recognise its full scope, and have in their caution introduced limitations which have deprived it of much utility.  Taken by itself, the decision in <i>Gunawardena</i> would not have had this effect, had a broad view been taken of the purposes in section 7 as well as of the circumstances in which a ruling under section 9 could be regarded as being for such a purpose. But in <i>Moore </i>and later cases the courts have required the direct purpose, and not merely the consequence, of a ruling under section 9 to come within section 7, in order for such a ruling to fall within the ambit of a preparatory hearing. There is, I consider, no justification on any basis for so narrow a reading of these sections. Mr John Rees QC for the appellant indicated that he would be content if the House held <i>either</i> (a) that a broad view was to be taken of the purposes in section 7 and of the circumstances in which a ruling under section 9 could be regarded as being for such a purpose <i>or</i> (b) that section 9 is independent of, rather than subordinate to, section 7. In practical terms, it may not matter which analysis one adopts. My own preference is for the view that, once a preparatory hearing has been validly ordered under section 7, the judge has powers under section 9 which are independent of section 7 (in other words, that the Court of Appeal was wrong in <i>Gunawardena </i>to require any link between the exercise of the section 9 powers and purposes within section 7). But, assuming some link to be required, the Court of Appeal was in my opinion wrong on any view in subsequent authority to require a direct or immediate link, as well as to restrict the exercise of section 9 powers to circumstances where a ruling would promote, rather than preclude or terminate trial before a jury. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once a preparatory hearing has validly been ordered, the power to make a ruling under section 9 is thus on any view exercisable - whatever the direct or dominant object of the application or ruling - whenever the judge reasonably considers that it would also serve a useful trial purpose within one of the heads in section 7(1) to make such a ruling. Courts do not and should not have to engage in minute and, as the authorities show, sometimes elusive arguments, about whether the direct or dominant purpose of the ruling would be one specified in section 7(1); I find it difficult to envisage any case, from now on, in which an appellate court should entertain an argument or refuse to hear an appeal from a ruling on a subject-matter falling within paragraph (b), (c) or (since the 2003 Act came into force) (d) of section 9(3) on the ground that the purpose of the ruling fell outside section 7(1). However, the powers exercisable during a preparatory hearing must, as I have stated in paragraph 83 above, be taken to be limited to those specified in section 9 of the 1987 Act. This does not mean that the judge may not at the same time exercise any other powers which he may have at common law or by statute prior to the swearing of a jury. Their exercise would not, however, strictly form part of the preparatory hearing. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93.&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequent amendments of the 1987 Act and the enactment of the 1996 Act do not lead to a different conclusion. The insertion by section 310 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, with effect from 4th April 2005, of section 7(1)(e) covering "considering questions as to the severance or joinder of charges" and of section 9(3)(d) covering "any question as to the severance or joinder of charges", combined with the expansion of section 9(11) to cover any order or ruling under section 9(3)(d) show Parliament's awareness of the restrictive nature of some of the previous case-law, and a desire to reverse it. But they do not prevent a conclusion that the previous case-law was in fact anyway wrong: see e.g. <i>West Midland Baptist (Trust) Association Inc v. Birmingham Corporation </i>[1970] AC 874, 898F-G per Lord Reid. (In fact, under the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (Commencement No. 8 and Transitional and Savings Provisions) Order 2005 SI 2005/950 article 2(1), Schedule 1 and Schedule 2 paragraphs 3(1)(b) and (2)(c), the insertions conferred no additional power to hold a preparatory hearing in respect of proceedings like the present which were sent for trial under section 51 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 prior to 4th April 2005. To that extent, the power in section 9 seems to have been viewed, in the transitional arrangements, as independent of section 7.)</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Terminating and non-terminating rulings </p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also consider that that the more fundamental conceptual objection, discussed in paragraph 85 above, has no basis. First, an application to quash one of several counts or to require the prosecution to elect between counts (cf <i>Moore</i>) would clearly meet the purposes of clauses (a), (b) and probably also (c) of section 7(1). If that is so, it is difficult to impute to Parliament an intention to cover an application which would limit the trial in such a way, but to exclude an application which would if successful prevent any trial at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95.&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, with regard to the conceptual distinction drawn in <i>Hedworth</i>, there are in my view clear indications in both the Roskill Report and the 1987 Act as originally enacted that this distinction was not envisaged as having the significance which has been attached to it. The Roskill Committee set out and was clearly impressed by the model powers exercisable at a pre-trial review, or directions hearing, under the Central Criminal Court Practice Rules in existence in 1986: see e.g. paragraphs 6.4 to 6.5 and 6.98. Rule 5(h) and (l), set out in the Report at paragraph 6.4, provided that counsel should at such a hearing inform the court "of any point of law which may arise on trial, any question as to the admissibility of evidence which then appears on the face of the papers" as well as "of any other significant matter which might affect the proper and convenient trial of the case". The Report further observed at paragraph 6.5 that "Provision is also made in rule 6 for the judge to hear and rule upon any application by any party to sever any count or defendant and to amend or provide further and better particulars of any count in the indictment". The Roskill Report recommended that the pre-trial review should become a preparatory part of the trial, known as the preparatory hearing. At paragraph 6.97, the Report observed that trials were frequently interrupted and juries sent out and "expensive trial time is wasted" while points of law were argued, some "at the beginning of the trial (for example, a submission that the offence charged is not one known to the law)", some "while the evidence is being given (for example, that the evidence which a witness is about to give is inadmissible)", some "as part of a defence submission of no case at the end of the prosecution's evidence", and "some at the end of the whole of the evidence before the judge sums up". At paragraph 6.98, the Report noted that:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It will not always be possible for counsel to anticipate in advance of the trial every point of law which may need to be raised in a case. In any event the judge would be unable to give a ruling at a preparatory hearing on points of law which depend on the way in which the evidence comes out at the trial. Nevertheless, it would be consistent with our emphasis on the need for more thorough pre-trial preparation, if counsel for the defence were to be required to raise with the judge at a preparatory hearing points of law which go to the root of the case or any point of law relating to the admissibility of the evidence as disclosed on the papers. The Central Criminal Court practice rules state that counsel would be expected to do this, but, as we have seen, there are no sanctions. â€¦."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96.&nbsp;&nbsp;By "points of law which go to the root of the case", it is a fair inference that the Roskill Committee had, in the very forefront of its mind, challenges made at the outset of any trial to the proposed indictment, including applications to sever (cf paragraph 6.5) and submissions that the indictment was invalid as charging an offence not known to law (cf paragraph 6.97).  The power given to the judge to order the prosecution under section 9(4)(a)(iv) to identify inter alia any proposition of law on which it proposes to rely and thereafter to order the defendant under section 9(5)(b)(iii) to inform the court and prosecution of "any point of law (including a point as to the admissibility of evidence) which he wishes to take, and any authority on which he intends to rely for that purpose" would, where exercised, elicit any points of this nature. The power given by section 9(3)(c) would enable them to be determined. </p>
