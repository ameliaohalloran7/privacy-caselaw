<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;182. In describing the depositors' case as "implausible" or "scarcely credible", I should not be taken as making any assumptions about the integrity of the Bank and its officials or as departing from the proper judicial stance of neutrality and impartiality. I do not take the view that the Bank can do no wrong or that public officials are incapable of acting in bad faith. But we are called upon to evaluate the action's prospects of success, and that exercise involves an impartial consideration of the inherent plausibility of the allegations and the strength of the evidence needed to establish them. The scales of justice must be evenly balanced at the commencement of such an operation; but they should not be incapable of movement while the operation is being undertaken.  It is not unfair to observe that, in the absence of some financial or other incentive, a charge of dishonesty against professional men and public officials is possible but inherently improbable.</p>
<i><p>The pleadings: demurrer</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;183. Having read and re-read the pleadings, I remain of opinion that they are demurrable and could be struck out on this ground. The rules which govern both pleading and proving a case of fraud are very strict. In <i>Jonesco v Beard</i> [1930]  AC 298 Lord Buckmaster, with whom  the other members of the House concurred, said, at p 300:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It has long been the settled practice of the court that the proper method of impeaching a completed judgment on the ground of fraud is by action in which, <i>as in any other action based on fraud, the particulars of the fraud must be exactly given and the allegation established by the strict proof such a charge requires" </i>(my emphasis).<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;184. It is well established that fraud or dishonesty (and the same must go for the present tort) must be distinctly alleged and as distinctly proved; that it must be sufficiently particularised; and that it is not sufficiently particularised if the facts pleaded are consistent with innocence: see <i>Kerr on Fraud and Mistake</i> 7th ed (1952), p 644; <i>Davy v Garrett</i> (1878)  7 Ch D 473, 489; <i>Bullivant v Attorney Genera; for Victoria</i> [1901]  AC 196; <i>Armitage v Nurse</i> [1998]  Ch 241, 256.  This means that a plaintiff who alleges dishonesty must plead the facts, matters and circumstances relied on to show that the defendant was dishonest and not merely negligent, and that facts, matters and circumstances which are consistent with negligence do not do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;185. It is important to appreciate that there are two principles in play. The first is a matter of pleading.  The function of pleadings is to give the party opposite sufficient notice of the case which is being made against him. If the pleader means "dishonestly" or "fraudulently", it may not be enough to say "wilfully" or "recklessly". Such language is equivocal. A similar requirement applies, in my opinion, in a case like the present, but the requirement is satisfied by the present pleadings. It is perfectly clear that the  depositors are alleging an intentional tort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;186. The second principle, which is quite distinct,  is that an allegation of fraud or dishonesty must be sufficiently particularised, and that particulars of facts which are consistent with honesty are not sufficient. This is only partly a matter of pleading.  It is also a matter of substance. As I have said, the defendant is entitled to know the case he has to meet. But since dishonesty is usually a matter of inference from primary facts, this involves knowing not only that he is alleged to have acted dishonestly, but also the primary facts which will be relied upon at trial to justify the inference.  At trial the court will not normally allow proof of primary facts which have not been pleaded, and will not do so in a case of fraud. It is not open to the court to infer dishonesty from facts which have not been pleaded, or from facts which have been pleaded but are consistent with honesty. There must be <i>some </i>fact which tilts the balance and justifies an inference of dishonesty, and this  fact must be both pleaded and proved. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;187. In <i>Davy v Garrett</i> 7 Ch D 473, 489 Thesiger LJ in a well known and frequently cited passage stated:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In the present case facts are alleged from which fraud might be inferred, but they are consistent with innocence. They were innocent acts in themselves, and it is not to be presumed that they were done with a fraudulent intent."<p></p></ul>
This is a clear statement of the second of the two principles to which I have referred.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;188. In <i>Armitage v Nurse</i> [1998] Ch 241 the plaintiff needed to prove that trustees had been guilty of fraudulent breach of trust. She pleaded that they had acted "in reckless and wilful breach of trust." This was equivocal. It did not make it clear that what was alleged was a dishonest breach of trust. But this was not fatal. If the particulars had not been consistent with honesty, it would not have mattered. Indeed, leave to amend would almost certainly have been given as a matter of course, for such an amendment would have been a technical one; it would merely have clarified the pleading without allowing new material to be introduced.  But the Court of Appeal struck out the allegation because the facts pleaded in support were consistent with honest incompetence: if proved, they would have supported a finding of negligence, even of gross negligence, but not of fraud. Amending the pleadings by substituting an unequivocal allegation of dishonesty without giving further particulars would not have cured the defect. The defendants would still not have known why they were charged with dishonesty rather than with honest incompetence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;189. It is not, therefore, correct to say that <i>if there is no specific allegation of dishonesty </i>it is not open to the court to make a finding of dishonesty if the facts pleaded are consistent with honesty. If the particulars of dishonesty are insufficient, the defect cannot be cured by an unequivocal allegation of dishonesty.  Such an allegation is effectively an unparticularised allegation of fraud.  If the observations of Buxton LJ in <i>Taylor v Midland Bank Trust Co Ltd</i> (unreported) 21 July 1999 are to the contrary, I am unable to accept them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;190. In the present case the depositors (save in one respect with which I shall deal later) make the allegations necessary to establish the tort, but the particulars pleaded in support are consistent with mere negligence. In my opinion, even if the depositors succeeded at the trial in establishing all the facts pleaded, it would not be open to the court to draw the inferences necessary to find that the essential elements of the tort had been proved.</p>
<i><p>The evidential material: prospects of success</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;191. But I prefer to decide this appeal on the broader and simpler ground that the action has no real prospects of success. In reaching this conclusion I have not relied upon the Bingham report or its findings. My reasons are as follows.</p>


<ul>

1. The grant of the licence<p>
(1) It is clear that the Bank was not entitled to grant the licence in reliance on the LBC. So the depositors can prove that the Bank acted unlawfully. However, it was not unlawful for the Bank to grant a licence, but only to do so without first making its own independent inquiries. It must now be a matter of speculation whether the Bank would still have granted the licence if it had made its own inquiries, so there is a difficult (though I am willing to assume not insuperable) question of causation. The burden of proving this lies with the depositors.   </p><p>
(2) It is arguable that the Bank knew the facts which deprived it of the power to grant the licence in reliance upon the LBC and without making its own inquiries.  But knowledge of facts which deprive a party of the power to take a particular course of action is not the same as knowledge that it is acting in excess of power.  There is no reason to suppose, and not a shred of evidence to suggest, that any official of the Bank appreciated the position, or that any official suspected it but turned a blind eye. If the Bank had realised or suspected that it was not entitled to rely on the LBC, it would obviously have made its own inquiries. It had not the slightest reason not to do so. The facts pleaded, and all the evidence we have seen, are entirely consistent with an honest but (possibly) negligent failure to appreciate the legal consequences of the known facts. This is insufficient to sustain the claim, since the first element of the tort is lacking. </p><p>
(3) Even if the depositors could establish the first element of the tort, they have no prospect of establishing the second. There is no case for supposing that in 1980 BCCI was in fact already insolvent or likely to collapse; and even if it was the Bank obviously had no knowledge or suspicion that it was. As Clarke J said: it defies common sense to suppose that regulators would licence a bank which they foresaw would probably (or be at all likely to) collapse. </p><p>
2.  The failure to revoke the licence prior to 1990.</p><p>
(1) The tort is concerned with the <i>abuse </i>of power by public officials who act in excess of their powers to the injury of the subject. It is not concerned with their failure to exercise the powers they do have, particularly when they have a discretion whether to exercise them or not.</p><p>
(2) The Bank had a <i>power </i>to revoke the licence in certain circumstances. But it had no <i>duty</i> to do so unless the circumstances were such that (objectively) the discretion could only be exercised in favour of revocation. This was never the case, nor is it alleged that it was.  Even if the Bank appreciated (after the event) that it had acted in excess of its powers when granting the licence, this did not impose a duty (as distinct from a power) to revoke the licence. It follows that the Bank never acted unlawfully in failing to exercise its power to revoke the licence.</p><p>
(3) In any case, the Bank's internal documents show that it never believed that it had grounds to revoke the licence, and considered that even if it did revocation would not be justified. There is no reason to suppose (and there is nothing pleaded which would justify a finding) that these views were not honestly (even if erroneously) held. Accordingly, the first element of the tort is lacking. </p><p>
(4) The real problem was that, as the Bank knew, BCCI was effectively unsupervised. The depositors laid considerable emphasis on this, and rightly so; but they did not face up to the consequences. It meant that the Bank did not know enough to justify either letting BCCI continue or closing it down. It was not unlawful to abstain from revoking the licence in these circumstances. The real charge against the Bank is that it never got to grips with the problem of supervision. This may have been negligent, but it did not amount to deliberate wrongdoing or bad faith. </p><p>
(5) The right course may have been to impose restrictions. This never entered anyone's head. The failure to take a step which was never even considered may be negligent but cannot possibly amount to deliberate (or reckless) wrongdoing.</p><p>
(3) The failure to revoke the licence: 1990-91.</p><p>
(1) By 1990 the Bank knew that BCCI was insolvent and fraudulently run. So it knew (for the first time) that there were grounds for closing it down. But it still had to consider whether this was in the interests of depositors, both present and future. </p><p>
(2) No regulator would close down a bank in such circumstances while there was any reasonable prospect of a rescue. The first question is whether, objectively and without the benefit of hindsight, there was a reasonable possibility of a rescue (with new funds and new management) until the section 41 report put paid to it. If so, the Bank was not acting unlawfully in exercising its discretion not to revoke the licence, and the first element of the tort would be lacking.</p><p>
(3) But even if the depositors satisfy the court that there was in fact no reasonable prospect of a rescue, this is not enough. The essential question is whether it was the Bank's honestly held view that there was. There is no reason to suppose and not a shred of evidence from which it could be inferred that the Bank did not honestly believe that a rescue was a reasonable possibility. All the documents we have seen show that this was why the Bank stayed its hand. There is no hint of any other reason.  As soon as it received the section 41 report, and realised that there would be no rescue, it moved to close the business down.</p><p>
(4) The depositors do not even plead the necessary averment. They still plead only that (negatively) the Bank did not believe that there would probably be a rescue. This is remarkable given that Clarke J told them that what they needed to allege and prove was that (positively) the Bank knew or suspected that there would probably <i>not</i> be a rescue. There can be only one reason for their failure to plead the necessary averment: it is because they know that they cannot. In the absence of the necessary pleading (supported by proper particulars), it is not open to the court to find that the Bank knew that depositors would probably suffer loss. The second element of the tort is lacking. </p><p>
(5) The depositors' case is that a regulator has a legal duty to close down an insolvent bank even if it believes that there is a reasonable prospect of a rescue, unless it also believes that a rescue is likely. It is only necessary to formulate the proposition to see that it must be rejected. Nothing could be more inimical to the interests of depositors than to place such a restriction on the regulator's power in their interests to explore every alternative to closure. Not to do so would display the very reckless indifference to their interests of which the depositors in the present case complain.</p><p>


</p></ul>

<i><p>Conclusion</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;192. I agree with my noble and learned friend Lord Hope of Craighead that, while cases should in principle be disposed of as expeditiously and cheaply as the circumstances permit, the most important principle of all is that justice should be done.  But this does not mean justice to the plaintiff alone.  It is not just to a plaintiff to strike out his claim without a trial unless it has no real prospect of success.  It is not just to defendants to subject them to a lengthy and expensive trial to defend their integrity when there is no foundation in the evidence for the attack upon it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;193. In my opinion the depositors cannot establish the requisite elements of the tort in respect of any matter of complaint. They have either failed to make the necessary allegations, or where they have done so they have pleaded insufficient facts in support to entitle the court to draw the necessary inferences. They have produced no document which supports their case, and every document which they have produced and on which they have placed reliance is either neutral or more often contradictory of their case. When in addition regard is had to the seriousness and sheer improbability of their case and the cogency of the evidence required to prove it, the conclusion is inescapable that it has no real prospects of success.</p>
