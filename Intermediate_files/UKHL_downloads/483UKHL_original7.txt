<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;171. The European Court of Human Rights tends to express its decisions in relation to a complete and concluded case.  In the present appeals we are asked to form a view at a preliminary stage.  It is not yet known what the decisions will be.  Far less is it known what grounds, if any, will emerge for dissatisfaction with the decision.  But the practical advantages of testing the issue at this early stage are obvious.  A very considerable expenditure of effort, time and money would have been spent in vain if the decision of the Divisional Court was correct.  The Divisional Court followed the view taken by the Lord Ordinary in the <i>County Properties</i> case 2000 SLT 965 that to wait until the eventual decision after the whole planning process has run its course would be unsound and impractical. That view seems to me to be correct.  It can at least at this stage be affirmed that for the purposes of section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act  it is not necessarily unlawful for the decisions in question to be made by the Secretary of State.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;172. I would accordingly allow the appeals.  The cross appeal which raised an issue regarding the application of section 6(1) and (2)(b) of the Human Rights Act 1998 does not then arise for determination. </p>
<p><b>LORD HUTTON</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;173. In their applications to the Divisional Court the respondents submitted that the respective procedures whereby the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions ("the Secretary of State") "called in" and "recovered" planning applications and decided whether to make a compulsory purchase order were not in compliance with article 6(1) of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms ("the Convention").  This submission was accepted by the Divisional Court and the Secretary of State now appeals directly to this House pursuant to section 12 of the Administration of Justice Act 1969.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;174. Article 6(1) of the Convention provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In the determination of his civil rights and obligations …. everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;175. Prior to the incorporation of the European Convention into the law of England by the Human Rights Act 1998, the law in relation to the functions of a Government minister in respect of planning applications and objections to compulsory purchase orders, as stated in the classic judgment of Lord Greene MR in <i>B Johnson and Co (Builders) Ltd v Minister of Health</i> [1947]  2 All ER 395, was clear.  It was that whilst a quasi-judicial duty to consider objections was superimposed on the minister, the functions which he performed were essentially of an administrative nature and his decision would be arrived at on grounds of puplic policy.  Thus Lord Greene stated, at p 399B:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The administrative character in which he acts reappears at a later stage because, after considering the objections, which may be regarded as the culminating point of his quasi-judicial functions, there follows something which again, in my view, is purely administrative, viz, the decision whether or not to confirm the order.  That decision must be an administrative decision, because it is not to be based purely on the view that he forms of the objection vis-à-vis the desires of the local authority, but is to be guided by his view as to the policy which in the circumstances he ought to pursue."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See also p 397G-H.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;176. Therefore the minister was entitled to overrule the objections of an individual citizen whose property was affected because of his views as to what the public interest required.  But this did not mean that the citizen was subject to the decision of a minister which might be arbitrary and without oversight because, as Lord Greene observed at page 399G-H, the minister was subject to the control of Parliament and he might have to defend his views and his decision in Parliament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;177. The respondents' submissions to the Divisional Court were that when the Secretary of State made his decisions whether to uphold or reject their objections to a planning scheme and whether to make a compulsory purchase order, those decisions constituted  determinations of their civil rights within the meaning of article 6(1). They further submitted that the Secretary of State was not an independent and impartial tribunal because he would come to his decisions in the light of the policy which he had formulated or adopted on behalf of the Government and was duty bound to promote.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;178. The Divisional Court accepted these submissions.  The reasoning of the court can be seen in the following passages of its judgment delivered by Tuckey LJ:</p>
<p></p><ul>"71.	It is common ground that the independence required by article 6(1) is independence from the executive and from the parties.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>72.	The Secretary of State is part of the executive as are all or any of his ministerial team or the civil servants involved in the decision making process.  The contrary is, we think, unarguable which no doubt explains the Secretary of State's stance in these proceedings ….<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>84.	There is no dispute about the position under domestic law.  It is well stated in [<i>Judicial Review</i>]<i> </i>passages from <i>Supperstone and Goudie</i> (1997) at para 9.21 :<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul><ul>'In many administrative situations the possibility of bias is built into the system.  Proposers of the scheme may have strong and carefully thought out views on the subject, and yet may have to hear and rule on objections to it.  Administrators may have guidelines to help them in their day to day application of legislation.  In such situations the concept of a fair trial may be impossible and indeed undesirable to achieve.  It has been pointed out ….. that the more indifferent to the aim in view the less efficient is the minister or civil servant likely to be.  After all, it his job to get things done.  So while the obvious pre-judgment of an issue is not allowed, a challenge to a decision on the grounds of departmental bias is unlikely to succeed.  It is a minister's job to have a policy and to support it in public.'. . .<p></p></ul></ul>
<p></p><ul>85.	But the question we have to answer is whether the position under domestic law can withstand the unqualified procedural right conferred by article 6.  We do not think it can.  The common law approach has inevitably been determined by the constraints imposed by legislation.  The logic is that if legislation vests a decision in a person who is biased or provides for a decision to be taken in a manner which is not compatible with the requirements of independence and impartiality, no breach of the requirements of fairness can be found.  Such requirements of fairness as there may be must be accommodated to the relevant statutory scheme.  But the question now is not how article 6 can best be accommodated in the interests of fairness given the existing statutory scheme, but rather whether the scheme itself complies with article 6.  To accept that the possibility of common law bias is inherent in the system and mandated by Parliament is merely to admit that the system involves structural bias and requires determinations to be made by a person who is not impartial.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>86.	It must follow from these conclusions that the Secretary of State is not impartial in the manner required by article 6 because in each case his policy is in issue.  This is not of course to say that there is anything wrong with his role as a policy maker.  What is objectionable in terms of article 6 is that he should be the judge in his own cause where his policy is in play.  In other words he cannot be both policy maker and decision taker."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;179. The Divisional Court then turned to consider whether the procedures involved in these cases were saved by the High Court's powers of review.  It observed at paragraphs 87-95 of its judgment that decisions of this House have made it clear that the High Court is only concerned with the legality of the Secretary of State's decision; the merits of the case and questions of planning judgment are for the determining authority, not for the High Court.  At paragraph 94 the court drew a distinction between the decision of an inspector and the decision of the Secretary of  State, and referring to the process followed where the Secretary of State makes the decision, it said at paragraph 95:</p>
<p></p><ul>"We do not think this process contains sufficient safeguards to justify the High Court's restricted power of review.  In terms of article 6 the decision on the merits, which usually involves findings of fact and planning judgment, has not been determined by an independent and impartial tribunal or anyone approaching this, but by someone who is obviously not independent and impartial."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;180. In arriving at its decision the Divisional Court found support in the judgment of the Court of Session in <i>County Properties Ltd v The Scottish Ministers</i> 2000 27 SLT 965 which had come to a similar decision in a case concerning a "called in" application for listed building consent under Scottish planning legislation similar to the Town and County Planning Act 1990.  In paragraph 26 of his judgment the Lord Ordinary (MacFadyen) stated:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is the petitioners' Convention right to have their civil rights determined by an independent and impartial tribunal.  In my view the respondents' decision to call in the application for their own decision has brought about a situation in which the determination of the petitioners' civil rights will be made by the respondents, who are admittedly not independent and impartial, and against whose decision there is only a limited right of appeal to this court.  The limitations on the right of appeal are such that it may well be impossible for this court, although indisputably an independent and impartial tribunal, to bring those qualities to bear on the real issues in the case."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;181. Before this House Mr Sumption QC, for the Secretary of State, accepted that the determination of planning applications involved a "determination of civil rights and obligations" within the meaning of article 6(1).  Mr Roderick Macdonald QC, for the Lord Advocate, who intervened on behalf of the Scottish Ministers, submitted that article 6 (1) only applied to claims or disputes concerning legal rights and obligations to be resolved by a judicial process, and not to the administrative process carried on by a minister when he decides a planning application.  Viewed in the light of the common law there would have been obvious force in this submission.  In addition there is support for the submission in some passages in the opinion of the European Commission of Human Rights in<i> Kaplan v United Kingdom</i> (1980)  4 EHRR 64, the Commission stating at paragraph 154:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In the Commission's view the essential role of article 6(1) in this sphere is to lay down guarantees concerning the mode in which claims or disputes concerning legal rights and obligations (of a 'civil' character) are to be resolved.  A distinction must be drawn between the acts of a body which is engaged in the resolution of such a claim or dispute and the acts of an administrative or other body purporting merely to exercise or apply a legal power vested in it and not to resolve a legal claim or dispute.  Article 6(1) would not, in the Commission's opinion, apply to the acts of the latter even if they do affect 'civil rights'.  It could not be considered as being engaged in a process of 'determination' of civil rights and obligations.  Its function would not be to decide (<i>'décidera'</i>) on a claim, dispute or <i>'contestation' </i>.  Its acts may, on the other hand, give rise to a claim, dispute or <i>'contestation' </i>and article 6 may come into play in that way."<p></p></ul>
<p>See also paragraphs 151, 152 and 153.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;182. However I think it is clear that the Commission and the European Court of Human Rights ("the European Court") have departed from this view and have held in a number of subsequent cases that the determination of a planning application by an official or a minister falls within the ambit of article 6(1).  In <i>Bryan v United Kingdom</i> (1995)  21 EHRR 342  in proceedings before the European Court the applicant complained that the review by the High Court of an inspector's decision upholding an enforcement notice was insufficient to comply with article 6(1).  Before the Commission the United Kingdom government had contended that the enforcement notice proceedings did not involve a determination of the applicant's "civil rights", but this contention was rejected by the Commission which stated, at paragraph 38:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The Commission recalls that the right of property is clearly a 'civil' right within the meaning of article 6(1) of the Convention, and the enforcement notice issued by the local authority and the subsequent enforcement proceedings were directly concerned with the way in which the applicant was entitled to use his land.  Consequently, the proceedings in the present case determined a 'civil right'."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;183. In its judgment the European Court stated, at paragraph 31:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Before the court the Government did not contest, as they had before the Commission, that the impugned planning proceedings involved a determination of the applicant's 'civil rights'.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>On the basis of its established case law, the court sees no reason to decide otherwise. Article 6(1) is accordingly applicable to the facts of the present case."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;184. A similar view has been taken in <i>Chapman v United Kingdom </i>Application No 27238/95, 18 January 2001 and other decisions of the European Court and this view is now clearly established in the jurisprudence of the court.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;185. The decisions of the Divisional Court and the Court of Session that there would be non-compliance with article 6(1) in the proceedings which they were considering were largely influenced by the judgment of the European Court in <i>Bryan v United Kingdom</i> and counsel for the respondents placed strong reliance on that judgment in their submissions to the House. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;186. The reasoning of the European Court in <i>Bryan</i> contained a number of stages which I enumerate as follows. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	(1)	Notwithstanding that the Inspector was required to decide the applicant's planning appeal in a quasi-judicial, independent and impartial manner, the Secretary of State could at any time revoke his power to decide the appeal.  In the context of planning applications the very existence of this power available to the Executive, whose own policies might be in issue, was enough to deprive the Inspector of the requisite appearance of independence, and for this reason alone, the review by the Inspector did not of itself satisfy the requirements of article 6(1) (paragraph 38).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	(2)	The court then stated, in paragraph 40:</p>
<p></p><ul>"As was explained in the court's <i>Albert and Le Compte v Belgium</i> [5 EHRR 533] judgment, even where an adjudicatory body determining disputes over 'civil rights and obligations' does not comply with article 6(1) in some respect, no violation of the Convention can be found if the proceedings before that body are 'subject to subsequent control by a judicial body that has full jurisdiction and does provide the guarantees of article 6(1)'.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>The issue in the present case is whether the High Court satisfied the requirements of article 6(1) as far as the scope of its jurisdiction was concerned."<p></p></ul>
<p>(3)	In paragraphs 41, 42, 43 and 44 the court noted that the appeal to the High Court, being on "points of law", was not capable of embracing all aspects of the inspector's decision concerning the enforcement notice served on Mr Bryan and, in particular: "as is not infrequently the case in relation to administrative law appeals in the Council of Europe member states, there was no rehearing as such of the original complaints submitted to the inspector;  the High Court could not substitute its own decision on the merits for that of the inspector;  and its jurisdiction over the facts was limited."  However the court then observed that in addition to the classic grounds of unlawfulness under English law the High Court had power to quash the inspector's decision if the inspector had taken into account irrelevant factors or had omitted to take into account relevant factors, or if the evidence was not capable of supporting a finding of fact or if the decision was perverse or irrational.  </p>
<p>(4)	In paragraphs 45 and 46 the court stated that in assessing the sufficiency of the review available on appeal to the High Court, it was necessary to have regard to matters such as "the subject matter of the decision appealed against" and the manner in which that decision was arrived at, and the court referred to the uncontested safeguards attending the procedure before the Inspector designed to ensure that the Inspector came to his decision in accordance with principles of openness, fairness and impartiality.</p>
<p>(5)	The court then stated, in paragraph 47:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In the present case there was no dispute as to the primary facts.  Nor was any challenge made at the hearing in the High Court to the factual inferences drawn by the inspector, following the abandonment by the applicant of his objection to the inspector's reasoning under ground (b).  The High Court had jurisdiction to entertain the remaining grounds of the applicant's appeal, and his submissions were adequately dealt with point by point.  These submissions, as the Commission noted, went essentially to questions involving 'a panoply of policy matters such as development plans, and the fact that the property was situated in a Green Belt and a conservation area'.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Furthermore, even if the applicant had sought to pursue his appeal under ground (b), the court notes that, while the High Court could not have substituted its own findings of fact for those of the inspector, it would have had the power to satisfy itself that the inspector's findings of fact or the inferences based on them were neither perverse nor irrational.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Such an approach by an appeal tribunal on questions of fact can reasonably be expected in specialised areas of the law such as the one at issue, particularly where the facts have already been established in the course of a quasi-judicial procedure governed by many of the safeguards required by article 6(1).  It is also frequently a feature in the systems of judicial control of administrative decisions found throughout the Council of Europe member states.  Indeed, in the instant case, the subject matter of the contested decision by the inspector was a typical example of the exercise of discretionary judgment in the regulation of citizens' conduct in the sphere of town and country planning."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court therefore concluded that the scope of review by the High Court was sufficient to comply with article 6(1) and held that there had been no violation of that article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;187.  There were two strands in the reasoning of the European Court.  One strand referred to the independent position of the Inspector and to the procedure designed to ensure openness, fairness and impartiality on his part.  The other strand laid emphasis on the consideration that it was a frequent feature throughout the Council of Europe member states that in specialised areas of the law such as judicial control of administrative decisions, the review by a court of law did not extend to a review of a decision on its merits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;188. Counsel for the respondents submitted that the decision in <i>Bryan</i> was distinguishable from the present case because in this case the Secretary of State lacked the independence of an inspector and his decision making process did not have the safeguards which related to the decision making process of an inspector.  In relation to the decision making process of the Secretary of State counsel pointed to the input of views and recommendations from civil servants of which the objectors were unaware and to which they had no opportunity to reply.  Counsel submitted that in <i>Bryan</i> the European Court's reliance on the independence of the Inspector was a crucial part of its reasoning and that, as the requisite independence did not exist when the Secretary of State made the decision, there would be non-compliance with article 6(1) in the present cases;  the consideration that it was a common feature of European systems of justice that a court did not review a planning decision on its merits was not sufficient to prevent a violation of article 6(1).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;189. Whilst there is some weight in these submissions I do not think that they are of sufficient force to distinguish <i>Bryan</i> from the instant case.  It is clear from paragraph 47 of the judgment that it was in relation to fact finding that the European Court referred to the safeguards attaching to the procedure before the Inspector, and I consider that the second strand of the court's reasoning was the more important one.  Moreover, the judgment cannot be viewed in isolation but must be considered in the light of other opinions of the Commission and judgments of the European Court.  I consider that the Strasbourg jurisprudence recognises that where an administrative decision to be taken in the public interest constitutes a determination of a civil right within the meaning of article 6(1), a review of the decision by a court is sufficient to comply with article 6(1) notwithstanding that the review does not extend to the merits of the decision.  Because it is a common feature of the judicial systems of the democratic member states of the Council of Europe that a court does not decide whether an administrative decision was well founded in substance, the Commission and the European court have held that article 6(1) does not guarantee a right to a full review by a court of the merits of every administrative decision affecting private rights, but that there is compliance with the article where there is a right to judicial review of such a decision of the nature exercised by the High Court in England.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;190. This approach is clearly set out and explained in paragraphs 159, 160 and 161 of the opinion of the Commission in <i>Kaplan v United Kingdom</i> 4 EHRR 64:</p>
<p></p><ul>"159.	The Commission has already noted that in the contracting states discretionary powers are frequently conferred on public authorities to take actions affecting private rights.  It is also a common feature of their administrative law, and indeed almost a corollary of the grant of discretionary powers, that the scope of judicial review of the relevant decisions is limited.  In the <i>Ringeisen</i> case<i> </i> the majority of the Commission drew attention to this.  They observed as follows:<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>'It is true that there is in all countries a legitimate concern to protect the citizen against arbitrary administrative action.  This concern may result in the adoption of legislative or other rules concerning administrative procedure.  It may result in the introduction of judicial review of administrative action, and the states members of the Council of Europe have for historical and other reasons adopted widely divergent systems of such judicial review.  One common feature, however, seems to be that there are certain elements of administrative discretion which cannot be reviewed by the judge.  If the administrative authority has acted properly and within the limits of the law, the judge can very rarely, if ever, decide whether or not the administrative decision was well-founded in substance.  To that extent, there is no possibility of bringing the case before an independent and impartial tribunal, even if there is a dispute (<i>'contestation'</i>) between the citizen and the public authority.'<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>160.	Following the court, the Commission does not conclude that article 6 is therefore altogether inapplicable.  However, this factor cannot be left out of account in considering the content or scope of the rights which article 6 guarantees.  The Commission also recalls that its minority in the same case considered that it guaranteed only a right to judicial control as to the 'lawfulness' of administrative decisions affecting civil rights.  It notes further that the limited scope of judicial review in many contracting states is also reflected in the scope of the jurisdiction afforded to the European Court of Justice under article 173 of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community.  Under that provision the court has jurisdiction to review the legality of acts of the Council and Commission of the European Communities only on grounds of<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>'lack of competence, infringement of an essential procedural requirement, infringement of this Treaty or of any rule of law relating to its application, or misuse of powers'.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>These limited grounds of action appear fairly typical of those existing in a number of the contracting states.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>161.	An interpretation of article 6(1) under which it was held to provide a right to a full appeal on the merits of every administrative decision affecting private rights would therefore lead to a result which was inconsistent with the existing, and long-standing, legal position in most of the contracting states."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;191. As I have observed in considering the submissions of Mr Macdonald, the Commission in <i>Kaplan</i> gave a narrower meaning to the words "In the determination of his civil rights" than has been given in subsequent decisions, but the approach stated in <i>Kaplan</i> in paragraphs 159, 160 and 161 has been adopted in a number of subsequent decisions, notwithstanding that those decisions have recognised that the administrative decisions of which the applicants complained involved the determination of civil rights within the meaning of article 6(1).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;192. In <i>X v United Kingdom</i> (1998)  25 EHRR CD 88 where the applicant complained of the decision of the Secretary of State that he was not a fit and proper person to be the chief executive of an insurance company, the Commission held that the scope of judicial review by the Court of Session was sufficient to comply with article 6(1), and the  Commission stated, at p 97:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The subject-matter of the decision appealed against in the present case was a classic exercise of administrative discretion.  The legislature had charged the Secretary of State with the express function of ensuring, in the public interest, that only appropriate persons would become chief executive of certain insurance companies, and the contested decision in the present case was the exercise of that discretion."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;193. In <i>Varey v United Kingdom</i> Application No 26662/95, 27 October 1999 the applicants appealed against refusals of planning permission and inspectors held public enquiries and recommended that the appeals be allowed, but the Secretary of State decided to dismiss the appeals.  The applicants complained that the decisions of the Secretary of State overruling the inspectors' recommendations concerning their appeals disclosed a violation of article 6(1) as the High Court was unable to substitute its own decision on the merits for that of the Secretary of State.  In its response the Government relied on the decision in <i>Bryan</i> as showing that the procedures complained of complied with the requirements of article 6(1).  The Commission found that there had been no violation of article 6(1) and in paragraph 86 of its opinion, after referring to the decision in <i>Bryan</i> 21 EHRR 342, it stated:</p>
<p></p><ul>"While the applicants argue that the scope of review prevents examination of the merits of their claims, the Commission notes that this does not contradict the position, as stated by the court, that the domestic courts will examine whether the Secretary of State had regard to all relevant factors.  It is true that the procedures by the inspectors do not themselves satisfy the requirements of article 6(1), the Inspectors being appointed by the Secretary of State who retains the power of decision, and that the safeguards provided by their quasi-judicial role in the process have been diminished in this case by the Secretary of State's dismissal of the applicants' appeals notwithstanding the inspectors' recommendations to the contrary (see paragraph 78).  However, the Secretary of State gave reasoned decisions on the basis of the facts found by the inspectors, and the matters relied on by him in overruling their recommendations could be challenged on appropriate grounds before the High Court.  Consequently in these circumstances the Commission is satisfied that the power of review of that process by the High Court ensures adequate judicial control of the administrative decisions in issue.  It finds that the applicants have not in the circumstances been deprived of a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal in the determination of any of their civil rights and obligations.  It would observe that matters concerning the compatibility of the subject-matter of the planning decisions with the requirements of the Convention fall to be examined under its substantive provisions." <p></p></ul>
