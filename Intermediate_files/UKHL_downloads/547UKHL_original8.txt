<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;162. I agree with my noble and learned friend Lord Hope that in substance Clarke J asked himself the right questions and that, as he expressed it, he directed himself correctly as to the relevance of the Bingham Report.  My noble and learned friend and those who agree with him are however critical of the actual use made by Clarke J and the majority of the Court of Appeal of the Report.  I consider that with minor exceptions these criticisms are not fair to Clarke J nor to Hirst and Robert Walker LJJ.  The relevant exercise was as I have said earlier not one of making findings of fact or comparable to a trial on admissible evidence.  It was to make a predictive assessment.  To use the Report as an aid was clearly appropriate and proper.  Further, as the plaintiffs themselves said, their pleading and its particularisation was substantially taken from the facts set out in the Report.  They were using the Report to plead their case: "With one principal exception, the statement of claim is pleaded on the basis of the Bingham Report."  (Clarke J at p.48)  It was therefore not only permissible but also pertinent to compare their selection from the history recounted in the Report with the whole and the conclusions drawn in the Report.  If the plaintiffs seek to infer bad faith which Bingham LJ declined to infer or even contradicted, is it realistic to suppose that a judge will hereafter be persuaded to do so?  The Report is in reality at the present stage the context in which the plaintiffs' particulars must be read and their viability assessed.  The approach of Clarke J was careful and fair to the plaintiffs.  He distinguished between the presently available material and that which might become available in the future (pp.166-9).  He said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"I have reached the firm conclusion that on the material available at present the plaintiffs have no arguable case that the bank dishonestly granted the licence to BCCI or dishonestly failed to revoke the licence or authorisation in circumstances when it knew, believed or suspected that BCCI would probably collapse.  There is nothing in the Bingham Report or in the documents which I have seen to support such a conclusion and there is much to contradict it.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul> . . .<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"There is nothing in [the Report] which gives reasonable grounds for supposing that there might be other evidence which might in the future support the plaintiffs' case.  In these circumstances I accept Mr Stadlen's further submission that there is no realistic possibility of more evidence becoming available, whether by further investigation, discovery, cross-examination or otherwise, which might throw light upon the state of mind of the bank or any of its relevant officials during the period in which BCCI was operating."<p></p></ul>
<p>He therefore concluded that the plaintiff's case would be bound to fail and that he could see no justification for allowing the action to continue: "To do so would be to require an enormous expenditure of time and money to no avail."  For myself, I see nothing to criticise in this methodology or chain of reasoning.  The critical matter is whether one agrees with his assessment of the inevitability of failure.  Were this appeal simply about whether Clarke J had misdirected himself or acted improperly in some way in the exercise of his discretion, I would regard it as improper to allow the appeal.  But that is not the manner in which this appeal has been argued.  The defendants have accepted that your Lordships' House should reassess the decision to dismiss the plaintiffs' claim using CPR 24 and it is to that that I now turn albeit with the apprehension that your Lordships may have been over influenced by the plaintiffs' submissions about the relevance of the Report.</p>
<i></i><p><i>The cause of action</i>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;163. This was the subject of the earlier hearing and decision of your Lordships, [2000] 2 WLR 1220.  It is easy to forget that the reason why the plaintiffs have to rely upon the tort of misfeasance in public office is that they cannot allege that the defendants owed them a duty of care.  If the plaintiffs were able to rely upon the tort of negligence, their claim would be easy to formulate and, whether or not it would ultimately succeed, would undoubtedly have to go to trial.  But, in the present context, to formulate and sustain a claim in the tort of misfeasance in public office is not straightforward, hence a need to have regard to its constituents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;164. In the speeches of your Lordships, in which I joined, delivered in May of last year, the essential constituents of that tort were explained.  The tort is exceptional in that it is necessary to prove the requisite subjective state of mind of the defendant in relation not only to his own conduct but also its effect on others.  That state of mind is one equivalent to dishonesty or bad faith and knowledge includes both direct knowledge and what is sometimes called 'blind eye' knowledge.  ('Blind eye' knowledge has since been discussed in different contexts by your Lordships in <i>Manifest Shipping v Uni-Polaris Shipping</i> [2001]  2 WLR 170 and <i>White v White</i> [2001]  UKHL/9.)  These features are referred to in the speeches. </p>
<p></p><ul>"It involves bad faith inasmuch as the public officer does not have an honest belief that his act is lawful."  "The [19th century] decisions laid the foundation of the modern tort; they established the two different forms of liability;  and revealed the unifying element of conduct amounting to an abuse of power accompanied by subjective bad faith."  (Lord Steyn at p.1231)<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"My Lords, I consider that dishonesty is a necessary ingredient of the tort and it is clear from the authorities that in this context dishonesty means acting in bad faith."  (Lord Hutton at p.1266)<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"The official concerned must be shown not to have had an honest belief that he was acting lawfully;"  (Lord Hobhouse at p.1269)<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"The policy underlying it is sound: reckless indifference to consequences is as blameworthy as deliberately seeking such consequences.  It can therefore now be regarded as settled law that an act performed in reckless indifference as to the outcome is sufficient to ground the tort in its second form."  (Lord Steyn at p.1232)<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"The official does the act intentionally being aware that it risks directly causing loss to the plaintiff or an identifiable class to which the plaintiff belongs and the official wilfully disregards that risk. … His recklessness arises because he chooses wilfully to disregard that risk." "Subjective recklessness comes into the formulation at the first and last stage because it is in law tantamount to knowledge and therefore gives rise to the same liability:" (Lord Hobhouse at p.1270)<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;165. Having carefully considered the submissions of the parties on both sides, the material which has been placed before us, what further material may reasonably be expected to become available to the plaintiffs before the time of the trial and the judgments of the courts below, I have come to the conclusion that the appeal should be dismissed.  Like my noble and learned friend Lord Millett, my assessment is that the plaintiffs' claim does not have a real prospect of success.  The majority of your Lordships are however of a different view and would allow the appeal and direct that the case proceed to a full trial on the alleged liability in tort.  Under these circumstances, whilst it is my duty to state what my decision would have been and briefly give my reasons, it is inappropriate that I should say anything which will prejudge the conduct or outcome of that trial when it occurs.  The outcome will be a matter for the trial judge in the light of the ruling which your Lordships have earlier given on the law, the evidence adduced at the trial and the submissions of the parties.  It is the trial judge who will have to decide how the trial should be conducted and what findings of fact to make.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;166. To turn now to the reasons for my assessment of the prospects of the claim, I will structure what I say applying the law as stated last May and applying it to the facts in two periods, first that period ending with the grant of the licence in June 1980, secondly that from July 1980 to the collapse of BCCI in July 1991.  The plaintiffs' complaint in these two periods is different.  In the first period it is that the defendants wrongly licensed BCCI under section s.3 of the Banking Act 1979 when they were forbidden by the statute from doing so.  In the second period the complaint is that the defendants failed to supervise BCCI as they were required to do by the 1979 Act and its successor the Banking Act 1987 and failed to perform an obligation under those Acts to revoke the licence.  I will take the law as stated in my speech, not because it is materially different from what was said by Lord Steyn, but because its analysis is unifying and therefore easier to apply in the discussion of these two periods and was, indeed, the formulation primarily relied upon by the plaintiffs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;167. The commission of the tort has two stages.  The first is the act done by the defendant.  The act must be an unlawful act, not in the sense that it is itself tortious but in the sense that it is contrary to the law for the defendant to have done what he did.  In the case of a failure to act it must be a failure to do a specific act which it was the legal obligation of the defendant to do and which was therefore unlawful.  In either case there must be unauthorised or forbidden conduct.  The conduct must be accompanied by either actual or subjectively reckless, or 'blind eye', knowledge that it is unauthorised or forbidden.  The second stage is that which relates to the defendants' appreciation of the consequences of his conduct.  This may arise from his purpose in doing what he did (my first 'limb', Lord Steyn's first form of the tort) or from his appreciation that the plaintiff will in the ordinary course be caused loss or his consciously and wilfully turning a blind eye to the possibility of such loss (my second and third 'limbs', Lord Steyn's second form of the tort).  Therefore, in making the assessment required by this appeal, one must apply this two stage test to the plaintiffs' case for the two periods.</p>
<i></i><p><i>The First Period</i>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;168. The Act of 1979 introduced a system of licensing for deposit-takers which was new.  The task of the defendants was not easy since they were faced with having to decide for the first time and within a relatively short time-scale whether to grant or refuse a licence to a substantial number of institutions which were already established businesses.  The refusal of a licence would mean that the institution could no longer accept deposits and would have to go out of business. (s.1(1))  However the defendants' statutory obligation was clearly stated.  In s.3(3)(b) and Part II of the Second Schedule, criteria are laid down which must be met unless subsection (5) applies.  In any other case the defendants were forbidden from granting the licence.  The defendants purported to grant the licence under subsection (5).  For this to apply, the principal place of business of the institution must be in a country outside the United Kingdom <i>and</i> the supervisory authority in that country must have informed the defendants that they are satisfied with respect to the management of the institution and its overall financial soundness <i>and</i> the defendants must be satisfied with the nature and scope of the supervision exercised by those authorities.  I consider that the plaintiffs clearly have a fully arguable case that these criteria were not satisfied and that the officials acting for the defendants cannot have believed that these criteria were satisfied.  Therefore the plaintiffs have an arguable case on the first stage of the legal test.  The courts below were of the same opinion and Mr Stadlen for the defendants only faintly argued the contrary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;169. The plaintiffs failed in the courts below on the second stage.  Clarke J said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Both BCCI SA and the group appeared to be profitable, the shareholders appeared to be supportive and willing to supply more capital when asked, the auditors were giving unqualified opinions on the accounts and the LBC continued to give favourable opinions.  [Bingham] also refers to the attitude of the Bank of America, to which I shall return.  In these circumstances, it cannot fairly be said that at this stage the Bank suspected that BCCI would probably collapse."  (pp.42-3)<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"In all the circumstances I have reached the clear conclusion that on the evidence available at present, either as referred to in the Bingham Report or as contained in the documents to which I have been referred, the plaintiffs' case that the Bank knew, believed or suspected that if it gave BCCI a licence it would probably collapse is bound to fail."  (pp.58-9)<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"I must say that, however critical one is of the Bank (and there is plenty of scope for criticism), it seems to me to offend common sense to conclude that before it licensed BCCI SA, in 1980 it actually knew, believed or suspected that if it licensed BCCI SA, BCCI SA would (or even might) subsequently collapse."  ([2000] 2 WLR pp.91-2)<p></p></ul>
<p>In the Court of Appeal, the majority agreed that there was no arguable case on foresight of loss. (p.92)  Auld LJ based his view on the application of a different view of the constituents of the tort, a view which has been held to be wrong by your Lordships.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;170. It is not suggested that the defendants granted the licence with the purpose of causing loss to any of the plaintiffs.  The plaintiffs' case is, rather, that the officials consciously closed their eyes to what might be the consequences to present and future depositors of granting and not refusing the licence.  There is no direct evidence to support this improbable allegation.  The main evidence which is said to support the allegation is in part the self evident proposition that the officials probably had in mind that one of the main purposes of the regime introduced by the 1979 Act was to protect depositors as is stated in the preamble of the Act plus the proposition that if the safeguards in the Act were not observed before granting a licence there must be a risk that depositors will not be effectively protected; and partly that the officials had already learnt some very disturbing facts about the conduct of the BCCI, for example, from the publicity surrounding the withdrawal of the Bank of America.  But there is no evidence to support the appreciation of the officials of the risk they were running nor that, having appreciated it, they wilfully chose to disregard it and hazard the depositors.  At the relevant time BCCI appeared to be a flourishing and successful, though to some extent controversial, institution with very many satisfied depositors.  The evidence both at the time and subsequently is that the officials thought that they would look silly if they raised difficulties for the approval of BCCI and that if they did they would not have been supported if challenged on an appeal.  The objective fact is that no depositor actually lost any money until many years later after much else had happened, including the passing of a new Act in 1987.  Problems of proving legal causation will obviously also arise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;171. There is simply no evidence of any contemplation at this stage that depositors with BCCI would lose their money.  There is no evidence whatsoever, nor any allegation, of any corruption of any official of the defendants, either at this time or subsequently.  The evidence of the requisite <i>subjective</i> state of mind is not there and there is no reasonable basis for believing that it ever will be.  The case of the plaintiffs is in reality one in negligence supported by <i>objective</i> criteria and this does not suffice for the tort upon which they have to rely.  This is as I see it an insuperable difficult for them on this part of the case.</p>
<i></i><p><i>The Second Period</i>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;172. Here the difficulties which the plaintiffs have to overcome are more fundamental.  The foundation of the tort is that the relevant person has done something (in the positive or negative sense) which is contrary to the law.  The statutory provisions upon which the plaintiffs rely are ones which give the defendants powers in respect of licenced institutions.  Their case is that they constitute a statutory scheme which included a duty to supervise the deposit-taker which the defendants failed to perform adequately.  Their more specific case is that the defendants failed to make use of the statutory power given to them under s.11 of the 1987 Act to revoke the authorisation of BCCI, or to exercise one or more of the lesser powers given by sections such as s.12 (restriction of authorisation) or s.19 (directions).  The difficulty for the plaintiffs here is that they are unable to sue in the tort of negligence and that the failures of the defendants which they allege do not have the character of unlawfulness.  They all involve the exercise of discretions and judgment.  There is no allegation which the plaintiffs can make that the statute made it <i>unlawful</i> for the defendants not to take some particular step at any given time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;173. This ties in with the plaintiffs' next difficulty.  There is no evidence that the defendants and their officials were doing anything other than their best to handle the developing situation in a responsible manner in accordance with the Act.  The officials may have been out of their depth.  They may have been more optimistic than was justified now that all the facts are known.  But, particularly in the later stages they were faced with a delicate situation where there were a number of conflicting interests to be taken into account and where any over-reaction would have caused BCCI to collapse without hope of rescue and with far greater losses to its creditors than ultimately occurred.  It is easy to overlook the fact that the defendants' forbearance led to the injection in 1990 of substantial additional shareholder funds (how much these were and what happened to them is apparently questioned).  The situation developed over the years.  In the earlier years, the problem was indiscipline without the anticipation of a threat of default.  Later, that situation developed into one which included a growing threat of failure, at first remote, finally grave and imminent.  But in all these situations the defendants had to exercise judgment.  The wrong step on their part would only make things worse.  In 1988 the "College" was constituted and an international approach adopted in which the defendants participated; the defendants would have been irresponsible not to have done so.  The plaintiffs have sought to identify some four occasions when they submit that the defendants knew that they had grounds for exercising one or more of their statutory powers and decided not to.  Their inaction may be open to criticism.  It can be argued that they should have acted differently but that is not the same as arguing that they acted unlawfully and, naturally, there is no evidence that they knew or even suspected that they might be acting unlawfully.  The plaintiffs wish to present a case of dishonesty but they have not got the material to justify the allegation and have no realistic prospect of ever obtaining it.  Instead, their case seeks to proceed from the proposition that the defendants were under a statutory duty to supervise BCCI to an allegation that the defendants were aware that they were not exercising effective supervision and thence to the allegation that it was unlawful for the defendants not to have exercised one or more of certain powers given to them under the Act.  This is a <i>non sequitur</i>.  The powers remain discretionary.  It does not follow from the proposition that it would have been lawful to exercise one or more of those powers that not to exercise them was unlawful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;174. The same applies to the second stage of the test.  There is no evidence that the defendants were setting out to cause anyone loss.  In the earlier stages they did not foresee the disaster that was to come.  In the later stages they were striving to avoid disaster and, if it proved not possible to avoid it, to limit the losses which would in that event inevitably be suffered.  The officials had nothing to gain.  All the evidence is that they were doing their best.  Once they realised the scale of the problem with BCCI, they did not close their eyes to the consequences of a failure; they attempted to avoid precipitating that collapse which would clearly have been the consequence of the wrong kind of intervention.  One can illustrate the general point from the plaintiffs' own pleading, schedule 5, paragraph 27(ii): the decision not to revoke the full licence in October 1986 was taken because the officials concluded that "there appeared to be no immediate danger to depositors and it seemed unlikely that there were grounds for revoking BCCI SA's licence outright".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;175. The hearing before your Lordships has been concerned with whether the plaintiffs have a real prospect of success in the action.  On any view they face very serious difficulties in presenting and substantiating their case.  The burden of proof is upon them.  The tort upon which they must rely is one which requires the plaintiffs to prove serious allegations of actual bad faith - dishonesty - against the officials.  It is an abuse of process to make the allegations unless the plaintiffs have material to support at least a prima facie case that the allegations are correct.  They do not have that material.  For the action to be allowed to proceed on the speculation, not backed up by any real expectation, that they may before trial find evidence to support their allegations is vexatious.  It is also contrary to the procedural rules now in force.  These rules are based upon sound principles of the administration of justice.  Doing justice includes bringing to a conclusion highly expensive and long drawn out litigation procedures, inevitably complex, which have no real prospect of success.  The real grievance of the actual plaintiffs is that they believe that the law ought to allow actions in negligence against regulators but they accept through their counsel that it does not.  I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p><b>LORD MILLETT</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;176. The Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA ("BCCI") was incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and obtained a banking licence from the Luxembourg Banking Commission ("the LBC") in 1972. In the years which followed it carried on a world-wide business as a bank and deposit taking institution. Shortly after it received the licence from the LBC it established an office in London which eventually became its principal place of business. By 1979 it had 45 branches in the United Kingdom through which it offered a full range of banking services to members of the public.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;177. The Banking Act 1979 came into force in October 1979. The Act made the Bank of England ("the Bank") formally responsible for supervising banks and other deposit taking institutions in the United Kingdom and conferred wide regulatory powers upon the Bank to enable it to discharge its functions. For the first time authorisation was required for a banking or deposit taking business to be carried on in the United Kingdom. The Act applied to companies like BCCI which was already carrying on an existing business in the United Kingdom as well as to those which wished to commence business here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;178. In 1980 the Bank granted BCCI a licence to accept deposits. Withholding the licence would have compelled the closure of BCCI's business in the United Kingdom (and in all likelihood elsewhere), with virtually certain loss to depositors. In granting the licence the Bank relied on the judgment of the LBC and made no independent judgment of its own whether the statutory criteria for authorisation were satisfied. It was not entitled to do this because BCCI's principal place of business was in the United Kingdom. Thereafter BCCI continued to carry on business in the United Kingdom and elsewhere for a further 11 years before it was closed down in July 1991 by regulatory action taken by the Bank. Depositors, most of whom must have become depositors or increased their deposits after 1980, have suffered substantial losses. They blame the Bank for its supervisory failures and seek to hold it responsible for their losses. They believe that the Bank was grossly negligent in granting the licence in the first place and in failing to revoke it or take other regulatory  action long before it did.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;179. Unfortunately for the depositors, a regulatory authority cannot be held liable in English law for negligence, however gross, in the exercise of its supervisory functions. So the depositors have been forced to base their claim on a very different cause of action. They allege that the Bank has been guilty of misfeasance in public office. This is an intentional tort. It involves deliberate or reckless wrongdoing. It cannot be committed negligently or inadvertently. Accordingly it is not enough for the depositors to establish negligence, or even gross negligence, on the part of the Bank. They must establish some intentional or reckless impropriety. As your Lordships ruled unanimously at an earlier stage of these proceedings ([2000] 2 WLR 1220), and in the absence of what has been described as "targeted malice" (which is not alleged), the tort has two elements. In the present case the depositors must prove (i) not merely that the Bank acted unlawfully, that is to say in excess of its powers or for an improper purpose, but that it did so <i>knowingly </i>(or recklessly not caring whether it had the necessary power or not); and (ii) that the Bank <i>knew </i>that its actions would probably cause loss to depositors (or was recklessly indifferent to the consequences of its actions).  Such conduct in a public official is grossly improper and equates to dishonesty in a private individual.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;180. Seen in this light, the depositors' case is a most implausible one. A bank regulator has a very difficult task and one which may call for an exercise of judgment of some nicety, since it must seek to protect future depositors against the risk of loss without  sacrificing the interests of existing depositors. No responsible regulator would contemplate closing down a bank or other deposit taking institution (or taking other action which risked a run on it) with inevitable loss to existing depositors unless there was no alternative, ie unless it considered that collapse was virtually inevitable. A regulator's task has often to be performed on incomplete information and is highly judgmental. Even an action based on negligence would face formidable difficulties. But it is scarcely credible that, unless corrupt, public officials should have been guilty of intentional wrongdoing or have been indifferent to the consequences of their actions to the very people they were supposed to protect. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility, of course, but in the absence of any incentive to act in this way it is in the highest degree unlikely. Certainly such conduct cannot lightly be inferred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;181. But the present case goes far beyond this. The Bank was formally concerned with the supervision of BCCI for more than 11 years (and informally for a further 8 years) and the supervisory attention which it paid to BCCI during this time was very great. The depositors are alleging deliberate or reckless wrongdoing on the part of a large number of officials at different levels of seniority over a long period. This would involve wholesale wrongdoing on a spectacular scale in the public service. Absent any plausible motive for such conduct it is an extravagant allegation. It will require evidence of the most compelling kind to establish. As Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead observed in <i>In</i> r<i>e H (minors) (Sexual abuse: Standard of proof)</i> [1996] AC 563, p 586:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The more improbable the event, the stronger must be the evidence that it did occur before, on the balance of probability, its occurrence will be established. Ungoed-Thomas J expressed this neatly in <i>In re Dellow's Will Trusts</i> [1964]  1 WLR 451, 455: "The more serious the allegation the more cogent is the evidence required to overcome the unlikelihood of what is alleged and thus to prove it."<p></p></ul>
<p>In the absence of evidence to support the allegation, it would be an abuse of process to make it. It is not at all surprising that the depositors have striven hard to avoid pleading any such case until they were compelled to do so, preferring instead to argue that it was not necessary.</p>
