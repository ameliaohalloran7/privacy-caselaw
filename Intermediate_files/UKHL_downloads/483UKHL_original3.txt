<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;63. My Lords, I have found it reassuring to read, in the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights and of the Commission in the cases of <i>Bryan</i> 21 EHRR 342, <i>ISHKON</i> 8 March 1994, <i>Chapman,</i> 18 January 2001, and <i>Varey,</i> 27 October 1999 the expression of views which to my mind strongly support the contentions of the Secretary of State. If, as I understand to be the case, your Lordships are unanimous in considering that the appeals should be allowed, I trust that the decision of your Lordships' House will be seen, not as in any way inconsistent with those decisions, but on the contrary as a contribution to the growth of Convention jurisprudence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;64. I would only add that the particular grounds of objection taken by some respondents to the role of the Secretary of State, such as the objection in <i>Alconbury</i> based on the ground of his having a financial interest in the matter, might if appropriate be raised as objections to the ultimate decision itself. They are insufficient to disqualify him <i>in limine.</i></p>
<p><b>LORD HOFFMANN</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<i><p>The issue</p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;65. The issue in these three appeals is whether  it is compatible with the Human Rights Act 1998 for Parliament to confer upon the Secretary of State the power to make decisions which affect people's rights to the ownership, use or enjoyment of land.  The Divisional Court has decided that article 6 of the European Convention requires such decisions to be made by independent and impartial tribunals.  This would mean radical amendment to the system by which such decisions have been made for many years. In view of the importance of the case, your Lordships have given leave for an appeal to be brought directly from the Divisional Court.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66. Although the principle must be of general application, the contexts in which the question has arisen in these appeals are planning, highway improvement and compulsory purchase.  In the first appeal ("the <i>Alconbury</i> case"), a company has applied for planning permission to construct a distribution centre of national significance on a disused American air base near Huntingdon. It could generate 7,000 new jobs but would obviously affect the lives of many people living in the neighbourhood.  In the second appeal ("the <i>Holding &amp; Barnes</i> case"), the respondents have applied for planning permission to use land at Canvey Island for the storage and sale of wrecked cars.  Again, the activity will generate employment but the site is close to some gas storage installations and the Health and Safety Executive thinks that this would create a danger to people living in the area.  In the third appeal ("the <i>Legal and General</i> case"), the respondent owns land near the interchange between the M4 motorway and the A34 trunk road at Newbury.  The Highways Agency, a branch of the department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, has promoted a road improvement scheme which would involve taking the respondent's land.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;67. In each of these cases the statutory decision maker is the Secretary of State.  In the first two, this is by virtue of his exercise of a statutory discretion.  In the <i>Alconbury</i> case, the application for planning permission has been refused by the Huntingdonshire District Council and the developer has appealed to the Secretary of State.  The appeal could have been determined under Schedule 6 to the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 by an inspector appointed to conduct a public inquiry, but the Secretary of State has exercised his discretion under paragraph 3 of the Schedule to "recover" the appeal and decide it himself.  In the <i>Holding &amp; Barnes</i> case, the local planning authority was minded to grant permission but the Secretary of State has exercised his power under section 77 of the 1990 Act to "call in" the application and decide it himself.  In the <i>Legal and General</i> case, the Secretary of State is the only statutory decision maker. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;68. All three cases involve general social and economic issues. They concern the rights of individuals to use, enjoy and own their land. But the number of persons potentially interested is very large and the decisions involve the consideration of questions of general welfare, such as the national or local economy, the preservation of the environment, the public safety, the convenience of the road network, all of which transcend the interests of any particular individual.</p>
<i></i><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Democracy and the rule of law</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;69. In a democratic country, decisions as to what the general interest requires are made by democratically elected bodies or persons accountable to them.  Sometimes the subject-matter is such that Parliament can itself lay down general rules for enforcement by the courts.  Taxation is a good example; Parliament decides on grounds of general interest what taxation is required and the rules according to which it should be levied.  The application of those rules, to determine the liability of a particular person, is then a matter for independent and impartial tribunals such as the General or Special Commissioners or the courts.  On the other hand, sometimes one cannot formulate general rules and the question of what the general interest requires has to be determined on a case by case basis.  Town and country planning or road construction, in which every decision is in some respects different, are archetypal examples.  In such cases Parliament may delegate the decision-making power to local democratically elected bodies or to ministers of the Crown responsible to Parliament.  In that way the democratic principle is preserved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70. There is no conflict between human rights and the democratic principle.  Respect for human rights requires that certain basic rights of individuals should not be capable in any circumstances of being overridden by the majority, even if they think that the public interest so requires.  Other rights should be capable of being overridden only in very restricted circumstances.  These are rights which belong to individuals simply by virtue of their humanity, independently of any utilitarian calculation.  The protection of these basic rights from majority decision requires that independent and impartial tribunals should have the power to decide whether legislation infringes them and either (as in the United States) to declare such legislation invalid or (as in the United Kingdom) to declare that it is incompatible with the governing human rights instrument.  But outside these basic rights, there are many decisions which have to be made every day (for example, about the allocation of resources) in which the only fair method of decision is by some person or body accountable to the electorate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;71. All democratic societies recognise that while there are certain basic rights which attach to the ownership of property, they are heavily qualified by considerations of the public interest.  This is reflected in the terms of article 1 of Protocol 1 to the Convention:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions.  No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a state to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72. Thus, under the first paragraph,  property may be taken by the state, on payment of compensation, if the public interest so requires.  And, under the second paragraph, the use of property may be restricted without compensation on similar grounds.  Importantly, the question of what the public interest requires for the purpose of article 1 of Protocol 1 can, and in my opinion should, be determined according to the democratic principle - by elected local or central bodies or by ministers accountable to them.  There is no principle of human rights which requires such decisions to be made by independent and impartial tribunals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73. There is however another relevant principle which must exist in a democratic society.  That is the rule of law.  When ministers or officials make decisions affecting the rights of individuals, they must do so in accordance with the law. The legality of what they do must be subject to review by independent and impartial tribunals. This is reflected in the requirement in article 1 of Protocol 1 that a taking of property must be "subject to the conditions provided for by law".  The principles of judicial review give effect to the rule of law. They ensure that administrative decisions will be taken rationally, in accordance with a fair procedure and within the powers conferred by Parliament. But this is not the occasion upon which to discuss the limits of judicial review.  The only issue in this case is whether the Secretary of State is disqualified as a decision-maker because he will give effect to policies with which, ex hypothesi, the courts will not interfere.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of principle</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74. My Lords, these basic principles are the background to the interpretation of article 6(1):</p>
<p></p><ul>"In the determination of his civil rights and obligations…everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from authority, I would have said that a decision as to what the public interest requires is not a "determination" of civil rights and obligations.  It may affect civil rights and obligations but it is not, and ought not to be, a judicial act such as article 6 has in contemplation. The reason is not simply that it involves the exercise of a discretion, taking many factors into account, which does not give any person affected by the decision the right to any particular outcome.  There are many such decisions made by courts (especially in family law) of which the same can be said.  Such decisions may nevertheless be determinations of an individual's civil rights (such as access to his child: compare <i>W v United Kingdom</i> (1987)  10 EHRR 29) and should be made by independent and impartial tribunals.  But a decision as to the public interest (what I shall call for short a "policy decision") is quite different from a determination of right. The administrator may have a duty, in accordance with the rule of law, to behave fairly ("quasi-judicially") in the decision-making procedure.  But the decision itself is not a judicial or quasi-judicial act. It does not involve deciding between the rights or interests of particular persons. It is the exercise of a power delegated by the people as a whole to decide what the public interest requires.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75. The distinction between policy decisions and determinations of right was put with great clarity by Lord Greene MR in <i>B Johnson &amp; Co (Builders) Ltd v Minister of Health</i> [1947]  2 All ER 395, 398-399, when speaking of the decision to confirm a compulsory purchase order:</p>
<p></p><ul>"…[T]he functions of the minister in carrying these provisions into operation are fundamentally administrative… subject only to the qualification that, at a particular stage and for a particular and limited purpose, there is superimposed on his administrative character a character which is loosely described as 'quasi-judicial'.  The language which has always been construed as giving rise to the obligations, whatever they may be, implied in the words 'quasi-judicial' is to be found in the duty to consider the objections.…The administrative character in which he acts reappears at a later stage because, after considering the objections, which may be regarded as the culminating point of his quasi-judicial functions, there follows something which again, in my view, is purely administrative, viz, the decision whether or not to confirm the order.  That decision must be an administrative decision, because it is not to be based purely on the view that he forms of the objections, vis-a-vis the desires of the local authority, but is to be guided by his view as to the policy which in the circumstances he ought to pursue… [O]n the substantive matter, viz, whether the order should be confirmed or not, there is a third party who is not present, viz, the public, and it is the function of the minister to consider the rights and the interests of the public.  That by itself shows that it is completely wrong to treat the controversy between objector and local authority as a controversy which covers the whole of the ground.  It is in respect of the public interest that the discretion that Parliament has given to the minister comes into operation.…His views on that matter he must, if necessary, defend in Parliament, but he cannot be called on to defend them in the courts."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76. In principle, therefore, and apart from authority, I would say that article 6(1) conferred the right to an independent and impartial tribunal to decide whether a policy decision by an administrator such as the Secretary of State was lawful but not to a tribunal which could substitute its own view of what the public interest required.  However, section 2(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998 requires an English court, in determining a question which has arisen in connection with a Convention right, to take into account the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights ("the European court") and the opinions of the Commission.  The House is not bound by the decisions of the European court and, if I thought that the Divisional Court was right to hold that they compelled a conclusion fundamentally at odds with the distribution of powers under the British constitution, I would have considerable doubt as to whether they should be followed.  But  in my opinion the Divisional Court misunderstood the European jurisprudence.  Although the route followed by the European court has been a tortuous one and some of its statements require interpretation, I hope to demonstrate that it has never attempted to undermine the principle that policy decisions within the limits imposed by the principles of judicial review are a matter for democratically accountable institutions and not for the courts. </p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The European jurisprudence</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77. The main European authorities are four decisions, two of the Commission and two of the European court, which deal specifically with the English planning system.  But before I analyse these important cases, I must give a more general account of the development of the jurisprudence on the right to an independent and impartial tribunal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78. As a matter of history it seems likely that the phrase "civil rights and obligations" was intended by the framers of the Convention to refer to rights created by private rather than by public law.  In  other words, it excluded even the right to a decision as to whether a public body had acted lawfully, which English law, with that lack of a clear distinction between public and private law which was noted by Dicey, would treat as part of the civil rights of the individual.  Sir Vincent Evans, in his dissenting judgment in <i>Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v. Belgium</i> (1981)  4 EHRR 1, 36, said that an intention that the words should bear this narrow meaning appeared from the negotiating history of the Convention. In his dissenting judgment in <i>König v Federal Republic of Germany</i> (1978) 2 EHRR 170, Judge Matscher said that the primary purpose of article 6(1) was, by way of reaction against arbitrary punishments under the Third Reich, to establish the right to an independent court in criminal proceedings.  The framers extended that concept to cases which, according to the systems of the majority of contracting states, fell within the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts of civil law.  But there was no intention to apply article 6(1) to public law, which was on the continent a matter for the administrative courts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79. These views of the meaning of "civil rights and obligations" are only of historical interest, because, as we shall see, the European court has not restricted article 6(1) to the determination of rights in private law.  The probable original meaning, which Judge Wiarda said, at p 205, in <i>König's</i> case was the "classical meaning" of the term "civil rights" in a civilian system of law, is nevertheless important. It explains the process of reasoning, unfamiliar to an English lawyer, by which the Strasbourg court has arrived at the conclusion that article 6(1) can have application to administrative decisions.  The court has not simply said, as I have suggested one might say in English law, that one can have a "civil right" to a  lawful decision by an administrator.  Instead, the court has accepted that "civil rights" means only rights in private law and has applied article 6(1) to administrative decisions on the ground that they can determine or affect rights in private law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80. The seminal case is <i>Ringeisen v Austria (No 1)</i> (1971) 1 EHRR 455.  This concerned an Austrian statute which required transfers of agricultural land to be approved by a District Land Transactions Commission with a right of appeal to a Regional Commission.  In the absence of approval, the contract of sale was void.  The purpose of the law was to keep agricultural land in the hands of farmers of small and medium holdings and the District Commission was required to refuse consent to a transfer which appeared to violate this policy.  This was a classic regulatory power exercisable by an administrative body.  The court nevertheless held that article 6(1) was applicable to its decision on the ground that it was "decisive" for the enforceability of the private law contract for the sale of land.  Thus a decision on a question of public law by an administrative body could attract article 6(1) by virtue of its effect on private law rights.  On the facts, the court held that article 6(1) had been satisfied because the Regional Commission was an independent and impartial tribunal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81. The full implications of <i>Ringeisen</i> were not examined by the court until some years later.  It led in <i>König v Germany</i> 2 EHRR 170 to a sharp disagreement between those members of the court who saw it as a means of enforcing minimum standards of judicial review of administrative and domestic tribunals and those who regarded it as a potential Pandora's box and wanted to confine it as narrowly as possible.  Dr. König was a surgeon charged with unprofessional conduct before a specialist medical tribunal attached to the Frankfurt Administrative Court.  It withdrew his right to practice and run a clinic.  He appealed to an administrative Court of Appeal and there followed lengthy and complicated proceedings. His complaint to the European court under article 6(1) was that he had been denied the right to a decision "within a reasonable time".  But this raised the question of whether, in principle, article 6(1) applied to disciplinary proceedings before an administrative court.  By a majority, the court held that it did.  On the <i>Ringeisen</i> principle, it affected private law rights such as his goodwill and his right to sell his services to members of the public. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82. Judge Matscher delivered a powerful dissent, saying that it was unwise to try to apply the pure judicial model of article 6(1) to the decisions of administrative or domestic tribunals.  They might share some characteristics with courts (eg requirements of fairness) but in other respects they were different.  For example, one could not apply the imperative of a public hearing to a professional disciplinary body.  A private hearing might be more in the public interest.  If article 6(1) was going to be applied to administrative law, it would have to be substantially modified. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83. The majority view which prevailed in <i>König's </i>case has enabled the court to develop a jurisprudence by which it has imposed a requirement that all administrative decisions should be subject to some form of judicial review.  Sweden, for example, has been held to be in breach of article 6(1) on a number of occasions because it lacked any procedure by which a Government decision could be challenged in the courts: see <i>Sporrong and Lönnroth v Sweden</i> (1982) 5 EHRR 35; <i>Bodén v Sweden</i>  (1987) 10 EHRR 367; <i>Tre Traktörer Aktiebolag v Sweden</i> (1989) 13 EHRR 309; <i>Allan Jacobsson v Sweden</i> (1989) 12 EHRR 56; <i>Pudas v Sweden</i> (1987) 10 EHRR 380;  <i>Zander v Sweden</i> (1993) 18 EHRR 175; <i>Skärby v Sweden</i> (1990) 13 EHRR 90.  In <i>Benthem v The Netherlands</i> (1985) 8 EHRR 1 the Netherlands was similarly held to be in breach because in constitutional theory the administrative court to which an appeal lay only tendered advice to the Crown which it was entitled to reject.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84. But the dissent of Judge Matscher in <i>König's </i>case 2 EHRR 170 has been vindicated in the sense that the application of article 6 to administrative decisions has required substantial modification of the full judicial model.  The cases establish that article 6(1) requires that there should be the possibility of some form of judicial review of the lawfulness of an administrative decision.  But the European court, in deciding the <i>extent</i> to which such decisions should be open to review, has been in practice fairly circumspect. Its jurisprudence on this point has however been complicated by the apparent breadth of some statements in two cases concerning medical disciplinary proceedings in Belgium.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85. In <i>Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v Belgium</i>  (1981) 4 EHRR 1 three doctors who had been suspended by a disciplinary tribunal sitting in private claimed that their right to a public hearing under article 6 had been infringed.  They had a right of appeal to the Cour de Cassation, which did sit in public, but that was only on a point of law.  The European court said, at paragraph 51, that this was not good enough:</p>
<p></p><ul>"article 6 draws no distinction between questions of fact and questions of law.  Both categories of question are equally crucial for the outcome of proceedings relating to 'civil rights and obligations'. Hence the 'right to a court' and the right to a judicial determination of a dispute cover questions of fact just as much as questions of law.  Yet the Court of Cassation does not have jurisdiction to rectify factual errors or to examine whether the sanction is proportionate to the fault.  It follows that article 6(1) was not satisfied…" <p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86. In the later case of <i>Albert and Le Compte v Belgium</i> (1983) 5 EHRR 533, in which a similar situation arose, the court said, at paragraph 29, that although disciplinary jurisdiction could be conferred upon professional bodies which did not meet the requirements of article 6(1) (eg because they were not "established by law" or did not sit in public):</p>
<p></p><ul>"Nonetheless, in such circumstances the Convention calls at least for one of the two following systems: either the jurisdictional organs themselves comply with the requirements of article 6(1), or they do not so comply but are subject to subsequent control by a judicial body that has full jurisdiction and does provide the guarantees of article 6(1)."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87. The reference to "full jurisdiction" has been frequently cited in subsequent cases and sometimes relied upon in argument as if it were authority for saying that a policy decision affecting civil rights by an administrator who does not comply with article 6(1) has to be reviewable on its merits by an independent and impartial tribunal.  It was certainly so relied upon by counsel for the respondents in these appeals.  But subsequent European authority shows that "full jurisdiction" does not mean full decision-making power.  It means full jurisdiction to deal with the case as the nature of the decision requires. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88. This emerges most clearly from the decisions on the English planning cases, which I shall analyse later in some detail.  But the leading European authority for the proposition that it is not necessary to have a review of the merits of a policy decision is <i>Zumtobel v Austria</i> (1993) 17 EHRR 116.  The Zumtobel partnership objected to the compulsory purchase of their farming land to build the L52 by-pass road in the Austrian Vorarlberg.  The appropriate Government committee heard their objections but confirmed the order.  They appealed to an administrative court which said that the Government had taken proper matters into account and that it was not entitled to substitute its decision for that of the administrative authority.   They complained to the Commission and the European court that, as the administrative court could not "independently assess the merits and the facts of the case", it did not have "full jurisdiction" within the meaning of the <i>Albert and Le Compte</i> formula.  The European court said, at paragraph 32, that its jurisdiction was sufficient in the circumstances of the case, "[r]egard being had to the respect which must be accorded to decisions taken by the administrative authorities on grounds of expediency and to the nature of the complaints made by the Zumtobel partnership".</p>
<i></i><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enforcement proceedings in English law</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89. This background should make it easier to follow the reasoning of the Commission and the European court in the four cases in which they have specifically considered the English planning system.  But before I examine these cases, it is necessary to say something more about certain aspects of English planning law.  Since the appointed day under the Town and Country Planning Act 1947 (1 July 1948), planning permission has been required in respect of any development of land: see section 12(1) of the 1947 Act and now section 57(1) of the 1990 Act.  Development without planning permission is a "breach of planning control": see section 171A of the 1990 Act as inserted by section 4 of the Planning and Compensation Act 1991.  But a breach of planning control does not in itself give rise to any criminal or civil liability.  It is necessary for the local planning authority to take enforcement proceedings in accordance with Part VII of the 1990 Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90. In applying the distinction between policy decisions and the determination of rights, one would expect that, while the question of whether planning permission should be granted was a matter of policy, the question of whether a breach of planning control had taken place would involve a determination of right.  It is no different in principle from a determination as to whether a person has contravened any other rule.  No questions of policy are involved in the decision as to whether there has been a breach of planning control or not.  So prima facie one would think that enforcement proceedings should fall within the category of decisions in which one was entitled to the judgment of an independent and impartial tribunal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91. This was the view of Parliament when it enacted the 1947 Act.  Section 23(1) provided that if it appeared to a local planning authority that there had been a breach of planning control, it could within a period of four years of the breach serve an "enforcement notice" upon the owner and occupier of the land.  The notice could require him to restore the land to its previous condition or discontinue any use of the land.  The notice took effect after a specified period of not less than 28 days and if the owner nevertheless failed to restore the land to its previous condition, the local planning authority could enter, take the necessary steps and require him to pay the cost.  If he did not comply with a notice requiring him to discontinue a use of land,  he could be prosecuted before the magistrates and fined: see section 24(1) and (3).</p>
