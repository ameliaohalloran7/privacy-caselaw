<p align="right"><a href="adan-2.htm">(back to preceding text)</a></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Pannick Q.C., on behalf of the Secretary of State, submitted that notwithstanding that the courts of the United Kingdom apply the persecution theory and the courts of Germany and France apply the accountability theory, the Secretary of State was entitled to be of the opinion that Germany would not send Ms. Adan to Somalia "otherwise and in accordance with the Convention", and that France would not send Mr. Aitseguer to Algeria "otherwise than in accordance with the Convention".</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Pannick advanced four main submissions which I summarise as follows:</p>

<p>1.	Section 2(1)(a) of the 1996 Act requires the Secretary of State to form an opinion whether, in relation to a particular asylum-seeker, the government of another State would act in accordance with the Convention.  The sub-section should not be construed as requiring the Secretary of State to reach a conclusion on what is a difficult and disputed issue of international law.  Parliament could not have intended the Secretary of State to decide whether or not the decision of a German court or a French court on an application for asylum in that country was correct in law.  </p>

<p>2.	Moreover, having regard to the principle of comity under which the courts of one country are very slow to adjudicate upon the actions or decisions of another country or its courts acting within the territory of that country, Parliament could not have intended that the Secretary of State or the courts of this country might, in effect, have to make a decision that an action by the German or French governments or a ruling by a German or French court was wrong in law.</p>

<p>3.	The purpose of section 2 was to give effect to the arrangements made in the Dublin Convention, and those arrangements were intended to ensure that where a refugee sought asylum in more than one Member State, his or her application for asylum would be considered only by one state, and under those arrangements the applications of Ms. Adan and Mr. Aitseguer were to be heard and determined respectively by Germany and France.</p>

<p>4.	Mr. Pannick also placed reliance on paragraph 5.2 of the Joint Position of 4 March 1996 of the Member States on the harmonized application of the definition of the term "refugee" in Article I of the Geneva Convention:</p>

<p></p><ul>"Persecution by third parties<p></p></ul>

<p></p><ul>Persecution by third parties will be considered to fall within the scope of the Geneva Convention where it is based on one of the grounds in Article 1A of that Convention, is individual in nature and is encouraged or permitted by the authorities.  Where the official authorities fail to act, such persecution should give rise to individual examination of each application for refugee status, in accordance with national judicial practice, in the light in particular of whether or not the failure to act was deliberate.  The person concerned may be eligible in any event for appropriate forms of protection under national law".  <p></p></ul>

<p>He submitted that the wording of the statement shows that it was accepted that the Convention did not give protection to asylum-seekers unless there was complicity by the State in the persecution which they feared. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, I consider that Mr. Pannick's second submission relating to comity is of limited weight as the purpose of an English court in determining applications such as the present ones is not to pass judgment on the validity of a decision of a French or German court but to decide if the English Secretary of State has acted lawfully in deciding to remove a claimant for asylum from England.</p>

<p>The Preamble to the Joint Position states:</p>

<p></p><ul>"Having established that the Handbook of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is a valuable aid to Member States in determining refugee status;"<p></p></ul>

<p>and I think that the weight of Mr. Pannick's fourth submission is reduced by the observations in the Handbook.  Paragraph 65 states:</p>

<p></p><ul>"Persecution is normally related to action by the authorities of a country.  It may also emanate from sections of the population that do not respect the standards established by the laws of the country concerned.  A case in point may be religious intolerance, amounting to persecution, in a country otherwise secular, but where sizeable fractions of the population do not respect the religious beliefs of their neighbours.  Where serious discriminatory or other offensive acts are committed by the local populace, they can be considered as persecution if they are knowingly tolerated by the authorities, or if the authorities refuse, or prove unable, to offer effective protection."<p></p></ul>

<p>And paragraph 98 states:</p>

<p></p><ul>"Being <i>unable</i> to avail himself of such protection implies circumstances that are beyond the will of the person concerned.  There may, for example, be a state of war, civil war or other grave disturbance, which prevents the country of nationality from extending protection or makes such protection ineffective.  Protection by the country of nationality may also have been denied to the applicant.  Such denial of protection may confirm or strengthen the applicant's fear of persecution, and may indeed be an element of persecution."<p></p></ul>

<p>However, I consider that the first and third arguments advanced on behalf of the Secretary of State are of considerable weight.  Where it is agreed between states that a particular legal issue under an international convention, which could arise for determination in a number of the states, be determined by one of them, it can be strongly argued that the issue should be resolved in accordance with the legal doctrines of that state and that a government minister of another state would not be required to form and express an opinion whether or not the decision of a court of that other state was correct in its interpretation of the convention.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a further consideration, however, which has to be taken into account. On the Secretary of State's case, section 2 of the 1996 Act constitutes a diminution in a human right given to an asylum-seeker by an international convention incorporated into the law of the United Kingdom by a United Kingdom statute.  Under the law of the United Kingdom, as decided by this House in <i>Adan v. The Secretary of State for the Home Department</i>, an asylum-seeker is entitled to the protection to Article 33 notwithstanding that the state in whose territory he fears persecution is not complicit in that persecution.  This is an important human right and, because the courts of Germany and France will rule that Article 33 does not give this right, the effect of section 2, if the construction contended for by the Secretary of State were held to be correct, would be to take away that right from Ms. Adan and Mr. Aitseguer.  This was recognised by Lord Bridge of Harwich in his speech in <i>Reg. v. Home Secretary, Ex parte Bugdaycay</i> [1987]  A.C. 514, 532C where, giving a different illustration, he stated:</p>

<p></p><ul>"Suppose it is well known that country A, although a signatory to the Convention, regularly sends back to its totalitarian and oppressive neighbour, country B, those opponents of the regime in country B who are apprehended in country A following their escape across the border.  Against that background, if a person arriving in the United Kingdom from country A sought asylum as a refugee from country B, assuming he could establish his well-founded fear of persecution there, it would, it seems to me, be as much a breach of article 33 of the Convention to return him to country A as to country B.  The one course would effect indirectly, the other directly, the prohibited result, i.e. his return "to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened.""<p></p></ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, Parliament can enact a provision which takes away a right given by the Geneva Convention and incorporated into the law of the United Kingdom by the 1993 Act.  But in deciding whether section 2 has this effect I consider that the House should apply the principle stated by Lord Hoffmann in <i>Reg. v. Home Secretary, Ex p. Simms</i> [1999]  3 W.L.R. 328, 341F:</p>

<p></p><ul>"Parliamentary sovereignty means that Parliament can, if it chooses, legislate contrary to fundamental principles of human rights.  The Human Rights Act 1998 will not detract from this power.  The constraints upon its exercise by Parliament are ultimately political, not legal.  But the principle of legality means that Parliament must squarely confront what it is doing and accept the political cost.  Fundamental rights cannot be overridden by general or ambiguous words.  This is because there is too great a risk that the full implications of their unqualified meaning may have passed unnoticed in the democratic process.  In the absence of express language or necessary implication to the contrary, the courts therefore presume that even the most general words were intended to be subject to the basic rights of the individual." <p></p></ul>

<p>In the present case I think that the words "otherwise than in accordance with the Convention" in section 2(2)(c) are ambiguous in the context in which they appear;  they could mean "otherwise than in accordance with the Convention as interpreted by the United Kingdom", or they could mean "otherwise than in accordance with the Convention as interpreted by the country to which he is to be sent".  Therefore in my opinion the important human right given by Article 33 cannot be taken away by those words.  Accordingly I would dismiss the two appeals.</p>

<p><b>LORD HOBHOUSE OF WOODBOROUGH</b></p>

<p>My Lords,</p>

<p>	I agree that these appeals by the Secretary of State should be dismissed as proposed by my Noble and learned friend Lord Steyn.  I agree with his conclusions and the substance of what he has said. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These appeals by the Secretary of State arise from the judicial review of two certificates which he issued purportedly pursuant to s.2 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996.  This section, since repealed, permitted the Secretary of State to order the removal of an asylum seeker from the United Kingdom to a third country if the Secretary of State was prepared to certify that in his opinion three conditions have been fulfilled.  These conditions are that -</p>

<p>(a)</p>

<p>The person is not a national or citizen of the country to which he is to be sent,</p>

<p>(b)</p>

<p>His life and liberty would not be threatened in that country for a Convention reason, and</p>

<p>(c)</p>

<p>The government of that country would not send him to another country or territory otherwise than in accordance with the Convention.  (s.2(2))</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue raised by these applicants relates to the proper interpretation of the third of these conditions, s.2(2)(c).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is accepted that condition (c), like condition (b), relates to Article 33(1) of the Convention which provides that no Contracting State shall expel or return ('<i>refouler'</i>) a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened for a Convention reason.  It is also accepted that Article 33 can be breached indirectly as well as directly.  Thus for a country to return a refugee to a state from which he will then be returned by the government of that state to a territory where his life or freedom will be threatened will be as much a breach of Article 33 as if the first country had itself returned him there direct.  This is the effect of Article 33 and has been further established as a matter of English law by your Lordships' House in <i>Re Musisi, ex parte Bugdaycay</i> [1987] AC 514 at 532, per Lord Bridge: "the one course would effect indirectly, the other directly, the prohibited result".</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, s.2 was designed to provide a scheme whereby the Secretary of State could return an asylum seeker to the country from which he had entered the United Kingdom without breaching the Convention and without having first to determine whether or not he was a "refugee" as defined by the Convention.  The section provides an authority under English law for the Secretary of State to do something which otherwise English law would preclude him from doing.  At the material time the prohibition was contained in s.6 of the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993, to which s.2 of the 1996 Act cross-refers and creates an exception.  But the exception is conditional and the Secretary of State must be able to certify that the conditions are in his opinion fulfilled.  If the Secretary of State misconstrues the Act and as a result certifies that the conditions are fulfilled when as a matter of law they cannot be, his purported exercise of his power is <i>ultra vires</i> under the statute and on an application for judicial review can be quashed.  The applicants say that that is the position here. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The practical problem that has arisen is that different countries within the European Union have interpreted the Convention differently.  The difference relevant to the present applications is in the interpretation of the definition of "refugee" in Article 1 of the Convention.  As my noble and learned friend has already explained, there is a difference of opinion between one group of countries, among which are Germany and France, and another group, which includes the United Kingdom.  The two groups adopt different interpretations of what persecution entitles an asylum seeker to say that he is unable, or fears, to avail himself of the protection of his own country.  It is fair to say that, internationally, the view adopted by the group which includes the United Kingdom is generally preferred and is supported by the UNHCR.  But it is likewise accepted by the United Kingdom Government that the view of the former group of countries is one which is held in good faith.  The scheme of the Convention is that any such differences should be referred to and resolved by the International Court of Justice under Article 38.  However there is no prospect that the presently relevant difference (which has existed now for many years) will be resolved in that way. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So long as such differences continue to exist, the intention of the Convention to provide a uniformity of approach to the refugee problem will be frustrated and the scheme of the international response will remain grossly distorted.  It is both contrary to the intention of the Convention and productive of the most severe abuses that there should be such a premium on making a claim for asylum on the North side of the English Channel as opposed to on the South side.  The evidence in the present case discloses that only 5% of would-be refugees from Algeria are granted asylum if they make their application in France, whereas 80% of such applicants are successful if applying in the United Kingdom.  It is in no way a criticism of the Government of the United Kingdom that it should try to find a solution to this problem.  However Parliament in 1996 passed legislation which did not leave the Secretary of State with a free hand.  His freedom to act was subject to the statutory conditions. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 2 is as I have stated a provision of English law binding upon the Secretary of State.  He is likewise bound by the law of England as to what is and is not "in accordance with the Convention".  In <i>Adan v The Secretary of State</i> [1999] 1 AC 293 at 306, Lord Lloyd with the agreement of your Lordships' House unequivocally upheld the United Kingdom's interpretation of Article 1 saying "if for whatever reason the state in question is unable to afford protection against factions within the state, then the qualifications for refugee status are complete."  So, to return a would-be refugee to a state where the state was unable to protect his life or freedom is in English law not in accordance with the Convention.  It has been suggested that this was a specifically English interpretation and not in accord with what was described as the "international" meaning of Article 1.  This is not correct.  As is demonstrated by authorities such as <i>Fothergill v Monarch Airlines</i> [1981] AC 251, particularly at pp.281-3 per Lord Diplock, when an English court construes an international convention it adopts the same techniques of construction and interpretation as would an international tribunal.  It is true that there has not been any decision of the International Court of Justice which would be authoritative under Article 38 but, in the absence of a decision of that court, the decision of your Lordships' House in <i>Adan</i> remains, for the purposes of English law and the construction and application of s.2 of the 1996 Act, the determinative decision.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts of the present cases are not in dispute.  Because of the interpretation which their governments and judiciary place upon Article 1, the expectation is that neither Germany nor France would recognise either of the applicants as refugees.  They would therefore not come within the protection of Article 33 in those countries.  The result of this is that there is a strong probability that, if returned to Germany or France, these two individuals will be returned respectively to Somalia and Algeria where their lives and freedom will be threatened for Convention reasons.  The Secretary of State issued his certificates being aware of and accepting these facts.  His reason for certifying that condition (c) was satisfied was that he felt at liberty, notwithstanding the decision of the House of Lords in the first <i>Adan</i> case, to treat the German and French interpretation of Article 1 as being "in accordance with" the Convention.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, the Secretary of State was not at liberty to do this.  The Act is a provision of English law.  It must be construed in accordance with English law, that is to say, as determined by the <i>Adan</i> decision.  The Secretary of State was in error. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The argument of behalf of the Secretary of State on these appeals contended for a different view based upon the submission that there were a range of interpretations which could be legitimately be adopted of Article 1 and the Convention and that the adoption of any of these in good faith would satisfy the requirement that the relevant person should not be sent to another country otherwise than in accordance with the Convention.  In support of this submission counsel relied upon <i>Kerrouche v Home Secretary</i> [1997] IAR 610 and <i>Iyadurai v Home Secretary</i> [1998] IAR 470.  These authorities certainly favour the submission made.  In <i>Kerrouche</i>, Lord Woolf said at p.615:</p>

<p></p><ul>"The difference in an approach to the interpretation of the Convention and Protocol has to be of such significance that it can be said that in making a decision affecting the position of a particular applicant for asylum, the third country would not be applying the principles of the Convention.  For this to be the position, the third country's approach would have to be outside the range of tolerance which one signatory country, as a matter of comity, is expected to extend to another.    ........    Unless the interpretation adopted by the 'safe' country was sufficiently different from that in English law to be outside the range of possible interpretations, the difference need not concern the authorities in this country."<p></p></ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Iyadurai</i>, Lord Woolf expressed similar views, again with the agreement of the other members of the Court of Appeal, and, at p.476, having characterised the question as being "whether the language used by the courts of another jurisdiction means that although they are purporting to apply the Convention they are not in fact doing so", said </p>

<p></p><ul>"It is only if the meaning placed on the Convention by the other municipal court is clearly inconsistent with its international meaning, that the courts in this country are entitled to conclude that the approach of the other municipal court involves a contravention of the Convention."<p></p></ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, it will be apparent from what I have already said that I do not agree with the analysis which is implicit in these statements.  The question is not one of comity but is one of satisfying the conditions laid down by the 1996 Act, as a matter of English law, before the Secretary of State is at liberty, under English law, to order the removal of the asylum seeker without having first determined whether or not he is a refugee.  In Convention terms, it is a question of the United Kingdom performing <i>its</i> obligation under Article 33: <i>Musisi</i> (<i>sup.</i>).  It is this on which the Secretary of State has to satisfy himself so that he can issue the statutory certificate.  If he cannot properly be so satisfied, he is not, as a matter of English law, entitled to issue the certificate.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two further points which arise from what was said by Lord Woolf and Buxton LJ in <i>Iyadurai</i>.  First, the Court of Appeal rejected a submission that a decision of the United Kingdom courts could be determinative of the interpretation of the Convention for the purposes of s.2 of the 1996 Act: indeed the Court of Appeal rejected the proposition that the Convention could have any autonomous meaning.  Whilst it is correct that any such decision would always need to be evaluated in order to see whether it was a decision which involved construing the Convention as an international instrument and not a collateral decision on some question of domestic law (even though occasioned by some question arising from the Convention), if it is a decision coming into the former category it must be respected and applied unless it can be shown to have been wrong.  In the present case, the Secretary of State has not argued that <i>Adan</i> was wrongly decided.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there are cases where, unlike in the present case, the position is not clear cut.  The facts may not have been established; they may be disputed.  This is exactly the type of situation to which the drafting of s.2 using the words "in his opinion" and "would" is directed.  But it may similarly involve an exercise of judgment to predict what will be the decision of the courts of the country to which it is proposed to return the relevant person.  Will those courts decide that he may be returned to the country from which he originally fled?  If so will such a decision be capable of being described as in accordance with the Convention.  Under the Act it is the Secretary of State who has to make this assessment and express his opinion.  It is for the applicant for judicial review to establish that the certificate issued by the Secretary of State cannot have been properly given applying the statutory criteria.  The language of Lord Woolf draws upon the test for <i>Wednesbury</i> unreasonableness.  If the certificate expresses opinions which the Secretary of State could reasonably hold and does not disclose that he has, or must have, made an error of law, the applicant for judicial review will fail.  He will not have established that there has been an illegality or that the statutory power has been exceeded.  It is not to be assumed that a country which has agreed to and adopted the Convention will then act otherwise than in accordance with its obligations under the Convention.  It is certainly not to be assumed that this will occur from the existence of differences of emphasis or from differences which can only be discovered by a meticulous comparative examination. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, my Lords, much of what has been said on this topic in previous decisions of the Court of Appeal I would agree with but it does not justify refusing to recognise that the wording of the Convention must at the end of the day have a meaning ascribed to it and it may be the task of a court to give its decision upon what that meaning is or, if the meaning has already been decided by an earlier authoritative decision, to give effect to that meaning.  It is not right to say that there can only be a range of meanings.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal in the present case was constrained by what had been said in the earlier Court of Appeal judgments by which they were bound.  The cases of <i>Kerrouche</i> and <i>Iyadurai</i> should not be treated as authoritative save to the limited extent I have recognised.  I agree with the decision of the Court of Appeal in the present case and the substance of its reasoning.  The question raised by these appeals is whether the Secretary of State's certificates disclose an error of law.  On the agreed facts they do and the Applicants were entitled to the remedy of judicial review.</p>

<p><b>LORD SCOTT OF FOSCOTE</b></p>

<p>My Lords,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the advantage of reading in draft the speeches of my noble and learned friends, Lord Steyn and Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough.  I agree with them and for the reasons they give I would dismiss these appeals</p>
