<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;124. For these reasons, the Divisional Court said that Secretary of State was not impartial in the manner required by article 6:  "What is objectionable in terms of article 6 is that he should be the judge in his own cause where his policy is in play." (see paragraph 86).  I do not disagree with the conclusion that the Secretary of State is not an independent and impartial tribunal. He does not claim to be. But the question is not whether he should be a judge in his own cause.  It is whether he should be a judge at all.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125. The Divisional Court then considered whether the requirements of article 6 were satisfied by the right to have an application for judicial review determined by a court.  This was rightly described by Tuckey LJ as the crucial question.  The answer he gave was that the procedure by which the Secretary of State arrived at his decision did not contain "sufficient safeguards to justify the High Court's restricted power of review".  The Secretary of State, having complied with the requirements of natural justice, was "free to make his own decision" and to take account of legal and policy guidance and recommendations from within the department "which are not seen by the parties"  Therefore, said Tuckey LJ, at paragraph 95:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In terms of article 6 the decision on the merits, which usually involves findings of fact and planning judgment, has not been determined by an independent and impartial tribunal or anyone approaching this, but by someone who is obviously not independent and impartial."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;126. There are three strands of reasoning here.  First, there is the fact that the parties are not privy to the processes of decision-making which go on within the department.   These contain, on the one hand, elaborate precautions to ensure that the decision-maker does not take into account any factual matters which have not been found by the inspector at the inquiry or put to the parties and, on the other hand, free communication within the department on questions of law and policy, with a view to preparing a recommendation for submission to the Secretary of State or one of the junior ministers to whom he has delegated the decision.  The latter is standard civil service procedure and takes place, as Lord Greene MR said in <i>B Johnson  &amp; Co (Builders) Ltd v Minister of Health</i> [1947]  2 All ER 395, after the Secretary of State's quasi-judicial function has been concluded and when he is acting in  his capacity as an administrator making a public policy decision.   The constitutional relationship between the Secretary of State and his civil servants was analysed by Lord Diplock in <i>Bushell v Secretary of State for the Environment</i> [1981]  AC 75, 95: </p>
<p></p><ul>"To treat the minister in his decision-making capacity as someone separate and distinct from the department of government of which he is the political head and for whose actions he alone in constitutional theory is accountable to Parliament is to ignore not only practical realities but also Parliament's intention. Ministers come and go; departments, though their names may change from time to time, remain. Discretion in making administrative decisions is conferred upon a minister not as an individual but as the holder of an office in which he will have available to him in arriving at his decision the collective knowledge, experience and expertise of all those who serve the Crown in the department of which, for the time being, he is the political head."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;127. Thus the process of consultation within the department is simply the Secretary of State advising himself.   If the Secretary of State was claiming to be, in his own person, an independent and impartial tribunal, the fact that he received confidential advice and recommendations from civil servants in his department might throw some doubt upon his claim.  But since he not only admits but avers that his constitutional role is to formulate and apply Government policy, the fact that both formulation and application require the advice and assistance of his civil servants is no more than one would expect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;128. The second strand concerns the facts.  These are found by the inspector and must be accepted by the Secretary of State unless he has first notified the parties and given them an opportunity to make representations in accordance with rule 17(5) of the Town and Country Planning (Inquiries Procedure)(England) Rules 2000.   This is the point upon which, in my opinion, the <i>Bryan</i> case 21 EHRR 342 is authority for saying that the independent position of the inspector, together with the control of the fairness of the fact-finding procedure by the court in judicial review, is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of article 6. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;129. Finally, the third strand is that of planning judgment.  In this area the principle in the <i>Zumtobel</i> case 17 EHRR 116, as applied in the <i>ISKCON</i> and <i>Bryan</i> cases to questions of policy, does not require that the court should be able to substitute its decision for that of the administrative authority.  Such a requirement would in my opinion not only be contrary to the jurisprudence of the European court but would also be profoundly undemocratic.  The Human Rights Act 1998 was no doubt intended to strengthen the rule of law but not to inaugurate the rule of lawyers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;130. For these reasons I respectfully disagree with the Divisional Court's conclusion that decisions by the Secretary of State in planning cases are incompatible with Convention rights.  Equally, the fact that the Department of Transport has promoted the road improvement scheme in the <i>Legal and General</i> case does not mean that judicial review cannot satisfy aticle 6 unless the court can itself decide whether the scheme is a good idea.  Nor do I think it makes any difference that in the <i>Alconbury</i> case the Ministry of Defence, another emanation of the Crown, has a financial interest in the proposed development.  Once again, this is something which might be significant if the Secretary of State was claiming to be an impartial tribunal.  But as he is not, the remedy available by way of judicial review to quash a decision on the ground that the Secretary of State has taken irrelevant matters into account is sufficient to satisfy article 6.  </p>
<i></i><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord Advocate's intervention</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;131. Your Lordships were referred to the decision of the Court of Session in <i>County Properties Ltd v The Scottish Ministers</i> 2000  SLT 965 in which it was decided that a decision on listed building consent by the Scottish Ministers was inconsistent with article 6 because they were not, as they acknowledged, an independent and impartial tribunal, and a court could not substitute its own decision on the questions of planning and aesthetic judgment which were central to the decision.   This decision is on appeal to the Inner House but the Lord Advocate intervened in the argument before your Lordships and appeared by counsel to put forward arguments as to why the case was wrongly decided.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;132. For the reasons I have already given, I would accept this submission.  The very notion that such questions should be decided by a court or any other independent tribunal rather than by ministers accountable to the Scottish Parliament seems to me contrary to the democratic principle.  I must however deal with a separate argument put forward by Mr Macdonald on behalf of the Lord Advocate, which he said provided a shorter route to the same answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;133. Mr Macdonald submitted that article 6 has no application to the decision by the Scottish Ministers (or the Secretary of State in England).  Their decisions do not involve the determination of anyone's civil rights or obligations.  They are simply the exercise of legal powers which affect, perhaps change, civil rights and obligations, but do not determine them within the meaning of article 6.  The point at which rights or obligations are determined is in the proceedings by way of judicial review, which decide whether the exercise of power by the administrator was lawful or not.  As that question is decided by a court which is undoubtedly independent and impartial, that is the end of the case.  Mr Macdonald said that this analysis was supported by the opinion of the Commission in <i>Kaplan v United Kingdom </i>(1980) 4 EHRR 64,  which concerned a decision by the Secretary of State that the applicant was not a fit and proper person to be involved in running an insurance company.  The Commission said, in paragraph 154 of its opinion, that article 6 lays down:</p>
<p></p><ul>"guarantees concerning the mode in which claims or disputes concerning legal rights and obligations (of a 'civil' character) are to be resolved.  A distinction must be drawn between the acts of a body which is engaged in the resolution of such a claim or dispute and the acts of an administrative or other body purporting merely to exercise or apply a legal power vested in it and not to resolve a legal claim or dispute.  Article 6(1) would not, in the Commission's opinion, apply to the acts of the latter even if they do affect 'civil rights'.  It could not be considered as being engaged in a process of 'determination' of civil rights and obligations. Its function would not be to decide ('<i>décidera'</i>) on a claim, dispute or '<i>contestation'.</i>  Its acts may, on the other hand, give rise to a claim, dispute or '<i>contestation'</i> and article 6 may come into play in that way."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;134. My Lords, this reasoning is in accordance with the way in which, at the outset of this speech, I suggested to your Lordships that, apart from European authority, the case ought to be decided.  But it provides a short answer only if it assumed that article 6 requires no more than that judicial review proceedings be decided by an independent and impartial tribunal.  If, however, article 6 is construed as going further and mandating some minimum content to the judicial review jurisdiction, then it is necessary to ask, as I have done at some length, whether the extent of the judicial review jurisdiction available in England and Scotland is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the European court jurisprudence.  As appears from my analysis of that jurisprudence, there is no doubt that the European court has construed article 6 as requiring certain minimum standards of judicial review. This appears most clearly from the Swedish cases to which I have referred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;135. Once one accepts this construction, it makes little difference whether one says, as in <i>Kaplan</i>, that the administrative act does not fall within article 6 at all and the question is concerned only with the adequacy and impartiality of the judicial review, or whether one says, as the European court and Commission have done in other cases, that the administrative act does in theory come within article 6 but the administrator's lack of impartiality can be cured by an adequate and impartial judicial review.  The former seems to me a more elegant analysis, but the latter may be necessary in order to explain, in the context of civilian concepts, why the administrative process can be treated as involving at any stage a determination of civil rights and obligations.  So, tempting as it is, I am unable accept Mr Macdonald's short cut.</p>
<i></i><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;136. I would therefore allow the appeals and declare that the impugned powers are not in breach of or incompatible with the Human Rights Act 1998.</p>
<p><b>LORD CLYDE</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;137. By section 77 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions may give directions requiring applications for planning permission to be referred to him instead of being dealt with by local planning authorities.  Section 78 provides for the making of appeals to the Secretary of State against planning decisions or the failure to take such decisions and section 79 provides for the opportunity of a hearing before a person appointed by the Secretary of State for that purpose.  By paragraph 3 of Schedule 6 to the Act the Secretary of State may direct that a planning appeal which would otherwise be determined by a person appointed by him shall instead be determined by the Secretary of State.  By paragraph 4 he may revoke such a direction.  Provision is made in sections 14, 16, 18 and 125 of the Highways Act1980 for the making of orders by the Secretary of State with regard to certain roadways and by paragraphs 1, 7 and 8 of Part I of Schedule I to that Act provision is made for the hearing of objections at a local inquiry and the subsequent making or confirmation of the order by the Secretary of State.  Section 2(3) of the Acquisition of Land Act 1981 and paragraph 4 of  Schedule 1 to that Act provide in relation to the making of a compulsory purchase order by a minister for the hearing of objections at a public local inquiry and the subsequent making of the order by the minister.  Under sections 1 and 3 of the Transport and Works Act 1992 the Secretary of State may make orders in relation to among other things railways and waterways and section 23(4) disentitles an inspector hearing objections into such orders from authorising compulsory acquisitions or the compulsory creation or extinguishment of rights over land.  The Divisional Court has held that these provisions are incompatible with article 6(1) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.  That decision is challenged in the present appeals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;138. At the heart of the challenge is the objection that the Secretary of State cannot compatibly with article 6(1) himself determine the various issues to which these statutory provisions can give rise.  No complaint is made where the decision is made by an inspector appointed by him.  The objection is levelled against his taking upon himself the direct function of being the decision-maker.</p>
<i>The planning context</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;139. The general context in which this challenge is raised is that of planning and development.  The functions of the Secretary of State in the context of planning may conveniently be referred to as "administrative", in the sense that they are dealing with policy and expediency rather than with the regulation of rights.  We are concerned with an administrative process and an administrative decision.  Planning is a matter of the formation and application of policy.  The policy is not matter for the courts but for the Executive.  Where decisions are required in the planning process they are not made by judges, but by members of the administration.  Members of the administration may be required in some of their functions to act in a judicial manner in that they may have to observe procedural rules and the overarching principles of fairness.  But while they may on some occasions be required to act like judges, they are not judges and their determinations on matters affecting civil rights and obligations are not to be seen as judicial decisions.  Even although there may be stages in the procedure leading up to the decision where what used to be described as a quasi-judicial character is superadded to the administrative task, the eventual decision is an administrative one.  As was long ago observed by Lord Greene MR in (<i>B Jo</i>hn<i>son &amp; Co (Builders) Ltd  Minister of Health</i> [1947]  2 All ER 395, 399:</p>
<p></p><ul>"That decision must be an administrative decision, because it is not to be based purely on the view that he forms of the objections, vis-a-vis the desires of the local authority, but is to be guided by his view as to the policy which in the circumstances he ought to pursue." <p></p></ul>
<p>Moreover the decision requires to take into account not just the facts of the case but very much wider issues of public interest, national priorities.  Thus the function of the Secretary of State as a decision-maker in planning matters is not in a proper sense a judicial function, although certain qualities of a judicial kind are required of him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;140. Planning and the development of land are matters which concern the community as a whole, not only the locality where the particular case arises.  They involve wider social and economic interests, considerations which are properly to be subject to a central supervision. By means of a central authority some degree of coherence and consistency in the development of land can be secured.  National planning guidance can be prepared and promulgated and that guidance will influence the local development plans and policies which the planning authorities will use in resolving their own local problems.  As is explained in paragraph I of the Government's publication Planning Policy Guidance Notes, the need to take account of economic, environmental, social and other factors requires a framework which provides consistent, predictable and prompt decision-making.  At the heart of that system are development plans.  The guidance sets out the objectives and policies comprised in the framework within which the local authorities are required to draw up their development plans and in accordance with which their planning decisions should be made.  One element which lies behind the framework is the policy of securing what is termed sustainable development, an objective which is essentially a matter of governmental strategy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;141. Once it is recognised that there should be a national planning policy under a central supervision, it is consistent with democratic principle that the responsibility for that work should lie on the shoulders of a minister answerable to Parliament.  The whole scheme of the planning legislation involves an allocation of various functions respectively between local authorities and the Secretary of State.  In placing some functions upon the Secretary of State it is of course recognised that he will not personally attend to every case himself.  The responsibility is given to his department and the power rests in the department with the Secretary of State as its head and responsible for the carrying out of its work.  Within his department a minister may well take advice on law and policy (<i>Bushell v Secretary of State for the Environment</i> [1981]  AC 75) and the Secretary of State is entitled to seek elucidation on matters raised by the case which he has to decide, provided always that he observes the basic rules of fairness.  In particular he should in fairness give the parties an opportunity to comment if after a public inquiry some significant factual material of which the parties might not be aware comes to his notice through departmental inquiry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;142. There may be various agencies which will advise him on particular aspects of planning, as for example an agency skilled in the conservation of historic buildings.  But it is a false analysis to claim that there is a lis between a developer and such an agency which will be heard and determined by the minister.  As Lord Greene MR observed in <i>Johnson, </i>at p 399, in relation to objections to a compulsory purchase order proposed by a local authority:</p>
<p></p><ul>"it is not a lis inter partes, and for the simple reason that the local authority and the objectors are not parties to anything that resembles litigation. . . . on the substantive matter, viz whether the order should be confirmed or not, there is a third party who is not present, viz, the public, and it is the function of the minister to consider the rights and interests of the public."<p></p></ul>
<p>The minister is not bound to follow the view of any agency, nor is he bound to follow the desires or interests of any other Government department.  He is not bound to apply a particular policy if the circumstances seem to him inappropriate for its application.  He is not independent.  Indeed it is not suggested that he is.  But that is not to say that in making the decisions on the matters in issue in the present appeals he is both judge and party.  It does not seem to me correct to say of the Secretary of State that he is judex in sua causa, at least in any strict sense of that expression.  He is, as I have already sought to explain, not strictly a judge.  Moreover the cause is not in any precise sense his own.  No one is suggesting that he, or the officials in his department, have any personal financial or proprietary interest in these cases.  The concern of the Secretary of State and his department is to manage planning and development in accordance with the broad lines of policy which have been prepared in the national interest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;143. One criticism which is levelled at the system is that the minister has the functions both of making planning policy and of applying the policies which he has made.  But that combination of functions does not necessarily give rise to unfairness.  The formulation of policies is a perfectly proper course for the provision of guidance in the exercise of an administrative discretion.  Indeed policies are an essential element in securing the coherent and consistent performance of administrative functions.  There are advantages both to the public and the administrators in having such policies.  Of course there are limits to be observed in the way policies are applied.  Blanket decisions which leave no room for particular circumstances may be unreasonable.  What is crucial is that the policy must not fetter the exercise of the discretion. The particular circumstances always require to be considered.  Provided that the policy is not regarded as binding and the authority still retains a free exercise of discretion the policy may serve the useful purpose of giving a reasonable guidance both to applicants and decision-makers. Nor is this a point which can be made solely in relation to the Secretary of State.  In a variety of administrative functions, in addition to planning, local authorities may devise and implement policies of their own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;144. It is now argued that the planning process is flawed in so far as the decision-maker is the Secretary of State.  It is said that where he is making the decision the case falls foul of article 6 of the Convention.  One possible solution which is proposed is that in the cases where at present the Secretary of State is himself the decision- maker, cases for the most part which are likely to give rise to issues of widespread or even national concern, which may well have a wide impact on the lives of many and involve major issues of policy, the decision should be removed from the minister, who is answerable to Parliament, to an independent body, answerable to no one.  That would be a somewhat startling proposition and it would be surprising if the Convention which is rooted in the ideas of democracy and the rule of law should lead to such a result.</p>
<i></i><p><i>Applicability of the Convention</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;145. The first question is whether article 6 applies at all to decisions by planning authorities or by the Secretary of State.  An attractive argument was presented on behalf of the Lord Advocate to the effect that article 6 was as regards civil matters concerned with the securing of justice in the resolution of a legal claim or dispute and not with the acts of an administrative body exercising a discretionary power.  Article 6 would only come to affect matters of administrative discretionary decisions at the stage when a dispute arose on the grounds that the decision-maker had acted unlawfully, exceeding the parameters of his lawful discretion and erring in law.  This argument looks to the whole terms of article 6(1) which can readily be seen as designed to cover judicial proceedings.  Counsel pointed to the French text of the article and the use of the word "contestations" which could be understood as relating to a dispute on civil rights and obligations and to litigation before a court of law.  In support of this approach reference was made to a decision of the Commission in <i>Kaplan v United Kingdom</i> (1980) 4 EHRR 64, para 154 where,  after referring to claims and disputes concerning legal rights and obligations of a civil character, the Commission stated:</p>
<p></p><ul>"A distinction must be drawn between the acts of a body which is engaged in the resolution of such a claim or dispute and the acts of an administrative or other body purporting merely to exercise or apply a legal power vested in it and not to resolve a legal claim or dispute. Article 6(1) would not, in the Commission's opinion, apply to the acts of the latter even if they do affect 'civil rights'.  It could not be considered as being engaged in a process of 'determination' of civil rights and obligations. Its function would not be to decide ('décidera') on a claim, dispute or 'contestation'.  Its acts may, on the other hand, give rise to a claim, dispute or 'contestation' and article 6 may come into play in that way."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;146. This approach provides a clean and simple solution to the present problem. But I do not consider that it is sound.  The observations in <i>Kaplan</i> on which the argument was supported have not been taken up by the court and reflect an earlier stage in the development of the jurisprudence on the scope and application of article 6(1).  In the developing jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights it became recognised that a narrow view of the scope of article 6(1) was inappropriate.  In <i>X v United Kingdom</i> (1998)  28 D&amp;R 177, 186 the Commission held that a compulsory purchase order affected the applicant's private rights of ownership, that these were "civil rights", and that in challenging the making of the order she was entitled to the protection of article 6(1). Counsel recognised the difficulty which that decision presented for his argument and was constrained to contend that the decision was wrong. His proposition involves a narrow understanding of the scope of the article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;147. In considering the scope of article 6(1) it is proper to take a broad approach to the language used and seek to give effect to the purpose of the provision.  In <i>Ringeisen v Austria (No.1)</i> (1971)  1 EHRR 455, para 94 the phrase was taken to cover "all proceedings the result of which is decisive for private rights and obligations." This included cases where the proceedings concerned a dispute between a private individual and a public authority.  In <i>Golder v United Kingdom</i> (1975)  1 EHRR 524, para 32 the court considered the French and English text of the article and concluded that the article covered a right of access to a court or "tribunal" without there being already proceedings pending.  The court held in paragraph 36 that "article 6(1) secures to everyone the right to have any claim relating to his civil rights and obligations brought before a court or tribunal."  These two cases pre-date the decision in <i>Kaplan</i>.  In <i>Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v Belgium</i> (1981)  4 EHRR 1, para 45 the court observed of the word "contestation":</p>
<p></p><ul>"Conformity with the spirit of the Convention requires that this word should not be construed too technically and that it should be given a substantive rather than a formal meaning besides, it has no counterpart in the English text of article 6(1)."<p></p></ul>
<p>The court held that even if the use of the French word implied the existence of a disagreement, the evidence showed that there was one in that case where there were allegations of professional misconduct which were denied.  The reference to a determination reflects the necessity for there to be a dispute.  But it does not require to be a dispute in any formal sense.  In <i>Moreira de Azevedo v Portugal</i> (1990)  13 EHRR 721, the court followed the approach taken in <i>Le Compte </i>and held that article 6(1) applied where the applicant had joined as an assistente in criminal proceedings with a view to securing financial reparation for injuries which he claimed he had suffered at the hands of the accused but had not filed any claim in civil proceedings.  The distinction noticed by the Commission in  <i>X v United Kingdom</i> (1998) 25 EHRR CD 88, 96 is not to be overlooked, that is the distinction between:</p>
<p></p><ul>"the acts of a body which is engaged in the resolution of a dispute ('contestation') and the acts of an administrative or other body purporting merely to exercise or apply a legal power vested in it and not to resolve a legal claim or dispute."<p></p></ul>
<p>But at least from the time when a power has been exercised and objection is taken to that exercise the existence of a dispute for the purpose of article 6(1) can be identified.</p>
