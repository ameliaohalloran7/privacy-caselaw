<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;153.&nbsp;&nbsp;It took until May 1911 for the Parliament Bill to get through the House of Commons, with more than 900 amendments tabled for the committee stage. The House of Lords gave it a second reading without a vote. There was then an extended Whitsun recess because of King George's coronation. The Lords began the committee stage of the Bill at the end of June and passed a number of wrecking amendments. On July 14 the Government formally asked the King to create the necessary number of new peers. The King agreed but asked that this should not happen until after the Lords had been given an opportunity of deciding whether they would give in once the Commons had rejected their amendments. The opposition leaders were formally told the position on 20 July. The opposition gave vent to its frustration by making it impossible for the Prime Minister to deliver his speech to the House of Commons on 24 July. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;154.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the real battle was among the opposition peers, the "ditchers" who were prepared to die in the ditch to preserve their powers, and the "hedgers" who were prepared to accept the bill for the sake of avoiding the worse fate of being swamped with Liberal peers. It was never quite clear how many were to be created - whether enough to make a permanent Liberal majority in the Lords, thus reversing the traditional position of the two parties, or simply enough to get the Bill through, or something in between (the King had suggested ennobling the elder sons of existing Liberal peers, which would have been the most modest solution, but not guaranteed to produce the right result; Asquith had in his possession a list of 249 possible candidates, some little known today but many of great distinction, including Bertrand Russell, Baden-Powell, and Joseph Rowntree). In the end, the "hedgers" won the day. On 10 August, the Lords voted by a majority of 131 to 114 not to insist on their amendments. The Parliament Act of 1911 became law. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;155.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1911 Act procedure was used for two measures introduced in the following session of Parliament, a Bill to provide for Home Rule for Ireland, and a Bill to provide for the disestablishment of the Anglican Church in Wales. The former was deeply controversial but the latter would never have passed the House of Lords had it not been for the 1911 Act. Both were passed into law as war broke out in August 1914 and immediately suspended because the nation had more important things to think about. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;156.&nbsp;&nbsp;The history is important because it demonstrates clearly the mischief which the 1911 Act was meant to cure. The party with the permanent majority in the unelected House of Lords could forever thwart the will of the elected House of Commons no matter how clearly that will had been endorsed by the electorate. At that time this could not be called a necessary or even desirable check on the over-weening power of a Government which had the command of the House of Commons, because there was no equivalent check on the party which had the command of the House of Lords. The object was henceforth to ensure that the elected House could always get its way in the end. The United Kingdom would become a real democracy. The democratic element was reinforced by the reduction in the maximum length of a Parliament from seven years to five and the exception of a Bill to prolong the life of Parliament from the 1911 Act procedure. The elected chamber would have to submit itself to re-election at regular intervals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;157.&nbsp;&nbsp;The history also clearly demonstrates that it was always contemplated that the procedure might be used to bring about major constitutional change. At that time the fragmentation of the United Kingdom by allowing a measure of self-government to the people of Ireland was the most fundamental constitutional change imaginable. Yet one of the objects of the 1911 Act was to make it possible. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;158.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the history also makes the position adopted by the Court of Appeal, however attractive it may now appear to be, untenable. The Court of Appeal concluded that the 1911 Act procedure could not be used to effect fundamental constitutional change, but that the modifications to its procedure brought about by the 1949 Act were "modest" rather than fundamental. On the contrary, it seems to me that the 1911 Act procedure can be used to effect any constitutional change, with the one exception stated. Section 2(1) of the 1911 Act applies to "any Public Bill (other than a Money Bill or a Bill containing any provision to extend the maximum duration of Parliament beyond five years)". There is no hint of any other exclusions. The expression of two exclusions would normally be read so as to include everything else. When one looks at the mischief which the Bill was designed to cure it is clear that anything else, no matter how fundamental or controversial, is in principle included. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;159.&nbsp;&nbsp;The argument that the procedure cannot be used to amend itself has rather more substance, although in the end it too must be rejected. The question of the legislative competence of the United Kingdom Parliament is quite distinct from the question of the composition of Parliament for this purpose. The concept of Parliamentary sovereignty which has been fundamental to the constitution of England and Wales since the 17th century (I appreciate that Scotland may have taken a different view) means that Parliament can do anything. The courts will, of course, decline to hold that Parliament has interfered with fundamental rights unless it has made its intentions crystal clear. The courts will treat with particular suspicion (and might even reject) any attempt to subvert the rule of law by removing governmental action affecting the rights of the individual from all judicial scrutiny. Parliament has also, for the time being at least, limited its own powers by the European Communities Act 1972 and, in a different way, by the Human Rights Act 1998.  It is possible that other qualifications may emerge in due course.  In general, however, the constraints upon what Parliament can do are political and diplomatic rather than constitutional. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;160.&nbsp;&nbsp;But that does not answer the question of what is meant by "Parliament". If Parliament can do anything, there is no reason why Parliament should not decide to re-design itself, either in general or for a particular purpose. The body which was Parliament in 1911 could decide, by the decision-making procedure of the day, to re-design itself. It decided that henceforward, money bills (certified as such by the Speaker of the House of Commons) could become law without any attempt to gain the consent of the House of Lords. No-one has suggested that it could not do this. No-one has challenged the legality of money bills passed under that procedure since then. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;161.&nbsp;&nbsp;It also decided that henceforward, any public bill other than a money bill or a bill to extend the maximum duration of Parliament beyond five years could be passed either in the traditional way, with the consent of both Houses of Parliament and the Royal Assent, or in the new way, without the consent of the House of Lords, provided that various conditions had been fulfilled. Nothing in the Act said or suggested that those conditions could not be modified by the same procedure. If, as we must, we start from the proposition that Parliament can do anything, it follows that Parliament can allow its redesigned self further to modify the design. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;162.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only question is whether that further permission has to be spelt out in the statute. Even if they were applicable to the Acts of the United Kingdom Parliament, there is nothing in the Commonwealth cases to which we have been referred to suggest that it does. On the contrary, they suggest that it is enough that what has been done is within the general powers given to the legislative body in question: see <i>R v Burah</i> (1878) 3 App Cas 889; <i>Taylor v Attorney General of Queensland </i> (1917) 23 CLR 457; <i>McCawley v The King</i> [1920] AC 691; <i>Clayton v Heffron</i> (1960) 105 CLR 214. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;163.&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Commonwealth cases do suggest, however, is the contrary proposition: that if Parliament is required to pass legislation on particular matters in a particular way, then Parliament is not permitted to ignore those requirements when passing legislation on those matters, nor is it permitted to remove or relax those requirements by passing legislation in the ordinary way: see <i>Harris v Minister of the Interior </i>1952 (2) SA 428; <i>Bribery Commissioner v Ranasinghe</i> [1965] AC 172. If the sovereign Parliament can redefine itself downwards, to remove or modify the requirement for the consent of the Upper House, it may very well be that it can also redefine itself upwards, to require a particular Parliamentary majority or a popular referendum for particular types of measure. In each case, the courts would be respecting the will of the sovereign Parliament as constituted when that will had been expressed. But that is for another day. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;164.&nbsp;&nbsp;I myself would be prepared to hold that, by excepting a Bill to prolong the maximum life of a Parliament from that procedure, Parliament was also disabled from using that procedure to remove the exception: that would be consistent with the principle in the <i>Harris</i> and <i>Ranasinghe</i> cases. But, not having excepted a Bill to modify the procedure in section 2, Parliament must be taken to have authorised the use of that procedure for that purpose. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;165.&nbsp;&nbsp;That conclusion is entirely consistent with the mischief disclosed by the preceding events which the Parliament Act was designed to correct. As a democrat, I have no problem with that. Whether our system now has sufficient democratic checks upon the combined power of the elected House and the Government which commands that House is a quite different question and not for this court to decide. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;166.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite clear from the words used by Parliament in section 2 of the Parliament Act 1911 that it intended no limit on the Bills which might be passed under that procedure other than those expressly stated in that section. I would therefore dismiss this appeal, but for the reasons given by the Administrative Court rather than the Court of Appeal.  </p>
<p><b>LORD CARSWELL</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;167.&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue at stake in the appeal before the House is the validity of the Hunting Act 2004, an enactment whose subject matter has provoked fierce passions on both sides of the debate.  The argument before your Lordships was not, however, concerned at any stage with the rights or wrongs of the hunting question; no discussion took place about the content of the Act and none will be found in the opinions of your Lordships.  The challenge was to the validity of the Hunting Act as an Act of Parliament, which in turn involved the validity of the Parliament Act 1949.  The arguments were confined to this issue, which required extensive consideration of fundamental constitutional principles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;168.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Lordships have referred to two of those fundamental principles, the sovereignty or supremacy of Parliament and the conclusiveness of the Parliamentary roll or the Speaker's certificate.  The first is one of the pillars of the modern constitution of this country and has been so fully accepted by the courts and described by so many writers on the constitution from Dicey onwards that it needs no further elaboration.  Both this principle and the second, which is discussed in paras 112 and 116 of the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Hope of Craighead, are judicial products of that carefully observed mutual respect which has long existed between the legislature and the courts.  As a judge I am very conscious of the proper reluctance of the courts to intervene in issues of the validity of Acts of Parliament.  I should be most unwilling to decide this or any other case in a way which would endanger that tradition of mutual respect.  I do not, and I have no doubt your Lordships do not, have any wish to expand the role of the judiciary at the expense of any other organ of the State or to seek to frustrate the properly expressed wish of Parliament as contained in legislation.  The attribution in certain quarters of such a wish to the judiciary is misconceived and appears to be the product of lack of understanding of the judicial function and the sources of law which the courts are bound to apply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;169.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was this instinct of respect which led the Court of Appeal to satisfy itself that it could properly pronounce upon the validity of the Parliament Act 1949, notwithstanding the acceptance both by the appellants and the Attorney General that it was justiciable in a court of law.  I am myself satisfied that it was right to conclude that this particular issue is one which can and should be determined by the courts.  It is correctly a question of statutory interpretation, determining the ambit of section 2(1) of the Parliament Act 1911, a question of law which falls within the scope of courts of law carrying out their regular function.  In my opinion the Court of Appeal was right to conclude that it had jurisdiction to determine the issue raised in these proceedings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;170.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unnecessary for me to dilate on the indicia of intention upon which the appellants' counsel Sir Sydney Kentridge QC relied in seeking to establish that the scope of section 2(1) of the 1911 Act is limited. He focused in particular on the opening word "If" and the meaning which he attributed to the word "Parliament" in the final recital to the Act.  The Attorney General for his part maintained that the words "any Public Bill" meant literally what they said and that that phrase was apt to include a Bill which itself amended the conditions laid down in section 2(1).  Several of your Lordships have dealt in detail with the issue of construction - I would refer in particular to para 29 of the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill - and I am content to agree with their conclusions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;171.&nbsp;&nbsp;In construing an Act of Parliament it may be of assistance to have regard to the historical context, which may throw light upon the mischief to which the legislation is directed: see, eg, <i>R v Z (Attorney General for Northern Ireland</i>'s<i> Reference) </i>[2005] UKHL 35; [2005] 2 WLR 1286.  Lord Bingham of Cornhill has dealt with this fully in his opinion and I cannot usefully add anything to his review of the events leading up to the enactment of the Parliament Act 1911.  The extent to which use may be made of subsequent events is less clear cut, but at its lowest one may obtain reinforcement of one's construction of legislation from the fact that the same interpretation has been adopted over a considerable period.  That is not to say that the courts may not reverse a long-held error of interpretation, if satisfied that it is right to do so: cf <i>Inland Revenue Comrs v Dowdall O'Mahoney &amp; Co Ltd </i>[1952] AC 401; <i>West Midland Baptist (Trust) Association (Inc) v Birmingham  Corporation </i>[1970] AC 874.  The longevity of that construction will, however, cause them to be cautious about doing so and, as my noble and learned friend Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead has pointed out at para 68, in the present case the involvement of the legislature goes much deeper.  Moreover, when subsequent legislation has been passed and acted upon which depends for its validity upon the correctness of that construction, the effect may exceed that of demonstrating unanimity of opinion and become a piece of political fact and reality which cannot readily be set aside: see the opinion of Lord Hope of Craighead, paras 119 et seq and the academic commentaries to which he there refers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;172.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have reached my conclusion about the meaning of section 2(1) of the 1911 Act without resort to the practice of consulting Hansard<i> </i>developed in consequence of the decision of the House in <i>Pepper v Hart </i>[1993] AC 593.  In particular, I have not taken into account the defeat of the amendment moved by Sir Philip Magnus and the withdrawal of that moved in the House of Lords by the Earl of Ancaster, described by the Court of Appeal in paras 79 to 87 of its judgment.  I am not persuaded that the conditions for resort to Hansard<i> </i>have been satisfied in the present case. It would accordingly be incorrect for a court to draw conclusions from such elements of the Parliamentary history of the legislation as the proposal and rejection of amendments: see <i>Viscountess Rhondda's Claim </i>[1922] 2 AC 339, 383, per Viscount Haldane.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;173.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Sydney sought to establish a limitation upon the freedom of Parliament to use section 2(1) of the 1911 Act to amend the terms of that subsection by reliance upon the proposition that legislation passed by the exercise of the powers contained in it is delegated or subordinate, not primary.  The conclusion which he drew from this premise was that it was unlawful for the delegated body, the Sovereign and the House of Commons, to enlarge the scope of its own authority without the approval of the delegating body, which includes the House of Lords.  I am unable to accept the validity of the premise.  I do not think that it makes sense to regard the Sovereign and the House of Commons as delegates, when they themselves constituted two of the delegators.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;174.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor do I consider that the appellants derive assistance from the decisions in cases related to colonial legislatures set up under the authority of enactments of the Imperial Parliament such as the Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865.  These decisions establish merely that where a legislature is given plenary powers by its founding legislation, it can pass such Acts as it sees fit, including enactments abolishing one of the houses of the legislature; where, on the other hand, the founding legislation contains limitations, the enactments of the body founded will not be valid if they contravene those limitations.  This is the explanation for the decision of the Privy Council in <i>Bribery Commissioner v Ranasinghe </i>[1965] AC 172, upon which Sir Sydney particularly relied, as distinct from such cases as <i>McCawley v The King </i>[1920] AC 691, <i>R v Burah </i>(1878) 3 App Cas 889 and <i>Hodge v The Queen </i>(1883) 9 App Cas 117, together with the Australian decisions in <i>Taylor v Attorney General of Queensland </i>(1917) 23 CLR 457 and <i>Clayton v Heffron </i>(1960) 105 CLR 214.  In <i>Powell v Apollo Candle Co Ltd </i>(1885) 10 App Cas 282 at 289 the Privy Council declared firmly that the earlier decisions had put an end to the doctrine that a colonial legislature is a delegate of the Imperial legislature.  The Court of Appeal in the present case, having accurately summarised the effect of the Commonwealth authorities at para 67 of its judgment, pointed out, again I think rightly, that the circumstances of these cases are not strictly analogous to those of the present appeal and went on in para 68 in a passage with which I agree:</p>
<p></p><ul>"There is, in our judgment, no constitutional principle or principle of statutory construction which prevents a legislature from altering its own constitution by enacting alterations to the very instrument from which its powers derive by virtue of powers in that same instrument, if the powers, properly understood, extend that far.  This is not performing an act of bootstrap levitation, provided the power exercised is duly derived, directly or indirectly, from a sufficient original sovereign power and authority."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;175.&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming the correctness of the conclusion that the Parliament Act 1949 was validly enacted, which is sufficient to dispose of the appeal before the House, it is nevertheless germane to the issue of the construction of section 2(1) of the 1911 Act to inquire whether Parliament could resort to it to extend the life of a Parliament beyond five years, notwithstanding the exception contained at the beginning of the subsection.  Your Lordships have expressed differing opinions on the issue and I shall not rehearse the arguments.  It is sufficient for me to say that I support the view that section 2(1) cannot be so used.  I agree with the reasoning set out in para 59 of the opinion of Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The Act setting up the new procedure expressly excludes its use for legislation extending the duration of Parliament.  That express exclusion carries with it, by necessary implication, a like exclusion in respect of legislation aimed at achieving the same result by two steps rather than one.  If this were not so the express legislative intention could readily be defeated."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;176.&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads me to one final question, which I find much the most difficult of those arising out of this appeal and to which I shall not attempt to give a definite answer.  Are there any other implied limitations upon the freedom to use section 2(1) of the Parliament Act 1911?  It is at this point that one enters the penumbra in which the boundary between political matters and legal entitlement becomes particularly indistinct.  Various changes might be posed as theoretical possibilities: abolition of the House of Lords, radical change in its composition which would effect a fundamental change in its nature, substantial reduction of the powers of the House of Lords or the virtual removal of the braking mechanism contained in section 2(1) by amending the number of times that the House of Lords can reject a bill or reducing the time which must elapse to a minimal period.  I would at once express the hope and belief that such possibilities are so unlikely to occur as to be purely theoretical.  Our constitution has for the last 200 years developed by evolution rather than revolution.  Successive governments, even those with massive majorities, have wisely recognised this in exercising the degree of moderation with which they have approached radical changes which some of their supporters ardently wished to put into effect, observing the principle expressed by Gladstone, that the constitution depends "on the good sense and good faith of those who work it."  An unwritten constitution, even more than a written one, is a living organism and develops with changing times, but it is still a delicate plant and is capable of being damaged by over-vigorous treatment, which may have incalculable results.  It is a corollary of the principle of the sovereignty of Parliament that Parliament as ordinarily constituted can enact even fundamental constitutional changes: the Kilbrandon Commission pointed to the legislation creating the Irish Free State in 1922 (Report of the Royal Commission on the Constitution 1969 - 1973 (1973), Cmnd 5460, para 56) and one can now add the removal of the hereditary peers from the House of Lords by the House of Lords Act 1999, which, it is to be noted, was passed in the customary fashion by both Houses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;177.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Reid in <i>Madzimbamuto v Lardner-Burke </i>[1969] 1 AC 645<i> </i>at 723 expressed with his customary clarity the accepted principle governing the powers of Parliament:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is often said that it would be unconstitutional for the United Kingdom Parliament to do certain things, meaning that the moral, political and other reasons against doing them are so strong that most people would regard it as highly improper if Parliament did these things.  But that does not mean that it is beyond the power of Parliament to do such things.  If Parliament chose to do any of them the courts could not hold the Act of Parliament invalid."<p></p></ul>
<p>In so holding Lord Reid was referring to legislation passed by Parliament in the normal manner.  The question now posed is whether this comprehensive principle applies with equal force to all legislation passed under the powers contained in the Parliament Act 1911.  If the unlikely came to pass and the 1911 Act were used to put through legislation of the type I have suggested, would critics be restricted to terming it outrageous (the epithet applied by Mr Quintin Hogg MP and Captain Crookshank MP to the Parliament Act 1949: see Hansard (HC Debates) 14 November 1949, <i>cols </i>1771, 1803), or would they be able to challenge its validity in a court of law?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;178.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal suggested (para 99) a distinction between making changes of a fundamentally different nature to the relationship between the House of Lords and the Commons and making such changes of a less fundamental nature.  As neither of the parties supported this distinction in argument before the House, and it has not found favour with any of your Lordships, I do not find it necessary to examine it further.  Despite the general lack of enthusiasm for the proposition espoused by the Court of Appeal, however, I incline very tentatively to the view that its instinct may be right, that there may be a limit somewhere to the powers contained in section 2(1) of the 1911 Act, though the boundaries appear extremely difficult to define.  If a fundamental disturbance of the building blocks of the constitution is contemplated at some time, it may well be that no government in the real political world would attempt to use those powers for the purpose.  Whether a legal challenge to the use of the 1911 Act for such a purpose could succeed is a topic on which I should prefer to receive much more specifically directed argument and to give much more profound consideration before reaching a conclusion.  All that I would say now is that I wish to reserve my position on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;179.&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, I agree that the challenge to the validity of the Parliament Act 1949 and the Hunting Act 2004 has not been sustained and I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
LORD BROWN OF EATON-UNDER-HEYWOOD
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;180.&nbsp;&nbsp;These proceedings attack the Hunting Act 2004.  Odd as it may seem, however, whatever views we hold upon the merits or demerits of hunting, or of the legislation which now bans it, are quite immaterial.   Instead the challenge is directed to the parliamentary procedure used to enact the ban, a procedure which invoked the Parliament Act 1949 (the 1949 Act).  Put shortly, this attack upon the Hunting Act stands or falls entirely upon the validity of the 1949 Act and that in turn depends upon whether it was lawful to force that Act through Parliament by the use of the Parliament Act 1911 (the 1911 Act).   The precise terms of section 2(1) of the 1911 Act are central to this dispute.  Rather, however, than set them out yet again, I shall take them as read. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;181.&nbsp;&nbsp;To many it will seem remarkable that your Lordships should now be asked, 56 years after the passage of the 1949 Act, to declare it invalid.  At first blush, indeed, given that the 1949 Act is an Act of Parliament, it is somewhat surprising that the courts should be examining its validity at all.  It was passed (as were two other Acts of Parliament before it) "in accordance with the provisions of the Parliament Act 1911 and by the authority of the same"—such being the words of enactment expressly provided for by section 4(1) of the 1911 Act.  It became an Act of Parliament precisely in the circumstances and upon the fulfilment of the conditions provided for by section 2(1) of the 1911 Act.  And when as a Bill it was presented to His Majesty for assent, it had endorsed on it, as section 2(2) of the 1911 Act required, the certificate of the Speaker of the House of Commons signed by him that the provisions of section 2 had been duly complied with—section 3 of the Act expressly providing that:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Any certificate of the Speaker of the House of Commons given under this Act shall be conclusive for all purposes, and shall not be questioned in any court of law."<p></p></ul>
