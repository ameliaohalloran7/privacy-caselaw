<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;242. On the first of the two issues she had identified, the judge concluded that Mrs Harris had pleaded an arguable case that the bank had had constructive notice of the presumed undue influence.  But as to the second issue, she concluded that on the facts, either pleaded or not in dispute, the bank, in asking Wragge &amp; Co to give appropriate advice to Mrs Harris, had taken reasonable steps to negative the constructive notice.  She held, also, that Wragge &amp; Co were not the bank's agents for any purpose other than to register the charge on the bank's behalf.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;243. The Court of Appeal agreed with the judge on both the two issues,  per Stuart Smith LJ:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The solicitors were acting for Mrs Harris in the transaction and the bank were entitled to assume that they had given appropriate advice and were entitled to accept the solicitors' letter as confirmation that this had been done."   [1998] 4 All ER 705, 730).<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;244. In my opinion, on the premise that the solicitors were indeed Mrs Harris' solicitors, the Court of Appeal came to the correct conclusion. In reviewing their decision, however, I would start with the third issue.  Was this a case in which, on Mrs Harris' pleading, there was an arguable case of undue influence?  The relationship of trust or confidence was certainly present.  Mr Harris conducted the businesses from which the family income was derived.  It was he who negotiated the financial arrangements with Barclays Bank.  He did not explain the arrangements to his wife.  He simply asked her to sign the legal documentation.  But there is no pleaded allegation of misrepresentation. His statement, express or implied, that he would be able to trade his way out of his financial difficulties may have been an expression of over optimism but cannot be, and has not been, suggested to be a misrepresentation.  There was no allegation of any bullying of Mrs Harris or of any pressure on her to sign that could be characterized as excessive.  She signed, without knowing what she was signing, because she trusted him.  This pleaded story does not, in my opinion, raise any presumption of undue influence.  It does not, in the absence of any other evidence, justify an inference  that Mr Harris brought undue influence to bear in order to persuade her to sign.  Her agreement to do so is consistent with a normal, trusting, relationship between a married couple.  Since, however, it was accepted below that, for striking-out purposes, Mrs Harris could rely on there being a presumption of undue influence, it would not be right to uphold the striking-out on this ground.  The critical issue is the constructive notice issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;245. As to constructive notice, the bank knew that Mrs Harris was agreeing to become surety for the debts of her husband's company, PCC.  As in all such cases the bank was, or ought to have been, aware that there was a risk of misrepresentation or of undue influence.  On the pleaded facts, the extent of the risk was not, in my opinion, very great.  There were no special features to put the bank on inquiry.  But the bank  did, in order to protect itself against that risk, have to take reasonable steps to satisfy itself that the nature and effect of the documents she was to sign were properly explained to Mrs Harris. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;246. The bank believed that Wragge &amp; Co were acting not only for Mr Harris but also for Mrs Harris and would give Mrs Harris the requisite legal advice about the documents.  Mr Hamlett's letter of 27 October, if the bank received it, would have confirmed that belief.  But it does not appear that the bank's belief was derived from anything said or done by Mrs Harris.  And Mrs Harris contends that Mr Hamlett was not her solicitor and in any event gave her no explanation about the nature and effect of the documents.  If these contentions can be made good and if Mrs Harris does succeed in establishing undue influence it is at least arguable that she will succeed on the constructive notice issue.  In my opinion, therefore, Mrs Harris' case must be allowed to go to trial.  I would allow her appeal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;247. There is a further complication to which I should refer.  Mrs Harris died on 22 March 2001 while the appeal to this House was pending.  Her appeal abated in accordance with Standing Order X but a Petition for Reviver presented by Mr Harris, her executor, was granted as of course on 9 May 2001.  In the hearing of the appeal before your Lordships no point was made as to any effect her death or Mr Harris' executorship might have on the bank's claim for possession of the Old Rectory or on the future course of the litigation.  It may seem somewhat incongruous for Mr Harris to be relying on his own undue influence over his wife in order to defeat the bank's possession claim, but any difficulties or problems must be sorted out at trial or by applications made at first instance.</p>
<i><p><i>Midland Bank Plc v Wallace</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;248. In this case, too, there has not been a full trial.  The bank, having commenced proceedings for possession of the mortgaged property, made an application for summary judgment.  Master Barratt gave Mrs Wallace leave to defend, but Lloyd J allowed the bank's appeal and made an order for possession.  Mrs Wallace appealed.  The Court of Appeal dismissed her appeal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;249. The property in question was a leasehold flat, Flat 1, 91, Priory Road, Hampstead.  Mr and Mrs Wallace were the joint registered proprietors of the flat which was held for a term of 125 years from 25 December 1986.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;250. The flat had been acquired by Mr and Mrs Wallace without the aid of a mortgage, but subsequently had been charged to Northern Rock Building Society to secure an £80,000 advance to Mr Wallace partly to pay off a previous loan from Coutts Bank and partly for his business purposes.  By 1988 the Northern Rock money had been fully utilised and Mr Wallace wanted to raise more money.  The bank agreed to advance £120,000.  The advance was to be repayable on demand and was to be secured by an "all monies" legal charge over the flat.  Mr Wallace accepted the bank's offer on 1 December 1988.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;251. By a letter dated 13 December 1988 the bank asked a solicitor, Mr Sidney Samson, to "attend to the necessary formalities for us in the signing of the enclosed legal charge form by [Mr and Mrs Wallace]."  The legal charge form enclosed with the letter contained, immediately above the space for the chargors' signatures, the following words in bold type:</p>
<p></p><ul>"This is an important legal document.  The bank recommends that before signing it you should seriously consider seeking the advice of a solicitor or other professional adviser."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;252. There was no evidence that Mr Samson had previously acted for Mr or Mrs Wallace.  The inference was that Mr Samson was on the Bank's panel of local solicitors willing to accept instructions to act in connection with conveyancing transactions between the Bank and its customers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;253. Mr and Mrs Wallace went together to a meeting with Mr Samson in his offices.  In her affidavit sworn on 13 February 1996 Mrs Wallace gave her evidence of what happened at that meeting.  The relevant passages were set out in paragraph 5 of the judgment of Stuart-Smith LJ in the Court of Appeal [1998] 4 All ER 705, 735.  It is not necessary for me to repeat the whole of the passages but the gist appears from the following excerpts:</p>
<p></p><ul>"12.&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the business loan itself, I was not involved at all . . .  Eventually I was told that I had to go to a solicitor's office to execute the charge.  I was directed to the office of Sidney Samson &amp; Co.  The firm had no connection with me . . .  I was there three or four minutes at most. . . .  I signed the document as directed by a solicitor.  There was no other discussion.  He did not begin to tell me what I was signing or to explain to me the consequences.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;My impression in retrospect is that the solicitor had been instructed merely to take and witness my signature…I certainly did not regard the solicitor as independent as he was instructed by the bank." <p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;254. Mr and Mrs Wallace signed the legal charge at their meeting with Mr Samson in his offices.  He witnessed their signatures.  Beneath Mrs Wallace's signature, Mr Samson wrote:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The same having first been explained to her and she appearing perfectly to understand it."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mrs Wallace's evidence this endorsement was untrue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;255. On 16 December 1988 Mr Samson wrote to the bank in the following terms:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In accordance with your instructions of the 13th instant, I have now seen Mr and Mrs Wallace.  They have executed the documents and I have attested them stating that the documents have been explained.  I enclose herewith a note of my fees."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;256. The legal charge was dated 30 December 1988.  The £120,000 was drawn down over a period between January and August 1989.  The £120,000 was a loan to Mr Wallace alone.  It was used by him to inject capital into the company, Capital Clinics Ltd, through which he ran private clinics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;257. Later in 1989 the bank made a further loan of £106,065 to Mr and Mrs Wallace jointly.  The purpose of this loan was to enable the Northern Rock's prior charge to be redeemed.  In March 1994 the bank commenced proceedings for recovery of the sums due in respect of the two loans and for possession of the flat and applied for summary judgment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;258. The question for the court was whether Mrs Wallace's affidavit disclosed an arguable defence to the bank's claim.  Both before Lloyd J and before the Court of Appeal, and again before your Lordships, counsel for the  bank conceded that Mrs Wallace had shown an arguable case of undue influence.  For my part, I would agree that Mrs Wallace's affidavit, and in particular paragraph 11, disclosed a sufficiently arguable case that in persuading her to sign the legal charge and in overriding her reluctance to do so Mr Wallace had abused the trust and confidence that she had in him.  Accordingly, the summary judgment application turned on the constructive notice issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;259. As to constructive notice, the bank knew that Mr and Mrs Wallace were a married couple living together in the jointly owned flat that was to be charged to the bank.  The bank knew that the £120,000 advance to Mr Wallace was to be used for his business purposes.  The bank knew that the proposed charge was an "all monies" charge which would secure any further advances that the bank might make to Mr Wallace.  In these circumstances, in my opinion, the bank was on notice of the existence of a risk that Mrs Wallace's consent to grant the charge might have been brought about by some impropriety, whether excessive pressure or misrepresentation, by Mr Wallace.  The bank needed, therefore, to take reasonable steps to satisfy itself that Mrs Wallace was entering into the transaction "freely and in knowledge of the true facts" (see <i>O'Brien</i> [1994] 1 AC 180, 198).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;260. Lloyd J decided the constructive notice issue in favour of the bank.  He took the view that although Mr Samson, having accepted the instructions given him by the bank's letter of 13 December 1988, owed the bank a duty, that duty was to witness the signature of Mrs Wallace and to return to the bank the signed document, or, if she did not sign, the unsigned document.  But the judge said "It was not, I think, any part of his function to inform the bank as to what passed between him and her by way of advice or indeed communications on her part seeking advice."  As to the endorsement that Mr Samson had written under Mrs Wallace's signature, Lloyd J said that it "carries with it a sufficient representation that he [ie Mr Samson] had given all necessary explanation and advice to her", and added:</p>
<p></p><ul>"in this situation the risk of her not being properly advised is one which lies between her and Mr Samson and which cannot be passed on to the bank."<p></p></ul>
<p>The Court of Appeal agreed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;261. I would agree that if Mr Samson had indeed been acting as Mrs Wallace's solicitor these conclusions and the reasons for them would have been unassailable.  But Mrs Wallace's criticism of these conclusions has been based mainly on the proposition that Mr Samson was not her solicitor.  She did not instruct him to give her any advice about the legal charge and he did not in fact give her any advice.  Nor had the bank in its letter of 13 December 1988 asked Mr Samson to give her any advice about the legal charge.  It had simply asked him to "attend to the necessary formalities for us".  It is true, as the evidence stands, that Mrs Wallace never did instruct Mr Samson to give her advice and that he gave her none.  It seems also to be true that Mr Samson never held himself out to Mrs Wallace as her solicitor with a duty to advise her.  On her evidence, he simply witnessed her signature.  Whether she noticed the endorsement he wrote beneath her signature is not clear.   In my opinion, for summary judgment purposes, your Lordships must proceed on the footing that Mr Samson was not Mrs Wallace's solicitor.  On whose behalf then was he acting?  The answer must, in my opinion, be that he was acting on behalf of the bank from whom he received his instructions and to whom he submitted his fee note.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;262. The issue of constructive notice depends not on how Mr Samson's role appeared to Mrs Wallace, but on how his role appeared to the bank.  If Mr Samson had not added the endorsement below Mrs Wallace's signature, the bank would, as I read the evidence, have had no reason to believe she had received any explanation about the legal charge.  In that case the bank, on notice of the risk that Mrs Wallace's consent to the legal charge might have been improperly obtained by undue influence or misrepresentation by her husband, would have taken no steps at all to satisfy itself that her consent to the legal charge had been given "freely and in knowledge of the true facts" (<i>O'Brien</i>, at<i> </i>p 198).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;263. Mr Samson's endorsement was, I would agree, a clear representation by him to the bank that he had acted as Mrs Wallace's solicitor for the purpose of giving her advice about the contents and effect of the legal charge.  In the face of that representation, I would accept that the bank would ordinarily have been entitled to be satisfied that it could reasonably rely on Mrs Wallace's apparent consent to the transaction, evidenced by her signing of the legal charge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;264. But Mr Samson, on the occasion when Mr and Mrs Wallace attended at his offices in order to sign the legal charge, was acting as the bank's solicitor on the bank's instructions.  He was not acting as Mrs Wallace's solicitor, nor, for that matter, as Mr Wallace's.  In these circumstances, in my opinion, section 199(1)(ii)(b) of the Law of Property Act, 1925, comes into play.  I have already set out the text of this statutory provision and discussed its implications in the type of cases that your Lordships are dealing with.  On the evidence as it now stands Mr Samson knew that he had given no explanation to Mrs Wallace of the nature and effect of the legal charge.  His failure was, since he was acting for the bank, the bank's failure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;265. Accordingly, in my opinion, if the facts alleged by Mrs Wallace in her affidavit are correct the bank never shed the constructive notice imputed to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;266. I would, therefore, allow Mrs Wallace's appeal.  The case must go to trial.</p>
<i>
<p><i>National Westminster Bank Plc v Gill</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;267. This is another case that comes to your Lordships' House after a full trial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;268. Mr and Mrs Gill were, in 1988, the joint owners of 60A, Queen's Park Avenue, Bournemouth, their matrimonial home.  On 20 February 1989 they executed a legal charge under which the property was charged with payment of all Mr Gill's liabilities to the bank.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;269. In December 1995, after demands by the bank for repayment of sums it had advanced to Mr Gill were not met, the bank commenced proceedings for possession of the property with a view to its sale.  Mrs Gill's defence to the claim was that her consent to the legal charge had been procured by Mr Gill's undue influence and that the bank had had constructive notice of the impropriety.  Both the trial judge, Mr Recorder Paulusz, and the Court of Appeal rejected the constructive notice allegation.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;270. Mr Gill was a second hand car dealer carrying on business from home.  In December 1988 he had the opportunity to acquire a garage business carried on from leasehold premises known as Gresham Garage.  The purchase price was £40,000.  He applied to the bank for a loan of £100,000 partly to fund the acquisition and partly to finance the garage and car sales business that he hoped to carry on from Gresham Garage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;271. On 19 December 1988 the bank made Mr Gill a written offer of the £100,000 loan.  One of the terms of the offer was that the loan be secured by a second charge of 60A, Queen's Park Avenue.  The bank did not have any communication with Mrs Gill about the proposed loan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;272. On 14 February 1989 Mr Gill contracted to purchase Gresham Garage for £40,000.  He paid a £4,000 deposit.  Completion was due on 20 February 1989.  The sum due on completion was £36,799.  Solicitors, Matthew &amp; Matthew, were acting for Mr Gill in the transaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;273. On 16 February 1989 the bank wrote to Matthew &amp; Matthew and enclosed the form of legal charge, charging the matrimonial home as security for Mr Gill's liabilities to the bank, that they required Mr and Mrs Gill to sign.  The letter said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"As [the document] is in relation to the sole liabilities of Mr Gill it will be necessary for Mrs Gill to receive separate legal advice as to the nature of the document and perhaps you would confirm that this is done prior to the signing of the form".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;274. On Monday 20 February 1989, Mr Gill told Mrs Gill that she had to go with him to Matthew &amp; Matthew for the purpose of having their signature to documents witnessed.  At the solicitors' offices they saw Mr West, a legal executive, and Mr Richard Matthew, a partner.  Important evidence of what happened on this occasion was given by Mrs Gill and by Mr West and Mr Matthew.  Mr Gill was not called to give evidence.  Where the evidence of Mrs Gill and that of Mr West and Mr Matthew conflicted, the Recorder preferred the evidence of the latter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;275. Mrs Gill gave evidence that there had been a heated altercation between herself and her husband when she discovered that she was being asked to sign a mortgage of the matrimonial home.  She said that when the document was placed before her for signature she had asked what it was and that her husband had told her he needed her signature to be able to buy the garage.  She said he had told her that the bank was lending him £36,000.  She disputed Mr West's evidence that he had explained the document to her and said that neither Mr West nor Mr Matthew, with whom she had a conversation in a separate room in the absence of her husband, had given her any explanation about the nature of the document that was offered for her signature.  Nonetheless, the Recorder found that Mr Matthew did, while he was alone with her, give her "a full and adequate explanation of the meaning of the document" and expressed himself as being "satisfied that Mrs Gill did receive proper and adequate advice".  Mrs Gill told the Recorder that she had had no alternative but to sign.  The Recorder did not accept that evidence.  He did find, on the contrary, that Mr Gill had spoken enthusiastically to her about the garage and its prospects and that she shared his enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;276. It was, however, clear that neither Mr West nor Mr Matthew had known that the amount the bank had agreed to advance was £100,000.  The amount secured by the legal charge was not expressed to be subject to any limit but the purchase price of Gresham Garage was only £40,000.  So it is believable that Mrs Gill was under the misapprehension that the bank loan was to be £36,000 (£4,000 having already been paid as a deposit).  It is believable also that Mrs Gill had obtained this misapprehension from what her husband had told her.  The advice that, as the Recorder found, Mr West and Mr Matthew gave Mrs Gill did not go beyond explaining the nature and effect of the legal charge that she was being asked to sign.  Neither was in a position to offer any advice about the commercial advantages or disadvantages of the purchase of the garage premises and business or about the wisdom of Mrs Gill agreeing to charge the matrimonial home with her husband's indebtedness to the bank.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;277. Mr and Mrs Gill signed the legal charge on 20 February at Matthew &amp; Matthew's offices and the solicitors then wrote to the bank in the following terms:</p>
<p></p><ul>"We confirm that the mortgage documentation supplied has been executed by Mr and Mrs Gill in accordance with your requirements, and we confirm that Mrs Gill was separately advised."<p></p></ul>
<p>On this evidence Mr Recorder Paulusz, although he held that the case was one in which there was a presumption of undue influence, rejected the contention that the bank should be taken to have had constructive notice of the undue influence.  The Court of Appeal agreed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;278. On the constructive notice point, I am in agreement with the Recorder and the Court of Appeal.  The case was one in which the natural trust and confidence that the bank would have expected Mrs Gill to have, and that she did in fact have, in her husband, coupled with the nature of the transaction, namely, a charge over her property as security for his debts, raised the risk that her consent to the transaction might have been obtained by undue influence or misrepresentation.  But the confirmation to the bank, that before signing the legal charge Mrs Gill had been separately advised by solicitors, as indeed she had been, and, by implication, that the advice had related to the nature and effect of the legal charge, entitled the bank to be satisfied that it could safely rely on her apparent consent to the transaction as being a true consent.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;279. There is some basis in the evidence for thinking that Mrs Gill may have been induced to sign by her husband's misrepresentation that the loan agreed to be made by the bank was only £36,000.  It does not appear, however, that any weight at the trial or in the Court of Appeal was sought to be placed on this misrepresentation.  The emphasis seems to have been all on undue influence. Whatever may have been the reason for this, it cannot, in my opinion, affect the conclusion on the constructive notice issue.  The legal charge secured Mr Gill's indebtedness to the bank whatever the amount of the indebtedness might be.  Matthew &amp; Matthew's confirmation to the bank that Mrs Gill had received separate advice was an implicit confirmation that she had been advised about the meaning and effect of the document - as, indeed, the Recorder found she had.  That advice would have included advice that the amount of the current loan might in the future be increased.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;280. I have earlier in this opinion expressed the view that in all cases the lender bank should inform the surety wife, or her solicitors, of the amount of the agreed facility and of any existing indebtedness that would be secured under the proposed charge.  If that had been done in the present case, it would have guarded Mrs Gill against a misapprehension about the amount of the agreed loan.  But in the circumstances of this case, and in particular in view of the fact that no limit on the amount of the secured liability was expressed in the legal charge, the fact that the bank did not disclose this information does not, in my opinion, constitute a failure by the bank to take reasonable steps to satisfy itself that Mrs Gill's consent had not been improperly procured.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;281. Finally, a comment on undue influence is prompted by the facts of this case.  The Recorder held that although there was no actual undue influence, there was a presumption of undue influence since the case fell within category 2B.  The Court of Appeal recorded these findings without comment.  In my opinion, these findings disclose the same  error to which I have referred previously in this opinion.  By the end of the trial the Recorder, having heard all the evidence, had to decide whether or not undue influence had been established.  Either the evidence did justify a finding of undue influence or it did not.  On the evidence in the case a finding of undue influence would, in my opinion, have been unthinkable.  Mrs Gill had been enthusiastic about the purchase of Gresham Garage.  She knew she was signing a legal charge under which her home became security for her husband's debts to the bank incurred in acquiring the premises and business.  She had been separately advised by a solicitor about the nature and effect of the document she was to sign.  The highest her case can be put is that she would have liked more time to consider whether or not to sign.  She said in evidence:</p>
<p></p><ul>"I did sign the documents put in front of me but with time for more reflection, and in less urgent circumstances, with proper advice to think about it, and time to consult a solicitor of my own, I would never have done so."<p></p></ul>
<p>This is a quite inadequate basis, in my opinion, for a finding of undue influence.  I do not think this was a case in which there was ever any evidence giving rise to the presumption of undue influence.  But, if there was, by the end of the trial the presumption had been rebutted.  In my opinion, Mrs Gill's appeal must be dismissed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;282. This, too, is a case where there has been a full trial.  The mortgaged property, 52, Ashtead Road, Clapton, London E5, was purchased by Mr and Mrs Coleman on 9 July 1986 in their joint names.  It was their matrimonial home.  By a legal charge signed on 30 January 1991 they charged the property with the repayment of sums advanced by the bank for the purpose of enabling Mr Coleman to make some speculative property acquisitions in Uxbridge Road, Hayes, Middlesex and in Brooklyn, New York.  In 1995, after the bank's demand for payment of the outstanding debt had not been met, the bank commenced proceedings for, among other things, possession of the property with a view to its sale.  Mrs Coleman defended the proceedings by alleging that she had consented to the legal charge under the undue influence of her husband and that the bank had had constructive notice of that impropriety.   The trial judge, Judge Wakefield, took the view that the legal charge was not to the manifest disadvantage of Mrs Coleman, that there was no presumption of undue influence and that undue influence had not been established.  He expressed the view, also, that the bank had not taken reasonable steps to avoid constructive notice if there had been any undue influence.  The Court of Appeal disagreed with the judge on both points, and therefore concurred with the judge in the result.  First, the court held that the transaction was to Mrs Coleman's material disadvantage and that, in the circumstances, undue influence was to be presumed.  But they held, secondly, that constructive notice should not be imputed to the bank.  Before your Lordships Mr Jarvis QC, for the bank, has not argued against the Court of Appeal's conclusion on the undue influence issue.  He accepts that if the bank had constructive notice that Mrs Coleman's consent may have been improperly obtained, her appeal is entitled to succeed.</p>
