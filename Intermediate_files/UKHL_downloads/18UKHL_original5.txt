<p class="para">103.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the Code makes detailed provision for obtaining authorisation for monitoring consultations covered by legal professional privilege.  It was laid before and approved by Parliament, but no point appears to have been taken that RIPA did not cover such consultations.  It would be surprising at least that no objection was made to the inclusion of those provisions in the Code if it was thought that Parliament had not intended that the consultations be covered by RIPA.</p>
<p class="para">104.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Girvan LJ pointed in paragraph 27 of his judgment to the specific exception in section 97 of the Police Act 1997 of situations where knowledge of matters subject to legal privilege was likely to be acquired, and contrasted that with the provisions of RIPA, relying on this to support the conclusion that RIPA was not intended to extend to such situations.  Subsections (1) and (2) provide as follows:</p>
<p class="qt">“(1) An authorisation to which this section applies shall not take effect until- </p>
<p class="qt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) it has been approved in accordance with this &nbsp;&nbsp;section by a Commissioner appointed under section &nbsp;&nbsp;91(1)(b), and</p>
<p class="qt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the person who gave the authorisation has been &nbsp;&nbsp;notified under subsection (4).</p>
<p class="qt">(2) Subject to subsection (3), this section applies to an authorisation if, at the time it is given, the person who gives it believes- </p>
<p class="qt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) that any of the property specified in the &nbsp;&nbsp;authorisation- </p>
<p class="qt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) is used wholly or mainly as a dwelling or &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as a bedroom in a hotel, or</p>
<p class="qt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) constitutes office premises, or </p>
<p class="qt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) that the action authorised by it is likely to result &nbsp;&nbsp;in any person acquiring knowledge of- </p>
<p class="qt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) matters subject to legal privilege,</p>
<p class="qt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) confidential personal information, or </p>
<p class="qt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) confidential journalistic material.”</p>
<p class="paraleft">It may be seen from the terms of section 97 that it is intended to be a special provision limiting the general powers conferred by the other provisions of Part III of the Act.  It does not follow that the Act would not have applied to privileged consultations without section 97.  I therefore do not think that this point assists the appellants’ contentions.  If anything, it goes the other way.</p>
<p class="para">105.&nbsp;&nbsp;I conclude accordingly that Parliament intended that the covert surveillance provisions of RIPA should extend to the type of lawyer/client and doctor/patient consultations which are ordinarily protected by legal professional privilege.  I would therefore answer in the affirmative questions 1 and 2 of the certified questions in the appeals of C, A and McE and question 1 in M’s appeal.  As I agree with the conclusion of the Divisional Court concerning the proportionality of directed surveillance of such consultations, I would answer the third certified question in the affirmative.  I would dismiss the appeals.  I have reservations about the appropriateness of the wording of the declarations, but as no appeal has been brought against their grant and none of the certified questions deals with them, I would leave them undisturbed. </p>
<p class="lawlord">LORD NEUBERGER OF ABBOTSBURY</p>
<p class="mylords">My Lords,</p>
<p class="para">106.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, Part II of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (“RIPA”) permits covert surveillance of communications and consultations between a person in custody and his or her lawyer, notwithstanding that such communications enjoy legal professional privilege, and despite such a person’s statutory right to consult a solicitor privately. Having had the benefit of reading in draft the opinion of my noble and learned friends Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers and Lord Carswell, which set out all the relevant material, I can express my reasons relatively shortly.</p>
<p class="para">107.&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with my noble and learned friend, Baroness Hale of Richmond, whose draft opinion I have also seen, that there are two essential features which compel my conclusion. First, there are the clear and wide opening words of section 27(1) of RIPA, which provide that covert surveillance, if carried out in accordance with the Act, “shall be lawful for all purposes". Secondly, there is the legislative background to RIPA, and in particular the Interception of Communications Act 1985, Part III of the Police Act 1997, and the Human Rights Act 1998, as considered in the context of the European Convention and the relevant Strasbourg jurisprudence.</p>
<p class="para">108.&nbsp;&nbsp;If covert surveillance is carried out in accordance with Part II of RIPA, the natural meaning of the opening words of section 27(1) is that, whatever rights would otherwise be infringed thereby, the surveillance is nonetheless lawful. As Lord Phillips’s admirable survey of the law demonstrates, this case involves two rights, which are different, but very closely connected, namely the right of a person to consult a lawyer in private, and the right to legal professional privilege in connection with communications with one’s lawyer. Any modern civilised legal system recognises the fundamental importance of these two rights, and therefore one feels an instinctive initial reluctance to hold that section 27(1) permits covert surveillance of such consultations and communications, as it would appear significantly to undermine such important rights.</p>
<p class="para">109.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, while these two rights are very important, neither can possibly be regarded as unqualified.  Both rights can self-evidently be abused for improper, even criminal, purposes; indeed, as a result of such abuse, the rights themselves could fall into disrepute. The right to privilege in respect of communications has thus always been subject to the so-called iniquity exception: see <i>R v Cox and Railton </i>(1884) 14 QBD 153, 167, and, more recently, <i>Barclays Bank plc v Eustice </i>[1995] 1 WLR 1238, 1249 (although, for my part, I would leave open the question of whether the latter case was rightly decided). The right to private consultation must plainly be subject to the same exception, given, as Lord Phillips says, that the rationale underlying both rights is the same, but also because the iniquity exception would be pointless if it were otherwise.  Strasbourg jurisprudence also recognises that neither right is absolute, for the same reasons - see e.g. <i>Klass v Germany </i>(1978) 2 EHRR 214 and the other cases identified by Lord Carswell in paras 84 to 86. </p>
<p class="para">110.&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, as explained more fully by Baroness Hale in paras 68 to 70, RIPA was enacted ahead of the Human Rights Act 1998 coming into force, and in the context of the previous authorisation of telephone tapping and of surveillance of private conversations by the 1985 Act and Part III of the 1997 Act respectively, to achieve compliance with article 8(2) of the European Convention. This history appears to me to indicate pretty clearly that “in accordance with the law” in section 27(1) was intended to extend to Convention rights, and indeed all other rights. </p>
<p class="para">111.&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be acknowledged that there are two inherent paradoxical problems in the exercise of intercepting or listening in on privileged communications and private consultations between lawyer and client. First, the authorities cannot know if the privilege and right to privacy are being abused and that the iniquity exception applies, until the interception or listening in has occurred and its results examined. Secondly, the authorities cannot warn the parties in advance that interception or listening in will or will not occur, as to do so would defeat the whole point of the exercise. Further, it is self-evident that knowing that a consultation or communication may be the subject of surveillance could have a chilling effect on the openness which should govern communications between lawyer and client, and is the very basis of the two rights. However, none of these problems can call into question the lawfulness of the statutory authorising of the surveillance of privileged communications, although they underline the fundamental requirement of clear and stringent rules governing the authorisation, circumstances, manner, and control over the fruits, of any such surveillance. </p>
<p class="para">112.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, there is nothing intrinsically objectionable in a statute which authorises surveillance of communications and consultations between a lawyer and client, provided that the statute includes safeguards which ensure that such authorisation complies in all respects with the requirements of the Convention. Additionally, I see no reason why the safeguards cannot be in a Code of Practice, at least if the statute provides that such a code has to be created and complied with (as is the position here - see sections 71 and 72 of RIPA); that is all the more true where, as here, the code has to be laid before Parliament.</p>
<p class="para">113.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Divisional Court decided that, if private consultations between lawyers and clients could be the subject of surveillance, the controls over such surveillance under RIPA and the Code were insufficient to satisfy article 8(2) of the Convention. In effect, they held that such surveillance must at least be classified as intrusive surveillance, not directed surveillance. That decision, which appears to me to be plainly right, has realistically not been challenged by the Secretary of State. The difficult issue on which your Lordships are divided, and on which the Divisional Court was also divided, is the logically anterior question of whether section 27(1) of RIPA overrides the right to consult privately with a solicitor (“the PACE right”), contained in article 59 of the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (SI 1989/1341 (NI 12)), which is in the same terms as section 58(1) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 in England and Wales, and section 17(2) of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 in Scotland.</p>
<p class="para">114.&nbsp;&nbsp;As already mentioned, the natural meaning of section 27(1) of RIPA and the history of the earlier statutory provisions both appear to me to support the notion that the section overrides the PACE right. I also agree with all your Lordships that it is unlikely that Parliament overlooked the possibility of Part II of RIPA applying to privileged communications, not least because it was clearly considered in the 1997 Act, as Lord Phillips explains in para 18. (Indeed, if, which I greatly doubt, it is permissible to look at <i>Hansard </i>for present purposes, it appears that the issue was considered and discussed during the passage of RIPA through your Lordships’ House, as my noble and learned friend, Lord Hope of Craighead, whose opinion I have seen in draft, mentions in para 62). It must therefore follow that, when enacting RIPA, Parliament envisaged that the Code would acknowledge and deal with the importance of the professional confidence between lawyer and client. On that basis, it seems to me to be very likely that Parliament also intended that the right to consult a lawyer privately, including pursuant to the PACE right, should also be subject to section 27(1). </p>
<p class="para">115.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not much impressed with the invocation of the maxim <i>generalia specialibus non derogant </i>in this case. One could make out a reasonable case for saying that, when it comes to those in prison, it is section 27(1), rather that the PACE right, that is the <i>speciale</i>. However, more importantly, while maxims have their uses, the other factors to which I have referred are more important in assisting in the resolution of the present problem. As Lord Hope says, we are ultimately concerned with deriving Parliament’s intention from the wording of RIPA, and in particular section 27(1), which has to be read in its legislative, Convention, and case-law context. </p>
<p class="para">116.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I agree with the majority of your Lordships that section 27(1) effectively overrides the PACE right, I must confess to having been a little troubled by the contrary argument, particularly by the point made by Lord Phillips at para 38, namely that, if Parliament had had in mind the right to consult a lawyer in private when passing RIPA, it would have provided that listening into such consultations constituted intrusive surveillance rather than directed surveillance. However, it does not seem to me particularly unlikely that Parliament took the view, albeit mistakenly, that the fact that there was a right to a consultation in private should not, of itself, be sufficient to render surveillance intrusive. All the more so if one accepts that Parliament appreciated that privileged communications would be caught by RIPA: it must have therefore concluded that surveillance of privileged communications could be characterised as directed rather than intrusive.</p>
<p class="para">117.&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, as a matter of policy, provided (and it is a vital proviso) that the Code ensures that all aspects of any surveillance and its consequences comply with the Convention, it seems to me proper that section 27(1) should override the PACE right. It is a melancholy fact that there are dishonest lawyers, and it is therefore positively consistent with the permissible purpose of RIPA, and indeed with the public interest, that their freedom of action be curtailed, and that their abuse of their clients’ rights of privilege and rights to privacy be exposed, and, where appropriate, punished. That applies as much to lawyers with clients in custody as to those with clients at liberty. It also appears to me that it would be unsatisfactory if a person in custody should be free from the risk of surveillance when consulting a lawyer, when a person who is at liberty does not have the same benefit. Not only would it be an indefensible inconsistency, but, in many ways, a person in custody, who is not free to do what he wants, is more likely to try and abuse the privilege for nefarious purposes than a person who is at liberty.   </p>
<p class="para">118.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Phillips has characterised the nature of the decision of the majority of your Lordships as being that RIPA permits the Code to authorise surveillance of communications between lawyers and their clients, whether or not in custody. That is indeed as far as our decision in this case goes, and we should not, I think, be taken as thereby endorsing the provisions of the Code, as we are not directly concerned with those provisions, and, in particular, whether they comply with the requirements of the Convention. Indeed, in my view, it must be highly questionable whether the Code sufficiently clearly identifies (or limits) either the circumstances in which surveillance may or may not occur, or how the information thereby obtained may or may not be used. At least as at present advised I share the doubts and concerns about the Code expressed by Lord Phillips at paras 49 to 51. The question of the use of material obtained by surveillance could have arisen in one of the cases before us, namely that of M, had he not been released without charge, and, in that connection, I agree with Baroness Hale’s observations at paras 71to 74.</p>
<p class="para">119.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also respectfully agree with what Lord Phillips says at paras 52 and 53. Having decided not to appeal the Divisional Court’s decision that surveillance of privileged and private consultations under the present regime is unlawful, the Secretary of State should have ensured that such surveillance did not take place or she should have promptly changed the regime so as to comply with the Divisional Court’s decision. As Lord Carswell points out, more than a year has elapsed since that decision, and your Lordships were told that the Secretary of State was not even in a position to produce a draft regulation embodying the changes to ensure that such surveillance was carried out legally. Unless no surveillance of privileged and private consultations has been going on for the past year in the United Kingdom (which appears most unlikely), this strongly suggests that the Government has been knowingly sanctioning illegal surveillance for more than a year. If that is indeed so, to describe such a state of affairs as “regrettable” strikes me as an understatement. </p>
<p class="para">120.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, which I believe fully accord with the more fully reasoned opinion of Lord Carswell, as well as with the opinions of Lord Hope and Baroness Hale, and indeed most of the reasoning of Lord Phillips, I would concur in making the orders proposed by Lord Carswell.  </p>
