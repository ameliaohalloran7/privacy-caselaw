<p align="right"><a href="graham-2.htm">(back to preceding text)</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;57. I do not find it necessary to decide whether the Grahams obtained exclusive possession under the agreement of 1 February 1983:  I will assume that the Court of Appeal was right in holding that they did not.  But even on that assumption it must be borne in mind that, ignorant of the legal niceties, the parties as lay people plainly thought that the Grahams were obtaining "possession" for eleven months and in order to regain "possession" during the currency of the agreement Pye would have had to serve notice.  In my judgment the form of the agreement is inconsistent with any clear distinction being drawn by the parties between possession on the one hand and occupation without possession on the other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;58. The second stage of the Court of Appeal reasoning was that, after the termination of the licence on 31 December 1983, and of the mowing agreement in August 1984, the Grahams continued to use the land in just the same way as they had during the currency of the grazing agreement:  all that changed was that use was no longer permissive.  In my view the facts as found by the judge or agreed do not support this view.  The grazing agreement expired on 31 December 1983.  In a letter from Pye's agents dated 30 December 1983 the Grahams were expressly required to vacate the disputed land.  But the Grahams did not vacate the disputed land either then or at any later date.  They spread dung on the land, harrowed it and rolled it.  They overwintered dry cattle and yearlings in a shed on the land.  From 1 January 1984 onwards the Grahams repeatedly did things on the disputed land which they would have had no right to do under the old grazing agreement even if it had still been in force.  The objective facts demonstrate that the Grahams made such use of the disputed land as they wished irrespective of whether it fell within the terms of any hypothetical grazing agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;59. To this must be added another factor of some importance.  When in January 1984 Pye refused to grant a further grazing licence they did so expressly on the grounds of the advice which they had received that, for planning purposes, they should have all the land in hand.  Therefore, as the judge pointed out, the Grahams by grazing the land during 1984 and thereafter were not only acting without permission of the paper owner:  they were acting in a way which, to their knowledge, was directly contrary to the wishes of the proprietors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60. The third limb of the Court of Appeal reasoning is that Michael Graham's evidence, contrary to his interest, was consistent with the Grahams' intention being not to possess the land on their own behalf but only to graze it as though there continued to be a grazing licence.  In expressing this view the Court of Appeal was selective in its choice of the evidence in Michael Graham's witness statement, relying only on such evidence as was contrary to his interest.  It is true that from the decision in <i>Powell</i> onwards judges have stressed the common sense caution to be shown towards self-serving evidence such as that which can be given by a squatter as to his own intention at a past time.  But this case is different:  the Court of Appeal is relying on part of Mr Michael Graham's evidence as to his attitude whilst ignoring other parts of the evidence.  In my judgment a proper view can only be formed by looking at the whole of his evidence on the subject.  The judge specifically accepted his evidence that the disputed land was farmed together with Manor Farm effectively as a single unit.  As the judge pointed out, there was independent evidence that Michael Graham "treated the [disputed] land" as his own.  When all the evidence is looked at in my judgment it is wholly consistent with the judge's view that, although the Grahams would have been willing to pay for the use of the disputed land if asked, such willingness is not inconsistent with them intending to possess the land in the meantime as demonstrated by them treating the land as part of Manor Farm and maintaining it on the same basis as the rest of the farm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;61. If the view of the Court of Appeal were to be correct, the result would be anomalous.  Although from 1984 to 1997 the Grahams were the only people who did anything on the disputed land and Pye had throughout that period been physically excluded from the land, nevertheless Pye was throughout to be treated as in possession.  In my judgment, however favourably one approaches the claim of a paper owner to possession, such a conclusion would be so unrealistic as to be an impossible one.  For all practical purposes the Grahams used the land as their own and in a way normal for an owner to use it throughout the period from August 1984 onwards.  During that whole period Pye did nothing on the disputed land from which they were wholly excluded save on foot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;62. Therefore I cannot accept the reasoning on which the Court of Appeal and Pye in their submissions before your Lordships sought to demonstrate that the Grahams did not intend to possess the land.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;63. In his persuasive submissions for Pye Mr Gaunt QC, whilst adopting the general tenor of the Court of Appeal reasoning, sought to concentrate attention on the first two and a half years, ie. from 31 December 1983 to 30 April 1986.  He was inclined to concede that at a later stage the Grahams might have been in possession.  But, he submitted correctly, the Grahams had to demonstrate that they had dispossessed Pye before 30 April 1986.  He submitted that this had not been done:  from the date of the end of the grazing agreement the Grahams were seeking to obtain further grazing licences from Pye.  Although this was initially refused they were granted the right to cut hay in 1984.  Then in 1984 they again sought to obtain grazing licences but there was no response from Pye.  Therefore, he submitted, whatever may have been the position in the later stages the Grahams had not demonstrated an intention to possess the disputed land on their own behalf before 30 April 1986 and accordingly had not demonstrated that Pye had been dispossessed before that date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;64. This is the most persuasive way of formulating Pye's case but I do not accept it.  Despite Pye's notification to quit the land in December 1983, its peremptory refusal of a further grazing licence in 1984 and the totally ignored later requests for a grazing licence, after 31 December 1983 the Grahams stayed in occupation of the disputed land using it for what purposes they thought fit.  Some of those purposes (ie. the grazing) would have fallen within a hypothetical grazing agreement.  But the rest are only consistent with an intention, verified by Mr Michael Graham, to use the land as they thought best.  That approach was adopted from the outset.  In my judgment, when the Grahams remained in factual possession of the fully enclosed land after the expiry of the mowing licence they manifestly intended to assert their possession against Pye.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;65. Finally I should mention one further point.  In the Court of Appeal Pye unsuccessfully contended that the Human Rights Act 1998 affected the appeal which came on for hearing on 4 December 2000, ie. after the Act had come into effect on 2 October 2000.  Before your Lordships' House, it was conceded that the Human Rights Act did not have a retrospective effect.  But Pye submitted that, even under the common law principles of construction applicable before the Human Rights Act came into effect, the Court should seek to apply the law so as to make it consistent with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights.  Any such old principle of construction only applied where there was an ambiguity in the language of a statute.  No such ambiguity in the Act of 1980 was demonstrated to your Lordships.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66. For these reasons I would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of Neuberger J.</p>
<p><b>LORD HOPE OF CRAIGHEAD</b></p>
<p><b>My Lords,</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;67. I have had the advantage of reading in draft the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Browne-Wilkinson.  I agree with it, and for the reasons which he has given I too would allow the appeal.  I should like however to add a few brief observations on the concept of "adverse possession" and on the apparent injustice of the result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;68. Where a person in whose favour the period of limitation can run under section 15 of the Limitation Act 1980 is in the possession of land, he is described in paragraph 8(1) of Schedule 1 to that Act as being in "adverse possession".  This use of the expression "adverse possession" has been followed in the Land Registration Act 2002, which has introduced a new regime for the registration of an adverse possessor of an estate in land or rent charge: see section 97.  The details are set out in Schedule 6 to that Act.  Paragraph 1(1) of the Schedule provides that a person may apply to the registrar to be registered as the proprietor of a registered estate in land if he has been in adverse possession of the estate for a period of ten years ending on the date of the application.  The phrase "adverse possession" is defined in paragraph 11 of the Schedule.  In brief, a person is in adverse possession for the purposes of the 2002 Act if, but for the disapplication by section 96 of that Act of periods of limitation against a registered proprietor, a period of limitation would run in his favour in relation to the estate under section 15 of the Limitation Act 1980.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;69. It is plainly of some importance, both now and for the future, to understand what the use of the word "adverse" in the context of section 15 of the Limitation Act 1980 was intended to convey.  At first sight, it might be thought that the word "adverse" describes the nature of the possession that the squatter needs to demonstrate.  It suggests that an element of aggression, hostility or subterfuge is required.  But an examination of the context makes it clear that this is not so.  It is used as a convenient label only, in recognition simply of the fact that the possession is adverse to the interests of the paper owner or, in the case of registered land, of the registered proprietor.  The context is that of a person bringing an action to recover land who has been in possession of land but has been dispossessed or has discontinued his possession: paragraph 8 of Schedule 1 to the 1980 Act.  His right of action is treated as accruing as soon as the land is in the possession of some other person in whose favour the limitation period can run.  In that sense, and for that purpose, the other person's possession is adverse to his.  But the question whether that other person is in fact in possession of the land is a separate question on which the word "adverse" casts no light. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70. The general rule, which English law has derived from the Roman law, is that only one person can be in possession at any one time.  Exclusivity is of the essence of possession.  The same rule applies in cases where two or more persons are entitled to the enjoyment of property simultaneously.  As between themselves they have separate rights, but as against everyone else they are in the position of a single owner.  Once possession has begun, as in the case of the owner of land with a paper title who has entered into occupation of it, his possession is presumed to continue.  But it can be transferred from one person to another, and it can also be lost when it is given up or discontinued.  When that happens, possession can be acquired by someone else.  The acquisition of possession requires both an intention to take or occupy the land ("animus") and some act of the body ("corpus") which gives effect to that intention.  Occupation of the land alone is not enough, nor is an intention to occupy which is not put into effect by action.  Both aspects must be examined, and each is bound up with the other.  But acts of the mind can be, and sometimes can only be, demonstrated by acts of the body.  In practice, the best evidence of intention is frequently found in the acts which have taken place.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;71. The question as to the nature of the intention that has to be demonstrated to establish possession was controversial, particularly among jurists in Germany: see, for example, Henry Bond, <i>Possession in the Roman Law</i> (1890)  6 LQR 259.  But it is reasonably clear that the <i>animus </i>which is required is the intent to exercise exclusive control over the thing for oneself: Bond, p 270.  The important point for present purposes is that it is not necessary to show that there was a deliberate intention to exclude the paper owner or the registered proprietor.  The word "adverse" in the context of section 15(1) of the Limitation Act 1980 does not carry this implication.  The only intention which has to be demonstrated is an intention to occupy and use the land as one's own.  This is a concept which Rankine, <i>The Law of Land-Ownership in Scotland</i> (4th ed, 1909), p 4, captured in his use of the Latin phrase<i> cum animo rem sibi habendi</i> (see his reference in footnote 1 to Savigny, <i>Das Recht des Besitzes</i>, translated by Perry (1848), paras 1-11).  It is similar to that which was introduced into the law of Scotland by the Prescription Act 1617, c 12 relating to the acquisition of an interest in land by positive prescription.  The possession that is required for that purpose is possession "openly, peaceably and without any judicial interruption" on a competing title for the requisite period: Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1973, section 1(1)(a).  So I would hold that, if the evidence shows that the person was using the land in the way one would expect him to use if it he were the true owner, that is enough.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72. I agree that the only conclusion that can reasonably be drawn from the evidence is that the Grahams occupied and used the disputed land as their own for twelve years before these actions were brought.  The limitation provision in section 15 of the Limitation Act 1980 applies.  The case has to be treated as one where the registered owner, having been dispossessed, has lost the right to recover the land.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73. The question whether this result is incompatible with the Pye's rights under article 1 of the First Protocol to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms was answered by the Court of Appeal in the negative:  [2001]  Ch 804.  It was not pursued before your Lordships.  This is a civil and not a criminal case: see my observations in <i>R v Kansal (No 2)</i> [2001]  3 WLR 1562, 1586G-1587B.  Nevertheless it was conceded that section 22(4) of the Human Rights Act 1998 did not apply as this was an appeal against a decision of a court or tribunal which was made before 2 October 2000.  The question itself however is not an easy one, as one might have expected the law - in the context of a statutory regime where compensation is not available - to lean in favour of the protection of a registered proprietor against the actions of persons who cannot show a competing title on the register.  Fortunately, as my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill has pointed out, a much more rigorous regime has now been enacted in Schedule 6 to the Land Registration Act 2002.  Its effect will be to make it much harder for a squatter who is in possession of registered land to obtain a title to it against the wishes of the proprietor.  The unfairness in the old regime which this case has demonstrated lies not in the absence of compensation, although that is an important factor, but in the lack of safeguards against oversight or inadvertence on the part of the registered proprietor. </p>
<p><b>LORD HUTTON</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74. I have had the advantage of reading in draft the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Browne-Wilkinson.  I would allow this appeal for the reasons which he gives and with which I am in full agreement.  I wish only to make some brief observations in relation to the proof of intention to possess which is referred to by Slade J in his classic judgment in <i>Powell v Macfarlane</i> (1977)  38 P &amp; CR 452, 470:</p>
<p></p><ul>"If the law is to attribute possession of land to a person who can establish no paper title to possession, he must be shown to have both factual possession and the requisite intention to possess ('<i>animus possidendi</i>')."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75. In the present case from August 1984 onwards the Grahams made full use of the disputed land as if they were the owners - they did everything which an owner of the land would have done and when an experienced chartered surveyor, called on behalf of the plaintiffs, was asked in cross-examination what an occupying owner of the disputed land might have done over and above what was done by the Grahams between 1984 and 1997, he was unable to think of anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76. I consider that such use of land by a person who is occupying it will normally make it clear that he has the requisite intention to possess and that such conduct should be viewed by a court as establishing that intention, unless the claimant with the paper title can adduce other evidence which points to a contrary conclusion.  Where the evidence establishes that the person claiming title under the Limitation Act 1980 has occupied the land and made full use of it in the way in which an owner would, I consider that in the normal case he will not have to adduce additional evidence to establish that he had the intention to possess.  It is in cases where the acts in relation to the land of a person claiming title by adverse possession are equivocal and are open to more than one interpretation that those acts will be insufficient to establish the intention to possess.  But it is different if the actions of the occupier make it clear that he is using the land in the way in which a full owner would and in such a way that the owner is excluded.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77. The conclusion to be drawn from such acts by an occupier is recognised  by Slade J in <i>Powell v Macfarlane,</i> at p 472:</p>
<p></p><ul>"If his acts are open to more than one interpretation and he has not made it perfectly plain to the world at large by his actions or words that he has intended to exclude the owner as best he can, the courts will treat him as not having had the requisite <i>animus possidendi</i> and consequently as not having dispossessed the owner."<p></p></ul>
<p>And, at page 476:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In my judgment it is consistent with principle as well as authority that a person who originally entered another's land as a trespasser, but later seeks to show that he has dispossessed the owner, should be required to adduce compelling evidence that he had the requisite <i>animus possidendi</i> in any case where his use of the land was equivocal, in the sense that it did not necessarily, by itself, betoken an intention on his part to claim the land as his own and exclude the true owner."<p></p></ul>
<p>In another passage of his judgment at pp 471-472 Slade J explains what is meant by "an intention on his part to …. exclude the true owner":</p>
<p></p><ul>"What is really meant, in my judgment, is that the <i>animus possidendi</i> involves the intention, in one's own name and on one's own behalf, to exclude the world at large, including the owner with the paper title if he be not himself the possessor, so far as is reasonably practicable and so far as the processes of the law will allow."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78. It is clear that the fact that the Grahams would have given up occupation to the plaintiffs or would have made payment for their occupation to the plaintiffs, if requested to do so, does not prevent the existence of the intention to possess:  see the judgment of the Privy Council delivered by Lord Diplock in <i>Ocean Estates Ltd v Pinder</i> [1969]  2 AC 19, 24.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79. Therefore I consider that Clarke LJ was right to state in <i>Lambeth London Borough Council v Blackburn</i> (2001)  82 P &amp; CR 494, 504: </p>
<p></p><ul>"I would not for my part think it appropriate to strain to hold that a trespasser who had established factual possession of the property for the necessary 12 years did not have the <i>animus possidendi</i> identified in the cases.  I express that view for two reasons.  The first is that the requirement that there be a sufficient manifestation of the intention provides protection for landowners and the second is that once it is held that the trespasser has factual possession it will very often be the case that he can establish the manifested intention.  Indeed it is difficult to find a case in which there has been a clear finding of factual possession in which the claim to adverse possession has failed for lack of intention."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80. In the present case I am of the opinion that the manner in which the Grahams occupied and used the land points unequivocally to the intention to possess and I further consider, for the reasons given by Lord Browne-Wilkinson, that the witness statement of the late Mr Michael Graham, when it is considered as a whole and together with the other evidence, does not lead to a different conclusion. </p>
