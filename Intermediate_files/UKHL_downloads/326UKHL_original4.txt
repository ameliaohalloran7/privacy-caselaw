<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83.&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn to the legislative history. As originally enacted, the Rent Act 1977 provided, as had earlier Rent Acts, that on the death of a statutory tenant without a widow but leaving a member of his family living with him at his death, that person should become a statutory tenant by succession. If there was more than one such person then, in the absence of agreement between them, the court should decide which of them would become the statutory tenant. If the tenant left a widow who was residing in the dwellinghouse at his death, however, she had a right to a statutory tenancy in priority to other members of his family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an important feature of this legislation that the widow succeeded to the tenancy by virtue of her status, much as she would succeed to her late husband's estate on intestacy. She merely had to produce her marriage certificate. She did not have to prove that the marriage was happy, or stable, or long-lasting, or that the parties had been faithful to each other. The marriage could have been unhappy, tempestuous, or very recent; she could have been unfaithful; her husband could have begun divorce proceedings. Provided that she was living <i>in the dwellinghouse</i> (not necessarily with her husband) at the date of the tenant's death and he was still her husband, she was entitled to become the statutory tenant. She did not have to prove that she deserved to do so. Merit did not come into it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85.&nbsp;&nbsp;The primacy given to the widow's claim was not, of course, at the expense of the landlord. She was a member of the tenant's family, and if she was the only member of his family who was residing in the dwellinghouse when he died she would be entitled to a statutory tenancy anyway. It was only when there was more than one member of his family who qualified that her priority was of any significance; and this was at the expense of the others. Even then hers would normally be the most deserving claim.  This provides the key to an understanding of the legislative policy behind the Rent Acts. The widow was to succeed by virtue of her status alone; she was not to be required to prove that she was more deserving than (say) her mother-in-law. Parliament sought to avoid provoking bitter and unseemly family disputes over the succession. A similar policy informs the law governing intestate succession. A statutory tenancy was the creature of statute. It was merely "a status of irremovability"; it was not property. It did not form part of a deceased tenant's estate and could not pass under his will or on his intestacy. But Parliament could determine what should happen on the tenant's death; and in effect it provided for it to pass to his widow in much the same way as if it were part of his estate and he had died intestate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, as originally enacted the Rent Act 1977 conferred the right on the tenant's widow, and the Court of Appeal held that this was gender specific. Paragraph 2(1) applied only where the tenancy was in the husband's name and he predeceased his wife. It did not apply in the converse, though much less common, case where the tenancy was in the wife's name and she predeceased her husband. Today, of course, section 3 of the Human Rights Act would permit this to be corrected. "Widow" cannot mean "widower" but it can mean "widow or widower". Reading in the words "or widower" would not contradict the express terms of the statute or create a nonsense. Parliament had failed to include the less common case (perhaps because it overlooked it or thought that it had provided for it), but it had not manifested an intention to exclude it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87.&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament responded promptly. In 1980 it amended the Rent Act by substituting "surviving spouse" for "widow", producing paragraph 2(1) in its present form. For the reasons I have mentioned, this did not prejudice the landlord. It merely meant that, like the widow, the widower could succeed by virtue of his status without having to prove that he was more deserving than (say) his stepson.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1988, however, Parliament made two changes of greater significance. The first was the consequence of a policy decision to introduce more flexibility into the housing market by phasing out statutory tenancies. No more statutory tenancies were to be created in future; they would be replaced by assured tenancies. Paragraph 3 was amended so that, on the death of a statutory tenant leaving a member of his or her family residing in the dwelling house, he or she would become an assured tenant but not a statutory tenant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89.&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament did not, however, alter the right of a surviving spouse to become a statutory tenant in the place of the deceased tenant. This must, I think, have been due to a reluctance to enact what might be seen as retrospective legislation. The wife or husband of a statutory tenant had a vested right to succeed to the tenancy on the tenant's death. He or she had more than a hope of succession, for there was nothing the tenant could do to prevent it. To the extent that this might be thought to run counter to the policy to phase out statutory tenancies, it should be recalled that the surviving spouse's claim arose only on the death of a statutory tenant. Eventually there would be no more statutory tenancies, and paragraph 2 would become a dead letter. The same aversion to retrospective legislation was not, however, seen as applying, or as applying with the same force, to the claims of other members of the tenant's family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90.&nbsp;&nbsp;The present case is concerned with the second change: the introduction of paragraph 2(2). This was compelled by changes in society. Couples are increasingly living together openly as man and wife without actually marrying. It is possible that this will become the norm rather than the exception. To extend the privileges of marriage to those who choose not to marry was formerly highly controversial; it was thought by many to undermine the status of marriage. It is less controversial today. By 1988 Parliament considered that it was sufficiently acceptable to enact it in legislation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91.&nbsp;&nbsp;By enacting paragraph 2(2), therefore, Parliament was responding to changes in society. The timing of such a response is, under our constitutional arrangements, peculiarly a matter for the legislature and not the judiciary. Parliament's policy, however, had not changed. The survivor, whether a spouse or merely treated as a spouse, should still have the right to succeed to the statutory tenancy by virtue of his or her status. The difference was that he or she no longer had to prove that the relationship was recognised by law; it was sufficient that it existed in fact. The claimant no longer had to produce a marriage certificate; it was sufficient that he or she and the deceased tenant had lived openly together as husband and wife. This probably was seen as entrenching on the landlord's rights, for it must have been far from clear in 1988 that the "common law wife" or husband was a member of the other party's family. But landlords do not ask to see their tenants' marriage certificates; and the encroachment, if any, was easily justifiable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92.&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression "living together as man and wife" or "as husband and wife "is in general use and well understood. It does not mean living together as lovers whether of the same or the opposite sex. It connotes persons who have openly set up home together as man and wife. While other factors may be significant where the question arises between the parties themselves, in a context such as the present it must depend largely if not exclusively on outward appearances. It cannot depend on the relationship being a happy, or long lasting, or stable one. This would be contrary to the Parliament's long-standing policy: the survivor must succeed by virtue of his or her status. He or she is to be treated as having been the spouse of the original tenant because that is what, to all intents and purposes and to all outward appearances, the claimant was. This is, of course, not to say that they must hold themselves out as husband and wife: couples who live together as husband and wife rarely do so. It means only that they must appear to the outside world as if they were husband and wife. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, indeed, a paradox at the heart of modern society. For centuries the civil and canon law, the common law of Europe as it has been called, did not require any form of religious or secular ceremony to constitute a marriage. Persons who openly set up home together and lived together as man and wife were presumed to be married; and if they had consummated the marriage they <i>were</i> married; marriage was by habit and repute. The combined effect of the Council of Trent and the Marriage Acts put an end to all that.  But there is nothing new in treating men and women who live openly together as husband and wife as if they were married; it is a reversion to an older tradition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94.&nbsp;&nbsp;By 1988 Parliament, therefore, had successively widened the scope of paragraph 2(1). First applying only to the tenant's widow, it was extended first to his or her surviving spouse and later to a person who had lived with the tenant as his or her spouse though without actually contracting a legally binding marriage. The common feature of all these relationships is that they are open relationships between persons of the opposite sex.  Persons who set up home together may be husband and wife or live together as husband and wife; they may be lovers; or brother and sister; or friends; or fellow students; or share a common economic interest; or one may be economically dependent on the other.  But Parliament did not extend the right to persons who set up home together; but only to those who did so <i>as husband and wife</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95.&nbsp;&nbsp;Couples of the same sex can no more live together as husband and wife than they can live together as brother and sister. To extend the paragraph to persons who set up home as lovers would have been a major category extension.  It would have been highly controversial in 1988 and was not then required by the Convention. The practice of Contracting States was far from uniform; and Parliament was entitled to take the view that any further extension of paragraph (2) could wait for another day. One step at a time is a defensible legislative policy which the courts should respect. Housing Acts come before Parliament with some frequency; and Parliament was entitled to take the view that the question could be revisited without any great delay. It is just as important for legislatures not to proceed faster than society can accept as it is for judges; and under our constitutional arrangements the pace of change is for Parliament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96.&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament, as I have said, is now considering corrective legislation in the Civil Partnerships Bill currently before the House in its legislative capacity. The Bill creates a new legal relationship, called a civil partnership, which the persons of the same sex may enter into by registering themselves as civil partners. It inserts the words "or surviving civil partner" after the words "surviving spouse" in paragraph 2(1), and adds a new paragraph (2)(b):</p>
<p></p><ul>"(b) a person who was living with the original tenant as if they were civil partners shall be treated as the civil partner of the original tenant."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97.&nbsp;&nbsp;There will thus be four categories of relationship covered if the Bill becomes law: (i) spouses, ie married persons (necessarily being persons of the opposite sex); (ii) persons who live together as husband and wife who are to be treated as if they were married (and who must therefore also be of the opposite sex): (iii) civil partners (who must be of the same sex) who  are given the same rights as but are not treated as if they were married persons; and (iv) persons who live together as if they were civil partners without having registered their relationship, who are treated as if they had done so. This is a rational and sensible scheme which does not involve pretending that couples of the same sex can marry or be treated as if they had done so.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98.&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the matters which Parliament will have had to consider in debating the Civil Partnerships Bill are: (i) which statutes to amend by extending their reach to civil partners and persons living together as civil partners: (ii) whether such statutes should extend to unregistered civil partnerships in every case or whether in some cases it would be appropriate to require the parties to register their relationship before taking the benefits of the statute: (iii) whether the Bill should be retrospective to any and what extent: and (iv) from what date should the new provisions come into force. Presumably some time must elapse before a system of registration can be established: should unregistered civil partners have to wait until it is? These, and no doubt other matters, are questions of policy for the legislature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99.&nbsp;&nbsp;All this will be foreclosed by the majority. By what is claimed to be a process of interpretation of an existing statute framed in gender specific terms, and enacted at a time when homosexual relationships were not recognised by law, it is proposed to treat persons of the same sex living together as if they were living together as husband and wife and then to treat such persons as if they were lawfully married. It is to be left unclear as from what date this change in the law has taken place. If we were to decide this question we would be usurping the function of Parliament; and if we were to say that it was from the time when the European Court of Human Rights decided that such discrimination was unlawful we would be transferring the legislative power from Parliament to that court. It is, in my view, consonant with the Convention for the Contracting States to take time to consider its implications and to bring their laws into conformity with it. They do not demand retrospective legislation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100.&nbsp;&nbsp;Worse still, in support of their conclusion that the existing discrimination is incompatible with the Convention, there is a tendency in some of the speeches of the majority to refer to loving, stable and long-lasting homosexual relationships. It is left wholly unclear whether qualification for the successive tenancy is confined to couples enjoying such a relationship or, consistently with the legislative policy which Parliament has hitherto adopted, is dependent on status and not merit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion all these questions are essentially questions of social policy which should be left to Parliament. For the reasons I have endeavoured to state it is in my view not open to the courts to foreclose them by adopting an interpretation of the existing legislation which it not only does not bear but which is manifestly inconsistent with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would allow the appeal.</p>

<p><b>LORD RODGER OF EARLSFERRY</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the advantage of considering the speeches of my noble and learned friends, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, Lord Steyn and Baroness Hale of Richmond, in draft.  I agree with them and would accordingly dismiss the appeal.  In view of the importance of the issue, I add some observations on section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998 ("the 1998 Act").</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 3, which, as Lord Hoffmann remarked in <i>R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p Simms </i>[2000] 2 AC 115, 132A, enacts the principle of legality as a rule of construction, provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"3. (1) So far as it is possible to do so, primary legislation and subordinate legislation must be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(2) This section-<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul><ul><ul><ul>(a) applies to primary legislation and subordinate legislation whenever enacted;<p></p></ul></ul></ul></ul>
<p></p><ul><ul><ul><ul>(b) does not affect the validity, continuing operation or enforcement of any incompatible primary legislation; and<p></p></ul></ul></ul></ul>
<p></p><ul><ul><ul><ul>(c) does not affect the validity, continuing operation or enforcement of any incompatible subordinate legislation if (disregarding any possibility of revocation) primary legislation prevents removal of the incompatibility."<p></p></ul></ul></ul></ul>
<p>In <i>R v Director of Public Prosecutions, Ex p Kebilene </i>[2000] 2 AC 326, 373F Lord Cooke of Thorndon described section 3(1) as "a strong adjuration" by Parliament to read and give effect to legislation compatibly with Convention rights.  Nevertheless, the opening words of subsection (1) show that there are limits to the obligation.  That is reflected in subsection (2)(b) and (c) as well as in the next section, section 4, which applies in those cases where a higher court is satisfied that, despite section 3(1), a provision is to be regarded as incompatible with a Convention right.  In that event the court may make a declaration of incompatibility.  While it is therefore clear that there are limits to the obligation in section 3(1), they are not spelled out.  In a number of cases your Lordships' House has taken tentative steps towards identifying those limits.  The matter calls for further consideration in this case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addressing the question, it is useful to bear in mind section 6(1) and (2):</p>
<p></p><ul>"(1) It is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(2) Subsection (1) does not apply to an act if - <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul><ul><ul><ul>(a) as the result of one or more provisions of primary legislation, the authority could not have acted differently; or <p></p></ul></ul></ul></ul>
<p></p><ul><ul><ul><ul>(b) in the case of one or more provisions of, or made under, primary legislation which cannot be read or given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights, the authority was acting so as to give effect to or enforce those provisions."<p></p></ul></ul></ul></ul>
<p>Subsection (3) goes on to define "public authority" as including a court.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106.&nbsp;&nbsp;Inevitably, when section 3 comes to be considered by a court, the focus is on the approach which section 3(1) requires the court to adopt when reading a statutory provision that, on a conventional interpretation, would be incompatible with a Convention right.  Nevertheless, the section is not aimed exclusively, or indeed mainly, at the courts.  In contrast to section 4 - which applies in terms only to "a court" of the level of the High Court or above - and in contrast also to section 6 - which applies only to public authorities - section 3 is carefully drafted in the passive voice to avoid specifying, and so limiting, the class of persons who are to read and give effect to the legislation in accordance with it.  Parliament thereby indicates that the section is of general application.  It applies, of course, to the courts, but it applies also to everyone else who may have to interpret and give effect to legislation.  The most obvious examples are public authorities such as organs of central and local government, but the section is not confined to them.  The broad sweep of section 3(1) is indeed crucial to the working of the 1998 Act.  It is the means by which Parliament intends that people should be afforded the benefit of their Convention rights - "so far as it is possible", without the need for any further intervention by Parliament.  In <i>R v A (No 2)</i> [2002] 1 AC 45, 67 - 68, para 44, and in his speech today, Lord Steyn has referred to what ministers told Parliament about how, they anticipated, the obligation in section 3(1) would work in practice.  However that may be, section 3(1) requires public authorities of all kinds to read their statutory powers and duties in the light of Convention rights and, so far as possible, to give effect to them in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights of the people concerned.  In practice, even before the 1998 Act came into force, many public authorities had reviewed the legislation affecting them so as to be in a position to comply with this obligation from the date of commencement.  This was a wise precaution.  Once the 1998 Act came into force, whenever, by virtue of section 3(1), a provision could be read in a way which was compatible with Convention rights, that was the meaning which Parliament intended that it should bear.  For all purposes, that meaning, and no other, is the "true" meaning of the provision in our law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point to notice is that, so far as possible, legislation must be "read and given effect" compatibly with Convention rights.  The use of the two expressions, "read" and "given effect", is not to be glossed over as an example of the kind of cautious tautologous drafting that used to be typical of much of the statute book.  That would be to ignore the lean elegance which characterises the style of the draftsman of the 1998 Act.  Rather, section 3(1) contains not one, but two, obligations:  legislation is to be read in a way which is compatible with Convention rights, but it is also to be given effect in a way which is compatible with those rights.  Although the obligations are complementary, they are distinct.  So there may be a breach of one but not of the other.  For instance, suppose that legislation within the ambit of a particular Convention right requires a local authority to provide a service to residents in its area.  The proper interpretation of the duty in the legislation may be straightforward.  But, even if the local authority interprets the provision correctly and provides the appropriate service, if it provides the service only to those residents who support the governing political party, the local authority will be in breach of article 14 in relation to the other article concerned and, in terms of section 3(1), will have failed to give effect to the legislation in a way which is compatible with Convention rights.  So, even though the heading of section 3 is "Interpretation of legislation", the content of the section actually goes beyond interpretation to cover the way that legislation is given effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108.&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the Act discloses one clear limit to section 3(1).  It is not concerned with provisions which, properly interpreted, impose an unavoidable obligation to act in a particular way.  This can be seen from a comparison of paras (a) and (b) of section 6(2).  According to para (a), section 6(1) does not apply, and a public authority therefore acts lawfully, if, as a result of primary legislation, "the authority could not have acted differently."  An example might be a provision requiring a local authority to dismiss an application if the applicant failed to take a particular step within seven days.  Even if this results in the violation of a Convention right, the local authority must dismiss the application and, in doing so, it acts lawfully:  it cannot act differently in terms of the legislation.  By para (b), on the other hand, the public authority also acts lawfully if, in the case of one or more provisions of primary or secondary legislation "which cannot be read or given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights", the authority was acting so as to give effect to or enforce those provisions.  Para (b) echoes the language of section 3(1) and therefore deals with the (different) situation where, in terms of section 3(1), it has not proved possible to read and give effect to a provision in a way which is compatible with Convention rights.  In that situation, as section 3(2)(b) provides, the validity, continuing operation and enforcement of the legislation are not affected and so it is lawful for a public authority to act in terms of the legislation.  In that case too, section 6(2) disapplies section 6(1).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109.&nbsp;&nbsp;If incompatible provisions that require a public authority to act in a particular way, and leave it with no option to act differently, do not fall within the scope of section 3(1), this can only be because, by definition, it is not possible to read them or give effect to them in a way which is compatible with Convention rights.  This makes sense.  If a provision requires the public authority to take a particular step which is, of its very nature, incompatible with Convention rights, then no process of interpretation can remove the obligation or change the nature of the step that has to be taken.  Nor can the public authority give effect to the obligation by doing anything other than taking the step which the Act requires of it.  In such cases, only Parliament can remove the incompatibility if it decides to repeal or amend the provision.  The most that a higher court can do is to make a declaration of incompatibility under section 4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110.&nbsp;&nbsp;What excludes such provisions from the scope of section 3(1) is not any mere matter of the linguistic form in which Parliament has chosen to express the obligation.  Rather, they are excluded because the entire substance of the provision, what it requires the public authority to do, is incompatible with the Convention.  The only cure is to change the provision and that is a matter for Parliament and not for the courts:  they, like everyone else, are bound by the provision.  So from section 6(2)(a) and (b) one can tell that, however powerful the obligation in section 3(1), it does not allow the courts to change the substance of a provision completely, to change a provision from one where Parliament says that <i>x </i>is to happen into one saying that <i>x </i>is not to happen.  And, of course, in considering what constitutes the substance of the provision or provisions under consideration, it is necessary to have regard to their place in the overall scheme of the legislation as enacted by Parliament.  In <i>International Transport Roth GmbH v Secretary of State for the Home Department </i>  [2003] QB 728, for instance, the Court of Appeal held that it was impossible for the court to use the interpretative obligation in section 3(1) in effect to recreate the fixed penalty scheme enacted by Parliament so as to turn it into a scheme that was compatible with article 6.  As Simon Brown LJ observed, at p 758C - D, it would have involved turning the scheme inside out - something that the court could not do.  Only Parliament, not the courts, could create a wholly different scheme so as to provide an acceptable alternative means of immigration control.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111.&nbsp;&nbsp;Another illustration of this limitation on the obligation under section 3(1) is to be found in the decision of your Lordships' House in <i>R (Anderson) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</i>  [2003] 1 AC 837.  Section 29 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 provided that, "if recommended to do so by the Parole Board, the Secretary of State may … release on licence" certain life prisoners, viz convicted murderers.  The House was satisfied that it was incompatible with the Convention rights of Mr Anderson, who had been convicted of murder, for the power to release him to lie with the Home Secretary rather than with a judicial body.  Counsel for Anderson submitted accordingly that, under section 3(1) of the 1998 Act, section 29 of the Crime (Sentences) Act could be read and given effect in a manner which would be compatible with his Convention rights.  In effect, this would have amounted to reading the section in such a way as to deprive the Home Secretary of the express power to release him.  The House rejected this submission since it was clear that, under section 29, the power of release and the power to determine how long a convicted murderer should remain in prison for punitive purposes were to lie with the Home Secretary and with no-one else.  In these circumstances, in the words of Lord Bingham of Cornhill [2003] 1 AC 837, 883C - D, para 30:</p>
<p></p><ul>"To read section 29 as precluding participation by the Home Secretary, if it were possible to do so, would not be judicial interpretation but judicial vandalism:  it would give the section an effect quite different from that which Parliament intended and would go well beyond any interpretative process sanctioned by section 3 of the 1998 Act …"<p></p></ul>
<p>The "judicial vandalism" would lie not in any linguistic changes, whether great or small, which the court might make in interpreting section 29 but in the fact that any reading of section 29 which negatived the explicit power of the Secretary of State to decide on the release date for murderers would be as drastic as changing black into white.  It would remove the very core and essence, the "pith and substance" of the measure that Parliament had enacted - to use the familiar phrase of Lord Watson (in a different context) in <i>Union Colliery Co of British Columbia Ltd v Bryden </i>[1899] AC 580, 587.  Section 3(1) gives the courts no power to go that far.  In these circumstances the House made a declaration of incompatibility, which left it to the minister and ultimately to Parliament to decide whether to remedy the incompatability by amending or repealing section 29 and, if so, how.</p>
