<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;64. I have had the advantage of reading in draft the speech of my noble and learned friend, Lord Bingham of Cornhill, with which I am in full agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;65. At the conclusion of the trial the jury were asked three questions. They answered them as follows:</p>
(1) <p></p><ul>Do you find for the Claimant (Mr. Grobbelaar) or the Defendants?  For the Claimant.<p></p></ul>
(2) <p></p><ul>What amount of damages do you award him?  £85,000.<p></p></ul>
(3) <p></p><ul>Does your award contain any sum by way of exemplary damages?  No.<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66. It was common ground in the Court of Appeal that the award of £85,000 was consistent only with a finding that neither of the alleged conspiracies was established. It would not be wholly accurate to say that this was agreed between the parties or that it was a concession made by either of them. Rather each party argued from the same premise because it suited its case to do so. Once the premise was accepted the Court of Appeal was fully justified in holding that the jury's finding was perverse. On the evidence before them no reasonable jury properly directed could make such a finding. But the premise was false. The only inference which could properly be drawn from the jury's answer to Question 1 was that the Defendants had failed to establish what they found to be the gist of the publication of which complaint was made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;67. In my view an appellate Court ought not to find the verdict of a jury on liability to be perverse unless there is no rational explanation for it. There is not the same constraint against finding an award of damages to be excessive. In the light of the evidence which was before the jury, a much more plausible explanation of the jury's verdict is that it found that the sting of the libel lay in the allegation that Mr. Grobbelaar had thrown matches in which he was playing by deliberately letting in goals, and that it was only this allegation which the Defendants had failed to establish. On the evidence such a finding was clearly open to the jury and would not have been perverse. It would not have justified an award of £85,000, or indeed any substantial award, but that is another matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;68. The Court of Appeal were not bound by the premise on which the case was argued before them merely because it suited both parties to adopt it, and your Lordships are certainly not bound to accept it. If the jury found that the sting of the libel lay in the allegations of match-fixing rather than the allegations of the corrupt agreements, they were entitled to find that this had not been established. This is sufficient to uphold their verdict for Mr. Grobbelaar on liability. They should not be taken to have reached a perverse finding, in the teeth of overwhelming evidence to the contrary, that the Defendants had also failed to establish the existence of the corrupt agreements. But a finding that Mr Grobbelaar had been a party to either or both corrupt agreements would be enough to deprive him of any right to substantial damages. It would be an affront to justice if a man who accepts bribes to throw matches should obtain damages for the loss of his reputation as a professional sportsman merely because he cannot be shown to have carried out his part of the bargain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;69. Accordingly, I would allow the appeal, enter judgment for the plaintiff, and substitute an award of £1 by way of derisory damages. I would also give Mr Grobbelaar liberty to apply to the High Court for a suitably worded injunction to restrain any repetition of the allegation that he actually fixed matches. By his own conduct Mr. Grobbelaar has destroyed the value of his own reputation, and this is sufficient to disentitle him to any but nominal damages. But it would not justify the Defendants in republishing an allegation the truth of which a jury have found that they have been unable to substantiate. Such conduct would still constitute an actionable wrong.  Mr Grobbelaar may have no reputation to lose; but that does not make him an object of ridicule, fair game for every slander that an imaginative journalist can concoct. It is precisely because his reputation is worthless that damages would be an inadequate remedy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70. The maxim that "he who comes into equity must come with clean hands" must not be taken too far.  It has no application in the present case.  As Brandeis J explained in <i>Loughran v Loughran</i> 292 US 216 at p 229 (1934) "Equity does not demand that its suitors shall have led blameless lives."  There must be "an immediate and necessary relation to the equity sued for" : see <i>Dering v Earl of Winchelsea</i> (1787)  1 Cox Eq 318, 319 <i>per</i> Eyre CB.  Any such relation between Mr Grobbelaar's wrongdoing (which must be taken to have lain in taking bribes, not in throwing football matches) and the way in which the Defendants reported it came to an end when the jury returned their verdict and exonerated him of the charge which is the subject of the proposed injunction.</p>

<p><b>LORD SCOTT OF FOSCOTE</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;71. In what circumstances is it permissible for an appellate court to reverse on an issue of fact a verdict given by a jury in a civil case?  That is the central question in this case.  In our system of justice juries occupy a position of near veneration, at least as far as many lawyers and most of the media are concerned.  The veneration is mainly attributable, I think, to the historic role of juries in criminal cases in standing between the accused citizen and the power and authority of the executive.  Judges have not always in the history of our justice system been seen to be independent of the executive.  The independence from the executive of prosecuting authorities has not always been apparent and still today is regarded with some cynicism by some people.  So it is not surprising that the role of juries in the criminal justice system is widely regarded as constituting a key and necessary protection for the citizens of this country from unfair and oppressive prosecution.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72. Juries, like judges, do not always come to the correct conclusion.  The question as to what can be done by an appellate court if the verdict of a jury in a criminal case appears in the light of the evidence to be plainly wrong must receive a variable answer depending on whether the verdict is to acquit or to convict.  If the verdict is to acquit, it cannot be reversed on appeal.  The accused walks free no matter how plainly wrong the verdict may appear to be.  The jury's verdict is sacrosanct.  But that is so only if the verdict is in favour of the accused.  If the jury should convict the accused their verdict is by no means sacrosanct.  An appellate court can be invited to examine the evidence, review the trial judge's summing-up and either substitute an acquittal for the conviction or direct a re-trial.  The criteria for taking these steps is a good deal less stringent than that the jury's verdict was plainly wrong.  It will suffice if the court thinks that the jury's verdict simply was not safe.  The imbalance between the sacrosanct character of a jury verdict of acquittal and the relatively less than conclusive character of a jury verdict to convict is a consequence of the nature of criminal proceedings and the revulsion about convicting a person who is possibly innocent that rightly permeates the criminal justice system.  There is no comparable revulsion about acquitting a person who is possibly guilty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73. I have made these rather trite remarks about the status of a jury verdict in the criminal justice system not because they have any direct relevance to the present case but in order to emphasise the inappropriateness of treating a jury verdict in favour of a defendant in a defamation case as though it deserved a status comparable to that of a verdict of acquittal in a criminal case.  If a person, believing himself to have been defamed, brings a defamation action and there is no dispute but that the defendant was responsible for uttering the words complained of and no dispute but that the words were defamatory of the claimant, the defendant, in order to rely on the defence of justification, must prove that the words were true.  If the allegation was of criminal conduct on the part of the claimant, that he was a thief, or a fraudster, or a child molester, or whatever, the defendant must satisfy the jury that that was so.  In effect, the defendant must satisfy the jury that the claimant had indeed committed the crime that the defamatory words had alleged.  There is, therefore, a clear analogy between the role of the prosecutor in a criminal case, endeavouring to satisfy the jury that the accused committed the crime with which he is charged, and the role of a defendant who has pleaded justification in a defamation case, endeavouring to satisfy the jury that the claimant had committed the crime alleged against him.  But the analogy becomes a misleading one if carried too far.  Although in the defamation case, the jury's verdict in favour of the claimant must necessarily have rejected the justification defence and indicated that the jury had not been satisfied that the claimant had committed the crime alleged, the verdict does not have the sacrosanct character of a verdict of "not guilty" in a criminal case.  In a civil case, the parties litigate on an even playing field.  It is as much of an affront to justice if a "guilty" claimant succeeds in obtaining damages as it is if an "innocent" claimant fails in his claim for damages.  A verdict in favour of the defendant, the jury apparently being satisfied that the claimant had committed the crime alleged, cannot be set aside simply because the court thinks that the verdict was not "safe".  Something more would be required.  The appellate court would need to be satisfied that, in the light of the evidence, a jury could not reasonably have concluded that the claimant had committed the crime.  The verdict would have to be shown to be plainly wrong and one that no reasonable jury could have reached.  A lower threshold would not suffice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74. The case is no different where a jury, apparently not satisfied that a justification defence has been made out, finds in favour of the claimant.  If an appellate court can be satisfied that no reasonable jury could, on the evidence in the case, have reached that decision, ie that the rejection of the justification defence was plainly wrong, then the appellate court must set aside the jury's verdict.  Justice to the defendant, no more and no less important in a civil case than justice to the claimant, so demands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75. In reviewing a jury's verdict against the background of the evidence given in the case in question, an appellate court is always faced with the difficulty that the jury will have given no reasons for their decision.  Underlying the verdict there is often likely to have been a series of decisions.  There may have been alternative possible routes leading to the verdict, some of questionable legitimacy, others less susceptible to impeachment.  The appellate court will not know which route the jury has taken.  In criminal cases the difficulty is surmounted by treating the verdict of acquittal as sacrosanct and the verdict of conviction as amenable to being set aside by anything rendering it not "safe".  The certainty of the former and the comfort of the latter are not available on appeals from jury verdicts in civil cases.  Each side is equally entitled to justice.  The appellate court must, of course, pay proper respect to the jury verdict.  The jury are the fact finders.  In a civil case, the jury, as fact finders, are entitled to the same respect, no more and no less, than that which is due to a trial judge sitting without a jury.  The difference is that the trial judge's reasoning will be, or should be, on the face of the judgment whereas the jury's reasons, being undisclosed, will need to be re-constructed by the appellate court.  Subject to that important difference, however, the factual conclusions of juries in civil cases should, in my opinion, be treated by an appellate court no differently, with no greater and no less respect, than the factual conclusions of judges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76. In the present case there were four critical issues which had to be resolved before a verdict could be reached.  They were the following:</p>
<p></p><ul>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;What was the "sting" of the defamatory articles that the Sun had to justify in order to succeed in its justification defence?  The parties were in agreement about the defamatory meaning of the articles, namely, that Mr Grobbelaar<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;having dishonestly taken bribes had fixed or attempted to fix the results of games of football in which he had played, and<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;had dishonestly taken bribes with a view to fixing the result of games in which he would be playing."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is well established law that in order to make good a defence plea of justification, the defendant does not have to prove the truth of every injurious allegation that he has made.  It suffices if the defendant makes good the "sting" of the allegations.  And it is for the jury, as part of the process of deciding whether a justification defence plea has been made good, to decide what is the "sting" of the defamatory remarks in question.  So it was for the Grobbelaar jury to decide what was the "sting" of the Sun articles.  Was it the allegation that Mr Grobbelaar had taken bribes with a view to fixing or attempting to fix football matches?  Or was it that he had taken bribes and had fixed, or attempted to fix, football matches?  Or was it both?</p>
<p></p><ul>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;The jury had to decide whether Mr Grobbelaar had taken bribes from Mr Lim with a view to fixing football matches.  The Sun alleged that he had.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;The jury had to decide whether, pursuant to his corrupt agreement with Mr Lim, Mr Grobbelaar had deliberately let in, or attempted to let in, goals.  The Sun alleged that he had done so.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;The jury had to decide whether Mr Grobbelaar had taken bribes from Mr Vincent with a view to fixing football matches.  The Sun alleged that he had.<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77. The jury returned a verdict in favour of Mr Grobbelaar and awarded him damages of £85,000.  On appeal to the Court of Appeal the Sun contended that the verdict was plainly wrong.  It contended that the jury could not reasonably have rejected its justification defence.  Mr Hartley QC, counsel for Mr Grobbelaar, submitted that the Sun was contending, in effect, that the trial judge, Mr Justice Gray, should have directed the jury that it was not open to them to find in favour of Mr Grobbelaar that the justification defence was not made out and should have withdrawn that issue from them.  In my opinion, this submission cannot be accepted.  Before the fate of the justification defence could be settled the "sting" of the articles had to be identified.  This was a matter for the jury.  The defence could not, therefore, have been withdrawn from them.  The judge had no alternative but to sum-up to the jury and leave the issue to them.  There has been no significant criticism of his summing-up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78. The Court of Appeal, for their part, had no alternative but to examine the evidence relevant to the justification issue and ask themselves whether the jury's verdict rejecting the justification defence could be sustained.  As my noble and learned friend Lord Steyn has said (para 32) it was common ground in the Court of Appeal that the jury's award of £85,000 was consistent only with the jury having rejected the allegations that Mr Grobbelaar had entered into corrupt agreements with Mr Lim and Mr Vincent.  A goalkeeper who is exposed as someone who has agreed to take money to let in goals, but, in a double-cross of his co-conspirators does not in fact let in goals, is not, if accused of deliberately letting in goals, deprived of a reputation worth £85,000, if anything at all.  I, therefore, respectfully agree with the Court of Appeal that the jury must have rejected the charge in the Sun's articles that Mr Grobbelaar had agreed to take bribes for throwing matches.  The jury must also have rejected the charge that Mr Grobbelaar had deliberately let in goals or attempted to do so.  As to this, the jury's rejection of the charge could not possibly be described as plainly wrong.  The Sun's case was wholly based on the admissions that Mr Grobbelaar himself had made in the video-taped conversations that he had had with Mr Vincent.  But the evidence of Mr Bob Wilson and Mr Alan Ball that none of the relevant goals that had been scored against Mr Grobbelaar were associated with any sign of bad goalkeeping and, indeed, that on occasions in the matches in question Mr Grobbelaar had achieved saves that no ordinary goalkeeper would have managed, was very strong.  The jury was entitled, on this evidence, to conclude that Mr Grobbelaar had not in fact deliberately let in any of the goals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79. But what about the corrupt agreements?  As to the agreement with Mr Lim, the Sun's case was based on Mr Grobbelaar's admissions made in the course of the video-taped conversations he had had with Mr Vincent.  As to the agreement with Mr Vincent, too, the Sun's case was based on the evidence of the video-tapes but here the visual and aural evidence was incontrovertible.  The tapes showed the two men entering into the corrupt agreement.  Mr Grobbelaar's admissions about his previous corrupt agreement with Mr Lim and about the goals pursuant to the agreement that he had deliberately let in or attempted to let in were the background to the agreement being negotiated between Mr Grobbelaar and Mr Vincent and recorded on the video tapes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80. Mr Grobbelaar endeavoured to explain away what the video tapes revealed.  His explanation was not credible for the reasons very fully set out in the Court of Appeal judgments and that I need not repeat.  I concur with my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill in concluding that no reasonable juror could have concluded that Mr Grobbelaar's apparent making of a corrupt bargain with Mr Vincent and his acceptance of money from him were merely a pretence on his part (paras 17 and 20 of Lord Bingham's opinion).  In my opinion, the same conclusion is justified so far as Mr Grobbelaar's admissions about his dealings with Mr Lim are concerned.  Here, of course, there is no comparable visual and aural evidence of the making of the corrupt bargain.  But there is a wealth of material corroborating the admissions about his dealings with Mr Lim made by Mr Grobbelaar in the course of the video-taped conversations.  The material was conveniently brought together for your Lordships in a note handed up by Mr Spearman QC, counsel for the Sun, but all the details are to be found in the Court of Appeal judgments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81. Mr Hartley put at the forefront of his submissions to your Lordships that the Court of Appeal had erred in putting themselves in the position of fact finders and substituting their opinion about the credibility of Mr Grobbelaar's explanations for that of the jury.  This criticism was, in my opinion, misplaced.  The Sun's appeal against the jury's verdict was that, on all the evidence, the verdict was perverse, plainly wrong.  This is a ground of appeal that is open to a disappointed litigant whether the fact finder be a judge or a jury.  In dealing with the Sun's appeal the Court of Appeal was bound to review all the relevant evidence and ask itself whether the assumed findings of the jury, necessary to sustain the verdict, were findings to which a reasonable jury could come.  If they were not, the Court of Appeal had no option but to overturn the verdict.  The approach would have been no different if the fact finder had been a judge.  But in that case the critical findings would, or should, have been expressed and would not have had to be assumed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82. In my opinion the Court of Appeal was well-entitled, having reviewed all the evidence, to overturn the rejection by the jury of the Sun's case that Mr Grobbelaar had entered into a corrupt agreement with Mr Lim and had received bribes from him pursuant to that agreement.  The jury's assumed finding to the contrary was, in the face of this material, plainly wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83. The position, therefore, is that the jury's assumed finding that Mr Grobbelaar did not actually fix or attempt to fix matches must stand, but the assumed finding that he did not enter into a corrupt agreement to do so cannot stand.  In these circumstances, can the jury's rejection of the Sun's justification defence be sustained?  The answer depends on identifying what was the "sting" of the Sun's articles.  If the "sting" was, or included, that he had thrown matches, the justification defence was not made out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84. Identification of the "sting" is for the jury, and it would have been open to the jury, in my opinion, to have concluded that the "sting", or at least an important part of the "sting", lay in the allegation that Mr Grobbelaar had deliberately let in or attempted to let in goals.  The verdict in favour of Mr Grobbelaar is consistent with the jury having come to that conclusion and, in my opinion, the Court of Appeal ought not to have disturbed that verdict.  The Sun's articles had charged Mr Grobbelaar not only with entering into corrupt agreements to throw matches for money but also with having actually done so.  On the footing that they had failed to prove that he had actually done so, although they had proved everything else, Mr Grobbelaar was, in my opinion, entitled to uphold the jury verdict in his favour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85. In these circumstances Mr Grobbelaar is no doubt entitled at least to nominal damage to mark the success, but is he entitled to any greater sum?  In my opinion, he is not.  There are two considerations which, to my mind, overwhelm all others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86. First, the Sun based its articles on what Mr Grobbelaar had himself said.  He was seen on the video tapes entering into the corrupt agreement with Mr Vincent; he was heard on the tapes admitting that he had entered into a corrupt agreement with Mr Lim; and he was heard admitting that he had, pursuant to his arrangements with Mr Lim, either thrown or attempted to throw matches.  His explanations for these things were not credible.  A reasonable jury would have had no alternative but to reject them.  In the context in which Mr Grobbelaar's admissions were made the admissions lacked nothing in credibility.  The Sun believed them and based the articles upon them.  Why should it not have done so?  In my opinion, Mr Grobbelaar brought on his own head the publication of that which he had admitted to doing.  If an individual makes damaging admissions about himself which come to the attention of a third party who has no reason to doubt their credibility and who repeats them in public, the notion that the individual can then, by successfully denying the truth of his admissions, succeed in extracting defamation damages from the third party seems to me inconsistent with justice as well as with common sense.  It has not been suggested to your Lordships that the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945 might have a part to play in such a scenario but it seems to me that it might, and, in any event, that, quantum of damages being at large, justice would be done by confining the individual to whatever satisfaction a jury's, or a judge's, public recognition of the falsity of his admissions might bring.  In the present case, I would adopt that approach.  The admissions by Mr Grobbelaar having become known to the Sun and Mr Grobbelaar having failed to provide any credible explanation for them, the Sun was bound, in my opinion, to make them public.  The admissions were matters of legitimate public interest and concern and that is what newspapers are for.  To hold the Sun liable to pay substantial, as opposed to nominal, damages for publishing articles based on Mr Grobbelaar's own admissions and for their failure to prove that these admissions were true, would, in my view, be quite wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87. Second, a professional footballer who has agreed to accept, and has accepted, bribes with a view to throwing matches has so diminished his reputation in the eyes of right thinking people that his success in establishing that, in breach of his corrupt agreement, he did not in fact throw matches cannot, in my opinion, justify anything more than nominal damages.  The harm to professional sporting contests if those who play them enter into corrupt bargains of the sort entered into by Mr Grobbelaar cannot be overstated.  Proof that a professional sportsman has deliberately underperformed in a match is likely in most cases to be very difficult.  All sportsmen make mistakes in the course of play.  An international-class striker in a football match may miss the goal from point blank range.  A wicket keeper in a cricket match may fumble a catch.  A rugby player may miss a tackle or drop a high kick.  These things are part of the inherent uncertainty of sport that gives sport much of its fascination.  Deliberate errors may be virtually impossible to prove and evidence that a professional sportsman had agreed for bribes to make deliberate errors should be enough to justify exposure and censure and enough to disentitle the sportsman in question to substantial defamation damages when a charge that he has carried out his dishonest bargain is not proved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88. For these reasons I would allow the appeal but reduce Mr Grobbelaar's damages to £1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89. The question has been raised whether an injunction should issue against the Sun restraining it from repeating the allegation that Mr Grobbelaar had deliberately let in goals or attempted to do so.  It is normal for success in a defamation action to be accompanied by an injunction restraining the defendant tortfeasor from repeating the defamatory remarks.  In the present case, however, there are, in my opinion, serious problems about the grant of an injunction.  First, the injunction would have to be so expressed as to permit the Sun to repeat that Mr Grobbelaar had entered into corrupt agreements to throw matches.  That allegation has, in my opinion, been well proved.  Second, the injunction would have to be expressed so as to permit the Sun to repeat that Mr Grobbelaar had admitted throwing matches.  It is common ground that Mr Grobbelaar did so admit.  In many contexts a comment that Mr Grobbelaar was a man who had admitted throwing matches might be taken to carry the inference that he had actually done so.  An injunction the breach of which might depend on what untrue inferences could be drawn by a reader from a true allegation is an injunction that would need very careful drafting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90. A third problem, and one that has caused me considerable hesitation, is that the grant of an injunction is the grant of an equitable remedy and it is long-established practice that an equitable remedy should not be granted to an applicant who does not come before the Court with "clean hands".  The grime on the hands must, of course, be sufficiently closely connected with the equitable remedy that is sought in order for an applicant to be denied a remedy to which he ordinarily would be entitled.  And whether there is or is not a sufficiently close connection must depend on the facts of each case.  In the present case it has seemed to me well arguable that it would be an affront to the "clean hands" principle if an injunction were granted to Mr Grobbelaar.  He entered into two successive corrupt agreements to throw matches in return for bribes and, as part of the inducement to his co-conspirator to enter into the second such agreement he represented that he had thrown or attempted to throw matches pursuant to the first such agreement.  He has brought a defamation action based first on his false denial that he entered into these agreements and, secondly, on his denial of the truth of his admission that he had thrown matches pursuant to the first agreement.  The question is whether the dishonesty that attended his entry into the corrupt agreements, and his denial in court that he had done so, so taints his success in persuading the jury to accept his denial of the truth of his match fixing admissions as to disqualify him from the grant of an injunction.  I can well understand that your Lordships may be concerned that, in the absence of an injunction, the Sun may repeat the allegation that Mr Grobbelaar did actually throw matches.  If the Sun does so, it will be repeating that which Mr Grobbelaar has succeeded in establishing is not true. I am, somewhat reluctantly, persuaded, on balance, that the grime on Mr Grobbelaar's hands is not such that he should be exposed to a repetition of that allegation.  I therefore agree that he should be given liberty to apply in this action to the High Court for the grant of a suitably worded injunction.  This will not, of course, be necessary if the Sun offers a suitable undertaking. </p>
