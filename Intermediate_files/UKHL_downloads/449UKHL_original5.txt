<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113. The decision in <i>Eastern Airlines Inc v Floyd </i>was followed <i>El Al Israel Airlines v Tseng</i> (1999)  525 US 155 in which the Supreme Court confirmed, at p 166, note 9, the conclusion reached in <i>Eastern Airlines Inc v Floyd </i>that the Convention provides for compensation only when the passenger suffers "death, physical injury, or physical manifestation of injury."  The passenger claimed that she had sustained psychic or psychosomatic injuries as a result of an intrusive body search but accepted that there had been no "bodily injury" as that term is used in the Convention.  Her claim was that, as the Convention allowed no recovery, it did not preclude her from maintaining a separate action for damages.  It was rejected by the Supreme Court.  The same result would be reached in this jurisdiction: see <i>Herd v Clyde Helicopters Ltd</i> [1997]  AC 534.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114. Judicial thinking in the United States has been developed further in a series of cases in the Federal courts.  In <i>Jack v Trans World Airlines Inc</i> (1994)  854 F Supp 654 there had been a crash and a fire following an aborted take-off.  The court distinguished three different kinds of injury, at p 664:</p>
<p></p><ul>"'Impact injuries' refer to the bodily injuries (such as bruises, lacerations and broken bones) that passengers suffer during an airplane accident (here, the aborted take-off and evacuation of the plane).  'Physical manifestations' refer to those bodily injuries or illnesses (such as skin rashes and heart attacks) that result from the distress one experiences during or after an accident.  'Emotional distress' refers to the psychic trauma that one experiences either during or after the accident."<p></p></ul>
<p>It was not disputed that "impact injuries" and "physical manifestations" were within the scope of the expression "bodily injury".  But the court noted, at p 665, that there were four possible approaches to emotional distress: (1) no recovery allowed for emotional distress; (2) recovery allowed for all distress, as long as bodily injury occurs; (3) emotional distress allowed as damages for bodily injury, but distress may include distress about the accident; and (4) only emotional distress flowing from the bodily injury is recoverable.  At p 668, the court adopted the fourth approach.  It held that the emotional distress recoverable was limited to the distress about the physical impact or manifestation, ie the bodily injury, but that recovery was not allowed for the distress about the accident itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115. In <i>Alvarez v American Airlines Inc</i> (2000)  27 Avi 17,475 the court held that a passenger's claim for psychological and emotional injuries was properly dismissed because the physical manifestations of his post-traumatic stress disorder, including increased heart rate and elevated blood pressure, were directly related to his emotional trauma and not to a physical injury suffered during the evacuation from the aircraft.  At p 17,478 the court said that, if these physical manifestations could support a recovery, a passenger frightened by air turbulence could recover on the basis of his increased heart rate which would convert the rule established in <i>Eastern Airlines Inc v Floyd</i> into a mere pleading formality.  This decision supports the view that emotions and other mental disturbances which cannot be related to a palpable, conspicuous or observable physical injury are outside the scope of article 17.  But it is not wholly consistent with what was said in <i>Rosman v Trans World Airlines Inc </i> (1974)  34 NY 2d 385 about the physical manifestations of a mental injury.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116. In <i>Weaver v Delta Airlines Inc</i> (1999)  56 F Supp 2d 1190 a passenger brought an action to recover damages for chronic post-traumatic stress disorder which she attributed to terror which she felt during an emergency landing of the aircraft in which she was a passenger.  But in this case there was an affidavit from the passenger's doctor which stated that the impact of the event included bio-chemical reactions which had physical impacts upon her brain and neurological system.  In response, the airline did not present sufficient evidence to raise a factual issue on this point.  The scientific research relied on by the passenger was criticised, but it was not explained and its expert had not examined the passenger.  In the light of this evidence the court held that she had met her burden of showing that the emergency landing physically impacted on her brain and that there was no genuine issue on the facts.  At p 1192, the court said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Weaver's action here is distinguishable from previous cases, because her claim is presented as a physical injury and she relies on recent scientific research explaining that post-traumatic stress disorder evidences actual trauma to brain cell structures.  Weaver's post-traumatic stress disorder evidences an injury to her brain, and the only reasonable conclusion is that it is, in fact, a bodily injury… The legal question in this case is simply whether the Warsaw Convention allows recovery for this particular kind of bodily injury, ie, a brain injury (even with slight physical effects).  The answer must be yes."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117. In <i>In re Air Crash at Little Rock, Arkansas, on June 1, 1999</i> (2000)  27 Avi 18,428 the passenger suffered from smoke inhalation, knee, leg and ankle injuries in a crash and her subsequent escape from the aircraft.  But her primary claim was for emotional and psychological injuries consisting of serious chronic post-traumatic stress disorder and major depression.  The judge observed, at p 18,431, that Federal courts had come to different conclusions as to the nexus required between physical and psychic injuries.  He referred to <i>Jack</i>, <i>Alvarez</i> and <i>Weaver</i> and to <i>Terrafranca v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd</i> (1998)  151 F 3d 108 in which it was held that there could be no recovery unless the passenger demonstrated direct, concrete bodily injury as opposed to manifestations of fear or anxiety.  He held, at p 18,433, that, once the threshold of liability had been crossed by proving a physical injury, then all damages available under the passenger's domicile are recoverable.  As to whether post-traumatic stress disorder was a physical manifestation of injury, the judge noted that different results had been reached in several recent cases on this point.  He held in favour of the passenger, regarding this as a matter of evidence.  The passenger's doctor said in his evidence that research had shown brain dysfunction in people with PTSD and that, while it could not be said that everybody would demonstrate the same abnormality, the consistent theme was that PTSD was both a biological and a psychological syndrome.  As the judge put it, at p 18,436:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The <i>Terrafranca</i> and <i>Jack</i> decisions reflect our nascent understanding of the nature of mental illness.  It is not clear that those courts were presented with the scientific literature to underpin a finding that PTSD is a biological as well as an emotional and psychological illness... Furthermore, the evidence presented at the trial, both in the form of expert testimony and exhibits, established that PTSD is a biological/physical as well as a psychological injury."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118. The conclusion which I would draw from these cases is that there is a consistent body of judicial opinion in the United States that the phrase "any other bodily injury" does not permit compensation for an emotional reaction which has not been shown to be a manifestation of physical injury.  Emotional distress is excluded, but so also is a psychiatric illness which affects the mind only and is not capable of being described as a physical injury.  The decisions in the <i>Weaver</i> and <i>Little Rock </i>cases appear to have broken new ground.  They have applied the phrase to a mental injury which was shown by expert medical evidence to have been accompanied by physical changes to the patient's brain cell structures.  In those cases, in the light of the evidence, the passengers' post-traumatic stress disorder was held to be a physical as well as a psychological injury.  This extends the meaning of the phrase "bodily injury" beyond that which was recognised in <i>Rosman</i>, because changes of that kind are plainly not palpable, conspicuous or observable.</p>
(b) <i><p><i>Australia and Israel</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119. I have grouped these two countries together because they have produced the only judicial decisions outside the United States which were drawn to our attention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120. In <i>Daddon v Air France</i>  (1984) 1 S &amp; B Av R VII/141 the Supreme Court of Israel was concerned with claims by passengers in respect of the mental anguish which they had suffered while being held captive at Entebbe Airport by hijackers.  It held that "bodily injury" in article 17 included mental anguish which was not accompanied by any physical injury.  It reached this conclusion after recognising, at p 152, that the parties to the Convention apparently had no intention whatsoever in that regard, either because most states at that time had not recognised mental anguish as a cause of action or because the possibility of mental anguish which was not accompanied by physical injury had nor been contemplated.  What the court sought to do was to develop the meaning of the word by judicial policy in the light of subsequent developments.  This approach has received no support in the other jurisdictions.  It has been criticised on the ground that it is impermissible to construe the Convention in the light of changes since 1929.  The question is whether purely mental injury was within the intention of the draftsmen and the signatories: <i>Eastern Airlines Inc v Floyd</i> (1991)  499 US 530, 544.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121. In <i>Kotsambasis v Singapore Airlines Ltd</i> (1997 )  42 NSWLR 110, a decision of the Court of Appeal of New South Wales, the passenger claimed that she had suffered psychological injuries when shortly after take off a fire broke out in one of the engines of the aircraft which returned safely to the airport after fuel had been jettisoned.  Meagher JA, with whose judgment Powell and Stein JJA agreed, said, at p 114, that the words "bodily injury" both in English and in French were ambiguous and that the ambiguity could only be resolved by looking at the intention of the contracting parties and adopting a purposive approach to the Convention:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is immediately apparent that the adjective 'bodily' is a word of qualification or limitation.  It is a general principle of statutory interpretation, equally applicable to the interpretation of international agreements, that courts are not at liberty to consider any word as superfluous or insignificant - <i>Commonwealth v Baume</i> (1905)  2 CLR 405, 414 - and, more specifically, that effect is to be given to words of limitation: <i>Randwick Municipal Council v Rutledge </i> (1959)  102 CLR 54, 94.  It is clear that the draftsmen of the Convention did not intend to impose absolute liability in respect of all forms of injury."<p></p></ul>
<p>Following <i>Eastern Airlines Inc v Floyd</i> (1991)  499 US 530 he held, at p 115, that the term "bodily injury" was not intended to, and on a proper interpretation of the Convention does not, include purely psychological injury.  He noted that the question whether recovery might be available where psychological injury was accompanied by physical injury was left open in <i>Eastern Airlines </i>and said that, in view of the findings of the trial judge, it was not necessary for him to decide that point.  This decision supports the view that article 17 does not provide compensation for mental injury.</p>
<i><p><i>Discussion</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122. I find myself in agreement with the conclusions which Lord Reed reached in Mr King's case and those of the Court of Appeal in Miss Morris's case.  The Lord President said in Mr King's case that, on the approach suitable to an international Convention, the phrase "any other bodily injury" was apt to cover all injuries of any kind which affected a person in his body, and that these would include purely psychological injuries which an individual suffers, in a certain sense at least, in his body: 2001 SLT 126, 144L.  I regret that I cannot agree with this view.  It seems to me to give too little weight to the limiting effect of the word "bodily" and to the difficulties that would have been apparent in 1929 if it had been the intention to extend liability to that kind of injury.  It is inconsistent with the decision in<i> Eastern Airlines Inc v Floyd</i> (1996)  499 US 530, which has been followed in New South Wales and which I too would wish to follow.  It is also inconsistent with the decision in <i>Rosman</i>, which I regard as the other leading authority in this field.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123. The evidence indicates that there was no uniform approach among the contracting states in 1929 to recovery in damages for mental injury.  As the court noted in <i>Eastern Airlines Inc v Floyd,</i> at p 540, a cause of action for mental injury would not have been recognised in many of them.  In this situation clear words would have been needed to ensure that a uniform approach to this problem was adopted in all jurisdictions.  The absence of clear words allowing recovery for a purely mental injury is telling.  The introduction of the word "corporelle" was not the way to make this point clear.  The absence of discussion suggests that the contracting parties were content to use this word as a word of limitation to qualify the otherwise unrestricted scope of the word "lésion", and that they intended to restrict it to physical injury of a kind that was manifest and observable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;124. Insurance practice has not been the subject of evidence.  But it is commonplace for insurers to seek to exclude or restrict liability.  One of the central points in the Convention was the surrendering of the opportunity to do this in the case of carriage to which the Convention applies.  Part of the process of compromise lay in the choice of language for the articles in Part III, including article 17.  This adds further weight to the point that the words "bodily" and "corporelle" were used as words of modification or restriction.  It would have been a reasonable compromise to provide strict liability for physical injury of a kind that was manifest and observable, but not to extend this to an emotional reaction or any kind of mental injury.  Practice since then suggests that this was what the compromise was understood to be, as there was a marked absence of claims of this character until the 1970s despite the many alarming or distressing events that may be encountered during air travel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125. The search is for the meaning which the words were understood to have when the Convention was entered into.  It would be wrong to regard article 17 as limited by the state of medical and scientific knowledge that was current in the 1920s.  There is no reason to think that the contracting parties intended that no account should be taken of developments in medical science in determining the question whether a passenger has sustained a bodily injury.  I agree with my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern that, if the brain could be shown to have been injured and the other conditions for compensation under article 17 are satisfied, it would not be right to refuse compensation under the article on the ground only that in 1929 an injury of that kind would not have been capable of being demonstrated.  Whether or not there is such an injury will always depend on the evidence.  But the fact remains that a bodily injury is conceptually distinct from any injury which affects the mind: <i>Mullany &amp; Handford, Tort Liability for Psychiatric Damage</i> (1993), p18.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;126. The words "palpable" and "conspicuous" were used by the court in <i>Rosman</i> to describe the kind of injury that they envisaged as falling within the expression "bodily injury".  But the use of such strong language risks substituting a new test for that used in the Convention.  The question whether there is any better way of explaining what the Convention meant is best left over for another occasion, as my noble and learned friend Lord Steyn has indicated.  For the time being I would venture to suggest that one would expect an injury falling within the expression "bodily injury" to be capable of being demonstrated by an examination of the body of the passenger, making the best use of the most sophisticated means that are now available.  The <i>Weaver </i>and <i>Air Crash at Little Rock</i>, <i>Arkansas</i> cases, as I understand them, did not proceed on that kind of evidence.  There was no evidence in either case that the passengers had suffered an injury to the brain that was capable of being demonstrated by means of an examination of the body of the passenger.  The argument was that the PTSD itself constituted a manifestation of a physical injury.  In my opinion evidence of the kind that was available in those cases is not enough to satisfy, the test of showing that a psychiatric illness is or includes a "bodily injury" for the purposes of article 17.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;127. I believe that this approach is consistent with the mainstream views in <i>Eastern Airlines v Floyd</i> (1991)  449 US 530 and other leading cases in the United States whose interpretation of article 17, like my noble and learned friend, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, I too would wish that this House should follow if possible.  I regret that I am unable to agree with the opinion of Lord Hobhouse as to the effect of these authorities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;128. In any event there has been no attempt in either case to demonstrate that the passengers' depressive illnesses had a physical cause or origin.  It would not be right to speculate as to whether, in view of the fact that a clinical diagnosis has been achieved in each case and that treatment has been prescribed for them, their illnesses could be shown to have had a physical origin which could be causally linked to the accident.  That would have been a matter for proof.  But there has been no offer to lead any such evidence.  It is sufficient for the decision in these cases to say that it has not been shown that the mental injury which the passengers sustained falls within the scope of the expression "bodily injury".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;129. I would however follow the indications in <i>Rosman v Trans World Airlines Inc</i> (1974)  34 NY 2d 385 and <i>Jack v Trans World Airlines Inc</i> (1994)  854 F Supp 654 that compensation may be awarded to a passenger under article 17 for the physical manifestations of a mental injury.  A peptic ulcer disorder involves the tissues of the body, and it is not difficult to see that it is a kind of bodily injury.  The requirement of a causal link to the accident will be satisfied if it can be shown, as Mr King seeks to do, that the disorder was caused by a mental illness which was itself caused by the accident.  Thus, while there is no general right to recover damages under article 17 for mental injury sustained by a passenger, damages for the physical manifestations of a mental injury will be recoverable.  I would hold that the Lord Ordinary was right to allow Mr King a proof of his averments about the peptic ulcer disease.</p>
<i><p><i>Conclusions</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;130. I would allow the appeal in Mr King's case and restore the interlocutor of the Lord Ordinary.  I have considered whether an opportunity should be given in Miss Morris's case to re-open the question whether her depressive illness was linked to changes in her brain cell structures and could be said on this ground to have amounted to a physical injury.  But I have come to the conclusion, in view of the way her case was expressly argued both in the Court of Appeal and in this House and because I do not think that even with the benefit of such evidence it could be shown that she has suffered a "bodily injury", that this would not be appropriate.  I would dismiss her appeal.</p>
<p><b>LORD HOBHOUSE OF WOODBOROUGH</b></p>
My Lords,
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;131. These two appeals, the one from the Court of Session (Lord President Rodger and Lord Cameron of Lochbroom, Lord Reed dissenting, 2001 SLT 126) and the other from the English Court of Appeal (Lord Phillips MR, Peter Gibson and Latham LJJ, [2002] QB 100), raise a question of the correct meaning to be given to Article 17 of the Warsaw Convention 1929, and the 1955 Hague Amendment, as incorporated into the law of the United Kingdom by the Carriage by Air Act 1961.  In one case the flight was internal to the United Kingdom and in the other was international.  As more fully explained by my noble and learned friend Lord Hope of Craighead, nothing turns on this difference and no argument has been advanced based on making such a distinction.  Point is lent to the relevant question by the fact that the two courts reached irreconcilable and opposing decisions as to the meaning of Article 17.  The question is one upon which the highest courts of other countries have also expressed opinions using language which has been relied upon by one or more of the parties to these appeals to support their submissions and which will need to be carefully examined.  The question is one of importance to the air transport industry world-wide since it affects the division of risk between passengers and carriers and the settlement of claims.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;132. The authoritative text of Article 17 of the Warsaw Convention is that in the French language: Article 36 of the Convention.  The UK Act schedules both an English text and the French text.  Section 1(2) of the Act provides: "if there is any inconsistency between the text in English ... and the text in French ..., the text in French shall prevail."  The English text, which is the same as that used in other English speaking countries and that used for the purposes of later air carriage conventions,reads:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The carrier is liable for damage sustained in the event of the death or wounding of a passenger or any other bodily injury suffered by a passenger, if the accident which caused the damage so sustained took place on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking."<p></p></ul>
<p>The relevant phrase in French reads "dommage survenu en cas de mort, de blessure ou de toute autre lésion corporelle subie par un voyageur" which has the same connotations as the English.  Thus the word <i>lésion</i> has a similar breadth of meaning as the English word <i>injury.</i>  Your Lordships were referred to various dictionaries, both French and English, but these did not disclose any inconsistency between the French and English texts and therefore did not raise any question under s.1(2).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;133. Before coming to the rival arguments it is necessary to give an example of a factual situation in order to illustrate the significance of the question raised before us.  It is convenient to take the pleaded facts of the Morris case for this purpose.  The passenger was a 15 year old girl travelling on an overnight international flight as an unaccompanied minor.  She was placed in a seat next to a male passenger of a different nationality.  During the night she woke up to find herself being indecently assaulted by her neighbour.  Unsurprisingly she was deeply disturbed by this.  The stewardess moved her to another part of the aeroplane where the girl completed the flight without further incident.  The man had not physically injured the girl in any visible way.  She had not been scratched or bruised.  The seriousness of the assault lay in its indecency.  It was a traumatic experience for the girl which had a lasting effect upon her.  As a direct result of the incident she became clinically depressed.  She was referred to a consultant psychiatrist, Dr Cooling, and he diagnosed her to be suffering from the illness "major depressive disorder, single episode", 296.2[x] in the "DSM-IV".  "DSM-IV" is the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders published by the American Psychiatric Association.  This manual contains the authoritative classification of psychiatric illnesses defining the signs and symptoms upon which the diagnosis of the various illnesses and disorders should be based.  The Manual explains the terminology used and its purpose.  The phrase 'mental disorder' is used for reasons of convenience although it "unfortunately implies a distinction between 'mental' and 'physical' disorders that is a reductionist anachronism of mind/body dualism". (p.xxx)  The word 'disorder' is used to describe what is clinically significant and mark the boundary between normality and pathology.</p>
<p></p><ul>"In DSM-IV, each of the mental disorders is conceptualized as a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual and that is associated with present distress (e.g., a painful symptom) or disability (i.e., impairment in one or more important areas of functioning) or with a significantly increased risk of suffering death, pain, disability, or an important loss of freedom. In addition, this syndrome or pattern must not be merely an expectable and culturally sanctioned response to a particular event, for example, the death of a loved one, Whatever its original cause, it must currently be considered a manifestation of a behavioral, psychological, or biological dysfunction in the individual. Neither deviant behavior (e.g., political, religious or sexual) nor conflicts that are primarily between the individual and society are mental disorders unless the deviance or conflict is a symptom of a dysfunction in the individual, as described above."  (p.xxxi)<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;134. So, there had been an incident during the course of the flight which qualified as an accident for the purposes of Article 17.  (See the judgment of the Court of Appeal [2002] QB 100 at 108-112, following <i>Air France v Saks</i> 470 US 392.)  The incident is alleged to have caused the girl to suffer a recognised psychiatric illness displaying observable dysfunctional symptoms as a result of which she suffered damage.  Is the psychiatric illness alleged a <i>bodily injury</i>?  The passenger submits that it is: the carrier submits that cannot be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;135. The arguments advanced by each side as to what was required for the passenger to have suffered a <i>bodily injury</i> ranged over a spectrum of alternative submissions.  These submissions covered not only the 'injury' itself but also how it may have been caused.  It was correctly accepted by the parties that the three elements in the first sentence of Article 17 must be causally linked.  The use of the phrase "in the event of" ("en cas de") does not mean that any wound suffered by the passenger at any time between the commencement of embarkation and the completion of disembarkation will suffice to permit any claim for damages.  Thus, there must have been an accident which has caused the death, the wounding or the <i>bodily injury</i> suffered by the passenger which caused the damage complained of.  Some of the submissions sought to distinguish between different ways in which the relevant death, wounding or <i>bodily injury</i>, as the case might be, had been caused.  Such submissions have been consistently rejected by the courts though they have undoubtedly affected the reasoning.  The simplest form of the argument has been the 'impact' argument: there must have been an actual impact between some physical object and the passenger.  Another form of the argument is that the causal link must have been through the medium of some physical object coming into contact with the passenger as, for example, the inhalation of smoke.  These arguments, which were advanced again on these appeals by the carriers, were directed to excluding any injury other than one so caused and many psychiatric illnesses would not have been so caused.  Ironically, in the case of Morris, there was such physical contact - the indecent touching.  However a traumatic experience can be something the passenger merely witnesses such as passively witnessing a life-threatening emergency or a hijacking.  The difficulty with the carriers' causation arguments is that they would seek to make an unwarranted distinction between death and injury.  The death of a susceptible individual can be caused by being involved in a sufficiently traumatic incident, such as a very severe fright, and the same applies to non-fatal injuries (though not to woundings).  The causal link is a link made through the passenger's senses.  Once the 'causation' arguments are rejected, it is necessary to examine carefully the carriers' arguments upon <i>bodily injury</i> since they tend to equate <i>bodily</i> with 'physical' and then apply criteria which would have the effect of including or excluding injuries of the same character on the basis that they were fatal or non-fatal.</p>
