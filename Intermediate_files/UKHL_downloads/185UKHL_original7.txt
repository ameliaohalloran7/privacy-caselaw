<i></i><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mistake issue</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;143.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can set out my views on this issue more briefly. I agree with the judge's conclusions, and I largely agree with his reasoning, though I respectfully think that he was rather over-analytical in his approach. I agree with the observation of Neuberger J in <i>Nurdin &amp; Peacock plc v D D B Ramsden &amp; Co Ltd</i> [1999]1 WLR 1249, 1272:</p>
<p></p><ul>"For the issue of recoverability to turn upon a nice analysis as to the precise nature of the mistake of law appears to me to be almost as undesirable as it is for recoverability to turn upon whether the mistake made by the payer was one of fact or law."<p></p></ul>
<p>The straightforward test of causation put forward by Robert Goff J (as he then was), after a full survey of authority, in <i>Barclays Bank Limited v W J Simms Son &amp; Cook (Southern) Limited</i> [1980] QB 677, has stood the test of time. DMG paid the ACT because it mistakenly thought that it had to. The fact that there was a procedural requirement for a GIE does not alter the substance of its mistake, since (as Park J expressly found, para 11) any attempt at making a GIE would undoubtedly have been rejected in this case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;144.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the judge and Jonathan Parker LJ were correct in their views that the mistake was not discovered until the ECJ gave judgment in <i>Hoechst</i> [2001] Ch 620<i>. </i> Perusal of the report in that case suggests that the United Kingdom government tenaciously defended the ACT regime on every available ground. At no time before the judgment did the government concede that the ACT regime was (in discriminating between national and multi-national groups) contrary to EU law and unlawful. It was the judgment that first turned recognition of the possibility of a mistake into knowledge that there had indeed been a mistake. I agree with the view of Lightman J in <i>First Roodhill Leasing Limited v Gillingham Operating Company Limited</i> (5 July 2001) para 22 that there may be cases</p>
<p></p><ul>"where a party may be held to have discovered a mistake without there being an authoritative pronouncement directly on point on the facts of that case by a court, let alone an appellate court."<p></p></ul>
<p>It all depends on the facts. But in this case it is, in my opinion, clear that the judgment of the ECJ on 8 March 2001 was the decisive moment.</p>
<i></i><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Settled law</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;145.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the judge, I agree with the view expressed in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> by my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann, that the fashioning of a settled law defence would be a legislative act and is therefore a matter for Parliament. Parliament has indeed incorporated its own version of the defence, in terms of "the practice generally prevailing", in section 33(2A)(a) of TMA 1970, re-enacting the proviso to section 33(2). As Lord Goff recognised in <i>Woolwich </i>and <i>Kleinwort Benson</i>, there are strong policy arguments in favour of a general common law right of recovery of wrongly exacted tax, and also strong countervailing arguments in favour of some restrictions on that right of recovery, especially as the defence of change of position could seldom, if ever, apply to wrongfully exacted tax. But the balancing of these high policy arguments is essentially a matter for the legislature. </p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "scope of section 32(1)(c)" issue</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;146.&nbsp;&nbsp;This issue arises only if DMG fails on the first (cause of action) issue. In my opinion it does not arise on this appeal. The rule that in order to come within section 32(1) a mistake must be an essential ingredient of the claimant's cause of action rests on a surprisingly uncertain basis, that is a view expressed by Pearson J in <i>Phillips-Higgins v Harper</i> [1954] 1QB 411, 419. Nevertheless it has been generally accepted (with some dissentient academic voices raised against it) for over fifty years. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;147.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Law Commission has now completed and published its review of the law of limitation of actions (2001, Law Com. 270) and the government has accepted its general recommendations with a view to legislation as soon as time permits. In those circumstances your Lordships need not, in my opinion, reconsider the now nearly traditional view of the scope of section 32(1)(c), although there are persuasive arguments for its reinterpretation (see Dr James Edelman, "Limitation Periods and the Theory of Unjust Enrichment" (2005) 68 MLR 848 and Professor Andrew Burrows, "Restitution in respect of Mistakenly Paid Tax" (2005) 121 LQR 540). </p>
<i></i><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pleading issue</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;148.&nbsp;&nbsp;This point was fully considered in the courts below. I agree with the reasoning and conclusions of Park J and the majority of the Court of Appeal. I would only echo the observations of Millett LJ in <i>Paragon Finance plc v DB Thakerar &amp; Co (a firm)</i> [1999] 1 All ER 400, 405:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The pleading of unnecessary allegations or the addition of further instances or better particulars do not amount to a distinct cause of action. The selection of the material facts to define the cause of action must be made at the lightest level of abstraction". <p></p></ul>
<p>The formula used in DMG's particulars of claim ("Such amounts include, but are not limited to, payments of ACT…specified in the [First or Second] Schedule") was imprecise and unsatisfactory, but the defect could have been cured by a request for particulars. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;149.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons I would allow the appeal and restore the order of Park J. </p>
<i><p>The foundations of unjust enrichment </p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;150.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do however wish to add some brief observations on the views of the late Professor Peter Birks, who died on 6 July 2004, after the first-instance decision of Park J but before the decision of the Court of Appeal. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;151.&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Birks was (in the words of Professor Burrows in his introduction to the second edition of Birks' <i>Unjust Enrichment</i>, published posthumously in 2005) one of the most influential academic lawyers of our time.  After Lord Goff and Professor Gareth Jones (the first edition of whose joint work on <i>The Law of Restitution</i> was published in 1966) Professor Birks was one of the foremost, and many would say the very foremost, of the scholars working on developing the law of restitution.  In the revised paperback edition of his <i>Introduction to The Law of Restitution</i> (1989) he explained his views as to the essential function in the law of unjust enrichment of "unjust factors" (such as mistake, undue influence, and compulsion).  Most if not all other leading textbooks adopt the same or similar terminology, for instance <i>Burrows, The Law of Restitution</i>, second edition (2002) pp 41 ff; <i>Goff and Jones, The Law of Restitution</i>, sixth edition (2002) para 1-053; Hedley and Halliwell (gen. eds.) <i>The Law of Restitution</i> (2002) para 1.20; Tettenborn, <i>Law of Restitution in England and Ireland</i>, third edition (2002) pp 13 ff; <i>Virgo, The Principles of the Law of Restitution</i> (1999) pp 119 ff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;152.&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the preface to the first (2003) edition of <i>Unjust Enrichment</i> Birks, with characteristic intellectual courage, explained that he had changed his views in some fundamental respects (he wrote to Sir Jack Beatson that he was "back to square one").  In particular, he switched from the concept of "unjust factors" to the civilian concept of "lack of basis" (or "lack of cause").  As he said in his preface to the first edition, summarising the points on which his views had changed:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, the onward march of case law and academic analysis, especially comparative analysis, has both compelled and convinced me that it was a misjudgement to insist that the common law, late coming, had by good luck hit upon a better way of answering the question whether an enrichment was unjust than, with their much longer experience, the civilian jurisdictions had achieved."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;153.&nbsp;&nbsp;Birks ascribed his change of view partly to the swaps litigation, and especially to <i>Kleinwort Benson</i>.  In his own contribution, the first chapter, to Birks and Rose (Eds), <i>Lessons of the Swaps Litigation</i>, (2000) he wrote of the decision of this House in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> (p14),</p>
<p></p><ul>"The disagreement between the majority and the minority turns on whether one can be retrospectively mistaken in any sense relevant to restitutionary relief.  The majority holds that one can, and in so holding it appears to have approved a notion of operative mistake of law which is not only broader than operative mistake of fact but broader than the <i>rationale </i>underlying relief for mistake.  Without saying so expressly, it has moved English law towards a civilian <i>condictio indebiti</i>.  '<i>Condictio indebiti'</i> means 'Claim in respect of something not due'."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can be contrasted with the well-known statement by Lord Goff in <i>Woolwich </i>[1993]  AC 70, 172, </p>
<p></p><ul>"The first [objection] is to be found in the structure of our law of restitution, as it developed during the 19th and early 20th centuries.  That law might have developed so as to recognise a condictio indebiti - an action for the recovery of money on the ground that it was not due.  But it did not do so.  Instead, as we have seen, there developed common law actions for the recovery of money paid under a mistake of fact, and under certain forms of compulsion."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law of Scotland has, by contrast, closely followed the civilian model: see the Lord President (Rodger) in <i>Shilliday v Smith</i> [1998]  SC 725, 727-728 and generally Professor Robin Evans-Jones, <i>Unjustified Enrichment</i>: Vol.One, Enrichment by Deliberate Conferral: Condictio (2003).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;154.&nbsp;&nbsp;In explaining his changes of view Professor Birks also acknowledged the influence of Dr Sonja Meier, a lecturer in law at the University of Regensberg.  Her views are accessible in English in her contributions to <i>Lessons of the Swaps Litigation</i> (chapter 6, Restitution After Executed Void Contracts) and to <i>Johnston and Zimmermann, Unjustified Enrichment: Key Issues in Comparison</i> (2002) (chapter 2, Unjust Factors and Legal Grounds).  On this point English law may be at something of a crossroads (a metaphor first used, I think, by Waller LJ in <i>Guinness Mahon &amp; Co Ltd v Kensington and Chelsea London Borough Council</i> [1999]  QB 215, 233, and since picked up by others including Dr Krebs, <i>Restitution at the Crossroads, A Comparative Study</i> (2001)).  The choice as to the way forward which restitution scholars identify is between continuing to view unjust enrichment as depending on the presence of one or more of a variety of "unjust factors" and adopting the single test of "absence of basis".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;155.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, the House is being invited (much more pressingly, it must be said, by scholars than by counsel for the parties) to make a choice at a very high level of abstraction.  Most scholars would take the view (though Professor Birks himself would not, I suspect, have agreed, since he regarded taxonomy as very important) that the choice is one which will rarely make much if any practical difference to the outcome of any particular case before the court.  For several reasons I doubt whether this is the right time for your Lordships to decide whether to rebase the whole law of unjust enrichment on a highly abstract principle which (although familiar to civilians and to Scottish lawyers, and discussed in the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Hope of Craighead in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> [1999]  2 AC 349, pp 408-409) would represent a distinct departure from established doctrine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;156.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is of the nature of the common law to develop slowly, and attempts at dramatic simplification may turn out to have been premature and indeed mistaken.  As Lord Rodger of Earlsferry put it in <i>Commissioners of Customs and Excise v Barclays Bank plc</i> [2006] UKHL 28; [2006]  3 WLR 1, 19, para 51: </p>
<p></p><ul>"Part of the function of appeal courts is to try to assist judges and practitioners by boiling down a mass of case law and distilling some shorter statement of the applicable law.  The temptation to try to identify some compact underlying rule which can then be applied to solve all future cases is obvious. [Counsel for the appellants] submitted that in this area the House had identified such a rule in the need to find that the defendant had voluntarily assumed responsibility.  But the unhappy experience with the rule so elegantly formulated by Lord Wilberforce in <i>Anns v Merton London Borough Council</i> [1978]  AC 728, 751-752, suggests that appellate judges should follow the philosopher's advice to 'Seek simplicity, and distrust it.'"<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other members of the House showed a similar disinclination to wide generalisation: see Lord Bingham of Cornhill at para 8, Lord Hoffmann at para 36 and Lord Mance at para 83. <i>Commissioners of Customs &amp; Excise v Barclays Bank plc</i> shows that more than forty years on from <i>Hedley Byrne &amp; Co Ltd v Heller &amp; Partners Ltd</i> [1964]  AC 465, the true foundations of the law of tortious liability for negligent mis-statement are still open to debate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;157.&nbsp;&nbsp;By contrast the English law of unjust enrichment has in the space of a decade seen four very important developments, all informed by the learning of Lord Goff: <i>Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd</i> [1991] 2 AC 548 in 1991, <i>Woolwich</i> [1993] AC 70 in 1992, <i>Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Borough Council</i> [1996] AC 669 in 1996, and <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> [1999] 2AC 349 in 1998.  The change in the views of Professor Birks is a recent development (which sadly he could not pursue further) and it has not yet been fully considered by other legal scholars. There is, it seems to me, much to be said for a period of reappraisal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;158.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless I would add that my tentative inclination is to welcome any tendency of the English law of unjust enrichment to align itself more closely with Scottish law, and so to civilian roots. I see attractions in the suggestion made by Professor Birks in <i>Unjust Enrichment</i> (2nd edition, p.116, under the heading 'The Pyramid: a Limited Reconciliation'):</p>
<p></p><ul>"A pyramid can be constructed in which, at the base, the particular unjust factors such as mistake, pressure and undue influence become reasons why, higher up, there is no basis for the defendant's acquisition, which is then the master reason why, higher up still, the enrichment is unjust and must be surrendered."<p></p></ul>
<p>I would be glad to see the law developing on those lines. The recognition of "no basis" as a single unifying principle would preserve what Lord Hope refers to as the purity of the principle on which unjust enrichment is founded, without in any way removing (as this case illustrates) the need for careful analysis of the content of particular "unjust factors" such as mistake.</p>
<p><b>LORD BROWN OF EATON-UNDER-HEYWOOD</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;159.&nbsp;&nbsp;DMG's claim in these proceedings (issued on 18 October 2000) is for compensation in respect of three payments of ACT made respectively on 14 October 1993, 15 February 1995 and 14 January 1996.  These payments could and would have been avoided had the UK tax regime not breached article 43 (formerly 52) of the EU Treaty by denying DMG (as a multinational rather than exclusively UK group) the right to make a group income election.  So much, the majority of your Lordships would hold, was established by the ECJ's decision in <i>Hoechst</i> on 8 March 2001.  The claim is not for the capital sums paid: those were subsequently set off against the company's liability for MCT.  Rather it is for compensation for the loss of use of the monies prior to such setoffs, i.e. for having made accelerated payments.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;160.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Revenue do not dispute DMG's entitlement to such compensation in principle.  On the contrary, they readily accept that the company has a perfectly good remedy, either in tort for breach of statutory duty or in restitution by analogy with the principle established in <i>Woolwich</i>—see <i>Woolwich Equitable Buildings Society v Inland Revenue Commissioners</i> [1993]  AC 70.  But under these causes of action DMG would be confined to a six year limitation period (i.e. six years from the date of the respective payments) and on this basis would fail in respect of the October 1993 payment (and fail too in respect of the later payments were the Revenue to succeed in their cross appeal on the pleading issue, contending as they do that such claims were only brought by later amendment rather than when the writ was first issued).  That is why DMG assert their claim as one for restitution based on a mistake of law—precisely so as to benefit from section 32 (1)(c) of the Limitation Act 1980, just as the claimants succeeded in doing in the landmark case of <i>Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Lincoln City Council </i> [1999]  2 AC 349.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;161.&nbsp;&nbsp;All this is fully and lucidly explained in the speech of my noble and learned friend, Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe, as too are the various issues which arise for decision on the appeal.  With almost all of Lord Walker's speech (and the speeches of my noble and learned friends, Lord Hoffmann and Lord Hope of Craighead) I find myself in full agreement and, in common with them, I too would allow DMG's appeal and restore Park J's order.  On one issue, however, the "discovery" issue (linked in one respect, as it is, with the "mistake" issue), I have the misfortune to take a different view, indeed a view which puts me in a minority of one.  As it happens, because of the inter-relationship of this issue with other issues arising on the appeal, my disagreement has in fact no effect whatsoever on the overall outcome of the proceedings.  But it would not, I think, be right to ignore it entirely: the point could well be of decisive importance in other actions, perhaps indeed actions awaiting the outcome of this very appeal.  Let me explain.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;162.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I understand it, your Lordships have concluded, first, that DMG was acting under a mistake of law when making the three relevant payments of ACT (it is on this issue that my noble and learned friend, Lord Scott of Foscote dissents on the basis that DMG was in any event under a legal obligation to make the payments and so should not be regarded within the <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> principle as having made them under a mistake of law); and, secondly, that that mistake was not discovered until the decision of the ECJ in the <i>Hoechst</i> case was handed down on 8 March 2001. The contrary view which I take is that DMG ceased to be acting under any relevant mistake of law in July 1995 when they first became aware of the <i>Hoechst</i> proceedings and recognised that there was a serious legal challenge to the legality of the UK's ACT regime under EC law.  If I am correct in this view it would follow that DMG, although paying the October 1993 and February 1995 payments under a mistake of law, discovered that mistake in July 1995 so as to set time running in respect of those particular payments as from that date; and that the January 1996 payment was not made under a mistake of law at all. (It is because, however, as already stated, the claim was issued on 18 October 2000, within six years of July 1995, and because DMG have the benefit of undisputed alternative grounds of claim in respect of the January 1996 payment, that none of this matters given your Lordships' rejection, with which I agree, of the Revenue's cross appeal.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;163.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn then to this narrow though potentially important issue upon which I diffidently disagree with your Lordships.  First I should for convenience set out again section 32(1) of the 1980 Act:</p>
<p></p><ul>" … where in the case of any action for which a period of limitation is prescribed by this Act, either—<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;the action is based upon the fraud of the defendant; or<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;any fact relevant to the plaintiff's right of action has been deliberately concealed from him by the defendant; or<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;the action is for relief from the consequences of a mistake;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>the period of limitation shall not begin to run until the plaintiff has discovered the fraud, concealment or mistake (as the case may be) or could with reasonable diligence have discovered it."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;164.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, I acknowledge, difficult to articulate the precise touchstone by which to determine whether a payment ought properly to be held to have been made under a mistake of law (or, indeed, answering essentially the same question from a different standpoint, whether such a mistake should be held to have been discovered—or able with reasonable diligence to have been discovered).  Section 32 itself affords little help on the question—unsurprisingly, perhaps, given that the provision (based as it was on section 26 of the Limitation Act 1939) was framed at a time when no plaintiff could have hoped to pray in aid a mistake of law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;165.&nbsp;&nbsp;For my part, however, I would hold that as soon as a paying party recognises that a worthwhile claim arises that he should not after all have made the payment and accordingly is entitled to recover it (or, as here, to compensation for the loss of its use), he has "discovered" the mistake within the meaning of section 32; and, by the same token, I would hold that if he makes any further payments thereafter, they are not to be regarded as payments made under a mistake of law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;166.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, I would respectfully ask, is there any injustice in this?  No one is suggesting, let me repeat, that the monies are not recoverable or that the payee should remain unjustly enriched.  All that is required is that the payer does not sit upon what ex-hypothesi he recognises to be a worthwhile legal argument for more than six years.  Provided he acts within that (surely ample) time, he can pursue his claim (whether in respect of past payments or, indeed, payments he may choose to continue making) under whatever may be the appropriate cause of action: restitution for mistake of law in respect of past payments made when he had no reason to question his liability to make them, total failure of consideration, or a claim based on the <i>Woolwich</i> principle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;167.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once a plaintiff recognises that he has a worthwhile case on the facts to pursue a claim in fraud or to extend the limitation period for a particular claim because of the defendant's deliberate concealment of a fact relevant to his cause of action, time surely then starts to run against him under section 32: he could not successfully argue that time starts running only when the court eventually comes to reject the defendant's denial of wrongdoing and to find fraud (or, as the case may be, deliberate concealment) established.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;168.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor do I find it easy to reconcile the approach taken by your Lordships with other provisions of the 1980 Act, most notably section 14A(9): "Knowledge that any acts or omissions did or did not, as a matter of law, involve negligence is irrelevant for the purposes of subsection (5) above."  (Section 14A(5) determines the starting date for reckoning the period of limitation based on the claimant's date of knowledge.)  As Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead recently observed in <i>Haward v Fawcetts</i> [2006]  1 WLR 682, 686F, para 12:  "A claimant need not know he has a worthwhile cause of action."  On your Lordships' view, however, such a claimant could well argue that he was labouring under a mistake of law so as to extend time under section 32(1).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;169.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Woolwich</i> was decided on the explicit basis that the building society was in no way mistaken when making its payments under the disputed regulations—see particularly the speech of Lord Goff at p 173D and that of Lord Slynn at p 201A-B.  Rather the payments were made because, as Lord Goff put it at p 171G-H:</p>
<p></p><ul>"[The taxpayer] is faced with the revenue, armed with the coercive power of the state, including what is in practice a power to charge interest which is penal in its effect.  In addition, being a reputable society which alone among building societies is challenging the lawfulness of the demand, it understandably fears damage to its reputation if it does not pay.  So it decides to pay first, asserting that it will challenge the lawfulness of the demand in litigation."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see no real distinction between that case and this (this case, that is, after July 1995).  True, as Lord Goff observed (at p 171G), <i>Woolwich</i> was 'convinced that the demand [was] unlawful' whereas here Mr Thomason, DMG's Head of Taxation, believed that the company was in law bound to make the payments (precisely, indeed, as Lord Scott would hold to be so).  But I fail to see why the question whether monies are paid under a mistake of law should turn on the degree of conviction or optimism which the parties hold upon the legal issue dividing them.  Were the claimants in <i>Hoechst</i> (who issued their proceedings against the Revenue in 1995) nonetheless to be regarded as having made all subsequent payments under a mistake of law?  Surely not.  Even DMG itself, it will have been noted, brought its claim in October 2000.  Is it nevertheless to be said that their original mistake remained undiscovered until the ECJ's actual decision in <i>Hoechst</i> some five months later?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;170.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Kleinwort Benson</i>, as I understand that case, nothing turned upon the particular state of mind of the payer as to whether the payments for which restitution was sought were made under a mistake.  As Lord Hope noted (at p 403G), the only issue on that part of the case was whether the bank's mistake was one of law.  It was certainly not critical to the decision there that the mistake of law was assumed, at least by Lord Lloyd, to have been discovered only when the House of Lords finally held in <i>Hazell v Hammersmith &amp; Fulham LBC</i> [1992]  2 AC 1 that the swap agreements were void.  As Lord Hoffmann observed (at p 401F-H), the decision (in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i>) "leaves open what may be difficult evidential questions over whether a person making a payment has made a mistake or not.   … There is room for a spectrum of states of mind between genuine belief in validity, founding a claim based on mistake, and a clear acceptance of the risk that they are not.  But these questions are not presently before your Lordships."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;171.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Hope too left open for another day cases where payments are made in a state of doubt about the law.  The Revenue on the present appeal understandably place some reliance on what Lord Hope said at p 410B-C:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Cases where the payer was aware that there was an issue of law which was relevant but, being in doubt as to what the law was, paid without waiting to resolve that doubt may be left on one side.  A state of doubt is different from that of mistake.  A person who pays when in doubt takes the risk that he may be wrong—and that is so whether the issue is one of fact or one of law."<p></p></ul>
