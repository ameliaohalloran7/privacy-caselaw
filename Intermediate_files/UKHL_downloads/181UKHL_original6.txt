<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, the usual courtesies are more than usually apt. It has been both a privilege and an advantage to read your lordships' opinions in draft. To some extent, I agree with you all.  Thus I agree entirely with my noble and learned friend, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, that the damage which is the "gist" of these actions is the mesothelioma and its physical and financial consequences. It is not the risk of contracting mesothelioma. Mr Stuart-Smith was indeed anxious to disclaim any such argument. He was understandably concerned to avoid the possibility that our reasoning might lead to the imposition of liability for tortiously exposing a person to the risk of harm even where that harm had not in fact been suffered. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree entirely with my noble and learned friend, Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe, that while the borderline between a divisible and an indivisible injury may be debateable, mesothelioma is an indivisible injury. What makes it an indivisible injury, and thus different from asbestosis or industrial deafness or any of the other dose-related cumulative diseases, is that it may be caused by a single fibre. This much, as I understand it, is known, although the mechanism whereby that fibre causes the transformation of a normal into a malignant cell is not known.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it does not necessarily follow from the fact that the damage is a single indivisible injury that each of the persons who may have caused that injury should be liable to pay for all of its consequences. The common law rules that lead to liability <i>in solidum</i> for the whole damage have always been closely linked to the common law's approach to causation. There is no reason in principle why the former rules should not be modified as the latter approach is courageously developed to meet new situations. Where joint tortfeasors act in concert, each is liable for the whole because each has caused the whole. The owner of one of the two dogs which had worried the sheep was liable for the whole damage because "each of the dogs did in law occasion the whole of the damage which was suffered by the sheep as a result of the action of the two dogs acting together." (<i>Arneil v Paterson</i> [1931] AC 560, 563, per Lord Hailsham) Where two people, acting independently, shoot simultaneously and kill another, each is still liable for the whole. This is because, according to <i>Prosser and Keeton on Torts</i> 5th ed, p 345<i>,</i> there is no sensible basis for dividing up the single damage which they have combined to cause - "for death cannot be divided or apportioned except by an arbitrary rule".</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123.&nbsp;&nbsp;But as our perceptions of causation have expanded, so too has our conception of whether there may exist a sensible basis for apportionment. In <i>Bonnington Castings Ltd v Wardlaw</i> [1956] AC 613, the issue was whether the employer was liable at all, given that some of the exposure to dust was in breach of duty and some was not; but it could be shown that the tortious exposure had materially contributed to the harm, even if it was not the only cause. In <i>McGhee v National Coal Board</i> [1973] 1 WLR 1, where again some of the exposure was in breach of duty and some was not, but this time it could not be shown that the tortious exposure had even materially contributed to the harm, the issue again was whether the employer was liable at all; it was held that a material increase to the risk of harm was the equivalent of a material contribution to causing the harm. In neither case was it argued that the employer should only be liable to the extent that his behaviour had been in breach of duty. Yet in the case of diseases which progress over time, such exercises have now become commonplace, following the decision of Mustill J in <i>Thompson v Smiths Shiprepairers Ltd </i>[1984] QB 405, whether as between successive employers or as between tortious and non-tortious exposure by the same employer. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;124.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, therefore, a logical connection between the law's approach to causation and the law's approach to the extent of liability. At each point along the road in developing the concept of causation, there is a choice to be made as to whether a single tortfeasor or a joint or concurrent tortfeasor should be liable for the whole or only for part of the damage. This is a policy question. One element in making that choice is whether there exists a sensible basis for apportioning liability. Another element is whether this would strike the right balance of fairness between claimant and defendant.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125.&nbsp;&nbsp;In one sense, there always exists a sensible basis for apportioning liability where more than one person is involved. Liability could be divided equally between them. But that would be arbitrary unless each was equally responsible. Even if liability were equally divided, this could be unfair to the claimant if, as in the dog-worrying and shooting examples, each defendant has in fact caused the whole of his damage. In the <i>Bonnington Castings</i> and <i>McGhee</i> situations, where one employer is responsible for all the potentially harmful exposure, there may exist a sensible basis for apportioning liability, but it may still be unfair to the claimant to do this, if the one employer has undoubtedly caused all his harm.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;126.&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the <i>Fairchild</i> situation we have yet another development. For the first time in our legal history, persons are made liable for damage even though they may not have caused it at all, simply because they have materially contributed to the risk of causing that damage. Mr Stuart-Smith does not quarrel with the principle in <i>Fairchild</i>. He simply argues that it does not follow from the imposition of liability in such a case that each should be liable for the whole. I agree with the majority of your lordships that indeed it does not follow. There is in this situation no magic in the indivisibility of the harm. It is not being said that each has caused or materially contributed to <i>the harm</i>. It can only be said that each has materially contributed to the <i>risk of harm</i>. The harm may be indivisible but the material contribution to the risk can be divided. There exists a sensible basis for doing so. Is it fair to do so?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;127.&nbsp;&nbsp;In common with the majority of your lordships, I think that it is fair to do so. On the one hand, the defendants are, by definition, in breach of their duties towards the claimants or the deceased. But then so are many employers, occupiers or other defendants who nevertheless escape liability altogether because it cannot be shown that their breach of duty caused the harm suffered by the claimant. For as long as we have rules of causation, some negligent (or otherwise duty-breaking) defendants will escape liability. The law of tort is not (generally) there to punish people for their behaviour. It is there to make them pay for the damage they have done. These <i>Fairchild</i> defendants may not have caused any harm at all. They are being made liable because it is thought fair that they should make at least some contribution to redressing the harm that may have flowed from their wrongdoing. It seems to me most fair that the contribution they should make is in proportion to the contribution they have made to the risk of that harm occurring.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;128.&nbsp;&nbsp;This solution is all the more attractive as it also provides the solution to the problem posed by the <i>barker</i> appeal. If the damage could have been suffered during a period of non-tortious exposure, it is suggested that the tortious exposers should escape liability altogether. There is considerable logic in this. One way of explaining <i>Fairchild</i> is that all were in breach of duty and one of them must be guilty, so that it made sense that all should be liable. That rationale does not apply, or certainly not with the same force, if there are other, non-tortious causers in the frame. But if the tortious exposers are only liable in proportion to their own contribution to the claimant's overall exposure to the risk of harm, then the problem does not arise. The victim's own behaviour is only relevant if he fails to take reasonable care for his own safety during a period of tortious exposure by a defendant.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;129.&nbsp;&nbsp;These reflections are only a footnote to the much fuller reasons given by my noble and learned friends, Lord Hoffmann and Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe, with which I agree. I too would allow these appeals and make the orders proposed by Lord Hoffmann.</p>
