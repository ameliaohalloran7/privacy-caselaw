<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;59.&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge ended by concluding that the response of the Trust to the parents was a proportionate one to a legitimate aim, namely to protect the welfare and interests of the child, and that there was accordingly no breach of article 8 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.  He therefore made a freeing order, leaving the question of contact for the adoption application, while expressing a firm view in support of continuing contact after adoption.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60.&nbsp;&nbsp;The leading judgment in the Court of Appeal was given by Nicholson LJ, with whom Campbell LJ agreed in a shorter judgment.  After extensive consideration of the facts of the case, the statutory provisions, the relevant authorities and the arguments presented, Nicholson LJ concluded that the judge's decision should be upheld on both grounds, the question whether adoption was in the best interests of the child and the question whether the parents' agreement should be dispensed with.  He expressed a measure of disagreement with the judge on the prospects of H's successful rehabilitation, since he considered the judge's pessimistic assessment unjustified by the evidence.  He concluded that the issue of making a freeing order in the absence of an assurance that post-adoption contact would be afforded was a finely balanced judgment, but upheld the judge's decision on the basis that it did not exceed "the generous ambit within which reasonable disagreement is possible."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;61.&nbsp;&nbsp;Campbell LJ reached the same conclusion, which he expressed in paragraph 21 of his judgment:</p>
<p></p><ul>"If it is a question of such a finely balanced judgment over contact are the advantages of adoption to the welfare of N sufficiently strong to justify overriding the views of her parents?  The judge was satisfied that the need for adoption was so pressing that whilst it would be preferable to have some limited measure of post adoption contact, nonetheless adoption must proceed even if this cannot be achieved.  The reasonable parent, faced with this decision and with the welfare of N in mind, would in my view be driven to this conclusion.  Accordingly I would affirm the judge's decision and dismiss the appeal."<p></p></ul>
<p>He reached that conclusion, however, while finding himself in less than full agreement with the judge on the prospects of H's remaining abstinent or the prospects of success of the course of treatment proposed for her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;62.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheil LJ agreed that it was in the best interests of the child that she should be freed for adoption, but dissented on the question whether the parents' agreement should be dispensed with.  He did not discuss in his judgment the limits within which an appellate court should reverse the judgment of a trial judge on such an issue.  He expressed his own view of the facts and his conclusions in paragraphs 11 to 13 of his judgment:</p>
<p></p><ul>"[11]&nbsp;&nbsp;In the instant case H has managed to stay off alcohol since July 2003 without the benefit of any counselling and has also been regularly attending Alcoholics Anonymous with favourable reports therefrom.  There has been no domestic violence since July 2003 and she has been reconciled with her mother.  N has strong attachments to both of her parents, particularly her mother, both of whom faithfully attend contact with N limited though that is at present to once a month.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>[12]&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case if the court does not free N for adoption, the care order will remain in place for the time being.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>[13]&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion it cannot be said that N's parents are withholding their consent unreasonably to her being freed for adoption."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;63.&nbsp;&nbsp;The arguments before your Lordships' House centred round the question of post-adoption contact.  The appellants' counsel did not place much emphasis on the issues of article 8 of the Convention or legitimate grievance, though both featured in their written case.  I do not consider that there is any substance in the latter argument, save in so far as the appellants' discontent with the support afforded by the Trust may, if well grounded, constitute a factor in determining whether they unreasonably withheld agreement to adoption.  For the reasons given by the judge, however, I do not think that it is well grounded and it is not a factor to be given any real weight in assessing unreasonableness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;64.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor do I consider that the argument based on article 8 of the Convention can succeed.  I entirely agree with the judge that the Trust's response was proportionate in the pursuit of the legitimate aim of protecting the welfare and interests of the child.  That is sufficient to dispose of this point, but I should add one grace note in the interests of clarity.  The appellants' argument may on one reading encompass the suggestion that if the Trust failed to recognise the existence of the appellants' rights under article 8, that failure ipso facto invalidated its decision to seek to place the child for adoption.  If that suggestion were advanced, in reliance on paragraph 90 of the judgment of Kerr LCJ in <i>AR v Homefirst Community Trust </i>[2005] NI 435, then it would in my opinion be misplaced.  I do not understand Kerr LCJ to be saying in that paragraph that failure to recognise the article 8 rights invalidated the decision, an approach which would be appropriate in a challenge to a decision by way of judicial review, but not in a contest on the merits of making a freeing order.  What he said was that if the rights have not been explicitly recognised at all, it may be difficult to establish that there was not an infringement of those rights.  In some cases that may well be so, but where the court is properly satisfied that the acts and decisions of the body concerned have been proportionate, then it may correctly conclude that no breach of article 8 has occurred, even if that body did not realise that article 8 was engaged and explicitly address the question of compliance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;65.&nbsp;&nbsp;The essence of the main argument advanced on behalf of the appellants was twofold, first, that the judge could not correctly hold that the withholding of agreement was unreasonable when it was not known whether post-adoption contact could be arranged, and, secondly, that the judge had strayed outside his proper function in determining whether the withholding of agreement was unreasonable, in that he had substituted his own view about the attitude which it was reasonable for them to take, rather than seeking to ascertain whether the parental veto came within the band of possible reasonable decisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first argument may be put in several ways.  The most extreme form, which was espoused by Mr McMahon QC on behalf of R, was that without evidence relating to the prospect of the provision of post-adoption contact, the judge was not entitled to proceed to dispense with the parents' agreement and make a freeing order.  If counsel intended by this submission to put forward the need for such evidence as a requirement imposed by law, this cannot in my opinion be sustained.  The availability of post-adoption contact is, of course, a relevant factor to be taken into account in deciding whether to dispense with the parents' agreement and make a freeing order, and the necessity to ascertain what and how much contact can be arranged will vary from case to case.  But evidence on that topic cannot be regarded as a condition which is in law a sine qua non, requiring to be satisfied before the judge can proceed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;67.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr O'Hara QC for H put the argument, as I understand his submissions, in a modified form, that the availability of post-adoption contact is a factor which ranks so high in importance that unless there is sufficient evidence about it before him the judge cannot be said to have had regard to all the necessary factors in reaching a decision on dispensing with agreement and freeing for adoption.   This again appears to me to be elevating a matter of evidence into a matter of law.  It is for the judge to have regard to the availability of contact in coming to his decision, but so long as he has evidence on which he can properly make his decision and he has not misdirected himself or been in error in respect of other factors to which he should have regard, his decision will be sustainable unless he is "plainly wrong".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;68.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, however, legitimate to argue, as the appellants also did, that the facts of the case pointed so clearly to the need for ascertaining the availability of post-adoption contact that the judge's decision was plainly wrong.  They also submitted, as I have said, that the judge substituted his own view and failed to ascertain whether the appellants' veto came within the band of possible reasonable decisions.  In order to assess these arguments it is necessary to examine the authorities on withholding agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;69.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the judge and the Court of Appeal cited the relevant statements giving guidance to courts in deciding the very difficult and anxious question whether a parent is unreasonably withholding agreement to the adoption of a child.  The starting point is the speech of Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone LC in <i>In re W (An Infant) </i>[1971] AC 682, in which he dispelled the then prevalent idea that there had necessarily to be an element in unreasonableness.  He stated categorically, at p 699:</p>
<p></p><ul>"… the test is reasonableness and not anything else.  It is not culpability.  It is not indifference.  It is not failure to discharge parental duties.  It is reasonableness, and reasonableness in the context of the totality of the circumstances.  But, although welfare <i>per se </i>is not the test, the fact that a reasonable parent does pay regard to the welfare of his child must enter into the question of reasonableness as a relevant factor.  It is relevant in all cases if and to the extent that a reasonable parent would take it into account.  It is decisive in those cases where a reasonable parent must so regard it."<p></p></ul>
<p>The mere fact that the proposed adoption would conduce to the welfare of the child is not of itself sufficient to establish unreasonableness on the part of the parent.  Nevertheless, as Lord Denning MR said in <i>In re L (An Infant) </i>(1962) 106 SJ 611:</p>
<p></p><ul>"A reasonable mother surely gives great weight to what is better for the child.  Her anguish of mind is quite understandable; but still it may be unreasonable for her to withhold consent. We must look and see whether it is reasonable or unreasonable according to what a reasonable woman in her place would do in all the circumstances of the case."<p></p></ul>
<p>There may be an amalgam of factors, possibly conflicting, which will vary from case to case and cannot profitably be placed in prescribed categories.  In <i>In re D (An Infant) (Adoption: Parent's Consent) </i>[1977] AC 602, 625 Lord Wilberforce said, in the context of a father's withholding agreement to his child's adoption by the mother and stepfather:</p>
<p></p><ul>"What, in my understanding, is required is for the court to ask whether the decision, actually made by the father in his individual circumstances, is, by an objective standard, reasonable or unreasonable.  This involves considering how a father in the circumstances of the actual father, but (hypothetically) endowed with a mind and temperament capable of making reasonable decisions, would approach a complex question involving a judgment as to the present and as to the future and the probable impact of these upon a child."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70.&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulty facing a court is obvious: it has to apply an objective standard of reasonableness, looking at the circumstances of the actual parent, but supposing this person to be endowed with a mind and temperament capable of making reasonable decisions.  It was this difficulty which moved Steyn and Hoffmann LJJ to say, in their joint judgment in <i>In re C (A Minor) (Adoption: Parental Agreement: Contact) </i>[1993] 2 FLR 260, 272:</p>
<p></p><ul>"…making the freeing order, the judge had to decide that the mother was 'withholding her agreement unreasonably'. This question had to be answered according to an objective standard. In other words, it required the judge to assume that the mother was not, as she in fact was, a person of limited intelligence and inadequate grasp of the emotional and other needs of a lively little girl of 4. Instead she had to be assumed to be a woman with a full perception of her own deficiencies and an ability to evaluate dispassionately the evidence and opinions of the experts. She was also to be endowed with the intelligence and altruism needed to appreciate, if such were the case, that her child's welfare would be so much better served by adoption that her own maternal feelings should take second place.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Such a paragon does not of course exist: she shares with the 'reasonable man' the quality of being, as Lord Radcliffe once said, an 'anthropomorphic conception of justice'. The law conjures the imaginary parent into existence to give expression to what it considers that justice requires as between the welfare of the child as perceived by the judge on the one hand and the legitimate views and interests of the natural parents on the other. The characteristics of the notional reasonable parent have been expounded on many occasions: see for example Lord Wilberforce in <i>In re D (Adoption: Parent's Consent)</i> [1977] AC 602, 625 ('endowed with a mind and temperament capable of making reasonable decisions'). The views of such a parent will not necessarily coincide with the judge's views as to what the child's welfare requires. As Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone LC said in <i>In re W (An Infant)</i> [1971] AC 682, 700:<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>'Two reasonable parents can perfectly reasonably come to opposite conclusions on the same set of facts without forfeiting their title to be regarded as reasonable.'<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Furthermore, although the reasonable parent will give great weight to the welfare of the child, there are other interests of herself and her family which she may legitimately take into account. All this is well settled by authority. Nevertheless, for those who feel some embarrassment at having to consult the views of so improbable a legal fiction, we venture to observe that precisely the same question may be raised in a demythologised form by the judge asking himself whether, having regard to the evidence and applying the current values of our society, the advantages of adoption for the welfare of the child appear sufficiently strong to justify overriding the views and interests of the objecting parent or parents. The reasonable parent is only a piece of machinery invented to provide the answer to this question."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;71.&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge addressed these issues, having referred to Lord Hailsham's speech in <i>In re W (An Infant) </i>and the judgment of Steyn and Hoffmann LJJ in <i>In re C (A Minor), </i>and articulated his approach to them in the opening passage of paragraph 21 of his judgment:</p>
<p></p><ul>"I recognise that the reasonableness of the parents' refusal to consent must be judged at the time of the hearing and I am doing that.  I have taken into account all the circumstances of the case.  I have recognised that whilst the welfare of the child must be taken into account it is not the sole or necessary paramount criterion.  I have applied an objective test in the case of each parent.  I have recognised that the test is reasonableness and nothing else.  I have been wary not to substitute my own view for that of the reasonable parent.  I recognise that there is a band of reasonable decisions each of which may be reasonable in any given case."<p></p></ul>
<p>He then went on to set out at length his reasons for reaching the conclusion that the parents' agreement should be dispensed with, even if no adopters could be found who were willing to accept post-adoption contact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholson LJ in the Court of Appeal adverted in paragraph 10 of his judgment to the "generous ambit within which judicial disagreement was reasonably possible" in this type of case.  He cited the approval given by the House of Lords in the custody case of <i>G v G </i>[1985] 1 WLR 647, 650 to the statement of Sir John Arnold P in the Court of Appeal (1984) 6 FLR 70, 73:</p>
<p></p><ul>"I believe that if the court comes to the conclusion, when examining the decision at first instance, that there is so blatant an error in the conclusion that it could only have been reached if the judge below had erred in his method of decision - sometimes called the balancing exercise - then the court is at liberty to interfere; but that, if the observation of the appellate court extends no further than that the decision in terms of the result of the balancing exercise was one with which, they might, or do, disagree as a matter of result, then that by itself is not enough, and that falls short of the conclusion, which is essential, that the judge has erred in his method."<p></p></ul>
<p>The judge's decision has to be "plainly wrong" or to have taken into account incorrect factors, before an appellate tribunal should interfere.  The majority in the Court of Appeal, applying these principles, concluded that the judge was entitled to decide the case as he did and that there was no ground on which his decision should be upset.  In my opinion they were correct in their conclusion.  The judge outlined for himself in the passages which I have quoted the considerations which he should follow and gave himself a reminder that he should not substitute his own view for that of the parents.  On a fair reading of his very careful judgment I do not consider that he failed to observe his own cautionary reminder.  He took quite a strong line in coming to and expressing his conclusions, but in my view these were properly inside the bounds within which his determination must be allowed to prevail.  There was considerable evidence before him of the risks that H might relapse and of the unhappy consequences which that would have for N if she were living with her.  It was a matter of judgment whether these circumstances were such that the hypothetical reasonable parents would give their agreement to adoption.  The majority of the Court of Appeal were of the opinion that it was a finely balanced judgment, but that the judge's decision should nevertheless stand, and in that I think that they were right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73.&nbsp;&nbsp;I accordingly consider that the appellants' arguments, in their several forms, cannot be sustained and that the judge's decision should be upheld.  I would only add a word of caution on the way in which the question of contact should be handled both before and after adoption.  The hope expressed by the judge in paragraph 23 of his judgment that N should have the benefit of continued contact with her parents now appears likely to be fulfilled.  I would, however, underline the warning which he gave that the birth parents' attitude and behaviour will require to be carefully monitored for some time.  They have so far been adamantly opposed to adoption, and if an adoption order is in due course made they will have to make what will undoubtedly be a painful and unwelcome adjustment.  It is in my view essential for the future well-being of their child N that they should then do nothing to undermine the success of the adoption or reduce the prospects of the child's settling successfully into a new and stable life.  It will require a degree of generosity of spirit, in the interests of N's welfare, which will ask a great deal of them as parents, and I earnestly hope that they will be able to play a constructive part in her future.  That will clearly require support and effective counselling from the Trust, which must necessarily keep a careful and thorough watch on the progress of contact, to ensure that it fulfils the purpose which it should and that it does not detract from the stability and success of the adoption.  In that respect I wholly agree with the observations of my noble and learned friend Baroness Hale of Richmond in the concluding sentences of her opinion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would dismiss the appeals.</p>
