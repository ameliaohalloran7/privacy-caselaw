<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107. The grounds which the Commission gave for contesting the Director's application were as follows:</p>
<p></p><ul>"4.&nbsp;&nbsp;In each of these cases, the Commission determined, having regard to argument not previously raised concerning the coming into force of the Human Rights Act 1998 and the fairness of the trial, that there was a real possibility that the Court of Appeal would not uphold the convictions.  The Commission decided to refer the convictions under section 9 of the Act and, in accordance with section 14(4) of the Act, Statements of Reasons by the Commission were given to the Court and to the parties. <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"15.&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . In the case of Mr Lyons and others, the Commission concluded - and it is not challenged by the Claimant - that there is a real possibility that the Court of Appeal would find their convictions unsafe because their right to a fair trial had been undermined by the admission of evidence obtained under compulsion.  The Commission decided not to exercise its discretion not to refer.  Indeed, the Commission submits that to have gone on to conclude in such circumstances that the Commission should not refer the convictions - on the ground that no substantial injustice had occurred - would itself have been irrational and open to challenge.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"16.&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of the Claimant's argument is that, while there is a real possibility that there has been a breach of the applicants' human rights so as to affect the safety of their convictions, there has been no concomitant substantial injustice which justifies the Commission referring their case to the Court.  This is an argument that can neither be sustained in law nor common sense."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108. It would not be appropriate for me to express a concluded opinion on the validity of the reasons given by the Commission, but I consider that they show the serious obstacles to an argument that, if section 22(4) applies to appeals, the Commission should not exercise its discretion to refer a conviction to the Court of Appeal where there has been or may have been a breach of a Convention right in the obtaining of a conviction a considerable number of years before the Human Rights Act came into operation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109. In my opinion Parliament did intend that valid convictions should not be quashed years later by the Court of Appeal, but it gave effect to this intention, not by leaving it to the uncertain exercise of the discretion of the Court of Appeal or the Criminal Cases Review Commission to filter out appeals in respect of old convictions, but by wording section 22(4) so that it applied to proceedings at first instance and not to appeals.  Accordingly, for the reasons which I have given, I consider that the decision of the majority in <i>Lambert</i> was correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110. I would add that if I had considered after the further argument in the present appeal that, on balance, the decision in <i>Lambert </i>was erroneous, I would nevertheless have been of the opinion that the decision should be followed.  In <i>Fitzleet Estates v Cherry</i> [1977]  1 WLR 1345, 1349.   Lord Wilberforce stated:</p>
<p></p><ul>"There is therefore nothing left to the appellant but to contend— as he frankly does— that the 1965 decision is wrong.  This contention means, when interpreted, that three or more of your Lordships ought to take the view which appealed then to the minority.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>My Lords, in my firm opinion, the Practice Statement of 1966 was never intended to allow and should not be considered to allow such a course.  Nothing could be more undesirable, in fact, than to permit litigants, after a decision has been given by this House with all appearance of finality, to return to this House in the hope that a differently constituted committee might be persuaded to take the view which its predecessors rejected.  True that the earlier decision was by majority:  I say nothing as to its correctness or as to the validity of the reasoning by which it was supported.  That there were two eminently possible views is shown by the support for each by at any rate two members of the House.  But doubtful issues have to be resolved and the law knows no better way of resolving them than by the considered majority opinion of the ultimate tribunal.  It requires much more than doubts as to the correctness of such opinion to justify departing from it."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111. In my opinion the view of the majority in <i>Lambert</i> was an eminently possible one and should be followed for the reason stated by Lord Wilberforce.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112. Accordingly I would answer the certified question in the negative and would allow the appeal by the Crown and would set aside the order of the Court of Appeal and restore the conviction of the respondent. </p>
