<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;69.&nbsp;&nbsp;What then of the evidence?  Mr Thomason said in his witness statement that he learned of Hoechst's<i> </i>challenge to the ACT rules in around July 1995.  Whilst he monitored developments, it was not clear what the outcome would be.  His position was that at all times prior to the determination of the European Court in the <i>Hoechst </i>case the law was to be found in the UK statute.  In para 45 he said that, so far as he was concerned, there were no good grounds prior to the date when the European court delivered its judgment for doubting the validity of the statutory payments requiring payment of ACT.  In cross-examination he said that he did not feeling anything near certainty that Hoechst's challenge would succeed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70.&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be said that there was enough in Hoechst's challenge to raise a doubt in Mr Thomason's mind as to whether or not the law with which he was faced would survive it.  But the situation with which he was faced is quite different from that where a payer who is in a state of doubt about the state of the law in a private transaction decides to pay nevertheless and take the risk that he may be wrong.  In such a case the causative link between the mistake and the payment may be broken because the evidence shows that the payer was content to pay irrespective of whether the sum is due or not.  In this case DMG was in no position to do anything else but pay the ACT.  It had not claimed group income relief because, wrongly as it turned out, it believed that group income relief was not available.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;71.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is plain, as the judge recognised, that if DMG had submitted a claim for group income relief under section 247(1) the Revenue would have pointed to the clear terms of the statute and rejected it.   It has never been suggested that they would have conceded in a question with DMG the point which they were resisting so strongly in their litigation with Hoechst.  DMG's mistaken belief that a group income election was not available was not shown to be wrong until the issue which Hoechst had raised was determined by the European Court on 8 March 2001. The issue, which was one of law, was not capable of being resolved except by litigation. Until the determination was made the mistake could not have been "discovered" in the sense referred to in section 32(1) of the 1980 Act. In this situation I would hold, in agreement with Park J and Jonathan Parker LJ, that DMG was not in a state of doubt, when it paid the ACT. It was not then obvious that the payments might not be due. They were made in accordance with the law as it was then understood to be. There was nothing yet to be discovered to the contrary which could have been revealed by the exercise of reasonable diligence.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons and those given by Lord Hoffmann and Lord Walker, with which I agree, I would allow the appeal and make the order that Lord Walker proposes.</p>
<p><b>LORD SCOTT OF FOSCOTE</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73.&nbsp;&nbsp;This appeal is another, but assuredly not the last, of the appeals to your Lordships' House in the litigation that has arisen as a result of the judgment of the European Court of Justice (the "ECJ"), given on 8 March 2001, in the <i>Metallgesellschaft Ltd</i> and <i>Hoechst AG</i> conjoined cases, but which I will, for convenience refer to as the "<i>Hoechst</i> case", reported in [2001] Ch 620.  The ECJ held, first, that it was contrary to Article 52 of the Treaty (now Article 43 EC) for the tax legislation of the United Kingdom to establish a tax regime under which group income elections (enabling dividends to be paid by UK subsidiaries to their parent companies without incurring an obligation to pay advance corporation tax) could be made only where the parent company was resident in the UK, and, accordingly, which denied the possibility of benefiting from a group income election where the parent company had its seat in another Member State. Secondly, the ECJ held that where a UK subsidiary had been obliged to pay ACT in respect of dividends paid to its parent company with a seat in another Member State, even though UK subsidiaries with parent companies resident in the UK were entitled in similar circumstances to make group income elections and thereby avoid that obligation, European law (i.e. Article 43 EC) required that the subsidiary and its non-resident parent </p>
<p></p><ul>"should have an effective legal remedy in order to obtain reimbursement or reparation of the financial loss which they have sustained and from which the authorities of the [UK] have benefited as a result of the advance payment of tax by the [UK subsidiary]" (ruling 2).<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74.&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue in this particular appeal is whether and, if so, how section 32 (1) (c) of the Limitation Act 1980 applies to the cause (or causes) of action on which the appellant company ("DMG") is suing the Revenue. The factual background to DMG's action and the manner in which the action was dealt with in the courts below is comprehensively set out in the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe. I have had the great advantage of reading his opinion in draft and gratefully adopt and need not repeat all that he has said. But as I have the misfortune to differ from him, and a majority of your Lordships, as to the right conclusion to be reached in this appeal I must refer to some of the background in order to explain the reasons for my dissent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75.&nbsp;&nbsp;In paragraph 117 of his opinion Lord Walker has helpfully summarised six issues in dispute between the parties. The issues which have led to my dissent are those Lord Walker has numbered (2) and (5). Issue (2) asks the question whether DMG made its payments of ACT under a mistake of law. Issue (5) asks whether DMG can bring its cause of action within section 32 (1) (c) of the 1980 Act. As to issue (5) I would respectfully venture an amendment to Lord Walker's description of the issue. Lord Walker has suggested that issue (5) arises if DMG fails on issue (1), that is to say, fails to satisfy your Lordships that English law recognises a restitutionary claim for tax paid under a mistake of law. I agree that issue (5) arises in that event, but it would arise also if DMG were to succeed on issue (1) but fail on issue (2). If that were to be the case DMG's cause of action could not be a restitutionary claim for tax paid under a mistake of law (the recognition of which by English law could not therefore assist DMG) but would have to be either a compensation claim or, perhaps, a claim based upon unjust enrichment, the Revenue having obtained payment of an amount of corporation tax earlier than would have happened if the group of which DMG formed part had been able to make a group income election. Whichever way the claim were put the question would arise whether DMG's action could be described, for section 32 (1) (c) purposes, as an "action for relief from the consequences of a mistake".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, these issues, and the identification of the nature of DMG's action against the Revenue, require, in my opinion, as an essential preliminary, a careful analysis of the ECJ judgment in order to be clear as to what it was about the UK tax regime that was ruled to be a breach of European law. Park J said that</p>
<p></p><ul>"the mistake of law which DMG made was not that it paid ACT which was not payable: the ACT was as a matter of law payable when DMG paid it, and the decision of the [ECJ] in <i>Metallgesellschaft/Hoechst </i>does not mean that it was not payable" (para 22).<i> <p></p></i></ul><i>
</i>
<p>But, in the Court of Appeal, Jonathan Parker LJ disagreed. He said, at para 231</p>
<p></p><ul>" … the Court of Justice, at para 76, held that the relevant statutory regime was contrary to article 52, and consequently unlawful under Community law. It follows that although <i>under the terms of that regime</i> ACT was due and payable, 'the true state of the law' (to use the judge's expression) was that the regime gave rise to no obligation to pay. Thus the payments were made pursuant to an unlawful demand."<p></p></ul>
<p>If the Lord Justice's analysis of the <i>Hoechst</i> judgment is correct, it must follow that his conclusion that DMG was under no legal obligation to pay ACT too is correct. The critical question is whether that conclusion is correct.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hoechst judgment </p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77.&nbsp;&nbsp;The unlawfulness found by the ECJ in the UK's ACT tax regime was the unjustified discrimination against corporate groups the parent companies of which were resident in Member States other than the UK. The discrimination consisted of withholding from those corporate groups the option of making group income elections and thereby avoiding the obligation of a UK resident subsidiary of paying ACT to the Revenue when paying dividends to its non-resident parent company. This discrimination was held to be incompatible with Article 52 because it would tend to discourage companies resident in other Member States from establishing subsidiaries in the UK. It thus constituted an unlawful restriction on the freedom of establishment guaranteed by Article 52 (see para 36 of the ECJ judgment). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ECJ was answering two questions which had been referred to it by the Chancery Division of the High Court. The first was whether it was consistent with Community law</p>
<p></p><ul>"for the legislation of [the UK] to permit a group income election …. only where both the subsidiary and parent are resident in [the UK]" (para 33(1)).<p></p></ul>
<p>The ECJ gave to this question the answer "no". It did so because</p>
<p></p><ul>"The abolition [by Article 52] of restrictions on freedom of establishment also applies to restrictions on the setting up of … subsidiaries by nationals of any Member State established in the territory of another Member State" (para 41)<p></p></ul>
<p>At paragraph 54 the ECJ explained that</p>
<p></p><ul>"to afford resident subsidiaries of non-resident companies the possibility of making a group income election would do no more than allow them to retain the sums which would otherwise be payable by way of [ACT] until such time as Mainstream Corporation Tax [MCT] falls due. They would thus enjoy the same cashflow advantage as resident subsidiaries of resident parent companies…."<p></p></ul>
<p>And, at paragraph 55, that</p>
<p></p><ul>" … the fact that a non-resident parent company will, unlike a resident parent company, not be subject to [ACT] when it in turn pays out dividends, cannot justify denying the resident subsidiary of the non-resident parent the possibility of exemption from payment of [ACT] when paying dividends to the parent."<p></p></ul>
<p>And, in paragraph 76, the ECJ answered the first question by declaring that it was </p>
<p></p><ul>" … contrary to Article 52 of the Treaty for the tax legislation of [the UK] … to afford companies resident in [the UK] the possibility of benefiting from a taxation regime allowing them to pay dividends to their parent company without having to pay [ACT] where their parent company is also resident in [the UK], but to deny them that possibility where their parent company has its seat in another Member State."<p></p></ul>
<p>The reference by the ECJ in each cited passage to "the possibility" of making a group income election, a "possibility" that the tax regime denied to corporate groups with a non-resident parent company, identifies the element in the tax regime that the ECJ found to be inconsistent with European law. The ECJ did not hold that subjecting resident subsidiaries of non-resident companies to the obligation of paying ACT was contrary to European law. What was unlawful was the discriminatory nature of the group income election provisions which failed to give corporate groups with a non-resident parent company the same possibility of enabling resident subsidiaries to avoid the payment of ACT as was open to corporate groups with a resident parent company. The question is what effect this unlawful feature of the ACT tax regime should be held to have had on the obligation of subsidiaries, such as DMG, to pay ACT in respect of dividends paid to their non-resident parent companies. This is a question to which I must return.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question for the ECJ to answer concerned remedies. The Chancery Division had asked, if the answer to the first question was 'no', about the remedies which national courts should grant. In paragraph 77 of its judgment the ECJ explained the question. Was the subsidiary and/or its parent company</p>
<p></p><ul>" … entitled to obtain a sum equal to the interest accrued on the advance payments made by the subsidiary from the date of those payments until the date on which the tax became chargeable [i.e. until MCT became payable], even when national law prohibits the payment of interest on a principal sum which is not due."<p></p></ul>
<p>The ECJ recorded that the Chancery Division had framed that question in two hypotheses -</p>
<p></p><ul>" … in the first alternative, where the claim by the subsidiary and/or parent company is made in an action for restitution of taxes levied in breach of Community law and, in the second, where the claim is made in an action for compensation for damage resulting from the breach of Community law."<p></p></ul>
<p>In paragraph 81, however, the ECJ stressed that it was not for the ECJ but for the parties and the national law of the forum to specify the nature and basis of the remedy or remedies being sought. Community law required no more than that</p>
<p></p><ul>" … resident subsidiaries and their non-resident parent companies should have an effective legal remedy in order to obtain reimbursement or reparation of the financial loss which they have sustained and from which the authorities of the Member State concerned have benefited as a result of the advance payment of tax by the subsidiaries" (para 96)<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>Hoechst</i> judgment contains passages which cast light upon the nature of the breach of Community law for which the appropriate remedy must be provided. Thus:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is important to bear in mind in this regard that what is contrary to Community law … is not the levying of a tax in the United Kingdom on the payment of dividends by a subsidiary to its parent company but the fact that subsidiaries, resident in the United Kingdom, of parent companies having their seat in another Member State were required to pay that tax in advance whereas resident subsidiaries of resident parent companies were able to avoid that requirement" (para 83);<p></p></ul>
<p>and, to the same effect,</p>
<p></p><ul>" … the breach of Community law arises, not from the payment of the tax itself but from its being levied prematurely" (para 87);<p></p></ul>
<p>and</p>
<p></p><ul>" … the principal sum due is none other than the amount of interest which would have been generated by the sum, use of which was lost as a result of the premature levy of the tax" (para 88)<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81.&nbsp;&nbsp;These passages show that the breach of Community law was the failure of the UK's ACT tax regime to provide for corporate groups with a parent company resident in a Member State other than the UK the same opportunity of postponing the payment of corporation tax by making a group income election as was available to domestic corporate groups.  Does it follow that section 14 (1) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (originally section 84 (1) of the Finance Act 1972), which imposed the obligation on UK companies to pay ACT in respect of dividends paid to their shareholders, was unlawful, or, to put the question another way, imposed an unlawful tax? In my opinion, it does not. The effect of the ECJ judgment in the <i>Hoechst</i> case on the validity of the section 14 (1) charge to tax is a matter for the domestic courts of the UK.  (See <i>Thoburn v. Sunderland City Council</i> [2002] EWHC 195 (Admin); [2003] QB 151 paras 68 and 69) If, under domestic law, the right conclusion is that section 14 (1) imposed an unlawful tax, then it would follow that every demand for ACT had been an ultra vires demand, that every payment of ACT had been paid under a mistake of law and that every payer of ACT should be entitled, subject to limitation defences, to a restitutionary remedy. There must be many domestic corporate groups which, for one reason or another, did not make a group income election and whose subsidiaries accordingly paid ACT in respect of dividends paid to their corporate shareholders. If ACT was an unlawful tax, the tax would have been paid under a mistake of law and, in any event, would be recoverable under the principle established in the <i>Woolwich </i>case [1993] AC 70. This would be a remarkable state of affairs. There is nothing, however, in the ECJ's <i>Hoechst</i> judgment that requires this conclusion and no reason at all why the domestic courts should reach it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, the proposition that the <i>Hoechst</i> judgment requires the conclusion that section 14 (1) imposed an unlawful tax cannot be sustained. The unlawfulness of the tax regime identified by the ECJ lies not with the imposition of ACT but in the discriminatory nature of the group income election provisions. So how should the domestic law deal with that unlawfulness? It would clearly be an inappropriate response for the domestic courts to hold that the benefits afforded by the group income election provisions to domestic corporate groups were unlawful and ultra vires. Nor was that suggested by the ECJ. The simple answer is that the UK courts must provide a remedy to the non-domestic corporate groups for the failure of the statutory provisions to extend the same benefits to them. The ECJ made it clear that it was no concern of Community law how, as a matter of domestic law, that remedy was to be categorised provided the remedy was an adequate and sufficient one (para 96). However the remedy cannot, in my opinion, be based on the premise that the payments of ACT were a response to unlawful demands or were payments of an unlawful tax or were payments that were not due. None of these premises is required to be made by the ECJ's judgment in the <i>Hoechst</i> case and none should be constructed by UK domestic law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first issue referred to by Lord Walker, the issue to which more time was devoted by counsel than to all the other issues combined, was whether English law recognised a restitutionary claim for tax paid under a mistake of law. On this issue I am in full agreement with, and there is nothing I wish to add to, the opinions given by my noble and learned friends. I agree that the effect of the speeches in this House in the <i>Woolwich</i> case [1993] AC 70 is that tax paid in response to an unlawful demand can be recovered by the taxpayer regardless of compulsion and regardless of whether the taxpayer made the payment in consequence of a mistake; and I agree that the effect of the speeches in the <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> case [1999] 2 AC 349 was that the rule barring a restitutionary remedy for money paid, or property transferred, under a mistake of law was overturned. Accordingly, I agree that the answer to issue (1) is that English law does now recognise a restitutionary remedy for tax paid under a mistake of law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the answer to issue (1) does not mean that money paid, or property transferred, under a mistake of law is <i>necessarily</i> recoverable, just as money paid, or property transferred, under a mistake of fact is not <i>necessarily </i>recoverable. It surely all depends on the part played by the mistake, whether of fact or law, in the sequence of events that has led to the payment or transfer. If A and B enter into a contract with one another for the sale by A to B of a horse and B pays the price and takes delivery of the horse, B cannot, absent some causative misrepresentation on A's part, claim his money back, proffering the horse in return, on the ground that he was mistaken as to the horse's breeding. The money once paid would be irrecoverable unless there were some ground for invalidating the contract. It cannot be enough for the buyer to assert and prove that but for his mistake about the horse's breeding he would not have entered into the contract and so would not have paid the money. In <i>Barclays Bank Ltd v. W J Simms Son &amp; Cooke (Southern) Ltd</i> [1980] QB 677 at 695 Robert Goff J (as he then was) said that</p>
<p></p><ul>"if a person pays money to another under a mistake of fact <i>which causes him to make the payment</i>, he is prima facie entitled to recover it as money paid under a mistake of fact" (emphasis added).<p></p></ul>
<p>He then described three types of circumstance which might lead to the claim failing. The first of these was that the payor intended the payee to have the money in any event, whether the believed fact was true or false. The second was that </p>
<p></p><ul>" … the payment is made for good consideration, in particular if the money is paid to discharge, and does discharge, a debt owed to the payee … by the payer or by a third party by whom he is authorised to discharge the debt…"<p></p></ul>
<p>The third was that the payee had changed his position in good faith. There is, I would respectfully suggest, a fundamental difference between the first and the third of these types of circumstances on the one hand and the second of them on the other. The first and third involve circumstances which have had no causative effect on the payment of the money. In the first, the money would have been paid in any event and the third involves circumstances which have nothing at all to do with the reasons why the payer paid the money or with any misapprehensions under which the payer may have been labouring. Neither of these types of case invalidates Robert Goff J's general proposition that if a mistake of fact causes a payment to be made that would not have been paid but for the mistake, the payer will have a cause of action for its recovery. They are not true exceptions. The second, however, does invalidate that proposition. If a contract has been entered into that would not have been entered into but for a mistake, but the contract is then completed by a payment of the price for the goods or services that the payee has supplied, the payment cannot be recovered unless the contract can be set aside. The proposition seems such an obviously correct one that it may seem pointless to ask why it is that it is correct. But I think the question does need to be asked for the answer casts, in my opinion, valuable light on the nature of the restitutionary remedy for the recovery of money paid under a mistake. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85.&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason, it seems to me, why the proposition is correct is that the mistake does not necessarily undermine the legal obligation which required the payment of the money or for the discharge of which the money was paid. If the mistake does enable the contract to be set aside then, subject to a change of position defence, the money should be recoverable. If the contract was void from the outset (as in the "swaps" cases) or had been avoided before the payment was made, the money should be recoverable. But if the legal obligation under which the money was paid cannot be, or has not been, invalidated, then, in my opinion, whether or not it can be shown that "but for" the mistake in question the money would not have been paid, a restitutionary remedy for the recovery of the money would not be available. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86.&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach to the recovery of money paid under a mistake should, in my opinion, apply whether the mistake be of fact or of law. In the <i>Woolwich</i> case [1993] AC 70 the tax paid by the <i>Woolwich</i> was recoverable because it had been paid on account of a non-existent legal obligation. In the <i>Kleinwort Benson </i>[1999] 2 AC 349 case the payments of which recovery was sought by the bank had been paid under contracts that were void ab initio. In neither case could it have been suggested that the payments had been made with any animus donandi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, I think, some problems about voluntary payments made as gifts but that would not have been made but for some causative mistake, whether of fact or law, e.g. a gift of £1000 by A to B where B is believed by A to be impecunious but is in fact a person of substantial wealth and where A would not have made the gift if he had known that to be so. My present opinion is that unless there were some other reason, such as a misrepresentation by B, to enable the gift to be set aside, the mistake made by A would not suffice, notwithstanding that the payment had not been made pursuant  to any legal obligation and that but for the mistake it would not have been made. But the availability of a restitutionary remedy to recover gifts which would not have been made but for some mistake of fact or of law does not need to be pursued on this appeal and can be left for another day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion the important question for the purposes of this appeal is whether the payments by DMG of the ACT were made in discharge of a legal obligation to pay. Park J thought they were. Jonathan Parker LJ thought not. For the reasons I have already expressed I agree with Park J. The mistake made by DMG and its parent company in Germany was in not realising that the failure of the ACT tax regime to allow the group to make a group income election was unlawful and could successfully have been challenged. If the group had purported to make a group income election the Revenue would certainly have rejected it. That rejection we now know, post <i>Hoechst</i>, would have been unlawful under Community law but even so, in my opinion, the lawfulness of section 14 (1) would not have been undermined. What might, perhaps, have been undermined would have been the Revenue's ability to recover the ACT in an action against DMG since any claim for payment might have been met by an equitable set-off or cross claim based upon the Revenue's breach of Community law in rejecting the group income election.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the events that actually happened DMG paid the ACT that was due under section 14 (1). DMG and its German parent company did make a mistake of law in that they did not realise that they could successfully challenge the failure of the ACT tax regime to allow them, too, to make a group income election. It is possible to argue that this mistake of law was, in a "but for" sense, a cause of their payment of the ACT. The argument has difficulties but even if it were right it would not, in my opinion, justify the conclusion that the ACT was paid under a mistake of law in the sense necessary for a restitutionary remedy. The ACT was paid because there was a legal obligation under a valid statutory provision for the money to be paid. DMG's remedy was, in my opinion, not a restitutionary one for the re-payment of money paid that was not due, or for the repayment of money paid under a mistake, but was, and is, a claim for compensation to recover the loss caused by the breach of Community law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before leaving the important issue of whether, in the light of <i>Hoechst</i>, DMG was under a legal obligation to pay the ACT, I should record the assistance I have had from the article "Justified Enrichment" by Robert Stevens (2005) 5 OUCLJ 141 and in particular from the section entitled "Was the Money Due". I am in respectful agreement with the conclusions there expressed. </p>
