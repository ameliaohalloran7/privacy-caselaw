<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88. These authorities might be thought to be conclusive in favour of BP.  They confirm the natural meaning of 'owner' as being the registered owner.  The liability is a liability which arises <i>ex dominio</i> and not from any conception of responsibility in tort or delict.  They recognise that to make the registered owner liable when he was in no way at fault may be harsh but point out that the liability is strict and not based on fault and that where another has been at fault s.76 gives the owner a right of recovery over.  The primary purpose is to give the undertaker a simple and direct method of recovering his expenditure without having to investigate or prove who was in possession of the vessel and actually responsible for the navigation of the vessel at the material time.  The registered ownership is easy of ascertainment and, indeed, it is the scheme of the Act that the master of the vessel is under an obligation when called upon to do so to produce the certificate of registry of the vessel.  (s.36)  It can be added that the present case provides an excellent illustration of the wisdom of this approach.  The argument of the defenders is that it is essential before the liability under s.74 can be enforced to investigate and prove who was in fact at the material time in possession of this vessel.  This argument is contradicted by the speeches in each of the three leading House of Lords decisions on s.74.  It is to be noted also that the speeches in these cases take into account the position where there is a compulsory pilot and the proviso to s.74 and conclude that they support the conclusion they arrive at.  Further, the provisions for the detention and sale of the vessel also support the conclusion that the relevant criterion is ownership not control. </p>
<i><p>The Defenders' Arguments:</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89. Before turning to the authorities upon which the defenders particularly rely, it is helpful to refer to two authorities which assist the understanding of the relevance of the existence of a demise charter to remedies <i>in rem</i> and <i>in personam</i>.  The first is <i>The Father Thames</i> [1979]  2 Lloyd's Rep 364.  The question was whether the negligent navigation of a demise chartered vessel gave the owner of the damaged property a maritime lien against the ship.  Sheen J, following two 19th century authorities, <i>The Ticonderoga</i> (1858) Sw 215 and <i>The Lemington</i> (1874) 2 Asp MLC 475, held that it did.  The argument unsuccessfully advanced by the defendant shipowner in that case used the same reasoning as that of the defenders in the present case: the liability in tort is a liability for the acts and omissions of the master and crew; where the vessel has been demise chartered, it is the charterer who is the employer of the crew and it is only he who should be liable, not the owner through the arrest of his ship.  The scheme of admiralty law reflected by these authorities is that, where the actual owner has voluntarily put the vessel in the possession of another, the owner must accept that the vessel and, indirectly, himself will be under a liability for the consequences of the navigation of the vessel even though those navigating the vessel may not be his servants.  Where the liability is strict and not fault based, the same conclusion follows with even greater force.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90. The second case is <i>The I Congreso del Partido</i> [1978]  QB 500, Robert Goff J.  There were a number of points.  The relevant one was the scope of the admiralty jurisdiction under s.3(4) of the Administration of Justice Act 1956 (the predecessor of the Supreme Court Act 1981) .  Robert Goff J refused to construe the Act so as to include a demise chartered vessel within the expression "beneficially owned as respects all the shares therein" saying (p.538-9),</p>
<p></p><ul>"I do not consider them apt to apply to apply to the case of a demise charterer or indeed any other person who has only possession of the ship, however full and complete such possession may be, and however much control over the ship he may have.<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally speaking, the essential characteristic of a demise charter is that it constitutes a contract of hire of the ship, under which the possession of the ship passes to the charterer, the master of the ship being the servant of the charterer, not of the owner.  It is to be compared with the ordinary form of time charter, which is not a contract of hire but a contract of services, under which the possession remains in the owner and the master is the servant of the owner:  see <i>Sea and Land Securities Ltd v William Dickinson &amp; Co Ltd </i>[1942]<i>  </i>2<i> </i>KB 65, 69-70,<i> per </i>Mackinnon LJ, and <i>Scrutton on Charterparties, 18th ed.</i> (1974), articles 24-26.  It is true that a demise charterer has in the past been described variously as "owner pro hac vice:"  see, for example, <i>Frazer v Marsh</i> (1811)  13 East 238, 239, per Lord Ellenbrough CJ, <i>The Lemington</i> (1874)  2 Asp MLC 475, 478, per Sir Robert Phillimore, and <i>The Tasmania</i> (1888)  13 PD 110, 118, <i>per</i> Sir James Hannen P.; or as a person who is "for the time the owner of the vessel": see <i>Sandeman v Scurr</i> (1866)  LR 2 QB 86, 96, <i>per</i> Cockburn CJ; or as a person with "special and temporary ownership:" see <i>The Hopper No 66</i> [1908]  AC 126, 136, <i>per </i>Lord Atkinson.  I doubt however if such language is much in use today; and its use should not be allowed to disguise the true legal nature of a demise charter."</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  "&nbsp;&nbsp;A demise charterer has, within limits defined by contract, the beneficial use of the ship; he does not have the beneficial ownership as respects all the shares in the ship."
<p>The importance of this judgment for present purposes is that it demonstrates the limits of basing arguments upon the use of the expression "owner <i>pro hac vice</i>" and recognises that if modern legislation is intended to use the word "owner" as meaning demise charterer it is likely to say so expressly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91. The authorities relied upon by the defenders in support of the argument that the liability of the "owner" under s.74 should be read as meaning demise charterer where the vessel is at the time demise chartered do support the submission that the employer of the master and crew will then be the demise charterer not the registered owner.  The vicarious liability <i>in personam</i> for their torts lies with their employer: <i>Fenton v Dublin SS Co</i> (1838)  8 A &amp; E 835.  It will be remembered that this was one of the points referred to by Lord Blackburn in <i>Adamson</i> as supporting the view that s.74 provided a remedy against the actual owner rather than the person in possession.  As regards the liability <i>in rem</i> the position is covered by <i>The Father Thames</i> and the cases there cited.  The same logic and limitations apply to the case of a master signing a bill of lading.  <i>Prima facie</i> he is signing on behalf of his employer.  Commercially he is, and to make sense must be, signing on behalf of the bailee of the cargo shipped, that is to say, where the vessel is in the possession of the demise charterer and his crew, the demise charterer.  Thus in <i>Baumwoll Manufactur von Carl Scheiber v Furness</i> [1893]  AC 8 goods were shipped upon the defendant's ship under a bill of lading which was signed by the master who was the employee of the demise charterer as were the rest of the crew.  During the voyage the vessel foundered and the cargo was lost.  The cargo owner could not sue the defendant.  He was not the bailee of the cargo.  The master had no authority to contract on his behalf.  The decision was straightforward.  The defenders rely upon the breadth of the language used by Lord Herschell LC, in particular at p.17,  - </p>
<p></p><ul>"there may be two persons at the same time in different senses not improperly spoken of as the owner of a ship.  The person who has the absolute right to the ship who is the registered owner, the owner (to borrow an expression from real property law) in fee simple, may properly be spoken of, no doubt, as the owner; but at the same time he may have so dealt with the vessel as to have given all the rights of ownership for a limited time to some other person, who, during that time, may equally properly be spoken of as the owner.  When there is such a person and that person appoints the master, officers, and crew of the ship, pays them, employs them and gives them the orders, and deals with the vessel in the adventure, during that time all those rights which are spoken of as resting upon the owner of the vessel rest upon that person who is, for those purposes and during that time, in point of law to be regarded as the owner.  When that distinction is once grasped it appears to me that all the difficulties that have been raised in this case vanish.  There is nothing in your Lordships' judgment, as I apprehend, which would detract in the least from the law as it has been laid down with regard to the power of a master to bind an owner, or with regard to, liabilities which rest upon an owner.  The whole difficulty has arisen from failing to see that there may be a person, who, although not the absolute owner of the vessel, is, during a particular adventure, the owner for all those purposes."<p></p></ul>
<p>This passage does describe the demise charterer as having some of the powers of the shipowner and therefore capable of being properly termed the owner.  But Lord Herschell is careful to remind the reader of the confusions which arise from failing to take account of the limited purposes and authority within which the demise charterer may assume the powers of owner and therefore properly be termed the owner.  Properly understood with these qualifications, the passage is as much against the defenders as in their favour.  In any event, it must defer to the specific authorities dealing with s.74 itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92. The other cases cited by the defenders I will take more shortly. <i>Meikelereid v West</i> (1876)  1 QBD 428 concerned a claim by the wife of a crew member of a demise chartered ship.  Her husband had signed an allotment note and the Merchant Shipping Act 1854 gave the wife a right to sue upon the allotment note for the wages.  The court unsurprisingly held that the liability was that of the demise charterer with whom he had his contract of employment not the registered owner who was a stranger to the contract of employment even though the Act referred to the "owner".  <i>The Hopper No </i>66 [1908]  AC 126 held that a demise charterer could limit his liability under the Merchant Shipping Act 1894.  In <i>Elliot Steam Tug v Admiralty Commissioners</i> [1921]  AC 137 the change of the terms upon which a tug had been requisitioned by the Crown from a manned basis to a bareboat basis was held to carry with it the implication that the Crown should be entitled to any salvage earned.  It was the Crown that was rendering the salvage service not the registered owner.  Finally, the defenders relied upon the case <i>Trinity House v Clark</i> (1815)  4 M &amp; S 288.  This concerned a ship chartered to the Crown.  Trinity House had claimed from the registered owner of the ship 'Britannia' tolls and duties on account of the vessel having over a period of about two years passed or crossed certain lights buoys and beacons during foreign voyages in the service of the Crown.  It seems that Trinity House were not entitled to recover from the tolls and duties from the Crown.  The charters and letters patent allowed Trinity House to recover dues etc from the "owners" of vessels.  Lord Ellenborough CJ held that on the facts of that case it meant the charterer not the registered owner:  "It seems also that there is no distinction in reason between vessels of which the King has a temporary ownership, and those which were built in the dockyards of the Crown, if it appears that the King was the owner during the voyage for which the duties are claimed."  (p.291)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93. The rationale of each of these decisions is easily understood.  They recognise a potential breadth of meaning for the word "owner" and show that it can in certain contexts be read as including or meaning the charterer of a demise chartered vessel.  But they do not contradict, nor should they be read as contradicting, what has been expressly said about the rationale of s.74 in speeches specifically concerned with that section.  The purpose of s.74 is to provide a direct and easy means of recovery from the actual owner without investigating any question of fault or responsibility.  This purpose can only be served by reading "owner" in its natural and primary sense as meaning the registered owner.  The defenders' arguments are irreconcilable with this purpose.  The argument based upon the proviso was taken into account in the leading authorities on s.47 and considered to be fully consistent with this conclusion.  As put by the defenders before your Lordships, it was a linguistic argument based upon the inclusion of the word "such" before the word "owner" in the proviso; the argument was inappropriate to an Act of that date and in any event the drafting was simply to enable the proviso to refer back to the person liable under the main part of the section, that is to say the registered owner.  Those deciding the primary authorities upon the 1847 Act have found further support for the construction they have adopted in sections 75 and 76.  They were clearly justified in doing so.</p>
<i><p>Conclusion:</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94. For these reasons, my Lords, I agree that the defenders' arguments upon s.74 should not be accepted and that the decision of the First Division on this point should be set aside.  The pursuers are entitled to claim against Tankers under s.74 and to rely upon the same reasoning in support of their claim against Shipping based upon personal bar.  The claim against Transport under s.74 is irrelevant and should not proceed to proof.  However, in so far as there are also claims against any of the defenders based on contract or delict, they are not affected by the decision on the s.74 point (unless it has rendered such claims, which potentially cover wider classes of loss, academic).  Since the s.74 point was raised entirely by the defenders in order to support their tactical objectives, the fact that Transport have been held not liable under s.74 should not in my opinion affect the liability of the defenders to pay BP's costs of this part of the argument both here and below. </p>
<p><b>LORD MILLETT</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95. I have had the advantage of reading in draft the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough with which I am in full agreement. I do not wish to add anything on the meaning of "owner" in section 74 of the Harbour, Docks, and Piers Clauses Act 1847 as incorporated in the Zetland County Council Act 1974.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96. I have also had the advantage of reading in draft the speeches of my noble and learned friends Lord Hope of Craighead and Lord Clyde dealing with the proper application of section 6(4) of the Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1973 ("the Act"). This raises a question of general importance in the law of Scotland, and in deference to the Inner House it is appropriate that I should set out in my own words why I agree that on this aspect of the case the appeal should be allowed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97. The pursuers ("BP") own and operate an oil terminal at Sullom Voe. They aver that while berthing at the terminal on 28 February 1990 the vessel <i>Chevron North America</i> caused damage to the terminal. On 21 February 1995 they commenced proceedings against Chevron Shipping Co ("Shipping"), believing that company to be the owner of the vessel and the party responsible for operating it at the relevant time.  In fact the vessel was owned by Chevron Tankers (Bermuda) Ltd and at the time of the incident was the subject of a bareboat charter to Chevron Transport Corporation ("Transport"). The pursuers aver that their error was the result of representations made to them or their solicitors by Shipping and others as agents for Transport.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98. The pursuers did not discover the error until 18 August 1995. They then brought proceedings against Transport, but they were unable to serve them until 28 September 1995. This was more than five years after the incident which gave rise to the obligation to make reparation, and accordingly the obligation was prima facie extinguished by the operation of section 6(1) of the Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99. In response the pursuers have invoked section 6(4) of the Act. This excludes from the computation of the prescriptive period: </p>
"(a)  any period during which by reason of -
(i) fraud on the part of the debtor or any person acting on his behalf, or
(ii) error induced by words or conduct of the debtor or any person acting on his behalf,
the creditor was induced to refrain from making a relevant claim in relation to the obligation.
       Provided that any period such as is mentioned in paragraph (a) of this subsection shall not include any time occurring after the creditor could with reasonable diligence have discovered the fraud or error, as the case may be, referred to in that paragraph."
<p>It is common ground that in Scotland a claim is made against a defender when the proceedings are served on him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100. Two questions arise on the application of this subsection to the facts averred by the pursuers in the present case. The first concerns the meaning of the words "refrain from making a relevant claim." The Inner House understood the expression to mean "stop oneself from making a relevant claim." So understood, it would appear to involve a conscious decision not to make the claim, and hence not even to make an attempt to do so. But I do not think that it bears this meaning in section 6(4). If the subsection required a conscious decision not to make the relevant claim, it would be difficult to apply to the ordinary case where, by reason of the error, the pursuer was wholly unaware that he had a claim of any kind against anyone. In my opinion the key to the meaning of the expression lies in the fact that the subsection is an amplification of section 6(1), and the two subsections must be read together. The primary prescriptive period is a period of five years "without any relevant claim having been made in relation to the obligation". Section 6(4) then excludes from the calculation of the primary period any period during which the creditor was induced to refrain from making a relevant claim. The words "induced to refrain from making a relevant claim" are a reference to "without any relevant claim having been made" and embrace the same concept. In my opinion they mean no more than "induced not to make a relevant claim."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101. The second question concerns the identification of the relevant period to be excluded from the computation, in relation both to the date of its commencement and to the date of its termination.  The pursuers arguments below assumed that the excluded period began at the latest on 21 February 1995, but they contended that it did not end until 28 September 1995 when they effected service on Transport. The Inner House held that it ended on 18 August 1995 when the error was discovered. The Inner House 2000 SLT 1374 saw no difficulty in seeing that the pursuers were refraining from making a relevant claim against Transport while they were unaware that Transport was the charterer of the vessel and so a possible party against whom proceedings should be brought. But they could not be said to be refraining from making the claim when they were "bending all their efforts" to doing so (p 1378). Excluding the period from 21 February 1995 to 18 August 1995 from the primary prescriptive period still left a period of more than five years from the date of the incident to the date when Transport was served, with the result that any obligation on its part to make reparation was extinguished.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102. Before your Lordships the pursuers have  concentrated instead on the commencement of the excluded period. They had averred that they were induced to refrain from making the claim against Transport "for at least the period between [21 February 1995] and [28 September 1995]." The Inner House observed that this was because they:</p>
"accept that they cannot say that, even if they had been aware of the situation, they would actually have raised proceedings against Transport any earlier than 21 February 1995 when they served the action on Shipping." 
<p>The pursuers offered to prove that, but for the error induced by Shipping on behalf of Transport, they would have served Transport on or about 21 February 1995. The Inner House declined to accept the offer because it would not have saved the obligation from extinction if the period to be excluded from the calculation of the prescriptive period ended on 18 August 1995.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103. This raises a question of some general importance. Is it sufficient for the creditor to identify the period during which he was induced by the error to refrain from making the claim, or must he go further and identify the date on which he would have made the claim but for the error?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104. I am satisfied that he need not take this further step, which involves a hypothetical inquiry which can never be answered precisely and may sometimes be incapable of being answered at all. A representee can say why he acted as he did. He can say that it was, inter alia, because of the representation. But he can only speculate on what he would have done if the representation had not been made. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105. As a matter of English law, a representee must always be prepared to prove that the representation had an effect upon his mind. But it is sufficient for him to prove that the representation was <i>an</i> inducing cause which led him to act as he did; he need not prove that it was <i>the</i> inducing cause: <i>Edgington v Fitzmaurice</i> (1885)  29 ChD 459; <i>Arnison v Smith</i> (1889)  41 ChD 348 (see especially at p 369). Whether, if a full disclosure of the truth had been made, he would or would not have acted differently is a question to which English law does not require an answer; it is sufficient that he might have done so: see <i>Spencer Bower and Turner, Actionable Misrepresentation </i>(1974) at p 139. There are many authorities to this effect: thus</p>
"I do not think a court of equity is in the habit of considering that a falsehood is not to be looked at because, if the truth had been told, the same thing might have resulted": <i>In Re Imperial Mercantile Credit Association, Williams' Case</i> (1869)  9 Eq 225, 226, per James V-C.
<p>Summarising the authorities and paraphrasing a passage in the judgment of Byrne J in a prospectus case (<i>Drincqbier v Wood</i> [1899]  1 Ch 393, 404) the authors of <i>Spencer Bower and Turner</i> continue </p>
"'Would you have taken the shares if something had been left out, and something else had been put in' is an extremely difficult question to answer, and one which the representor is not entitled to ask and to which the representee can give a perfectly adequate reply by saying 'I cannot say; I have never seen such a prospectus'." 
I do not understand the law of Scotland to differ in this respect.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106. Although the context is different, I think that the same principle must operate. It is sufficient for the pursuers to prove that for a period they believed that Shipping was the owner and operator of the vessel, that this belief was induced by words or conduct on the part of Transport or persons acting on its behalf, and that as a result they did not make a relevant claim against Transport. They do not have to show that but for the error they would have made a claim against Transport or that they would have done so on any particular date. This would have depended on the response of Transport and its agents to letters written to them by the pursuers' solicitors which in the event were never written. Since all three defenders are members of the same group of companies and employ the same agents, the likelihood is that nothing would have happened any differently from what did happen save for the substitution of Transport for Shipping. But this does not affect the principle that what would have happened is hypothetical and depends on making a number of assumptions the truth of which cannot be known; and that on the pursuers' averments the reason it is a hypothetical question is the fault of Transport or those acting on its behalf.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107. It follows that the pursuers' averment that if they had known the truth they would have made the claim against Transport on or before 21 February 1995 is irrelevant. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108. I think that section 6(4) of the Act operates in a very simple way. The first step is to take the period between the date when the obligation to make reparation arose and the date when the particular defender was served. If this primary period exceeds five years, then section 6(1) has the effect of extinguishing the obligation at the end of the fifth year. In the present case the obligation to make reparation arose on 1 March 1990 and the proceedings were served on Transport on 28 September 1995, more than five years later. Any obligation on the part of Transport to make reparation was prima facie extinguished.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109. The next step is to exclude from the calculation of the primary period any period during which the creditor's failure to serve the defender was the result of an error which was induced by the defender or someone acting on his behalf.  This period is coterminous with the subsistence of the error in question. It cannot begin until the creditor is induced to make the error and it ends when he discovers the truth. On the pursuers' averments, the period to be excluded began in 1990 or 1991 and continued until 18 August 1995. It did not begin only on 21 February 1995 when they served Shipping. If they prove what they have averred, their failure to serve Transport before that date was due to their belief that Shipping was the party responsible for the operation of the vessel; and the fact that had they known the truth they still might not have served Transport until that date is neither here nor there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110. On the other hand, the excluded period ended on 18 August 1995 when the pursuers discovered the error. This is not, as the Inner House suggested 2000 SLT 1374, 1378-1379, because they could not be said to be refraining from making the claim when they were "bending all their efforts" to doing so. It is because their failure to serve Transport after 18 August 1995 cannot be said to be "by reason of" any error when they knew the truth. As the Inner House observed, in paragraph 13, this is confirmed by the proviso to the subsection. If the excluded period is brought to an end as soon as the creditor could with reasonable diligence have discovered the error in question, then a fortiori it must come to an end when he actually did so.  The periods before and after the error operated on the creditor's mind are not excluded from the five-year primary period, not because it is assumed that in the absence of any error the creditor would bring proceedings to enforce the obligation to make reparation immediately it arose, but because that is what he is given five years to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111. If the matter stopped there, any obligation on the part of Transport to make reparation was not extinguished by the time it was served with the present proceedings. But Transport may still succeed in showing that its obligation was extinguished before 28 September 1995 by invoking the proviso to curtail the duration of the period to be excluded from the calculation of the primary period. If it can establish that the pursuers could with reasonable diligence have discovered the error at some time before 18August 1995, then the excluded period will end at that earlier time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112. For these reasons, as well as the reasons which they have given, I agree with the order which Lord Hope of Craighead and Lord Clyde propose.</p>
