<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion there is nothing ambiguous or unclear in the words of the section and I think, with respect, that the Court of Appeal fell into error because it did not first ask itself the question whether the words were unclear or ambiguous;  rather it moved on to consider at the outset whether Parliament might have intended a more restricted power than the power which appeared to be given by the words of the section and it posed the question. </p>
<p></p><ul>"… whether it is clear and unambiguous that Parliament intended to confer an unlimited and unrestricted power (other than the restraints involved in the application of <i>Wednesbury</i> principles); or whether the matter is in doubt.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>If it is in doubt the court is entitled to look at the legislative history.  In our judgment the matter is not clear;  on the contrary it is doubtful."<p></p></ul>
<p>But if the words of the section are clear the speeches in <i>Maunsell v. Olins</i> and <i>Farrell v. Alexander</i> counsel against the harking back to earlier legislation unless there is something in the context of the consolidation Act or the section which causes the court to consider that it should do so.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There can be no precise test to apply to enable a court to determine whether the context of an Act or a section is such that it should look back at an earlier provision notwithstanding that the words of the section which it is considering are clear— in essence the question is, as Lord Edmund-Davies stated in <i>Farrell v. Alexander </i>at page 97A, whether its ambit is obscure.  In <i>Reg. v. Schildkamp</i> [1971]  A.C. 1, upon which Mr. Bonney Q.C. for Spath Holme Limited<i> </i>relied, Lord Upjohn considered that in construing section 332(3) of the Companies Act 1948 it was appropriate to look back at a provision in the earlier Companies Act of 1928, and stated at page 22G:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The argument of counsel for the appellant was straightforward.  Reading subsection (3) he submits truly that its terms are perfectly clear and simple.  There is no ambiguity; the subsection clearly applies so as to create an offence on the part of a person knowingly carrying on a business— with intent to defraud creditors of the company or creditors of any other person or for any fraudulent purpose, and the circumstance that the company may subsequently have been wound up is quite irrelevant.  The subsection plainly applies as a matter of language to the case where there has been no subsequent winding up.  Looking at that subsection alone, I agree.  Naturally he relies upon the contrast between subsection (1) where there is a reference to winding up and subsection (3) where there is not; a point to which I shall return later.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"But, my Lords, this, in my opinion, is the wrong approach to the construction of an Act of Parliament.  The task of the court is to ascertain the intention of Parliament; you cannot look at a section, still less a subsection, in isolation, to ascertain that intention; you must look at all the admissible surrounding circumstances before starting to construe the Act."<p></p></ul>
<p>And at page 23G:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Nevertheless, in my opinion, the problem is essentially a question of construction of the 1928 Act and not the 1948 Act, for it was the former that created the new concept of making directors liable for the fraudulent trading of a company and the true scope and ambit of that liability, whether civil or criminal, must be determined by considering the terms of that Act and not of the subsequent consolidation Acts."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in my opinion in the present case there is nothing in the context of the 1985 Act or section 31 which justifies the court in looking back at provisions in the Counter-Inflation Acts of 1972 and 1973 and the Housing Rents and Subsidies Act 1975.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act of 1985 contains a number of sections designed to give protection to the tenants of dwellings.  One group of sections requires landlords to give certain information to tenants, another group of sections requires landlords to provide rent books to tenants, another group of sections implies terms as to the fitness of houses for human habitation, another group of sections imposes obligations on lessors to keep houses in repair, and another group of sections imposes limitations on service charges for flats.  Therefore when one comes to consider section 31 in the context of the other provisions of the Act, it appears to me that the power given to the Secretary of State by order to restrict or prevent increases of rent is given to ensure fairness to tenants.  Moreover, I find nothing which would cause a court to feel a sense of concern about such a power and to cause it to think that it should consider earlier legislation to find guidance as to the ambit of the power, particularly bearing in mind that since the first Rent Act in 1915 Parliament has frequently enacted provisions to protect tenants of dwellings from the obligation to pay rents which would impose an unfair burden upon them.  Therefore I am of opinion that there is nothing in the context of the Act of 1985 or of section 31 which would provide a reason for a court to look back at earlier legislation and to infer from it that the apparent width of the power given by the words of section 31 is to be restricted to the counter-inflationary purpose for which the earlier statutory provisions were enacted.  I am further of opinion that the presumptions and provisions to which the Court of Appeal refers in the latter part of paragraph 42 of its judgment are not of sufficient weight in the context of the 1985 Act to restrict the clear words of the section.  And as I consider that there is no doubt as to the scope of the power given by the section there is no need for the restrictive approach to subordinate legislation taken by the Court of Appeal in <i>McKiernon v. Secretary of State for Social Security</i> [unreported, 26 October 1989]  and approved by this House in <i>Reg. v. Secretary of State for Social Security, Ex parte Britnell</i> [1991]  1 W.L.R. 198, 204F.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore in restricting the ambit of section 31 I consider that the Court of Appeal was not observing the warning given by Lord Simon of Glaisdale and Lord Diplock in <i>Maunsell v. Olins</i> at p. 393E:</p>
<p></p><ul>"For a court of construction to constrain statutory language which has a primary natural meaning appropriate in its context so as to give it an artificial meaning which is appropriate only to remedy the mischief which is conceived to have occasioned the statutory provision is to proceed unsupported by principle, inconsonant with authority and oblivious of the actual practice of parliamentary draftsmen."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I further consider that Spath Holme Limited<i> </i>does not derive assistance from the principle applied in <i>Padfield v. Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</i> [1968] A.C. 997 and stated by Professor Sir William Wade Q.C. in <i>Administrative Law</i> 5th ed. (1982) pp. 355-356 in a passage approved by this House in <i>Reg. v. Tower Hamlets London Borough Council, Ex parte Chetnik Developments Limited</i> [1988]  A.C. 858, 872B: </p>
<p></p><ul>"The common theme of all the passages quoted is that the notion of absolute or unfettered discretion is rejected.  Statutory power conferred for public purposes is conferred as it were upon trust, not absolutely— that is to say, it can validly be used only in the right and proper way which Parliament when conferring it is presumed to have intended."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is apparent that the Court of Appeal was influenced in its decision by this principle and the court stated at p. 154G para 40:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In <i>Padfield's</i> case the House of Lords were not facing the same problem as we do in this case.  Although the Agricultural Marketing Act 1958 was a consolidating Act, it was perfectly possible to find the purpose for which the power was conferred from that Act alone because it contained the whole of a comprehensive scheme.  There is nothing in that case or in <i>Julius's</i> case which justifies the conclusion that, where the purpose cannot be derived from the Act itself or there is considerable doubt whether the apparently unlimited power is intended to be so, ordinary principles of construction cannot be prayed in aid."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in my opinion Mr. Parker Q.C. was correct in submitting, on behalf of the Secretaries of State, that an argument based upon this principle ought to be advanced by reference to the purpose to be derived from the particular statute in which the discretionary power is enacted.  Thus Lord Reid said in <i>Padfield</i> at p. 1030B:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Parliament must have conferred the discretion with the intention that it should be used to promote the policy and objects of the Act; the policy and objects of the Act must be determined by construing the Act as a whole and construction is always a matter of law for the court."<p></p></ul>
<p>And at p. 1052G referring to <i>Julius v. Bishop of Oxford</i> (1880)  5 App. Cas. 214  Lord Pearce said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"That decision rested on the construction of the particular Act and it made clear that in the context of an Act is to be found the answer to the question how a power given by it is to be exercised."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore for the reasons which I have sought to give, I respectfully consider that the Court of Appeal erred when it expressed the opinion that it could look for a purpose in earlier legislation and use such a purpose to restrict the words of section 31 which, in my opinion, are clear and unambiguous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I am of opinion that the words of section 31 are clear and unambiguous I further consider that this case does not satisfy the first threshold test stated by Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <i>Pepper v. Hart</i> [1993] A.C. 593, 640C, with the agreement of the other members of the House, Lord Mackay of Clashfern L.C. dissenting, and that therefore it was inappropriate to refer to statements in Parliament in this case.  I respectfully agree with my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill that the conditions laid down by the House in <i>Pepper v. Hart</i> should be strictly adhered to; otherwise in many cases time will be taken up and costs will be incurred without assistance to the court in its task of construction by references by counsel to statements by Ministers and by the weighing of those statements by the court.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that where Lord Browne-Wilkinson referred at page 640C to legislation which is "ambiguous or obscure" he was referring to ambiguity or obscurity in the wording of a statutory provision, not to possible ambiguity as to the purpose for which Parliament gave a power.  In my opinion this view finds support in the speeches of Lord Griffiths and Lord Oliver of Aylmerton.  Lord Griffiths said at page 617E:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The ever increasing volume of legislation must inevitably result in ambiguities of statutory language which are not perceived at the time the legislation is enacted.  The object of the court in interpreting legislation is to give effect so far as the language permits to the intention of the legislature.  If the language proves to be ambiguous I can see no sound reason not to consult Hansard to see if there is a clear statement of the meaning that the words were intended to carry." <p></p></ul>
<p>Lord Oliver of Aylmerton said at page 620C:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is, however, important to stress the limits within which such a relaxation is permissible and which are set out in the speech of my noble and learned friend.  It can apply only where the expression of the legislative intention is genuinely ambiguous or obscure or where a literal or prima facie construction leads to a manifest absurdity and where the difficulty can be resolved by a clear statement directed to the matter in issue."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I consider, with respect, that if Lord Browne-Wilkinson's requirement that the language must be ambiguous or obscure were to be read as referring to uncertainty as to the purpose of a statutory provision where there is no ambiguity or obscurity  in the wording of the provision, there would be some risk of the process feared by Lord Diplock in <i>Fothergill v. Monarch Airlines Ltd.</i> [1981]  A.C. 251, 280B that those affected by a statute might have to</p>
<p></p><ul>"… search through all that had happened before and in the course of the legislative process in order to see whether there was anything to be found from which it could be inferred that Parliament's real intention had not been accurately expressed by the actual words that Parliament had adopted to communicate it to those affected by the legislation."<p></p></ul>
