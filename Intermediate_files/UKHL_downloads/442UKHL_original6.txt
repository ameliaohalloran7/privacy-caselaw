<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88. In his dissenting judgment the Vice-Chancellor stated, at p 779F:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The position, to my mind, is wholly different from that in the <i>McGhee</i> case [1973] 1 WLR 1, where there was only one candidate (brick dust) which could have caused the dermatitis, and the failure to take a precaution against brick dust causing dermatitis was followed by dermatitis caused by brick dust.  In such a case, I can see the common sense, if not the logic, of holding that, in the absence of any other evidence, the failure to take the precaution caused or contributed to the dermatitis.  To the extent that certain members of the House of Lords decided the question on inferences from evidence or presumptions, I do not consider that the present case falls within their reasoning. A failure to take preventative measures against one out of five possible causes is no evidence as to which of those five caused the injury."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89. The defendant appealed to this House and the appeal was allowed [1988] AC 1074.  The ground on which the appeal was allowed was the ground stated by the Vice-Chancellor in his dissenting judgment and in his speech at pp 1090 and 1091, with which the other members of the House concurred, Lord Bridge of Harwich set out the relevant passage in the judgment of  the Vice-Chancellor and stated that he was quite unable to find any fault with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90. The House also considered the passages in the speech of Lord Wilberforce in <i>McGhee</i> at pp 6 and 7 which the House considered constituted a reversal of the burden of proof.  Lord Bridge stated, at p 1087F:</p>
<p></p><ul>"My Lords, it seems to me that both these paragraphs, particularly in the words I have emphasised, amount to saying that, in the circumstances, the burden of proof of causation is reversed and thereby to run counter to the unanimous and emphatic opinions expressed in <i>Bonnington Castings Ltd v Wardlaw</i> [1956] AC 613 to the contrary effect.  I find no support in any of the other speeches for the view that the burden of proof is reversed and, in this respect, I think Lord Wilberforce's reasoning must be regarded as expressing a minority opinion."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91. In his speech Lord Bridge also stated that in his opinion the decision of Lord Reid, Lord Simon, Lord Kilbrandon and Lord Salmon was based on the drawing of an inference.  He said, at pp 1087H and 1088A-B:</p>
<p></p><ul>"A distinction is, of course, apparent between the facts of <i>Bonnington Castings Ltd v Wardlaw</i>, where the "innocent" and "guilty" silica dust particles which together caused the pursuer's lung disease were inhaled concurrently and the facts of <i>McGhee v National Coal Board</i> [1973] 1 WLR 1 where the  "innocent" and "guilty" brick dust was present on the pursuer's body for consecutive periods.  In the one case the concurrent inhalation of "innocent" and "guilty" dust must both have contributed to the cause of the disease.  In the other case the consecutive periods when "innocent" and "guilty" brick dust was present on the pursuer's body may both have contributed to the cause of the disease or, theoretically at least, one or other may have been the sole cause.  But where the layman is told by the doctors that the longer the brick dust remains on the body, the greater the risk of dermatitis, although the doctors cannot identify the process of causation scientifically, there seems to be nothing irrational in drawing the inference, as a matter of common sense, that the consecutive periods when brick dust remained on the body probably contributed cumulatively to the causation of the dermatitis.  I believe that a process of inferential reasoning on these general lines underlies the decision of the majority in <i>McGhee's</i> case."<p></p></ul>
<p>After citing passages from the four speeches he said, at p 1090C:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The conclusion I draw from these is that <i>McGhee v National Coal Board</i> [1973] 1 WLR 1 laid down no new principle of law whatever.  On the contrary, it affirmed the principle that the onus of proving causation lies on the pursuer or plaintiff.  Adopting a robust and pragmatic approach to the undisputed primary facts of the case, the majority concluded that it was a legitimate inference of fact that the defenders' negligence had materially contributed to the pursuer's injury.  The decision, in my opinion, is of no greater significance than that and to attempt to extract from it some esoteric principle which in some way modifies, as a matter of law, the nature of the burden of proof of causation which a plaintiff or pursuer must discharge once he has established a relevant breach of duty is a fruitless one."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92. Mr Stewart QC, in an impressive argument on behalf of two of the defendants, advanced submissions which I summarise as follows:</p>
<p></p><ul>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;The fundamental principle of English law in relation to industrial injury cases which has been constantly followed and applied by this House is that stated by Lord Reid in <i>Bonnington Castings v Wardlaw</i> at p 620:<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"It would seem obvious in principle that a pursuer or plaintiff must prove not only negligence or breach of duty but also that such fault caused or materially contributed to his injury, and there is ample authority for that proposition both in Scotland and in England.  I can find neither reason nor authority for the rule being different where there is breach of a statutory duty.  The fact that Parliament imposes a duty for the protection of employees has been held to entitle an employee to sue if he is injured as a result of a breach of that duty, but it would be going a great deal farther to hold that it can be inferred from the enactment of a duty that Parliament intended that any employee suffering injury can sue his employer merely because there was a breach of duty and it is shown to be possible that his injury may have been caused by it.  In my judgment, the employee must in all cases prove his case by the ordinary standard of proof in civil actions: he must make it appear at least that on a balance of probabilities the breach of duty caused or materially contributed to his injury."<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Wardlaw</i> was a case where the inhalation of "innocent" and "guilty" dust contributed cumulatively over a period of time to the pursuer's lung disease, and therefore the inhalation of the "guilty" dust was properly regarded as making a material contribution to the disease.  Mr Stewart submitted that <i>McGhee's</i> case was also a case where it was established that there had been a cumulative causative process because the "innocent" and "guilty" brick dust had been present on the pursuer's body for consecutive periods.  In support of this submission he relied on the passage in Lord Bridge's speech in <i>Wilsher</i>, at 1087H to 1088B, where he referred to the cumulative contribution to the causation of the dermatitis.  He further submitted that the present case was not governed by the decision in <i>McGhee</i> because in this case the medical evidence was that it was as probable as not that the onset of the disease was not due to a cumulative process occurring during the entire period when an employee was employed by different employers but was due to the inhalation of a single fibre or a number of fibres during the course of employment with only one employer.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;This House held in <i>Wilsher </i>that the decision in <i>McGhee</i> had not laid down a new principle of law that proof of a material increase in risk constitutes proof of causation: rather the decision was based on the robust drawing of an inference.  But in the present case it was not open to draw such an inference because the medical evidence established that it was as likely as not that the cause of the onset of the disease was the inhalation of a single fibre or a small number of fibres.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;If this House were to hold that the decision in <i>McGhee </i>laid down a principle of law that proof of a material increase of risk constitutes proof of causation, such a decision would reverse the burden of proof contrary to the decision in <i>Wardlaw's</i> case where the House overruled the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Vyner v Waldenberg Brothers Ltd</i> [1946] KB 50 that the onus is on an employer to show that the breach of a safety regulation was not the cause of an accident.  Moreover if the House were to hold that there was such a principle of law, it would not be possible to confine the principle to cases such as the present ones where there is only one possible cause, and the principle would be extended to cases of medical negligence (as was done by the Court of Appeal in the <i>Wilsher</i> case) and to other cases.<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93. I do not accept Mr Stewart's submission that <i>McGhee</i> was a case where there was a cumulative process analogous to that in <i>Wardlaw</i>, and that the present case is not governed by <i>McGhee</i> and is distinguishable from it because in this case it was as probable as not that the disease developed from the inhalation of one fibre or a small number of fibres.  Lord Reid stated in his speech in <i>McGhee</i> at p 4F-H that whilst it was possible that the pursuer's disease started with an accumulation of minor abrasions this was not proved and that it was possible that the disease started at one particular abrasion.  Therefore it is clear that Lord Reid held that the defender was liable even if the onset of the disease had not been due to an accumulation of abrasions but had started at one particular abrasion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94. My Lords, I consider that the question whether the decision in <i>McGhee</i> was based on an inference raises an issue of some difficulty.   There does not appear to be a clear statement in the speeches that the House was formulating a new principle of law rather than basing its decision on an inference from the evidence.  The case was one in which there was no real conflict between the medical witnesses and therefore the House was in as good a position to evaluate the evidence and to come to a factual conclusion on causation as were the trial judge and the Inner House:  see per Lord Reid in <i>Benmax v Austin Motor Co Ltd</i> [1955] AC 370, 376.  Moreover the issue of causation is one to be decided ultimately by the tribunal of fact and not by the medical witnesses (see <i>Sentilles v Inter-Caribbean Shipping Corporation</i> 361 US 107 (1959) cited later in para 100 of this opinion), although the tribunal of fact must give proper weight to their opinions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95. Although at the commencement of his speech Lord Reid said at p 3D that the allegation that the defender was at fault in not providing adequate washing facilities "raises a difficult question of law", there are other passages in the speeches which I think can be read as pointing to the decision being based on the drawing of an inference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96. Lord Simon, referring to <i>Wardlaw and Nicholson v Atlas Steel Foundry and Engineering Co Ltd</i>, said, at p 8C:</p>
<p></p><ul>"the law does not require a pursuer or plaintiff to prove the impossible, but holds that he is entitled to damages for the injury if he proves on a balance of probabilities that the breach or breaches of duty contributed substantially to causing the injury. ….<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>The question, then, is whether on the evidence the appellant brought himself within this rule.  In my view, a failure to take steps which would bring about a material reduction of the risk involves, in this type of case, a substantial contribution to the injury.  In this type of case a stark distinction between breach of duty and causation is unreal.  If the provision of shower baths was (as the evidence showed) a precaution which any reasonable employer in the respondents' position would take, it means that such employer should have foreseen that failure to take the precaution would, more probably than not, substantially contribute towards injury:  this is sufficient prima facie evidence."  (emphasis added)<p></p></ul>
<p>It is also relevant to note that at the conclusion of his speech, at p 9A, Lord Simon cited with approval the decision in <i>Gardiner v Motherwell Machinery and Scrap Co Ltd </i>[1961] 1 WLR 1424 where Lord Reid stated, at p 1429:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In my opinion, when a man who has not previously suffered from a disease contracts that disease after being subjected to conditions likely to cause it, and when he shows that it starts in a way typical of disease caused by such conditions, he establishes a prima facie presumption that his disease was caused by those conditions.  I think that the facts proved in this case do establish such a presumption.  That presumption could be displaced in many ways."<p></p></ul>
<p>In my opinion in the context of <i>Gardiner</i> and <i>McGhee</i> there is little, if any, difference between a prima facie presumption and an inference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97. Lord Kilbrandon said, at p 10G:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The pursuer has after all, only to satisfy the court of a probability, not to demonstrate an irrefragable chain of causation, which in a case of dermatitis, in the present state of medical knowledge, he could probably never do."<p></p></ul>
<p>And Lord Salmon said, at pp 11H-12A:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In the circumstances of the present case it seems to me unrealistic and contrary to ordinary common sense to hold that the negligence which materially increased the risk of injury did not materially contribute to causing the injury."  <p></p></ul>
<p>I incline to the view that these statements by Lord Simon, Lord Kilbrandon and Lord Salmon point more to the drawing of an inference in a common sense way from the evidence than to the formulation of a principle of law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98. In <i>Hotson v East Berkshire Area Health Authority</i> [1987] AC 750, Lord Mackay of Clashfern (who was counsel for the defender in <i>McGhee</i>) referring to that case, said, at p 786D:</p>
<p></p><ul>"the decision of this House may be taken as holding that in the circumstances of that case it was reasonable to infer that there was a relationship between contraction of dermatitis in these conditions and the absence of washing facilities and therefore it was reasonable to hold that absence of washing facilities was likely to have made a material contribution to the causation of the dermatitis."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99. It is clear that this House in <i>Wilsher</i> considered that a new principle of law was not laid down in <i>McGhee</i> and that the decision of the majority was based on the drawing of an inference from the evidence in a robust and commonsense way.  And in the Court of Appeal [1987] QB 730, at p 779 the Vice-Chancellor said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"To the extent that certain members of the House of Lords decided the question on inferences from evidence or presumptions, I do not consider that the present case falls within their reasoning."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100. In describing in <i>Wilsher</i> the manner in which, in his opinion, the House drew an inference in <i>McGhee</i>, Lord Bridge said, [1988] AC 1074, at p 1088A-B:</p>
<p></p><ul>"But where the layman is told by the doctors that the longer the brick dust remains on the body, the greater the risk of dermatitis, although the doctors cannot identify the process of causation scientifically, there seems to be nothing irrational in drawing the inference, as a matter of common sense, that the consecutive periods when brick dust remained on the body probably contributed cumulatively to the causation of the dermatitis."<p></p></ul>
<p>I consider that this approach, whereby the layman applying broad common sense draws an inference which the doctors as scientific witnesses are not prepared to draw, is one which is permissible.   In the United States Supreme Court in<i> Sentilles v Inter-Caribbean Shipping Corporation </i>361 US 107 (1959) Brennan J stated, at p 109:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The jury's power to draw the inference that the aggravation of petitioner's tubercular condition, evident so shortly after the accident, was in fact caused by that accident, was not impaired by the failure of any medical witness to testify that it was in fact the cause.  Neither can it be impaired by the lack of medical unanimity as to the respective likelihood of the potential causes of the aggravation, or by the fact that other potential causes of the aggravation existed and were not conclusively negated by the proofs.  The matter does not turn on the use of a particular form of words by the physicians in giving their testimony.  The members of the jury, not the medical witnesses, were sworn to make a legal determination of the question of causation."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101. It is apparent from his judgment in the action brought by Mr Matthews in which he found that the breaches of duty by the defendants caused his mesothelioma that Mitting J based his decision on an inference from the evidence.  He referred to the judgment of Lord Bridge in <i>Wilsher</i> and stated, at p 15 of his judgment:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Adopting that robust approach, my firm conclusion in this case is that the claimant's exposure to asbestos fibres in the employment of the two defendants, did materially contribute to, and so cause his mesothelioma.  I reach that conclusion by a simple, direct process of reasoning, readily understandable to a layman.  The claimant was exposed by each defendant and by both defendants, to asbestos fibres, in quantities sufficient greatly to increase his risk of contracting mesothelioma, on the evidence of Dr. Rudd, by up to a thousand times the general population risk. They owed him statutory and common law duties to take steps to minimise that risk.  They failed to do so.  He contracted the very disease against which it was their duty to take those steps.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>In those circumstances, like Lord Reid in <i>McGhee</i>, I can see no substantial difference between saying that what the defendant did materially increased the risk of injury to the claimant and saying that what the defendants did made a material contribution to his injury.  It seems to me wholly artificial to require a claimant to prove which fibre, or fibres, inhaled in whose employment in precisely what circumstances, caused or set off or contributed to the process by which one or more mesothelial cells became malignant.  In principle, it is just as artificial as requiring proof in a case in which a pool of liquid, collected from separate sources, has caused injury, of precisely which molecule was the mechanical cause of injury.  Even though the precise mechanism by which the claimant's mesothelioma was caused or set off cannot be established, those conclusions point, inexorably, to the finding that the defendants' breaches of duty materially contributed to his contracting the disease.  In other words, the evidence which I have heard proves, on the balance of probabilities, that their breach of duty caused his injury." <p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102. The courts in Canada have taken the view that the majority decision in <i>McGhee</i> was based on an inference.  In <i>Snell v Farrell </i>(1990) 72 DLR (4th) 289 Sopinka J, in delivering the judgment of the Supreme Court, stated with reference to <i>McGhee,</i> at p 296g:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Two theories of causation emerge from an analysis of the speeches of the Lords in this case.  The first, firmly espoused by Lord Wilberforce, is that the plaintiff need only prove that the defendant created a risk of harm and that the injury occurred within the area of the risk.  The second is that in these circumstances, an inference of causation was warranted in that there is no practical difference between materially contributing to the risk of harm and materially contributing to the harm itself."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103. The judgment of Lambert JA in the British Columbia Court of Appeal in <i>Haag v Marshall</i> (1989) 61 DLR (4th) 371 contains, in my respectful opinion, an illuminating discussion of the decision in <i>McGhee</i>.  He stated, at pp 378 and 379:</p>
<p></p><ul>"<i>McGhee v National Coal Board</i> was considered by the House of Lords in <i>Kay v Ayrshire</i> <i>and</i> <i>Arran Health Board</i> [1987] 2 All ER 417; <i>Hotson v East Berkshire Area Health Authority</i> [1987] 2 All ER 909, and <i>Wilsher v Essex Area Health Authority</i> [1988] 1 All ER 871.  It is clear from those decisions that <i>McGhee</i> is not now, and never was, authority for the legally adventurous proposition that if a breach of duty is shown, and damage is proven within the area of risk that brought about the duty, and if the breach of duty materially increases the risk of damage of that type, then the onus of proof shifts from the plaintiff to the defendant to disprove the causal connection.  That proposition could be derived only from the speech of Lord Wilberforce and it is now clear that it was never a binding principle emerging from the <i>McGhee</i> case.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>But <i>McGhee</i> remains a worthwhile study.  And there is a somewhat more cautious principle underlying the decision in that case.  However, it is not an "onus" principle but an "inference" principle. ….<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>The "inference" principle derived from <i>McGhee</i>, and from the Canadian cases to which I have referred, is this:  Where a breach of duty has occurred, and damage is shown to have arisen within the area of risk which brought the duty into being, and where the breach of duty materially increased the risk that damage of that type would occur, and where it is impossible, in a practical sense, for either party to lead evidence which would establish either that the breach of duty caused the loss or that it did not, then it is permissible to infer, as a matter of legal, though not necessarily logical, inference, that the material increase in risk arising from the breach of duty constituted a material contributing cause of the loss and as such a foundation for a finding of liability. ….<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Whether the inference of causation should in fact be made in any particular case depends on whether it is in accordance with common sense and justice in that case to say that the breach of duty which materially increased the risk ought reasonably to be considered as having materially contributed to the loss."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104. Courts in Australia have also taken the view that the decision in <i>McGhee</i> was arrived at on the basis of an inference.  In the Supreme Court of South Australia in <i>Birkholz v RJ Gilbertson Pty Ltd</i> (1985) 38 SASR 121, 130 King CJ stated:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Has the failure to take those precautions been shown to have caused or materially contributed to the contracting of the disease by the appellant?  It might be argued as a matter of strict logic, that the fact that given precautions would substantially diminish the risk, does not prove that failure to take those precautions materially contributed to the appellant's infection unless it can be established how that infection occurred.  But the law's view of causation is less concerned with logical and philosophical considerations than with the need to produce a just result to the parties involved.  Where a defendant is under a legal duty to take precautions to protect the plaintiff from the risk of contracting disease, and, by omitting those precautions, he substantially increases the risk of the plaintiff contracting that disease, the law treats that increase in risk as a sufficient basis, in the absence of evidence showing how the infection occurred, for an inference that the omission of the precautions materially contributed to the contracting of the disease.  Justice requires such an approach to the problem of causation and it is the approach which was taken by the House of Lords in <i>McGhee v National Coal Board</i>."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105. Another illuminating discussion of the proper approach to the issue of causation where a claimant seeks to recover damages for an asbestos-related cancer is contained in the judgment of Baxter J in the Supreme Court of California (with which the majority of the court agreed) in <i>Rutherford v Owens-Illinois Inc</i> (1997) 16 Cal. 4th 953 where he stated at p 977:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In refining the concept of legal cause we must also ensure that the triers of fact in asbestos-related cancer cases know the precise contours of the plaintiff's burden.  The generally applicable standard instructions on causation are insufficient for this purpose.  Those instructions tell the jury that every "substantial factor in bringing about an injury" is a legal cause (BAJI No. 3.76), even when more than one such factor "contributes concurrently as a cause of the injury" (BAJI No. 3.77).  They say nothing, however, to inform the jury that, in asbestos-related cancer cases, a particular asbestos-containing product is deemed to be a substantial factor in bringing about the injury if its contribution to the plaintiff or decedent's <i>risk </i>or <i>probability</i> of developing cancer was substantial.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Without such guidance, a juror might well conclude that the plaintiff needed to prove that fibers from the defendant's product were a substantial factor <i>actually contributing </i>to the development of the plaintiff's or decedent's cancer.  In many cases, such a burden will be medically impossible to sustain, even with the greatest possible effort by the plaintiff, because of irreducible uncertainty regarding the cellular formation of an asbestos-related cancer.  We therefore hold that, in the trial of an asbestos-related cancer case, although no instruction "shifting the burden of proof as to causation" to defendant is warranted, the jury should be told that the plaintiff's or decedent's exposure to a particular product was a substantial factor in causing or bringing about the disease if in reasonable medical probability it was a substantial factor contributing to plaintiff's or decedent's <i>risk</i> of developing cancer."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106. As I have stated, I think that there is no clear statement in the speeches in <i>McGhee</i> as to the underlying basis of the decision. The preponderance of subsequent judicial opinion has been that the decision was based on an inference from the facts.  On the evidence before it in <i>McGhee</i> I think that the House was entitled to draw an inference in the way described by Lord Bridge in <i>Wilsher</i>.  But some authorities suggest that in cases where the claimant can prove that a breach of duty materially increased the risk of the contraction of a particular disease and the disease occurred, the law should treat this as giving rise to the inference that the breach of duty was a cause of the disease rather than that the judge as the tribunal of fact should draw a factual inference.  I think this was the view of Lambert JA in <i>Haag v Marshall </i>when he said at p 379, "it is permissible to infer, as a matter of legal, though not necessarily logical, inference, that the material increase in risk arising from the breach of duty constituted a material contributing cause of the loss".  I think that King CJ was expressing the same view when he said in <i>Birkholz v RJ Gilbertson Pty Ltd</i> at p 130 that "the law treats that increase in risk as a sufficient basis, in the absence of evidence showing how the infection occurred, for an inference that the omission of the precautions materially contributed to the contracting of the disease."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107. A rule that such a legal inference should or can arise is, in effect, a principle of law.  I consider that such a rule is virtually indistinguishable from the approach of the Supreme Court of California in <i>Rutherford</i> where Baxter J stated that a jury should be directed that  "a particular asbestos-containing product is deemed to be a substantial factor in bringing about the injury if its contribution to the plaintiff or decedent's risk or probability of developing cancer was substantial …. the jury should be told that the plaintiff's or decedent's exposure to a particular product was a substantial factor in causing or bringing about the disease if in reasonable medical probability it was a substantial factor contributing to plaintiff's or decedent's risk of developing cancer."
