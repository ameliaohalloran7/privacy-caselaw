<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;65.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appellants' argument, following the approach favoured by the minority in <i>Qazi</i>, gives rise to the following conundrum.  They say that every person against whom a public authority seeks a possession order with respect to premises which he occupies as his home must be given a fair opportunity to raise as a defence to the proceedings that the excepting conditions in article 8(2) have not been met on the facts of his case and that, if such a defence is raised, it must be rebutted by the public authority.  But what if there is a statutory scheme which covers the case of an occupier, and the scheme itself is not challenged as being incompatible with his Convention rights?  What if that scheme prescribes conditions that must be met for the obtaining of a possession order by the public authority and the court finds that the requirements of the scheme have all been satisfied?  And what if there is no statutory scheme but all the requirements for the making of a possession order by the court under domestic property law, which is not challenged as being incompatible with the occupier's Convention rights, have been satisfied?  Lord Bingham says of these cases, that it would require highly exceptional circumstances before a defence under article 8(2) would avail the occupiers: paras 35, 36.  But what are these circumstances?  What is there in the jurisprudence of the Strasbourg court that tells us that, in those situations, there is anything left for the court to consider under that article?  Does that jurisprudence not teach us that the only question that can be raised under that article is whether the law itself is compatible with the occupier's Convention rights and that, so long as the law itself is compatible, it is open to the court to apply it to the facts of each case once the requirements of the law have been satisfied?  This is the point that the majority in <i>Qazi </i>were seeking to grapple with when they said that, because the domestic property law gave an unqualified right to immediate possession to the housing authority once service of the notice to quit had terminated the joint tenancy, there was nothing left for the court to consider under article 8 in that case and the judge had been right to strike out the defence and make the possession order.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66.&nbsp;&nbsp;The jurisprudence of the Strasbourg court indicates that three requirements must be met under article 8(2) in cases where a possession order is sought before it can be held that the interference with the exercise of the right to respect for the home that will result from the making of the possession order is justified.  Article 8(2) provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others."<p></p></ul>
<p>The first question is whether the interference is "in accordance with the law".  As article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which was adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1948 puts it, no one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his home.  The requirement that any interference must be in accordance with the law meets the point that it must not be arbitrary.  The next question is whether it has an aim that is identified by that paragraph as a legitimate one.  Satisfaction of the housing needs of others is regarded as a legitimate aim for this purpose, because it was intended to promote "the economic well-being of the country" and "the protection of the rights of … others": <i>Blecic v Croatia</i> (2004) 41 EHRR 185, para 58.  In <i>Connors v United Kingdom </i>(2004) 40 EHRR 189 the legitimate aim pursued by the interference was "the protection of the rights of … others" - other occupiers of the site and the public authority as its owner and manager: para 69.  It is hard to conceive of a case where this requirement would not be met where a landowner seeks to vindicate his right to obtain an order for possession of his property on the grounds that all the requirements that the law lays down for recovery of possession from its occupier by means of a court order have been satisfied.  The final question is whether interference in pursuit of that aim is "necessary in a democratic society".  The notion of necessity implies a pressing social need, and the measure employed must be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued: <i>Blecic</i>, para 59.  In this context a margin of appreciation is allowed to the government of the contracting state.  The scope of this margin of appreciation will depend not only on the aim of the interference but also, where the right to respect for the home is involved, the importance of that right to the individual: <i>Gillow v United Kingdom</i> (1986) 11 EHRR 335, para 48; <i>Blecic</i>, paras 59, 60.  This is the only area for legitimate debate in cases where the other requirements have been satisfied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;67.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as I shall seek to show in the following paragraphs, <i>Connors </i>is the only case where the Strasbourg court has held that the making of a possession order against an occupier in favour of a public authority in accordance with the requirements of domestic property law has failed to meet the third requirement in article 8(2).  It failed to do so in that case because the making of the order was not attended by the procedural safeguards that were required to establish that there was a proper justification for the interference with the applicant's right to respect for his private and family life and his home.  So it could not be regarded as justified by a pressing social need or as proportionate to the aim being pursued: para 95.  The point of that case, however, was that the law enabled the public authority to evict the applicant from the site which he had been given a licence to occupy without giving reasons which could be examined on their merits by an independent tribunal.  There were exceptional circumstances, but it was the law itself that was defective.  The margin of appreciation within which in spheres such as housing the judgment of the legislature will be respected did not save it from this criticism: para 82.  It leaves untouched cases, of which <i>Qazi</i> is an example, where the judgment of the legislature on issues of property law meets the third requirement of the article.</p>
<i><p><i>The correct starting point</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;68.&nbsp;&nbsp;The key to a proper understanding of the decision in <i>Qazi </i>is to be found in an appreciation of the fact that the question whether an interference with the respondent's right to respect for his home is permitted by article 8(2) of the European Convention for Human Rights raises a question of procedure as well as one of substance.  The question of substance is whether, on the facts of that case, the interference with the respondent's Convention right is permitted by article 8(2).  The question of procedure is whether it is necessary, as the appellants submit, for the question whether the excepting conditions in article 8(2) are met to be considered by the county court in every case where the court is asked to make a possession order.  In the view of the majority in <i>Qazi</i> the question does not require to be considered by the county court if the case is of a type where an application of the law shows that the outcome is a foregone conclusion, as it was in that case because the tenancy which gave the right to occupy had come to an end on the expiry of a notice to quit.  In that situation the exercise would have been a pointless one: paras 83, 84; 103; 152.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;69.&nbsp;&nbsp;The jurisprudence of the European court to which we must look for guidance as to how the question of substance should be answered does not provide much guidance as to how we should deal with the question of procedure.  It is a domestic problem.  It is not one which troubles the European court when it is asked to decide the issues remitted to it by article 41 of the Convention.  That is why the questions arising under article 8(1) and 8(2) are so often run together at the admissibility stage, with the result that the commission or the court, as the case may be, is content to address article 8(2) on the assumption that, or after only a cursory examination of the question whether, the right to respect for the home has been interfered with and has to be justified: <i>S v United Kingdom</i> (1986) 47 DR 274, para 4; <i>O'Rourke v United Kingdom </i>(Application No 39022/97), 26 June 2001, p 5; <i>Connors v United Kingdom </i>(2004) 40 EHRR 189, para 68 (the parties were agreed that the applicant's eviction disclosed an interference with his right to respect for his private life, family life and home); <i>Blecic v Croatia</i> (2004) 41 EHRR 185, para 54 (the court found, in the light of its finding in para 52 that the flat in question could reasonably be regarded as the applicant's home, that the termination of her specially protected tenancy of it by the domestic courts constituted an interference with her right to respect for her home).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70.&nbsp;&nbsp;The European court leaves questions of procedure to the contracting states.  Its only concern is that procedures are in place which enable individuals to assert their Convention rights where there is a live question as to whether or not they have been violated.  How this is to be done is a matter for the domestic system.  There is therefore no objection in principle, on Convention grounds, to a system which treats cases where a violation of article 8 of the Convention is likely to be a live issue differently from those where it is not.  Provided means are in place which enable those cases where this is a live question to be dealt with appropriately, a system which provides for all other cases where possession is sought to be dealt with simply and summarily will not be objectionable.  That, no doubt, is why, notwithstanding Lord Steyn's strong condemnation of it in para 27 of his dissenting opinion, the decision in <i>Qazi's</i> case which on its own facts did not disclose a breach of the Convention right has survived European scrutiny: see para 88.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;71.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the domestic legal order actions for possession are brought in the county court.  In Scotland they are brought under the summary cause procedure in the sheriff court.  This has important implications for the way issues as to whether an interference with the article 8 right is justified can be dealt with domestically.  These courts do not have unlimited jurisdiction.  They cannot make a declaration of incompatibility: see section 4(5) of the Human Rights Act 1998.  The question whether, and if so to what extent, they have a discretion to make or withhold an order for possession depends, and depends only, on the law which has to be applied to the facts of each case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72.&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of the decision in <i>Qazi</i> is that where an order for possession is made by the court in accordance with domestic property law the essence of the article 8(1) right to respect for the home will not be violated.  So the question whether the interference is permitted by article 8(2) is not a matter that need be considered by the county court.  The law itself provides the answer to that question.  The only matter which the court needs to consider is whether the requirements of the law and the procedural safeguards which it lays down for the protection of the occupier have been satisfied.  There may perhaps be cases where the party seeking to recover possession is a public authority and there is a live issue as to whether the requirements of the law and the procedural safeguards which it lays down fall short of what is required to satisfy the Convention right.  The law in this area is guided by the decisions of the European court in Strasbourg, and it must be acknowledged that it is capable of being adapted to new and as yet unexplored circumstances.  But cases of this kind are likely to occur only very rarely in practice.  As a general rule all the court need concern itself with are the requirements of the law and the relevant safeguards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73.&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost every working day judges sitting in the county and sheriff courts throughout the United Kingdom are presented with a long list of claims by public authorities seeking orders for possession of houses and other property forming part of their social housing stock against their occupiers.  Almost all of these cases are brought by local authorities, housing association trusts or registered social landlords with respect to property let to tenants on a secure tenancy under section 79 of the Housing Act 1985 and the equivalent legislation that operates in Scotland under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001.  For the most part they are cases where, assuming that one or other of the various grounds for possession which are laid down in Schedule 2 to the 1985 Act or its Scottish equivalent is established (and there is usually little or no dispute about this), the court cannot make an order for possession unless it considers it reasonable to make the order, or it is satisfied that suitable alternative accommodation will be available and it is also reasonable to make the order: see section 84(2) of the 1985 Act and section 16 of the 2001 Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74.&nbsp;&nbsp;The hearings on this issue are, for the most part, brief and to the point.  They are often unopposed, although an order cannot be made in accordance with the statute unless the party seeking possession can show that the statutory requirements are satisfied.  Where there is opposition the hearings are frequently adjourned for a short period for the parties to reach agreement.  Where agreement cannot be reached a full hearing is necessary.  But this rarely happens.  On the whole, despite the high volume of cases, the system appears to work well.  It is widely seen as fair, quick and reliable.  The legislation relating to housing in the public sector has been in place for over twenty years.  It was recently reviewed and the Scottish equivalent of the 1985 Act was re-enacted in 2001 with only minor modifications by the Scottish Parliament.  Nowhere has it been suggested in the Strasbourg case law that a public authority landlord's claim to possession which has been upheld on these grounds in accordance with the statute was a violation of the occupier's right to respect for his home under article 8 of the Convention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the other extreme, and much less frequent, are actions brought by the owners of land in the public or private sector for the recovery of possession of property over which the occupiers had no security of tenure at all.  These include licensees, other than those such as persons employed in agriculture whose licence to occupy is protected by statute, tenants such as those in property with a high rateable value who are excluded from the security of tenure which most tenants in the private sector have under the Housing Act 1988 and other statutes whose contractual right to occupation of the property has been terminated, occupiers under student or holiday lets and trespassers.  The absence of any statutory protection in these cases is the result of a deliberate decision by Parliament that the owner's right to recover possession should in these cases be unqualified, other than by the requirement that an order for possession must be sought from the court which ensures that procedures are in place to safeguard the rights of the occupier.  That was the position in <i>Connors </i>under the legislation that was then in force.  The significance of the decision in that case<i> </i>is that it has shown that cases falling within this end of the spectrum may raise issues as to whether the law itself satisfies the requirements of article 8(2).  This is not something that can be dealt with in the county court.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76.&nbsp;&nbsp;In between these extremes there are a wide variety of lettings of one kind or another controlled by statute or by the common law which it is impossible accurately to summarise in a few sentences.  The position is complex because it has been appreciated for many years that the law in this area has a strong social content.  By the end of the war of 1914-1918 many countries had enacted provisions controlling rent: John W Willis, "A Short History of Rent Control Laws" (1950) 36 Cornell LQ 54, 67-71.  By 1950 some 150 countries had adopted such laws: Megarry, <i>The Rent Acts</i>, 10th ed (1967), p 7.<i>  </i>Hand in hand with rent control goes security of tenure.  In <i>Feyereisel v Turnidge </i> [1952] 2 QB 29, 37, Denning LJ said that the guiding light through the darkness of the Rent Acts was to remember that they confer personal security of tenure on a tenant in respect of his home.  The same approach is taken almost every day in the county and sheriff courts as the judges apply the legislation by which Parliament controls the provision of housing in the public sector.  As Lord Porter observed in <i>Baker v Turner</i> [1950] AC 401, 417, the rules of formal logic must not be applied with too great strictness to legislation of this kind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77.&nbsp;&nbsp;The issues addressed by this legislation involve questions of social and economic policy where the choices that are to be made can easily be seen as falling within the discretionary area of judgment best left to the considered opinion of the legislature.  They include decisions as to the circumstances in which protection of tenure is not to be given to those who have no contractual right to occupy as well those in which there is to be security of tenure, and if so, on what terms.  Cases falling into this category are typical of those where the Strasbourg court will respect the judgment of the contracting state.  They are most unlikely to raise an issue as to whether the right to possession which is afforded by domestic law violates the article 8 Convention right.  If they do, the county court in the exercise of its ordinary jurisdiction should, so far as it is possible for it to do so, deal with it: see para 109.  But no example has been referred to in the Strasbourg jurisprudence where a claim to possession in such a case has failed on article 8(2) grounds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the background to the claim by the appellants in these two appeals that the orders for possession which were made against them in the county court violated their rights under article 8(1) of the Convention.</p>
<i><p><i>The appeals</i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the <i>Lambeth</i> appeal the properties in question are owed by Lambeth.  The appellants were let into possession of them by the London and Quadrant Housing Trust ("LQHT") at various times from about 1981, initially under an informal arrangement with Lambeth and from 1986 under the authority of a licence which was replaced in 1995 by ten year leases granted by Lambeth to LQHT which were subject to a break clause providing for early termination by either party.  In 1999 Lambeth gave notice to terminate these leases.  The county court judge, HH Judge Roger Cooke, held that the effect of the notices was that Lambeth had an unqualified right to possession and that, as the appellants were not tenants of Lambeth, they had no security of tenure under the 1985 Act.  The defence under article 8 was struck out.  The Court of Appeal, applying <i>Qazi</i>, dismissed the appeal: <i>Kay v Lambeth London Borough Council</i> [2005] QB 352.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the <i>Leeds</i> appeal the respondent local authority is the freehold owner of a recreation ground onto which the appellants, who are gypsies, moved without the respondents' consent on 13 June 2004.  The respondents issued possession proceedings against them two days later on 15 June 2004 on the ground that they were trespassers.  It was not disputed that the appellants had entered onto and remained in occupation of the land without any licence from or consent of the respondents.  The case having been transferred to the High Court, HH Judge Bush held that the appellants had no defence to the claim for possession under article 8.   The Court of Appeal held that the decision in <i>Qazi </i>was incompatible with <i>Connors</i>.  But, regarding itself as bound to follow the decision in <i>Qazi</i>, it dismissed the appeal: [2005] 1 WLR 1825.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81.&nbsp;&nbsp;The following points are common to both cases.  First, the claim by the owners of the properties is that the appellants have no right to remain in occupation of them.  They seek to vindicate their right, as owners of the land, to exclusive occupation of the properties.  Secondly, the owners in each case are a public authority.  They are under a statutory duty to use the property which they own for public purposes - in <i>Leeds'</i> case as land held for use as a public recreation ground, in <i>Lambeth's</i> case as part of the land held for use as part of its social housing stock.  Thirdly, as they are public authorities, they are under a duty not to act in a manner that is incompatible with the appellants' Convention rights: section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998.  Fourthly, the factual circumstances are different from those which were before the House in <i>Qazi</i>.  In neither of these cases was there a right to possession of the property granted by the owner of the land which under domestic law was no longer enforceable against it by the occupier.</p>
<i><p><i>The article 8(2) issue</i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Connors v United Kingdom</i> (2004) 40 EHRR 189 the European Court of Human Rights held that the eviction of the applicant and his family, who were gypsies, from a local authority gypsy site which they were licensed to occupy so long as they did not cause a nuisance was a violation of article 8 because it had not been attended by the requisite procedural safeguards.  The appellants submit that this case shows the decision of the majority in <i>Harrow London Borough Council v Qazi</i> [2004] 1 AC 983 was wrong, and that the decision in <i>Qazi</i> should be departed from because it is incompatible with what the European court said in <i>Connors</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83.&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts in these two cases were different, as indeed are the facts in these two appeals.  But the scope of the argument is such as to raise again the question of procedure to which the majority drew attention in <i>Qazi's </i>case.  In para 5.74 of the Law Commission's Consultation Paper on Renting Homes I; Status and Security (Consultation Paper No 162, March 2002), Part V, The Impact of Human Rights Law, it is said that a procedure which gives a discretion to the county court by requiring it to consider whether having regard to article 8(2) the making of an order would be proportionate is inimical to the purpose of providing a quick and reliable way of evicting tenants whose leases have by the operation of law been terminated.  This conclusion has all the more force if the case is one where the person in possession never had a right to occupy the land in the first place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Luba QC for the appellants submitted that it was a norm of Convention law that every case of a person's dispossession from his home had to be justified under article 8(2).  He said that a merits review was required in every case, and that there was no room for a short cut.  It was not sufficient for the public authority to show that it had an absolute right to possession.  Its claim for possession must be accompanied in every case by a pleaded case that the claim for possession was justified under article 8(2).  Mr Sales for the First Secretary of State submitted that in principle it was open to any defendant to proceedings for possession to advance an article 8(2) defence in the county court.  He differed from Mr Luba in that he accepted that in the vast majority of cases it would be sufficient for the public authority simply to assert its absolute right to possession.  But he maintained that in every case - even in those cases where the statutory reasonableness test had to be satisfied by a housing authority - there was a balance that had to be struck under article 8(2) of the Convention.  This was a matter about which the county court had to be satisfied in every case, notwithstanding the fact that in the overwhelming majority of cases this would, as Lord Bingham points out, be both burdensome and futile: para 29.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85.&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite Mr Luba's assurances to the contrary, there are substantial grounds for thinking that, if it were to be open to a defendant to raise this issue in the county court in every case where the premises are occupied as his home, this would have serious consequences for the system which Parliament has chosen for dealing with possession cases - as the Law Commission has pointed out.  He would have to be given a fair opportunity to advance this defence, as the article 8 right carries with it the right to respect for the interest safeguarded in the decision-making process.  So he would have to be permitted to plead the defence if he wished to do so.  This would have consequences both for the public authority, which would have to rebut it, and for the court which would have to consider and dispose of the issue in every case where it was raised.  This is the procedural problem under the domestic system which confronts us, as it did in <i>Qazi</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any procedure that requires consideration of the article 8(2) issue on its merits would be bound to delay the proceedings in one way or another.  It is preferable, wherever possible, that the matter should be dealt with in the county court, rather than by adjourning the proceedings to enable the defendant to apply in the High Court for permission for judicial review of the decision to apply for the possession order.  A defendant has the right to contend in his defence that the decision of a public authority to recover possession was one which no reasonable person could consider justifiable, as Lord Fraser of Tullybelton explained in <i>Wandsworth London Borough Council v Winder</i> [1985]  1 AC 461, 506C-D, 509E-H.  But it has to be borne in mind that it would not have been open to the county court to hold that the claim by the public authority in <i>Connors </i>to seek to recover possession was unlawful as it was invoking a right to possession that was provided by statute: see section 6(2)(b) of the Human Rights Act 1998, which provides that section 6(1) does not apply to an act if the authority was acting so as to give effect to or enforce provisions under primary legislation which cannot be read or given effect to in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights.  If the ground of challenge is that the legislation is incompatible with article 8 and the statute cannot be read or given effect in a way that is compatible with that article, the county court judge must make the order required by the legislation notwithstanding the incompatibility.  The defendant can, if he wishes, apply to the High Court for a declaration of incompatibility.  But it would serve no good purpose for the proceedings in the county court to be adjourned to allow him to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>R (Ullah) v Special Adjudicator</i> [2004] UKHL 26; [2004] 2 AC 323, para 20 Lord Bingham of Cornhill acknowledged that courts should, in the absence of some special circumstances, follow any clear and constant jurisprudence of the Strasbourg court:</p>
<p></p><ul>"This reflects the fact that the Convention is an international instrument, the correct interpretation of which can be authoritatively expounded only by the Strasbourg court.  From this it follows that a national court subject to a duty such as that imposed by section 2 [of the Human Rights Act 1998] should not without strong reason dilute or weaken the effect of the Strasbourg case law.  It is indeed unlawful under section 6 of the 1998 Act for a public authority, including a court, to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right.  It is of course open to member states to provide for rights more generous than those guaranteed by the Convention, but such provision should not be the product of interpretation of the Convention by national courts, since the meaning of the Convention should be uniform throughout the states party to it.  The duty of national courts is to keep pace with the Strasbourg jurisprudence as it evolves over time: no more, but certainly no less."<p></p></ul>
