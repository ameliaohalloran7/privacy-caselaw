<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108. Therefore, whilst the decision taken by the House in <i>McGhee</i> may have been based on an inference of fact, I consider that it is in the interests of justice that it should now be held as a matter of law that the approach taken by the House in <i>McGhee</i> is one which should be followed by trial judges in cases such as the present ones where the claimant can prove that the employer's breach of duty materially increased the risk of him contracting a particular disease and the disease occurred, but where in the state of existing medical knowledge he is unable to prove by medical evidence that the breach was a cause of the disease.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109. Whilst there is very little practical difference between the two views I prefer, with respect, to take the view that the <i>McGhee</i> approach is based on the drawing of a factual or legal inference leading to the conclusion that the breach of duty was a cause of the disease rather than that the decision in <i>McGhee</i> laid down a new principle that, in cases where medical evidence as to the precise nature of the causation cannot be adduced, the material increase in the risk is taken in law to be a cause of the disease without reliance on a factual or legal inference.  As well as the passages in the speeches of Lord Simon of Glaisdale, Lord Kilbrandon and Lord Salmon to which I have referred in paragraphs 96 and 97 of this opinion I incline to the view that Lord Reid's references to the legal concept of causation being based "on the practical way in which the ordinary man's mind works in the everyday affairs of life" and to a "broad and practical viewpoint" (see p 5 B) point more to the drawing of an inference than to the laying down of a new principle of law.  Moreover I think that in his speech in <i>McGhee,</i> at p 7, Lord Wilberforce recognised that there were two ways in which injustice to the pursuer could be avoided:  one way was by drawing an inference (which he rejected in that case as a fiction), and the other way was, in effect, by reversing the burden of proof on causation.  But as Lord Bridge observed in <i>Wilsher,</i> at p 1087 G, there was no support for the reversal of the burden of proof in the other speeches.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110. In some cases in other jurisdictions (as in the hunting cases where two hunters fire negligently at the same time and the claimant, struck by one shot, cannot prove which shot struck him) the courts, in order to avoid injustice, have expressly held that the burden of proof on causation should be reversed.  In <i>Summers v Tice</i> 199 2d 1 (1948) Carter J delivering the judgment of the Supreme Court of California stated, at page 4 "a requirement that the burden of proof on that subject be shifted to defendants becomes manifest";  see also the majority judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Cook v Lewis</i> [1952] 1 DLR 1, 18.  In the hunting cases and in cases analogous to them justice may well require that the burden of proof be reversed, but in relation to cases of industrial disease there appears to be no support in the English authorities, other than in Lord Wilberforce's speech in <i>McGhee</i>, for the reversal of the burden of proof as a matter of law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111. Where the claimant proves that the breach of duty materially increased the risk of the onset of the disease from which he suffers, it will be open to the defendant to adduce evidence and to argue that even though the breach of duty materially increased the risk, nevertheless the evidence adduced on its behalf displaces the inference of causation.  Therefore I turn to consider whether the medical evidence relied on by the defendants displaces the inference which should otherwise be drawn that the prolonged exposure to asbestos dust which increased the risk of contracting mesothelioma materially contributed to the onset of the disease in the three employees.  The evidence upon which the defendants rely is that it is as probable as not that the transformation of a normal mesothelial cell to a cancerous cell could be due to the action of a single asbestos fibre or of a few asbestos fibres.  In the light of this evidence the defendants submit that it was as probable as not that each employee contracted the disease during the course of his employment with only one employer who cannot be identified.  Therefore the evidence that each successive period of exposure augments the risk that the disease will occur should not give rise to the inference that the exposure to asbestos dust created by the default of each employer was the cause of the disease.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112. I am unable to accept that submission.  The other part of the evidence as to the mechanism by which asbestos causes mesothelioma is that it is as probable as not that the onset of the disease could be due to the action of multiple fibres.  When this is added to the evidence that each successive period of exposure augments the risk that the disease will occur, and that mesothelioma usually occurs in persons who have inhaled millions of asbestos fibres in the course of their work, I think that the inference of causation is not displaced by the evidence upon which the defendants rely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113. In the course of his evidence in the trial of the action brought by Mrs Fairchild her medical witness, Dr Rudd, referred to the common sense conclusion on the question whether Mr Fairchild's mesothelioma was caused by one fibre or by prolonged exposure to many fibres.  I set out a portion of the transcript so that his observation on common sense can be seen in its context.  I add that I do not think that his evidence departs from the agreed statement of facts in any of the three cases:</p>
<p></p><ul>"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-examined by MR HOGARTH<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>MR HOGARTH:  (To the witness) Dr Rudd, you are (inaudible) deal with the situation (?) put to you by Mr Stewart, where he suggested that if you assume that there are two equal exposers it is impossible to say which one produced or exposed to the fatal fibre.  Can you say that one or other, or both?<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's not possible to say it was one or another, or both.  It could have been one.  It could have been the other.  It could have been both if there was more than one fibre involved.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;It has to be one, or the other, or both?<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;What is known for certain is that together they were responsible for the malignant transformation.  The situation is analogous to causation of lung cancer by cigarette smoking.  The cigarette smoke causes a [series] of mutations which, together, give rise to the lung cancer.  One could say, theoretically, that last mutation was caused by a molecule of tar from one cigarette, but it would not be in accordance with common sense to suggest that the man who had smoked for thirty years and developed lung cancer got it as a result of smoking one cigarette rather than another.  The cancer is the end result of the sum total of smoking.  Mesothelioma is the end result of the sum total of asbestos exposure.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cross-examined by MR STEWART<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>MR STEWART:  My Lord, I am a little concerned your Lordship may possibly be misled by that last answer.  I wonder if I may clarify it?  (To the witness) Dr Rudd, that last statement, that it is the sum total of the exposure to asbestos, is strictly on the hypothesis that more (inaudible) which was not proven that as asbestos fibres, as opposed to one asbestos fibre, is more likely to have caused it?<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a statement based upon the facts which can be known with certainty.  The facts which can be known with certainty are that asbestos causes mesothelioma.  The risk that mesothelioma will occur increases with the quantity of asbestos inhaled.  Mr Fairchild was exposed to a quantity of asbestos from various sources.  As a result, he developed mesothelioma.  The rest is speculation.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;You are not, I assume, [resiling from]  the fact that you agreed that it is possible that the risk lies with exposure simply because each fibre has a chance in initiating the fatal (?) mutation?<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;That's possible.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is equally likely, as you said before, that it is the one fibre out of all those millions that it is equally likely to be that, as more than one fibre?<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we're moving on to mechanisms, now, as opposed to observable facts."<p></p></ul>
<p>I consider that the common sense view expressed by Dr Rudd is the one which a court should take and is in conformity with the opinion of Lord Reid in <i>McGhee,</i> at p 5B, that the issue of causation in cases such as these should be assessed from a broad and practical viewpoint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114. The application of the <i>McGhee</i> principle in these cases and in similar cases, where successive employers of an employee have been in breach of duty to take steps to guard against an industrial disease which the employee  contracts, may mean that an employer may be held liable when in reality, if medical science were able to be certain as to how the employee's disease started, it was not fibres inhaled during the employment with it which caused the onset of the disease.  But if the <i>McGhee</i> principle is not applied the consequence will be that an employee who undoubtedly sustained the disease because one or some or all of his employers were in breach of duty to take steps to guard against the onset of the disease, will recover no damages because in the present state of medical knowledge the doctors are unable to say which breach of duty by an employer caused the disease.  In these circumstances I have no doubt that justice is better served by requiring an employer, who has been in breach of duty and who has materially increased the risk of its innocent employee incurring the disease, to pay damages than by ruling that the employee who has sustained a grievous disease can recover nothing.  Therefore I am in respectful agreement with the opinion of Lord Wilberforce in <i>McGhee,</i> at p 6F:</p>
<p></p><ul>"And if one asks which of the parties, the workman or the employers, should suffer from this inherent evidential difficulty, the answer as a matter of policy or justice should be that it is the creator of the risk who, ex hypothesi must be taken to have foreseen the possibility of damage, who should bear its consequences."<p></p></ul>
<p>This view is also well put by Lambert JA in <i>Haag v Marshall,</i> at p 379:</p>
<p></p><ul>"as between an innocent plaintiff and a defendant who has committed a breach of duty to the plaintiff and by so doing materially increased the risk of loss to the plaintiff, in a situation where it is impossible, as a practical matter, to prove whether the breach of duty caused the loss, it is more in keeping with a common sense approach to causation as a tool of justice, to let the liability fall on the defendant."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115. In its judgment the Court of Appeal stated, at [2002] 1 WLR 1052, 1080, in para 103:</p>
<p></p><ul>"the claimant is wholly unable to prove on the balance of probabilities that that period of employment had any causative relationship with the inception of the disease.  This is far too weighty an edifice to build on the slender foundations of <i>McGhee v National Coal Board </i>[1973] 1 WLR 1, and Lord Bridge has told us in <i>Wilsher v Essex Area Health Authority</i> [1988] AC 1074 that <i>McGhee</i> established no new principle of law at all.  If we were to accede to the claimants' arguments, we would be distorting the law to accommodate the exigencies of a very hard case.  We would be yielding to a contention that all those who have suffered injury after being exposed to a risk of that injury from which someone else should have protected them should be able to recover compensation even when they are quite unable to prove who was the culprit."<p></p></ul>
<p>For the reasons which I have given I am unable, with respect, to agree with the opinion of the Court of Appeal that the claimants were unable to prove on the balance of probabilities that there was a causative relationship between a period of employment during which there was exposure to asbestos dust at the onset of the disease.  The Court of Appeal also stated, at pp 1080-1081, in para 104:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In our judgment, what Lord Reid said in <i>McGhee</i> [1973] 1 WLR 1, at pp 4G to 5B, in the passage of his speech which forms the basis of Mr Langstaff's argument, must be read in the context of that case.  There was only one causative agent, brick dust, and only one possible tortfeasor, Mr McGhee's employer.  In that situation Lord Reid was prepared to find causation established in the absence of scientific proof.  Lord Bridge in <i>Wilsher</i> has made it clear that the same technique cannot be used where there is more than one causative agent.  It seems to us that for the same reasons the same technique cannot be used where there is more than one tortfeasor, unless of course the evidence establishes, on the balance of probabilities, that the disease was caused by cumulative exposure."<p></p></ul>
<p>I am unable to agree with this view because I consider that where there is only one causative agent (in this case asbestos dust) the <i>McGhee </i>principle can apply notwithstanding that there are a number of tortfeasors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116. Therefore applying the <i>McGhee</i> principle I concluded that the breach of duty by each defendant materially increasing the risk of the onset of mesothelioma in Mr Fox, Mr Fairchild and Mr Matthews involved a substantial contribution to the disease suffered by them and it was for this reason that I allowed the appeals.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117. I observe that no argument was addressed to the House that in the event of the claimants succeeding there should be an apportionment of damages because the breaches of duty of a number of employers had contributed to cause the disease and therefore the damages awarded against a defendant should be a proportion of the full sum of damages which the claimant would have recovered if he (or the claimant's husband) had been employed by only one employer for the whole of his working life.  Therefore each defendant is liable in full for a claimant's damages, although a defendant can seek contribution against another employer liable for causing the disease.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118. In my respectful opinion in <i>Wilsher</i> the House was right to hold that the majority of the Court of Appeal should not have extended the <i>McGhee</i> principle to apply where there were five possible candidates which could have caused the plaintiff's blindness.  I consider that, as the Vice-Chancellor observed at [1987] 730, 780E-F, the justification for holding a defendant liable is that the defendant created a risk and that the injury suffered by the plaintiff fell squarely within that risk. Subject to this observation on the decision in <i>Wilsher</i>, I wish to confine my opinion to the circumstances of these cases.  It may be necessary in the future to consider whether the <i>McGhee</i> principle should be applied to other cases, but such decisions will have to be taken when such cases arise.  </p>
<p><b>LORD RODGER OF EARLSFERRY</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119. These appeals concern the liability of employers for mesothelioma which employees developed as a result of being exposed to asbestos dust in the course of their employment with more than one employer.  The Court of Appeal held ([2002] 1 WLR 1052) that the claimants had not proved that the defendants whom they had sued had caused or materially contributed to the mesothelioma afflicting the men in respect of whom the actions had been raised.  Their claims accordingly failed, as all similar claims in courts throughout the United Kingdom would have failed if the Court of Appeal's approach had prevailed.  On 16 May 2002, however, your Lordships reported to the House that the appeals should be allowed.  I agree with the reasons given in the speech of my noble and learned friend, Lord Bingham of Cornhill, for allowing the appeals, but I have thought it right to explain in my own words why I differed from the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal on this important matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120. I gratefully adopt the account of the facts and issues given by Lord Bingham of Cornhill.  As he has explained, the Court of Appeal reached their conclusion on the basis of the expert medical evidence, which was essentially the same in each of the cases.  Mesothelioma arises when one of the mesothelial cells in the pleura is damaged and undergoes a malignant transformation.  While it is certain that asbestos fibres play a role in triggering this transformation, it is not known whether the triggering mechanism involves a single asbestos fibre or multiple asbestos fibres.  In the state of medical knowledge today, the one is as likely as the other.  Once the malignant transformation has been triggered, the malignancy develops in a process that may involve some six or seven genetic changes.  Asbestos may have a role to play at one or more of these stages, but again there is no evidence that the action of asbestos is more or less likely at one stage than at another.  In summary ([2002] 1 WLR 1052, 1064, para 26) therefore,</p>
<p></p><ul>"it could not be said whether a single fibre of asbestos was more or less likely to have caused the disease, alternatively whether more than one fibre was more or less likely to have caused the disease.  In the latter event, it could not be shown that it was more likely than not that those fibres came from more than one source.  In other words, none of these scenarios could be proved on the balance of probabilities.  Similarly, it could not be proved on the balance of probabilities that any one man's mesothelioma was caused cumulatively by exposure to asbestos dust in more than one employment."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121. Since it is possible that mesothelioma is triggered by a single fibre of asbestos and since the disease, once contracted, is not made worse by the extent of any subsequent exposure to asbestos dust, the disease differs, for example, from pneumoconiosis or asbestosis where the severity of the condition will depend, to some extent at least, on the amount of dust to which the victim has been exposed.  In pneumoconiosis and asbestosis, therefore, by contrast with mesothelioma, it can be said in an appropriate case that the severity of the particular victim's condition will have been caused cumulatively by exposure to dust in more than one employment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122. Equally importantly, however, "the risk that mesothelioma will occur increases in relation to the total dose of asbestos received" ([2002] 1 WLR 1052, 1064A, para 25).  Why this should be so is not known.  It may be because the build-up of asbestos progressively weakens and eventually overwhelms the body's defences, with the result that a mesothelioma then develops.  But this is now thought to be unlikely.  The alternative explanation would seem to be that the greater the number of asbestos fibres taken into the body, the greater are the chances that one of them will trigger a malignant transformation.  Whatever may be the reason for the increase in risk, since all the defendants exposed the men concerned to an atmosphere containing a substantial amount of asbestos dust, they all increased the risk that the men would develop mesothelioma.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123. All of the men were employed by more than one employer.  This is, of course, typical of the employment patterns of men who have been exposed to asbestos, whether in fitting out or stripping buildings and ships or in casual dock labour, handling cargoes of asbestos.  Mesothelioma takes at least ten, and up to forty, years to manifest itself.  When the disease does eventually show itself, therefore, the men inevitably find it difficult to identify more than a few of the employers for whom they worked;  after so many years employment records tend to be relatively few and far between.  The claimants in these cases accordingly sued only those employers whom they could identify and who - or whose successors - were still in existence.  They could do no more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;124. Because of the current state of medical knowledge about the aetiology of mesothelioma, it was impossible for the claimants to prove on the balance of probabilities that the men's illness had been triggered by a fibre or fibres inhaled while working with any particular employer and, more especially, while working with the particular defendants whom they had sued.  For that reason the Court of Appeal rejected their claims.  The claimants thus failed because of the particular stage which medical science has reached.  Research has gone far enough for scientists to be able to see, at a microscopic level, what the possible mechanisms may be, but not far enough for them to determine which is the one that actually operates.  In future more may be known.  As Mr Stewart rightly observed, in the course of submissions that were both helpful and sensitive, this may change the way in which the law treats such cases.  But the House must deal with these appeals on the basis of the evidence as to medical knowledge today and leave the problems of the future to be resolved in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125. At the hearing counsel for the appellants simply contended that the appeals should be allowed and that the respondents should be found liable in damages.  The contentions for the respondents were to the opposite effect.  No argument was advanced to the effect that, if they were held liable, the defendants' liability should be reduced or apportioned in some way to reflect an assessment of the chances that the particular defendants, rather than other employers, were actually responsible for the exposure that led to the development of the claimants' mesothelioma.  Indeed it was said that no such assessment, even on a rough basis, was possible.  Counsel accepted accordingly that, if liable at all, the defendants would be jointly and severally liable for the whole of the damage done to the claimants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;126. Cases on the liability of employers to their employees who develop industrial diseases have been coming before the courts for many years.  At the hearing counsel cited a number of well-known decisions of your Lordships' House in this sphere.  Although the battles in those cases were hard fought, both for the employees and for the employers, for the most part the descendants of the protagonists now acknowledge in tranquillity what was won and what was lost in the struggle:  the resulting decisions have long been accepted as shaping the law that governs these matters.  <i>McGhee v National Coal Board</i> [1973] 1 WLR 1;  1973 SC(HL) 37 is an exception.  It dealt with the issue of causation in a case where, as here, the medical experts could not fully explain how the pursuer's condition had started.  Controversy persists as to why the pursuer, having lost his claim for damages for dermatitis in the Court of Session, won it in this House.  In <i>Wilsher v Essex Area Health Authority</i> [1988] AC 1074 the House sought, with only limited success, to put an end to that controversy.  Giving the unanimous views of the Appellate Committee, Lord Bridge indicated that in <i>McGhee</i> the pursuer had won his case simply because the House had been prepared to draw from the primary facts an inference that the defenders' wrongful failure to provide showers had materially contributed to the onset of his dermatitis.  On that basis <i>McGhee</i> laid down no new legal principle and was nothing more than a decision on a matter of fact, of no relevance for the present case.  On behalf of the appellants Sir Sydney Kentridge and Mr Langstaff questioned that explanation of <i>McGhee</i>, however.  They submitted that the majority of their Lordships had proceeded on the principle that, in the circumstances of that case, proof that the defenders' wrongdoing had increased the risk of the pursuer developing dermatitis was to be equated with proof that the defenders had materially contributed to his dermatitis.  If applied to the facts in the present cases, that principle would determine the appeals in favour of the appellants.  For their part, counsel for the respondents frankly, and in my view correctly, acknowledged that if the House applied that approach in these cases, then the appeals must indeed succeed.  Counsel contended, however, that the House should follow the interpretation of <i>McGhee</i> adopted in <i>Wilsher</i>.  On that basis the appeals must fail since, on the evidence, the claimants had not proved that the defendants had caused or materially contributed to their mesothelioma.  The proper interpretation of <i>McGhee</i> is therefore critical to the disposal of these appeals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;127. To appreciate the novelty of the issue confronting the House in <i>McGhee</i> and the possible significance of that decision for the present proceedings, it is necessary to go back to <i>Bonnington Castings Ltd v Wardlaw </i>[1956] AC 613, the starting-point of much of the law in this field.  The pursuer sued his employers for damages for contracting pneumoconiosis as a result of inhaling air containing minute particles of silica.  The evidence showed that the dust in the workshop was caused by the operation of two types of equipment, the pneumatic hammer at which the pursuer worked and certain swing grinders.  Given the technology available at the time, the defenders were not at fault in the operation of the pneumatic hammer nor in failing to extract the dust which it threw off.  They were, however, at fault inasmuch as the apparatus for intercepting the dust from the swing grinders was choked.  The First Division of the Court of Session (Lord President Clyde, Lord Carmont and Lord Russell) held that the pursuer could succeed only if he could show that the sole source of his disease was the dust from the swing grinders.  The majority (the Lord President dissenting) applied a reverse onus of proof and so held that the pursuer had indeed proved this (1955 SC 320).  The defenders appealed and the House held that the majority had been wrong to apply the reverse onus of proof.  Lord Reid said ([1956] AC 613, 620):</p>
<p></p><ul>"In my judgment, the employee must in all cases prove his case by the ordinary standard of proof in civil actions:  he must make it appear at least that on a balance of probabilities the breach of duty caused or materially contributed to his injury."<p></p></ul>
<p>He went on, however, to hold that the pursuer did not need to show that the dust from the swing grinders had been the sole source of his illness.  It appeared to Lord Reid ([1956] AC 613, 621) that:</p>
<p></p><ul>"the source of his disease was the dust from both sources, and the real question is whether the dust from the swing grinders materially contributed to the disease.  What is a material contribution must be a question of degree.  A contribution which comes within the exception de minimis non curat lex is not material, but I think that any contribution which does not fall within that exception must be material.  I do not see how there can be something too large to come within the de minimis principle but yet too small to be material."<p></p></ul>
<p>Lord Keith of Avonholm observed ([1956] AC 613, 626):</p>
<p></p><ul>"It was the atmosphere inhaled by the pursuer that caused his illness and it is impossible, in my opinion, to resolve the components of that atmosphere into particles caused by the fault of the defenders and particles not caused by the fault of the defenders, as if they were separate and independent factors in his illness, as if they were separate and independent factors in his illness.  Prima facie the particles are acting cumulatively, and I think the natural inference is that had it not been for the cumulative effect the pursuer would not have developed pneumoconiosis when he did and might not have developed it at all."<p></p></ul>
<i>
</i><p>The House held that it had been established that the swing grinders had indeed contributed a quota of dust that was not negligible and that they had therefore helped to produce his disease.  On that footing the House dismissed the appeal.</p>
