<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sempra's damages claim</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;225.&nbsp;&nbsp;Against this background, I turn to Sempra's claim for damages caused by the breach of Community law consisting in the enactment and/or enforcement of the relevant ACT legislation. It is common ground that Sempra has in this respect a claim for, or analogous to a claim for, breach of statutory duty, in other words a tortious claim. The offending legislation required Sempra to "advance" to the Inland Revenue money on account of corporation tax, which would in due course be credited and offset against actual mainstream corporation tax. Payment was accelerated (or levied "prematurely" as the European Court put it - cf paragraphs 87 and 88), and the Inland Revenue thus acquired the use of the money for a period before mainstream corporation tax would otherwise have been paid. The loss of use of the money over a period as a result of the premature levy of the tax was, the European Court said, not an ancillary aspect but "the very objective" of the claim (paragraph 87).  That such loss would be caused was plainly foreseeable and not at all remote. In these circumstances, nothing in <i>La Pintada</i> precludes a tortious claim for damages consisting of the loss of interest on the ACT paid during the periods until such ACT could be and was set off against mainstream corporation tax. The damages should in principle be such as would compensate Sempra fully for its foreseeable loss in respect of the period up to set-off.  I add however that, if the unlawful legislation had required an <i>outright</i> payment not capable of recovery by set-off, this would not affect the strength of any claim which Sempra might plead and prove in domestic law for damages for loss of interest.  It would merely mean that Sempra had a claim for damages composed of both the lost principal and the lost interest. The position would not be significantly different from that of a company which in the present ACT context never incurred mainstream corporation tax enabling it to achieve a set-off of ACT paid. It too could in domestic law plead and prove first the loss of the principal and second any interest loss. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;226.&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge had before him extensive evidence about Sempra's financial position at the relevant times, which showed that it was in a net borrowing position. He was evidently satisfied that Sempra had incurred properly recoverable loss of interest on a compound basis. On one view he should or might have sought to assess Sempra's actual loss by detailed calculation. He decided instead that "full compensation" would be achieved by taking a conventional rate and by compounding that. There has been no challenge in this connection to his decision to take a conventional rate. As the Court of Appeal noted, a conventional rate will only give rise to full compensation in conjunction with compounding at the periodic intervals used in arriving at the rate. The commercial and indeed moral case for compounding was recognised on both sides of the decision in the <i>Westdeutsche </i>case [1996] AC 669: see per Lord Goff at p.691E-F, Lord Browne-Wilkinson at pa.717D and Lord Woolf at p.720B-C. The conclusion of the courts below in the present case that there should be compounding for the period until set off of the ACT is not open to challenge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;227.&nbsp;&nbsp;Park J drew a line at the point when set off occurred. After that point, he said that interest was only recoverable on a simple interest basis under s.35A of the 1981 Act. He said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"46 ….. the claim for interest attributable to the post-utilisation period is different. It is truly ancillary: it is a claim for interest on the primary loss, and it is a claim for interest over the period between the time when the primary loss accrued and the time when judgment is given for the primary loss to be paid to Sempra by way of restitution or compensation. It may seem anomalous that Sempra's recovery for the period from payment of the ACT until utilisation is in an amount computed by reference to compound interest, but its recovery for the period from utilisation until judgment is in an amount computed by reference to simple interest. However, the anomaly lies in the wording of s.35A of the 1981 Act. That section is the source of the claim for interest for the post-utilisation period, and it plainly restricts the interest to simple interest."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;228.&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been no appeal against this conclusion, and we did not hear argument on its correctness. I shall not therefore express any view about that, either way. It does mean that the longer the period before set-off, the longer the period during which compound interest is recoverable by way of damages. If no set-off had been possible, the period would have continued to judgment. But equally there is a point when, as in the case of <i>President of India v. Lips</i>,<i> </i>damages are being claimed for non-payment of damages. </p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sempra's restitutionary claim</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;229.&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn to Sempra's alternative restitutionary claim in respect of the Revenue's unjust enrichment. Since Sempra's damages claim for compound interest succeeds, there is no European compulsion that Sempra should have any restitutionary claim to interest, either compound or even simple (cf paragraphs 199 and 200 above). But Sempra advances the two domestic law heads for such a claim, the second offering a limitation advantage, as identified in paragraph 192 above. The first relies on <i>Woolwich Equitable Building Society v. Inland Revenue Commissioners</i> [1993] AC 70, where the Revenue, after action brought, repaid tax which had been levied under ultra vires regulations. An award of simple interest was made under s. 35A in respect of the period prior to repayment. No consideration was given to compounding. The second relies on the House's decisions in<i> Kleinwort Benson Ltd. v. Lincoln C.C. </i>[1999] 2 AC 349 and <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Group Plc v. Inland Revenue Commissioners</i> [2007] 1 AC 558 on the basis that Sempra made its ACT payments under a mistake of law. Mr Glick submitted that there could not under this head be any European requirement to award compound interest, but, since I consider that there is no such requirement in any context, the argument becomes irrelevant. There is no reason why this head of recovery should not be available in domestic law, but the question is whether it can yield interest, either simple or, as Sempra submits, compound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;230.&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of each head, Sempra's primary case, as developed on the resumed hearing, is that the Revenue should pay a reasonable price for the use of the money which it had. On that basis, Sempra continues to support the judge's and the Court of Appeal's conventional, market-based borrower's rate, which was agreed between the parties in the different context of a claim for damages or for "restitution" in respect of Sempra's loss of use of the money.  Sempra seeks to distinguish a claim on this basis from a claim to "disgorgement", which it accepts would involve investigation into what benefit the Revenue (or Treasury) actually had from its use of the money.  In support of its preferred former basis of claim, Sempra referred to cases such as <i>Whitwham v. Westminster Brymbo Coal and Coke Company </i>[1896] 2 CH 538, <i>Watson Laidlaw &amp; Co. v. Pott Cassells &amp; Williamson </i>(1914) 31 RPC 104, 119-120 per Lord Shaw, <i>Inverugie Investments Ltd. v. Hackett</i> [1995] 1 WLR 713 and <i>Experience Hendrix LLC v. PPX Enterprises Inc </i>[2003] EWCA Civ 323; [2003] 1 All ER (Comm) 830. These are all cases recognising the right to recover a reasonable price for the unauthorised use of various forms of property, irrespective of whether or not the claimant had lost thereby. These are all cases of what I will for present purposes (without entering into analytical controversy) identify as "restitutionary damages" in respect of a wrong. <i>Attorney-General v. Blake </i>[2001] 1 AC 268, where, exceptionally, a claim succeeded for a full account of the wrongdoer's profits, is also a case of restitutionary relief (at a still more radical level) in respect of a wrong. In <i>Experience Hendrix </i>in a parenthesis at para. 26, I raised the possibility that recovery of a reasonable price might even be possible, where a wrongdoer had failed, perhaps simply due to his own incompetence, to make any profit. But not all commentators would agree with this, and I made clear that my parenthesis depended on the wrong-based nature of the claim. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;231.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view (and in agreement with my noble and learned friend Lord Scott of Foscote), if any claim to restitution is to be recognised in relation to the use of money had and received, at common law or in equity, it must refer to any actual benefit obtained by the recipient, here the Revenue. The critical point is that Sempra's restitutionary claims - based on the Revenue's demand or on Sempra's own mistake - are not for damages or in respect of any wrong. They are for simple restitution of the unjust enrichment achieved by the Revenue. None of the cases cited in the previous paragraph has any present relevance. It is indeed essential to the limitation advantages at which Sempra aims under section 32(2)(c) of the Limitation Act 1980 that its mistaken payment claim is just that - a claim for "relief from the consequences of a mistake" - and is not a claim for "restitutionary" damages or restitutionary relief consequent on a wrong. The distinction is important. It was a corner stone of the late Professor Birks QC's last work, <i>Unjust Enrichment </i>(2nd ed.) (2005). He observed at p. 11, "The most important feature of mistaken payments is the absence of contract and wrong", and it is necessary to "isolate" and draw "a careful line" around cases of unjust enrichment which are "not manifestations of consent and are not wrongs". Professor Burrows in <i>The Law of Restitution </i>(2nd Ed.) (2002) draws the same distinction. He deals in chapter 1 with the "unjust enrichment principle and its four essential elements" and, quite separately, in chapter 14 with "restitution for wrongs" where he discusses all of the cases identified in the previous paragraph of this opinion which had been decided by 2002. His introduction to chapter 14, at p 455, points out that "the distinction between restitution for wrongs and unjust enrichment by subtraction [i.e. enrichment "at the expense of the claimant"] reflects different moral ideas. Both Birks and Burrows stress that it is fundamental to restitution for unjust enrichment that any recovery must relate to the actual benefit obtained. However restitutionary damages are rationalised, their award derives from the wrong upon which they are based, and this justifies a measure of recovery which is objective or assessed by reference to a "hypothetical bargain", as Burrows points out at pp. 468 to 470 and 477 in his chapter 14. In contrast, restitution on the basis of unjust enrichment looks, carefully and advisedly, at the recipient's actual benefit. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;232.&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the point that Professor Birks introduced in <i>Unjust Enrichment </i>(2nd ed.) p.53, by pointing out that there was no room for argument about the value of the money received, but a question did arise about the value of money over time, which would "have to be handled very carefully when next it is revisited". He went on to say that the use of money is, in itself, "a non-money benefit and, whether the issue is enrichment or disenrichment, it has to pass the tests applied to other non-money benefits", and to identify the two basic situations in which "exceptionally" the law will recognise such a benefit as having a value: see p. 55. In the present context, that means showing that the recipient received an incontrovertible benefit from the use of the money, for example by earning interest on it or saving interest on borrowings that would otherwise have been made: see pp. 55 and 59-62. These passages show that, far from operating as a control on or qualification of some objective or hypothetical measure of recovery, the principle of "subjective devaluation" makes actual or "incontrovertible" benefit the very test of and pre-condition to recovery: see also Birks, A<i>n Introduction to the Law of Restitution </i>(2nd Ed.) pp. 108-114, especially 114, and Burrows in <i>The Law of Restitution </i>(2nd Ed.) p. 18, et seq.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;233.&nbsp;&nbsp;My noble and learned friends Lord Nicholls and Lord Hope advocate an alternative approach, according to which a prima facie right would exist to recover a conventional or "objective" measure of loss, which could then, to some uncertain extent, be qualified by the application of another principle identified in the case of Lord Nicholls as subjective devaluation. I do not regard such an analysis as correct in principle. Why should there be a legal (as opposed, perhaps, to an evidential) onus on the recipient to displace a conventional or objective measure? Why should the rigour of a conventional approach be mitigated, only partially, by allowing the recipient (or "enrichee") to refer to "the [borrowing] rates and other terms … relevant to the circumstances of the enrichee" (Lord Hope's opinion at para 49)? A recipient may not in fact use the money received at all, or borrow any less money as a result of having its use. We are not here concerned with a wrongdoer or with compensation, but with recoupment by an innocent (albeit, as it transpires, unjustly enriched) recipient. There is no reason why such a person should use or account for the use of the money received in any particular way. Why should he or she not put it in a non-interest bearing current account or even under the bed? As I understand my noble and learned friend Lord Nicholls's approach, he would have sympathy with these points, but as giving rise to a possible qualification, in the interests of justice, on a prima facie objective measure of recovery, which may or may not be characterised as an aspect of a possible defence of change of position (para 119), and Lord Hope accepts that "it is open to the recipient to demonstrate that there was no actual enrichment" (para 48). As I have said, that seems to me at the least incorrectly to reverse the legal onus. The basic test of recovery in my view looks directly to and depends on actual benefit. Any change of position defence seems to me a separate matter, arising after any actual benefit has been ascertained, if, for example, the recipient then suggests that he has disbursed that benefit by expenditure which would not otherwise have been incurred. But, in a fully investigated context, such approaches should assimilate with Lord Scott's and mine (viz, that actual benefit is what matters) in the end result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;234.&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning to the basic question whether the law can and should recognise a restitutionary claim in unjust enrichment relating to any actual interest benefit obtained by the Revenue, such a claim faces a long line of authority refusing any interest on any basis at common law on claims for money had and received. The further obstacle to any claim for compound interest is the majority decision of this House in the <i>Westdeutsche </i>case. In their opinions my noble and learned friends, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead and Lord Hope of Craighead, take the view that the House can now revisit the common acceptation of the common law rule over nearly two hundred years of the law's development, including by the most eminent counsel and judges in the <i>Westdeutsche </i>case. I find myself unable to agree. But, if the common law rule were or is now to be reversed, it would follow, as I have already indicated, that damages should be measured by reference to any actual benefit received by the recipient, not some conventional or objective benefit. I reinforce this by adding that, if a claimant in a claim for special damages can only recover his actual (pleaded and proved) loss of interest, no reason appears why a claimant should be entitled in a common law claim for restitution against an innocent recipient to recover anything other than the recipient's actual benefit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;235.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I for my part regard it as a step too far now to reverse the common law approach to restitution in respect of money had and received for two main reasons. First, the existing common law rule has been recognised and effectively endorsed by the courts over two centuries, by the 1934 Law Revision Committee, by the Law Commission in all its reports and, above all, by Parliament. In contrast to the position regarding interest on debts, where the <i>London, Chatham and Dover </i>case can be distinguished as dealing only with claims to general damages, it is clear that these authorities all proceeded on the basis that there could be no common law claim for the use, or for any actual benefit obtained from the use, of money had and received. Second, there are in my view policy reasons making it unwise to introduce an absolute right to compound interest in restitution, and especially so if this were, as it should be, contingent upon proof of actual benefit acquired by the recipient. Restitution of any interest benefit received by a recipient of money had and received is not concerned with loss which a claimant himself actually suffers and knows and can prove that he has suffered. Yet its ascertainment would require investigation and evidence - often likely to be detailed and expensive, as the present case shows - relating to what the recipient has done with the money had and received. There could then be arguments about change of position, in so far as the recipient had disbursed any interest. Pragmatically, it seems to me dubious policy to recognise an absolute right to restitution of unjust enrichment which would in every case entitle a claimant (and as a matter of professional competence often require his lawyers) to insist on full disclosure of whatever the defendant had done with the money in order to assess what benefit had been had thereby.  I would therefore reject the invitation to revisit the common law rule. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;236.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, like my noble and learned friend Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe, prefer to address the present situation by accepting Mr Rabinowitz's powerful invitation to the House to revisit the area of equity which only arose for consideration in unsatisfactory circumstances in the <i>Westdeutsche </i>case [1996] AC 669 and led there to a three to two division in the House.  This would involve departing from the decision of the majority pursuant to the <i>Practice Statement (Judicial Precedent)</i> [1966] 1 WLR 1234, but it was an express purpose of the second question raised by the House with the parties leading to the resumed hearing of 16th May 2007 to consider whether this should be done. It is right to add that I have felt some unease about an invitation to a committee of five members of the House to reconsider a recent previous decision, where there was a three to two division of opinion. Further, the issue whether equity can assist requires more than simple reconsideration of the result in the <i>Westdeutsche </i>case. As already observed, the House there simply did not address the problem that the interest claimed related to the balance from time to time outstanding, and so, in considerable measure, to interest on principal repaid before action brought. The minority focused in their dissenting speeches on the power of equity to act <i>in aid of</i> the common law (see per Lord Goff at pp. 695E, 696 C-D and 698E) or in a manner <i>ancillary to </i>(or <i>in conjunction with </i>or <i>in addition to</i>) an order for restitution at common law (cf per Lord Woolf at pp. 719C, 721B, 722B-C (though with the word "usually"), 724G and 735D.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;237.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rabinowitz accepts that, in so far as the principal sums were repaid before action brought, there is no common law claim in aid of or ancillary to which equity can act. But he submits that that is not the end of the matter. Equity itself possesses remedies enabling monies paid under a mistake to be recovered, even though they may be differently described, for example as involving an order for an account. Court of Appeal cases recognising that equity could in this respect mirror the common law are <i>Rogers v. Ingham </i>(1876) 3 Ch. D. 351 and <i>Harsant v. Blaine, Macdonald and Company </i>(1887) 56 LJQB (NS) 511.  In the former case, the claim failed because based on mistake of law. In the latter case, the only mistake was the agent's in thinking that he was not liable to account for the particular monies received, and (simple) interest was awarded at 4% per annum from the date when the principal demanded payment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;238.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although in the <i>Westdeutsche </i>case, equity was being invoked to act in aid of a common law claim for restitution, I cannot think that Lord Goff and Lord Woolf would have declined to extend the equitable power to award compound interest to a situation like the present merely because the principal sum was recouped before action brought. It is true that such an extension involves recognising an independent equitable claim to recover interest. But the restitutionary impulse that the Revenue should relinquish any monetary benefit actually received is a strong incentive to extend equity's reach to such cases. As the European Court of Justice stressed in paragraphs 87 to 89 of its judgment, the essence of the United Kingdom's legislative scheme, and of the levying of ACT under it, was that the Revenue would receive payment of tax prematurely, to hold until it was recouped by set off against mainstream corporation tax liability. Sempra was thus, by making taxable profits but no thanks to the Revenue, able to recoup most of the principal sums by set off. By the same token, to limit recovery of interest to a situation in which Sempra was <i>unable</i> to recoup the principal sums of ACT paid and had to sue for them, would be to confine recovery to atypical circumstances. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;239.&nbsp;&nbsp;The other obstacle faced by Sempra's claim relates to the circumstances in which equity will award compound interest. The <i>Harsant </i>case cited above in fact falls within the category of claims against fiduciaries in relation to which Lord Brandon in <i>La Pintada </i>pointed out that the equitable jurisdiction to award interest, with compounding, was well established. The principles were set out by Lord Denning MR in <i>Wallersteiner v. Moir (No 2) </i>[1975] QB 373, 388B-G and by Lord Goff in the <i>Westdeutsche </i>case at pp 692D-H. In claims against fiduciaries, the court may in its discretion award interest on a simple or compound basis, as it concludes that the circumstances require. In other cases, as where granting specific performance or rescission of a bargain or taking an account, equity commonly awards simple interest only. But Lord Goff and Lord Woolf in the <i>Westdeutsche </i>[1996] AC 669<i> </i>case considered that the equitable jurisdiction to award compound interest extended to personal claims where there was no question of failure to account as a fiduciary: see e.g. per Lord Goff at pp. 693H-695E and Lord Woolf at pp 726H-730H.  In my view, the House can and should now adopt this approach. The courts of equity developed the equitable jurisdiction to award interest. There is no sustainable reason in modern conditions for continuing to limit it artificially in a way which may prevent the court doing equity. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;240.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would in these circumstances respond to Sempra's invitation to revisit the <i>Westdeutsche </i>case, by adopting the minority approach in preference to that of the majority and also by determining that in appropriate circumstances equity can go further and provide relief in respect of any actual interest benefit received from any principal sum paid by mistake, even though such principal may be recouped before action brought. However, while the basic aim should be to restore any actual benefit received, I emphasise that I regard equity's jurisdiction in these respects as discretionary, as, it is clear, did the minority in the <i>Westdeutsche </i>case. At p. 698G in that case Lord Goff would have approved Dillon LJ's exercise of discretion in the Court of Appeal, and at pp. 722D and 735C-D Lord Woolf carefully spelled out the discretionary nature of the relief which he would have granted and its advantages. In my view, these advantages are considerable. Using their discretion, courts will be able to keep equitable claims seeking to investigate and recover any actual benefit obtained by the use of money had and received within sensible bounds, and also to avoid detailed arguments about change of position where these would be likely to give rise to disproportionate expense to resolve. The sensible exercise of such a discretion should go some way to meet concerns like those expressed to and recognised by the Law Commission in cases where the sums or periods involved are small. Courts should be able to discourage or refuse expensive demands for discovery by claimants hoping to investigate precisely what interest benefit a defendant may have made, in circumstances where that would be disproportionate.  While the general basis of any award made should be to recoup any actual benefit, this does not entitle a claimant to insist either on full investigation or full disgorgement or to compound interest in every case. The court can take a robust and general approach.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;241.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, in view of the size of the sums in question, and the fact that they were recouped not as a result of anything done by the Revenue, but simply because Sempra happened to be able to set them off before action brought, I consider that Sempra should be able to recover from the Revenue an award of interest on a compound basis to reflect any actual benefit which the Court may find to have been made by the Revenue on such a basis through its receipt and retention of the ACT payments up to the time of their set off against mainstream corporation tax. In view of the manner in which the case proceeded below, I further consider that the question should be remitted to the Chancery Division, for the judge there to consider what actual award should be made against the Revenue to reflect, whether broadly or precisely, any actual benefit which the Revenue may be found to have received. In all other respects, I would dismiss this appeal.</p>
