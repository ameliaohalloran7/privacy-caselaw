<p align="right"><a href="riv-5.htm">(back to preceding text)</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection it is worth quoting the remarks of Knight Bruce V-C in <i>Pearse v Pearse </i>(1846) 1 De G &amp; Sm 12 at 28-9, which, expressed in the style of the times, seem to me to retain considerable validity:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The discovery and vindication and establishment of truth are main purposes certainly of the existence of Courts of Justice; still, for the obtaining of these objects, which, however valuable and important, cannot be usefully pursued without moderation, cannot be either usefully or creditably pursued unfairly or gained by unfair means, not every channel is or ought to be open to them … Truth, like all other good things, may be loved unwisely - may be pursued too keenly - may cost too much.  And surely the meanness and the mischief of prying into a man's confidential communications with his legal adviser, the general evil of infusing reserve and dissimulation, uneasiness, and suspicion and fear, into those communications which must take place, and which, unless in a condition of perfect security, must take place uselessly or worse, are too great a price to pay for truth itself."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead summarised the same principle in more sober modern legal parlance in <i>Re L (a minor) </i>[1997] AC 16 when he said at page 32:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The public interest in a party being able to obtain informed legal advice in confidence prevails over the public interest in all relevant material being available to courts when deciding cases."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113.&nbsp;&nbsp;The question for decision is where the line is to be drawn and the bounds of privilege are to be set.  It is unquestionable that the breadth of work commonly carried out by lawyers has increased since the early 19th century.  The increase in the number and variety of tribunals other than courts of law has been marked in recent years.  Statutory and non-statutory inquiries and investigations have proliferated, as HM Government set out in its written case.  The consequences of findings in inquiries such as the Bingham Inquiry may, as I have earlier outlined, be serious for some of the persons or bodies to whom they relate, and investigations such as those held under the Companies Act 1985 can have a substantial effect.  It may be of considerable importance for those who may be affected to ensure that their case is put before the inquiry in as effective a manner as possible.  The Court of Appeal stated in paragraph 33 of its judgment that a desire to protect reputation to avoid more intrusive regulation does not put the Bank on the same footing as an individual whose reputation is at risk in a public inquiry.  That may be so, but I cannot agree that the Bank should for that reason be deprived of any protection of legal professional privilege.  Its interests may differ from those of individuals whose conduct is called in question, but it does not follow that they are to be disregarded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114.&nbsp;&nbsp;The work of advising a client on the most suitable approach to adopt, assembling material for presentation of his case and taking statements which set out the relevant material in an orderly fashion and omit the irrelevant is to my mind the classic exercise of one of the lawyer's skills.  I can see no valid reason why that should cease to be so because the forum is an inquiry or other tribunal which is not a court of law, provided that the advice is given in a legal context: see Lord Scott's opinion at para 42.  The skills of a lawyer in assembling the facts and handling the evidence are of importance in that forum as well as a court of law.  The availability of competent legal advice will materially assist an inquiry by reducing irrelevance and encouraging the making of proper admissions.  As Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers himself expressed it in his Chairman's Note on Lawyers in connection with the BSE tribunal:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Lawyers are experienced in gathering documentary evidence and have the skills essential to ensure that witness statements cover the relevant ground, without becoming unnecessarily prolix."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Johnson described the function of lawyers, as Lord Simon of Glaisdale felicitously recalled in <i>Waugh v British Railways Board </i>[1980] AC 521 at  535, in the following terms:</p>
<p></p><ul>"As it rarely happens that a man is fit to plead his own cause, lawyers are a class of the community who, by study and experience, have acquired the art and power of arranging evidence, and of applying to the points at issue what the law has settled.  A lawyer is to do for his client all that his client might fairly do for himself, if he could."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal acknowledged at paragraph 34 of its judgment that the role of Freshfields in assisting with the preparation of evidence and submissions for the Bingham Inquiry was very similar to that which a solicitor plays in relation to litigation.  It is an exercise in advocacy and good advocacy will be adapted to the tribunal concerned.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115.&nbsp;&nbsp;An inquest is a case in point.  The findings may not now have the legal consequences which they formerly could have, but, as Lord Bingham of Cornhill stated in <i>R (on the application of Amin) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </i>[2004] 1 AC 653 at paragraph 31, the inquest may have a vital function in exposing culpable and discreditable conduct: cf the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in <i>Jordan v United Kingdom </i>(2001) 11 BHRC 1 and the discussion in the speech of Lord Bingham of Cornhill in <i>R (on the application of Middleton) v West Somerset Coroner </i>[2004] 2 AC 182.  It is difficult to suppose that those whose conduct is investigated under such a searching light should be deprived of the protection of legal professional privilege when they obtain advice and assistance from their lawyers about how to proceed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116.&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore conclude that there is a clear case for upholding the appellant Bank's submission that privilege attached to communications between the BIU and Freshfields by which the advice and assistance of Freshfields was sought and obtained as to the manner in which the Bank should appropriately present evidence and material to the Bingham Inquiry.  To repeat the phrase of Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, the public interest in the Bank's being able to obtain legal advice in confidence prevails over the public interest in all relevant material being available to the inquiry when reaching its conclusions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117.&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows that the declaration and order made by Tomlinson J in <i>Three Rivers (No 6)</i> were incorrectly made.  I would allow the appeal and set aside the judge's declaration and order for disclosure and inspection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118.&nbsp;&nbsp;One other matter remains for mention.  Mr Sumption urged that we should express an opinion on the correctness of the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Three Rivers (No 5)</i>, which he submitted raised important issues about privilege which should be resolved.  The Court of Appeal in that case found against the Bank and your Lordships refused the Bank's petition for leave to appeal.<i>  </i>Disclosure of large numbers of documents has been made in accordance with the order of the Court of Appeal and Mr Sumption gave an undertaking on behalf of the Bank that, if the House were to rule that the decision of the Court of Appeal was incorrect, the documents already disclosed will continue to be admissible in the present action and no point will be taken about the judge having seen them.  I should be reluctant, in the absence of a very pressing need, to express an opinion on issues which are not before the House - even though we permitted some argument on them to be put before us - the more so when leave to appeal was refused.  For that reason, and for those given by my noble and learned friend Lord Scott of Foscote in discussing this issue, I do not propose to express any opinion on it.  Having said that, I am not to be taken to have approved of the decision in <i>Three Rivers (No 5), </i>and I would reserve my position on its correctness.</p>
<p><b>LORD BROWN OF EATON-UNDER-HEYWOOD</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having had the advantage of reading in draft the speeches of my noble and learned friends, Lord Scott of Foscote, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry and Lord Carswell, I gratefully adopt Lord Scott's and Lord Carswell's accounts of the facts and issues and proceed at once to add just a very few observations of my own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it clear that legal advice privilege attaches to the communications between the Bank and its lawyers concerning the preparation of the Bank's overarching statement (the statement of its case to the Bingham inquiry).  I would go so far as to state as a general principle that the process by which a client seeks and obtains his lawyer's assistance in the presentation of his case for the purposes of any formal inquiry—whether concerned with public law or private law issues, whether adversarial or inquisitorial in form, whether held in public or in private, whether or not directly affecting his rights or liabilities—attracts legal advice privilege.  Such assistance to my mind clearly has the character of legal business.  It is precisely the sort of professional service for which lawyers are ordinarily employed by virtue of their expertise and experience.  Indeed, it falls squarely within Dr Johnson's description of a lawyer's function—see Lord Carswell's speech at paragraph 114.  It is, moreover, a service which can only effectively be rendered if the client is candid and forthcoming as to the true facts of his case—the very consideration which justifies the absolute character of legal advice privilege in the first place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal in <i>Three Rivers District Council v Governor and Company of the Bank of England (No. 6)</i> [2004]  QB 916 (<i>Three Rivers (No. 6)</i>) to my mind adopted too narrow an approach to the scope of legal advice privilege, holding as it did that the privilege applies only where the client's legal rights and liabilities are at stake, seldom therefore in relation to an inquiry, perhaps not even where the inquiry puts the client's reputation at risk—a question expressly left undecided.  But consider an inquiry where the client receives and must respond to a Salmon letter.  Can the tribunal then insist on seeing the communications between the client and his lawyer by which the terms of his response come to be settled?  Surely not.  Rather this would seem to me a classic case for the application of the privilege.  And by the same token that legal advice privilege must in my judgment apply to someone whose reputation is at stake, so too should it apply to anyone who instructs lawyers with a view to making the best presentation of his case at an inquiry.  It is simply not practicable to seek to distinguish between the different interests of those appearing.  This is, after all, an area of the law where clarity and certainty are at a premium.  Furthermore, as Lord Scott points out at paragraph 39 of his speech, it could hardly be right to allow legal advice privilege, for example, to a developer at a planning inquiry but deny it to an objector.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, together with the reasons given in the speeches of my noble and learned friends, Lord Scott, Lord Rodger and Lord Carswell, I too would allow this appeal.</p>
