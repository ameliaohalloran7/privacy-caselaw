<p class="para">87.&nbsp;&nbsp;This point undermines a major plank in the argument advanced on behalf of Knowsley by Mr Edward Bartley Jones QC, namely that a close examination of parts of section 9 of the 1988 Act indicates that it must have been envisaged that an assured tenancy would be ended by a possession order some time before the tenant vacated. In particular, this argument relies, perfectly logically, on the point that the references to “occupation after the termination of the tenancy” and “mesne profits” in subsection (3) appear to envisage that an assured tenancy subject to a possession order will, or at least may, end before the tenant gives up possession. The trouble with that point is that the same words are found in section 100(3) of the 1977 Act: yet, in the light of section 2(1)(a) of that Act, there can be no doubt but that a regulated tenancy does not expire pursuant to a possession order until possession is obtained. The same point applies to the reliance placed by Knowsley on the reference to the tenancy being terminated in the provisions in the two sections conferring rights on spouses.</p>
<p class="para">88.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my judgment, section 100 of the 1977 Act, and therefore section 9 of the 1988 Act, contains more than one example of torrential drafting. Not only are the references to mesne profits in subsection (3) unnecessary, but “stay” and “suspend” in subsection (2) are synonymous, as are “discharge” and “rescind” in subsection (4). Section 100 of the 1977 Act owes its origin, albeit via the 1968 and 1965 Rent Acts, to the 1923 Act (which in turn replaced a provision of the 1920 Act). Accordingly, it must be construed bearing in mind that its origins are based on a provision enacted at a time when the drafting of the Rent Acts was not, as I have mentioned, noted for its clarity.</p>
<p class="para">89.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, it appears to me that an assured tenancy subject to a suspended possession order does not come to an end until possession is delivered up. Logic dictates that this conclusion must also apply to an outright possession order, so on that point I would overrule the reasoning in <i>Artesian </i>at [2000] QB 541, 549A-B.</p>
<p class="para">90.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now necessary to face up to the point that this means that the effect of a possession order under Part I of the 1988 Act would be different from one under Part IV of the 1985 Act, as stated by this House in <i>Burrows </i>[1996] 1 WLR 1448. As already explained, there is a difference between the 1985 and 1988 Acts, in that the latter has no equivalent to the former’s section 82(2), and it was the wording of that subsection on which Russell LJ primarily rested his conclusion in <i>Thompson </i>[1987] 1 WLR, 1425 (see at 1430F-G) and indeed on which Sir Andrew Morritt C rested his conclusion in <i>Hall </i>[2006] 1 WLR 2116, para 13. Accordingly, although it would obviously be sensible and convenient that the point at issue should be resolved the same way under the two statutes, I do not consider that logic compels that result. </p>
<p class="para">91.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it should be added that I strongly suspect that, if the point had not been determined in <i>Burrows </i>[1996] 1 WLR 1448, I would have reached the same conclusion in relation to section 85 of the 1985 Act as that which I have reached in relation to section 9 of the 1988 Act. There is a powerful case for saying that “the date on which the tenant is to give up possession in pursuance of the order” in section 82(2) of the 1985 Act can, and therefore should, mean the date specified in a warrant of possession which is duly executed (or acted on by the tenant). Furthermore, section 121 of the 1985 Act appears to me to be arguably inconsistent with the decisions in <i>Thompson </i>[1987] 1 WLR 1425 and in <i>Hall </i>[2006] 1 WLR 2116, in that it appears expressly to assume that a tenant who “is", as well as a tenant who “will be", obliged to give up possession pursuant to a court order, would remain entitled to pursue the right to buy, and only a person who is a secure tenant can have that right.</p>
<p class="para">92.&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that these arguments and, indeed, the point now at issue were not actually debated in <i>Burrows </i>[1996] 1 WLR 1448, should your Lordships reconsider whether <i>Thompson </i>[1987] 1 WLR 1425 and <i>Hall </i>[2006] 1 WLR 2116 were rightly decided? When that question was raised with Mr Luba, he replied (with the apparent support of Mr Ashley Underwood QC, Mr Richard Drabble QC, and Mr Andrew Arden QC) that it was simply too late to take that course: <i>Thompson</i> [1987] 1 WLR 1425 has been assumed to be right, and has been acted on, in many tens of thousands of cases over the past twenty years or more, particularly since it had the express approval of your Lordships’ House more than twelve years ago. Further, by section 299 of, and Schedule 11 to, the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008, Parliament has amended and clarified the law, so that secure and assured tenancies will only end “when the order is executed", although those provisions are not yet in force, and, when they come into force, they will largely only be prospective in their effect.</p>
<p class="para">93.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, we should not reconsider the view expressed in this House in <i>Burrows </i>[1996] 1 WLR 1448<i> </i>that <i>Thompson </i>[1987] 1 WLR 1425 was rightly decided so far as secure tenancies are concerned. In the absence of any submission to that effect from the Bar, and in the face of discouragement from counsel who are highly experienced in the field, it would be wrong for this House effectively to go back on its previous approval of a long-standing decision which had been acted on in a plethora of cases, when there is in place amending legislation having the same effect as such a reversal, in which Parliament has decided to amend the law only prospectively. Further, in <i>Bristol City Council v Hassan </i>[2006] 1 WLR 2582, the Court of Appeal has approved a form of suspended order for possession against a secure tenant which would normally avoid the secure tenancy determining unless and until the court makes a further order. </p>
<i><p class="para">Can the court proleptically order the discharge of a possession order?</p></i>
<p class="para">94.&nbsp;&nbsp;A suspended order for possession sometimes provides for the order to be discharged in the event of the tenant paying off all the arrears and costs; an example is in para 6 of the order in Mrs Honeygan-Green’s<i> </i>case. In <i>Marshall </i>[2002] HLR 428, it was held that it was not open to the court to include such a proleptic discharge provision in the original order. Chadwick LJ (giving the only reasoned judgment of the Court of Appeal) said at para 37 that “[t]he power to discharge or rescind the order for possession, conferred by section 85(4) of the 1985 Act, is a power which can only be exercised in the light of the circumstances prevailing at the time", and that therefore that power “cannot be exercised in advance; because the court cannot know, in advance, whether the conditions precedent to the exercise of the power will be satisfied".</p>
<p class="para">95.&nbsp;&nbsp;The consequence of that analysis is that secure tenants who have become tolerated trespassers (which will presumably be the majority of those against whom suspended orders for possession are made, as strict compliance with the terms of suspension will, I suspect, be rare) face an unattractive choice. They either have to remain tolerated trespassers indefinitely or they must incur the inconvenience and expense of applying to discharge the possession order. Many of these tenants will be people who would be unlikely to seek legal advice, and would therefore, in ignorance, be condemned to a permanent state of tolerated trespassers. In almost any case where a possession order is suspended simply on terms that the rent arrears and costs are paid off, it will be acceptable to the landlord that the order should be discharged once all that is owing to the landlord has been paid. </p>
<p class="para">96.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rare case where circumstances may justify the order for possession not being discharged owing to events which occur after the order is made but before its execution, a landlord would not be prejudiced by a proleptic discharge provision. Once the terms of suspension were not complied with, the landlord could seek to execute the order by applying for a warrant of possession. It would then be up to the tenant to apply to the court under section 85(2). The court could then consider whether and how to vary the terms of the order (including the proleptic discharge provision).  </p>
<p class="para">97.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, on a fair reading of section 85, it is open to the court to include a proleptic discharge provision in a suspended order for possession. The section should be construed, as far as permissible, to confer as much flexibility as possible on the court, and in such a way as to minimise future uncertainty and need for further applications. The section permits a proleptic discharge provision, in my view, not least because the court can always revisit the provision, effectively at the suit of the landlord, as already mentioned, if the terms of the suspension are not complied with. The wording of section 85(4), particularly if read with the practicalities in mind, does not preclude the court from effectively committing itself in advance to discharging a suspended order, provided that (a) certain conditions are complied with, and (b) neither the landlord (by applying for a warrant of possession) nor the tenant (by applying under section 85(2)) seeks, in the meantime, reconsideration of the terms of the discharge provision.</p>
<p class="para">98.&nbsp;&nbsp;This view is supported by authority which, as Sedley LJ said in <i>Porter </i>[2008] EWCA Civ 196,<i> </i>at para 59, does not appear to have been before the court in <i>Marshall </i>[2002] HLR 428. In <i>Payne v Cooper </i>[1958] 1 QB 174, the Court of Appeal had to consider a similar point in relation to section 4(2) of the 1923 Act, which ended with a provision whose structure was identical, and whose wording was effectively the same for present purposes, as that of section 85(4) of the 1985 Act. While accepting that “there [was] obviously much to be said for [the] view” that the court could not include a proleptic discharge provision in a suspended possession order, Lord Evershed MR said that that course had been sanctioned in the court’s earlier decision of <i>Sherrin v Brand  </i>[1956] 1 QB 403, and adopted in the standard form of possession order. Accordingly, he concluded that the course was within the court’s power — see at [1958] 1 QB 174, 187-189. Romer LJ agreed saying, at [1958] 1 QB 174, 189-90, that he saw “nothing wrong, or beyond the power of the court, in making an order in” what he called a “compendious form".</p>
<p class="para">99.&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislature presumably considered that conclusion to be acceptable, as the same structure and a very similar form of words to the closing part of section 4(2) of the 1923 Act was then used in the 1968 and 1977 Acts. If section 100(4) of the 1977 Act permits the court to make an order in such a form, as seems to me to follow, then it is very hard to see why the same conclusion does not apply to section 85(4) of the 1985 Act. The fact that a suspended order for possession against a secure tenant may determine the tenancy before execution, unlike in the case of a statutory tenant, does not make any difference in this connection, given that the effect of the discharge of a suspended order against a secure tenant is to revive the secure tenancy retrospectively. </p>
<p class="para">100.&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite apart from the wording of section 85(4), it appears to me that there is a strong argument for saying that, particularly with the advent of the CPR, it would in any event be open to a court to make an order which includes a provision that, in certain events, the order would automatically be discharged, normally, one suspects, with permission to the parties to apply in the meantime. In this connection, it appears to me that CPR 3.1(2)(a) may be particularly in point.</p>
<i><p class="para">Must the terms of proleptic discharge and suspension be the same? </p></i>
<p class="para">101.&nbsp;&nbsp; A proleptic discharge provision in an order for possession against a secure tenant is therefore valid in principle, but it is said that, if it is in the terms such as para 6 of the order made against Mrs Honeygan-Green, it would fall foul of section 85(4) of the 1985 Act. This is because the terms justifying discharge of the order were not the same as the terms of suspension in para 5 of the order. Para 5 suspended the operation of the order for possession so long as, every week, the tenant paid £50 off the arrears (and costs) together with the current rent, whereas para 6 provided that the order would be discharged once the arrears (and costs) had been paid off, irrespective of when payment was actually made. In <i>Marshall </i>[2002] HLR 428, para 37, Chadwick LJ said that, as a result of the reference in section 85(4) of the 1985 Act to “the conditions", discharge under that provision could only be directed if the conditions of suspension, as referred to in section 85(3) were complied with. </p>
<p class="para">102.&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the force of this point, which is very well articulated by my noble and learned friend Lord Mance, in his opinion which I have had the privilege of seeing in draft. Nonetheless it appears to me that this point involves taking an over-technical view of section 85.  If (as I have concluded) it is possible for the court to make a proleptic order discharging the order for possession, and if (as is rightly agreed) it is open to the court to vary the terms of suspension retrospectively, then it would be surprising if the court could not proleptically order that the terms of discharge should be different from the terms of suspension. </p>
<p class="para">103.&nbsp;&nbsp;The view that the court does not have such power seems to me to be inconsistent with the views expressed by the Court of Appeal in two earlier cases that I have already mentioned. In <i>Payne</i> [1958] 1 QB 174, 186, in relation to the identically structured and very similarly worded last part of section 4(2) of the 1923 Act, Lord Evershed MR agreed with the reasoning of Romer LJ in <i>Sherrin</i> [1956] 1 QB 403, in a passage at 428-429. In that passage, Romer LJ approved an order for possession which was expressed to be suspended “so long as” the tenant “punctually” paid a specified amount “per week” in respect of the arrears, mesne profits and costs. The order concluded by providing that it would “cease to be enforceable when the arrears … mesne profits and costs … are satisfied.” (see at [1956] 1 QB 403, 404-405).  </p>
<p class="para">104.&nbsp;&nbsp;I accept that in neither of those cases did the Court of Appeal expressly address the point that the terms of suspension and the terms for discharge were not the same, however, the court clearly approved the form of order in <i>Sherrin</i> [1956] 1 QB 403, whose effect seems to me to be pretty clear. It may be said that the word “satisfied” in the final part of that order could, and indeed should, be construed as referring to satisfaction of the liability to pay off the arrears “punctually” at the specified weekly rate. However, that does not appear to me to accord with the natural meaning of the final part of the order, which is simply concerned with payment of all the money which is due.  This conclusion also accords with common sense. It would be surprising if the court was powerless to discharge a suspended order for possession when all the arrears and costs had been paid, just because there had not been strict compliance with the terms of suspension — for instance, if one weekly instalment had been a day late, or even if the tenant was not infrequently a little late in making some of the weekly payments.</p>
<p class="para">105.&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms on which a possession order for non-payment of rent is suspended should, almost as a matter of course, include precise dates on which any payment should be made. However, particularly bearing in mind that such orders are, in general, directed to the relatively less fortunate, and also bearing in mind the very wide powers bestowed on the court by section 85, I do not think it follows that the proleptic discharge, to be accorded once payment in full has been made, should only be available if payment was made strictly on those dates.</p>
<p class="para">106.&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to another decision of the Court of Appeal, to which I must turn in the next section of this opinion, it may be said that, if <i>Marshall </i>[2002] HLR 428<i> </i>is right on this issue, discharge under section 85(4) could nonetheless be achieved by the tenant applying under section 85(2) to amend the terms of suspension retrospectively so that they reflected the payments the tenant had actually made, and then applying under section 85(4) for discharge. That argument, I accept, would reduce the absurdity. However, it would require a tenant to incur expenditure and effort in making an application to the court. Not only may many tenants be unaware of this requirement, but such an application could carry a degree of uncertainty, as there would be no obligation on the court to grant it. Again, these points are reinforced by considering the type of person who is likely to be subject to such an order. </p>
<p class="para">107.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Accordingly, it seems to me that the terms of section 85, taken as a whole, common sense and the reasoning in <i>Payne</i> [1958] 1 QB 174 and <i>Sherrin</i> [1956] 1 QB 403 support the proposition that section 85(4) has the effect not merely that the court ordering possession can direct that the order will be discharged if the conditions referred to in section 85(3) are met, but that the court can also then decide the extent to which compliance with the strict terms of the conditions will not be required in order for the order to be discharged. In other words, just as the court can proleptically exercise its powers under section 85(4) when making the order for possession, so can it proleptically exercise its powers under section 85(2) to vary the terms of suspension for the purpose of giving effect to its power of discharge. (Again, I consider that there is a strong argument that the court has such a power under the CPR when making any order.)</p>
<p class="para">108.&nbsp;&nbsp;Save in relatively exceptional circumstances, it would, I think, be unrealistic for the court proleptically to direct that discharge could only occur if every payment was made on the precise day identified by the terms of suspension. Equally, in some cases it might be too generous to the tenant to provide for an automatic discharge on payment in full of the arrears (and costs), irrespective of when payment occurs, but, on the other hand, as already mentioned, it is always open to the landlord to force the issue if the tenant fails to comply with the terms of suspension.</p>
<p class="para">109.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the arguments raised in these appeals, I should add that the terms of suspension would not be complied with if a payment due thereunder was made late. Those terms represent a series of conditions which have to be satisfied if the order is not to be executed, and should therefore, in my view, be interpreted strictly. That is a point which appears to have been taken for granted in <i>Thompson </i>[1987] 1 WLR 1425 and the cases which follow and approve it (including <i>Burrows </i>[1996] 1 WLR 1448). Also, if it were otherwise, it would be difficult to devise a test to assess whether the terms had been complied with. It was suggested that the test should be whether the tenant had substantially complied with the terms of suspension, but that could often lead to uncertainty and expense, which would be particularly undesirable for public sector residential tenants. </p>
<p class="para">110.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the correct analysis, in principle and in practice, is that the terms of a suspended order are to be literally applied and precisely complied with. Accordingly, if a tenant fails to comply strictly with any of the terms of suspension, the landlord can apply for a warrant. However, if the tenant then applies to the court for relief, the court may suspend or discharge the warrant (and may vary the order). Indeed, if the court considers the landlord’s application for a warrant, or his resistance to the tenant’s application, to have been unreasonable, then the landlord may very well find itself paying the tenant’s costs. </p>
<i><p class="para">The “Swindon v Aston trap”</p></i>
<p class="para">111.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the order in Mrs Honeygan-Green’s case<i>, </i>the order in Mr Porter’s case<i> </i>does not in terms direct a proleptic discharge once all the arrears and costs have been paid. Instead, it provides, in para 4, that the order for possession cannot be enforced once all the arrears and costs are paid. The effect of the reasoning in <i>Marshall</i> [2002] HLR 428 is, of course, that, in such a case, the tenant cannot apply under section 85(4) of the 1985 Act for a discharge unless he or she has strictly complied with the terms of suspension. The effect of a subsequent decision of the Court of Appeal, <i>Swindon Borough Council v Aston </i>[2002] EWCA Civ 1850, [2003] HLR 610, is that the tenant in such a case cannot apply for a variation to the order under section 85(2) either.</p>
<p class="para">112.&nbsp;&nbsp;If those decisions are right, then it has been said that a tenant is caught in a trap every time a secure tenancy is made subject to an order such as that in Mr Porter’s case, where the tenant does not strictly comply with the terms of suspension, but nonetheless pays off all the arrears and costs. The tenant cannot get the order discharged under section 85(4) either directly (owing to the decision in <i>Marshall </i>[2002] HLR 428<i>)</i> or indirectly by first having the terms of suspension varied under section 85(2) (owing to the decision in <i>Swindon </i>[2003] HLR 610), yet the landlord cannot enforce the order as para 4 precludes it. Given that the effect of the existence of the order is inconsistent with the existence of a secure tenancy, it would seem that, if the law is as it was held to be in those two cases, the tenant is not so much caught in a trap as confined to the purgatory of being a permanent tolerated trespasser. </p>
<p class="para">113.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reasons already given, <i>Marshall</i> [2002] HLR 428 is, in my view, wrong on this issue. So, in my opinion, is <i>Swindon</i> [2003] HLR 610 (where the terms of the order were similar, for present purposes, to those in the order made in Mr Porter’s case)<i>. </i>At the end of para 20, Pumfrey J, who gave the only reasoned judgment, said that, once the order had become unenforceable because all the arrears and costs had been paid, it was not open to a<i> </i>secure tenant to apply to vary the order under section 85(2). This uncharacteristically unexplained conclusion seems to me to be wrong in principle and in practice. So far as practicalities are concerned, as Mr Underwood submitted, this conclusion not only gives rise to the trap, but it puts a tenant who has paid off all the arrears and costs in a worse position than one who has not. As to principle, there is nothing in section 85(2), or elsewhere in the 1985 Act, which expressly or impliedly appears to prevent a tenant, who is subject to an order such as that in Mr Porter’s case<i> </i>and has paid off all the arrears and costs, making an application to the court to exercise its powers under section 85(2). Indeed, the wide powers granted to the court under section 85 indicate that the tenant should have such a right, particularly in the light of the absurdity of the consequences if there is no such right.</p>
<i><p class="para">The right to buy and possession orders</p></i>
<p class="para">114.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of Court of Appeal decisions which support the proposition that, in order to enforce the right to buy, a person must normally be a secure tenant (or, in a case such as Mrs White’s, an assured tenant) throughout the period from service of the section 122 notice, exercising the right to buy, until completion is effected (see eg <i>Enfield London Borough Council v McKeon</i> [1986] 1 WLR 1007, <i>Muir Group Housing Association Ltd v Thornley </i>(1992) 91 LGR 1, and <i>Harrow London Borough Council v Tonge </i>(1992) 25 HLR 99). That proposition was referred to in this House with approval in <i>Bristol City Council v Lovell </i>[1998] 1 WLR 446, 458F-G, and, realistically in my view, it was not challenged by any party in the instant appeals. </p>
<p class="para">115.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ultimate issue in Mrs Honeygan-Green’s case is whether she is entitled to maintain her right to buy pursuant to the section 122 notice she served on 23 May 2000. Her case, accepted by the Court of Appeal for reasons given by Keene LJ, was that, while section 121(1) of the 1985 Act prevented her from processing her claim once she was in breach of the terms of suspension in the possession order of 4 October 2002, she became entitled to renew her right to rely on the notice once the order was discharged on 8 July 2003.</p>
<p class="para">116.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Arden, for Islington, contended that the right to buy pursuant to a notice served under section 122 is lost once a secure tenancy is determined pursuant to a court order for possession, and that it cannot be retrospectively reinstated by the secure tenancy being retrospectively revived by the subsequent discharge of the order.</p>
<p class="para">117.&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot accept that argument, as it seems to me to fly in the face of the provisions of section 121(1) of the 1985 Act, to produce unacceptable results under section 122(2), and to offend against the principle of retrospective revival as examined and applied in <i>Rogers </i>(1999) 32 HLR 361, which, as indicated, I consider to have been rightly decided. </p>
<p class="para">118.&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Arden rightly accepted, section 121 has the effect of suspending a tenant’s ability from exercising or pursuing the right to buy so long as any of the situations identified in subsections (1) or (2) obtain. Particularly in the light of section 121(2)(a), and the language of section 121(2)(d), it cannot realistically be argued that the section permanently removes the right to buy: it merely suspends it.</p>
