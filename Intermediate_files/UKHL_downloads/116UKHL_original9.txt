<p class="para">199.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, as already mentioned, in view of its wide words, section 72(1) would extend to all the other parties involved in the fraud, including (in the present case) Total; indeed, in view of section 61, section 60 has a longer reach than merely to the taxable person. It is also worth mentioning that sections 63 and 64 apply to cases where a person “overstates his entitlement to a VAT credit". Although not quite as specific as the provisions of sections 60 and 72, these provisions also seem to me to embrace a case such as this, where a VAT credit has been wrongly claimed. </p>
<p class="para">200.&nbsp;&nbsp;In these circumstances, it appears to me that the same principles and conclusions apply in relation to the second way in which the Commissioners put their case as in relation to the first.</p>
<i><p class="paraleft">Conclusion on the effect of the 1994 Act on the claim</p>
</i>
<p class="para">201.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a common law claim, whether based on unpaid tax or on a payment of an unjustified claim for a tax credit, could be maintained, it would either sometimes overlap with statutory remedy or be limited to cases where there was no statutory remedy. It would plainly be unsatisfactory and inappropriate to have concurrent claims under the statute and in tort. It would also, as I have just been discussing, risk rendering the limitation, procedural and mitigation provisions in the 1994 Act nugatory. The notion of the common law filling in the holes in a taxing statute, particularly one containing many remedial rights in favour of the Commissioners, often not only against the primarily taxable person, appears wrong in principle, as I have already indicated; indeed, it is getting very close to Article 4 of the Bill of Rights territory. Further, it would lead to many and significant substantive and procedural inconsistencies, and indeed duplication of process, in claims against co-conspirators, where one or more of the conspirators are liable under the statute and others are not.</p>
<p class="para">202.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, I am of the view that a claim in tort such as that raised by the Commissioners in these proceedings is precluded as a matter of law. It is tempting to hold that an exception should be made in the case of those who dishonestly evade paying VAT or make dishonest claims, and of those who assist in their dishonesty. However, simply to invoke the doctrine that “fraud unravels everything” would seem to me to involve palm tree justice. In other words, one would be relying on a general sense of morality or indignation, without regard to principle or the rule of law. Such a course would be inconsistent with principle, especially in the context of a taxing statute, and would effectively represent <i>carte blanche</i> for any tribunal to do what it likes.</p>
<p class="para">203.&nbsp;&nbsp;A more principled approach might appear to involve holding Total liable on the basis that it was seeking to invoke the 1994 Act “as an engine of fraud". This doctrine has, so far as I am aware, only been applied to section 4 of the Statute of Frauds 1677 (re-enacted in a partial and amended form in section 40 of the Law of Property Act 1925, which has now been replaced by section 2 of the Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989). The basis of the doctrine and the consequent development of the law of part performance was explained by Lord Selborne LC in <i>Maddison v. Alderson</i> (1883) 8 App. Cas. 467 at 474 to 480.</p>
<p class="para">204.&nbsp;&nbsp;The present case can be said to be in some ways a stronger candidate for the application of the doctrine than the normal case where part performance is invoked. Total has not merely been fraudulent in the equitable sense, but has been guilty of conspiracy to deceive and to cheat the Revenue. Nonetheless, it seems to me that the doctrine is inapplicable here, as its invocation would involve the Commissioners pulling themselves up by their own bootstraps: the only reason they have a claim at all is because of the existence of the 1994 Act, so they can scarcely complain if the person against whom they are claiming relies on that Act.  </p>
<p class="para">205.&nbsp;&nbsp;The conclusion that the Commissioners cannot claim common law damages from a party to a dishonest “scam” which deprived the public purse of substantial sums might appear surprising and unsatisfactory. However, although Article 4 of the Bill of Rights does not come directly into play in this case, I consider that there is a policy argument for rejecting the existence of such a claim which as mentioned is similar to the policy behind Article 4. If the Government wishes to raise tax, or to recover compensation for not having received tax which it ought to have received, it is for the legislature to give the executive, presumably the Commissioners, the appropriate powers and duties; it is not for the courts to permit the executive to rely on the common law to fill in gaps in the legislation.</p>
<p class="para">206.&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, “the taxpayer must use the remedies provided by the tax legislation” - see <i>Autologic plc v Inland Revenue Commissioners </i>[2006] 1 AC 118 at para 13. Although that statement was made in a case where the legislation concerned contained a remedy, it has some resonance here. It does appear appropriate, as a matter of principle, and consistent with the spirit of Article 4, that the Commissioners should be limited to their statutory remedies. The law relating to direct and indirect tax is comprehensively reviewed annually by the legislature through a Finance Bill which is presented by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, no doubt after consultation with the Commissioners. Other changes in revenue law can be introduced relatively easily during the year (particularly during the passage of a Finance Bill), and this presumably sometimes happens at the instigation of the Commissioners. Such reviews and changes are often retrospective, in the sense of taking effect from the date they are publicly announced.</p>
<p class="para">207.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present connection, I am unpersuaded that the Commissioners can gain any assistance from the way the court has treated “artificial transactions” for the purposes of taxing statutes in cases since <i>WT Ramsay Ltd v Inland Revenue Commissioners </i>[1982] AC 300. I appreciate that there have been dicta (e.g. per Lord Wilberforce in that very case at p 326) which appear to suggest that the court in such cases was almost acting as a quasi-legislator, filling in gaps in the legislation. However, the rationale of such cases has been conclusively explained in <i>MacNiven v Westmoreland Investments Ltd </i>[2003] 1 AC 311 as involving the normal principles of a purposive approach to interpretation and giving effect to the statutory language (see at para 7 per Lord Nicholls, and at paras 33 to 64 per Lord Hoffmann). </p>
<p class="para">208.&nbsp;&nbsp;In his opinion, Lord Mance, also relying on the <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell </i>case, suggests that, in order for Total to succeed, the 1994 Act must positively be shown to be inconsistent with the existence of a common law claim such as the Commissioners seek to bring. I have already identified the points which seem to me to support such a conclusion in this case. However, I should also mention the reasoning of your Lordships’ House in <i>Johnson v Unisys Ltd </i>[2003] 1 AC 518, to which my attention has been drawn by Lord Mance. In that case, it was held to be inappropriate to develop the common law in relation to employee dismissal because (per Lord Nicholls at para 2):</p>
<p class="qt">“[A] common law right embracing the manner in which an employee is dismissed cannot satisfactorily coexist with the statutory right not to be unfairly dismissed. A newly developed common law right of this nature, covering the same ground as the statutory right, would fly in the face of limits Parliament has already prescribed on matters such as the classes of employees who have the benefit of the statutory right, the amount of compensation payable and the short time limits for making claims. It would also defeat the intention of Parliament that claims of this nature should be decided by specialist tribunals, not the ordinary courts of law".</p>
<p class="para">Lord Hoffmann (after full consideration of the legislation) and Lord Millett said much the same at paras 43 to 66 and para 80 respectively. </p>
<p class="para">209.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the factors relating to statutory rights and remedies which persuaded the House that there should be no common law claim in <i>Johnson</i> are applicable here. It is true that the Commissioners’ claim would not involve extending the common law, as in <i>Johnson</i>. However, unlike in <i>Johnson</i>, the claim here is not based on a relationship recognised by the common law, but on obligations created by the very statute which contains the rights and remedies. In those circumstances, I do derive some support for my conclusion from <i>Johnson</i>. </p>
<p class="para">210.&nbsp;&nbsp;In reaching my conclusion, I do not rely directly on the existence of section 77A of the 1994 Act, which now enables the Commissioners to visit liability for VAT on any party to a transaction who “knew or had reasonable grounds to suspect” that it was part of a carousel fraud. However, its relatively recent enactment illustrates both the principle and the practicality of the legislature dealing with carousel fraud by claiming the unpaid VAT from a party such as Total. Perhaps of greater support is what the Advocate-General said in para 42 of his Opinion in <i>Optigen</i> in answer to the UK Government’s concern about combating carousel fraud. He accepted the desirability of “member states…taking appropriate measures against carousel fraud", and went on to point out that “article 21 of the Sixth Directive gives member states the opportunity to introduce joint and several fiscal liability", so that a person can be made responsible for the VAT due from a “co-contractor, if he knew or should have known of his co-contractor’s fraudulent activities". Another point arises from section 77A. Parliament has now legislated to ensure that certain parties involved in a carousel fraud, in addition to the primary taxpayer, should be liable for the VAT the Commissioners have lost as a result of the fraud, but this new legislation does not extend to a party such as Total. In those circumstances, it would seem wrong for the common law to intervene and hold Total nonetheless effectively liable to the Commissioners for that VAT. The alternative possibility, namely that the enactment of section 77A would now exonerate Total from common law liability would appear to run counter to the notion that the common law can “fill the holes” in the statutory scheme.</p>
<p class="para">211.&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 21.3 of the Sixth Directive provides that, where there is a taxable supply, “Member States may provide that someone other than the person liable for payment of the tax shall be held jointly and severally liable for payment of the tax". (This only came into effect in October 2000, but the predecessor article contained similar provisions in at the end of article 21.1(a) and 21.1(b)). The 1994 Act was intended to give effect to the Sixth Directive. The fact that the Directive clearly permits the legislature to extend liability for payment of VAT to persons not primarily liable for payment reinforces the conclusion that, as it did not do so in relation to cases such as this, it is not for the courts to do so. All the more so where the legislature has taken advantage of that right in the 1994 Act in relation to other types of case. </p>
<p class="para">212.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, and for those given by Lord Hope (which I believe are much the same), I am of the view that the Commissioners’ claim in these proceedings, whether based on the contention that they were wrongly deprived of output tax or on the contention that they were wrongly induced to credit and pay input tax, is effectively precluded by the 1994 Act. This conclusion renders it unnecessary to resolve the third issue, but I shall nonetheless consider it, not least because I understand that the majority of your Lordships consider that the Commissioners’ claim is not barred by the 1994 Act.  </p>
<i><p class="paraleft">If a claim in tort is permissible, is it made out on the pleadings?</p>
</i>
<p class="para">213.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commissioners’ case, as advanced both in writing and orally, against Total relies on the tort of unlawful means conspiracy. It is common ground that that tort involves an arrangement between two or more parties, whereby they effectively agree that at least one of them will use “unlawful means” against the claimant, and, although damage to the claimant need not be the predominant intention of any of the parties, the claimant must have suffered loss or damage as a result. It is also common ground that all those ingredients are present in the pleaded case against Total.</p>
<p class="para">214.&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason the Court of Appeal, albeit with regret, held that the Commissioners had not made out the claim in the present case was that there was an additional requirement of the tort which was not present. That requirement was that the unlawful means relied on must be independently actionable by the claimant against at least one of the parties to the alleged conspiracy. The question for your Lordships is whether that is correct.</p>
<p class="para">215.&nbsp;&nbsp;This issue appears to me only to arise in relation to the first basis upon which the Commissioners put their case. That claim alleges a conspiracy which involves no independent cause of action on the part of any of the alleged conspirators; what is relied on is that the conspiracy involved criminal means, namely cheating the Revenue. However, the second basis upon which the case is put seems to me to avoid the problem identified by the Court of Appeal. That is because, as already mentioned, the Commissioners contend that the conspiracy involved means which included an independently actionable tort, namely deceit on the part of Alldech. However, in case it transpires that this second basis is not maintainable and the first basis is otherwise maintainable, the Court of Appeal’s reason for holding the tort was not made out needs to be addressed.</p>
<p class="para">216.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlawful means conspiracy is one of the so-called economic torts, which include procuring a breach of contract, unlawful interference, causing loss by unlawful means, intimidation, and conspiracy to injure (or lawful means conspiracy). These torts present problems even if they are considered individually (and yet more problems arise if they are treated as a genus). This is as true of unlawful means conspiracy as of any of the other economic torts. The issue in the present case is what constitutes “unlawful means” in unlawful means conspiracy, and in particular whether, at least in a case such as the present, a criminal act is enough, or whether it must involve an act by at least one of the conspirators which is actionable at the suit of the claimant. </p>
<p class="para">217.&nbsp;&nbsp;This issue had not been expressly addressed by any court before it was specifically discussed and decided by the Court of Appeal in <i>Powell v Boladz </i>[1998] 1 Lloyd’s Rep Med 116. The reasoning of Stuart-Smith LJ (who gave the only reasoned judgment) is not only brief but, with respect, unsatisfactory. He cited three cases to justify the proposition that the unlawful means in the tort of unlawful conspiracy must be a civil wrong committed by at least one of the conspirators, actionable at the suit of the claimant; however, none of those cases in fact provides such support. In their opinions, Lord Walker and Lord Mance have authoritatively and fully considered the decisions which touched on this issue, before <i>Powell</i>, and I agree with their analyses.</p>
<p class="para">218.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only has the issue not been addressed in your Lordships’ House, but it has really only been considered in any detail at first instance, most fully and impressively by Davis J in <i>Mbasogo v Logo Ltd </i>[2005] EWHC 2034 (QB) at paras 51 to 89. As Davis J said at para 69, referring to <i>Lonrho Limited v Shell Petroleum Co Ltd</i> <i>(No 2)</i> [1982] AC 173 and <i>Lonrho Plc v Fayed</i> [1992] 1 AC 488, “there are statements in the various speeches in the cases on this topic in the House of Lords which are capable of being read either way", but they do not really grapple with the issue (because it was not relevant to the conclusion in either appeal). </p>
<p class="para">219.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, it appears to me that your Lordships’ House is free to decide the issue as it sees fit. However, we should plainly resolve the issue on a principled basis, in so far as that is possible in this very tricky area.</p>
<p class="para">220.&nbsp;&nbsp;At para 57 of his opinion in <i>OBG v Allan </i>[2007] 2 WLR 920, Lord Hoffmann (expressing the majority view in this House) said that the fact that the means involve a crime, without also involving a civilly actionable wrong, was insufficient to establish a claim for loss caused by unlawful means. Given the obvious desirability of consistency and coherence as between the economic torts, it can fairly be said that the same rule should apply to a claim in unlawful means conspiracy. Further, the point made by Lord Hoffmann at para 57 of <i>OBG</i>, that “it is not for the courts to create a cause of action out of a…criminal statute which Parliament did not intend to be actionable in private law” can fairly be said to be as applicable to unlawful means conspiracy as to causing loss by unlawful means.</p>
<p class="para">221.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, it appears that the law of tort takes a particularly censorious view where conspiracy is involved. Thus, a claim based on conspiracy to injure can be established even where no unlawful means, let alone any other actionable tort, is involved. That tort is therefore frequently described as anomalous; yet its existence is very well established. Its centrally important feature is that the conspiracy must have as its primary purpose injury to the claimant. In my judgment, given the existence of that tort, it would be anomalous if an unlawful means conspiracy could not found a cause of action where, as here, the means “merely” involved a crime, where the loss to the claimant was the obvious and inevitable, indeed in many ways the intended, result of the sole purpose of the conspiracy, and where the crime involved, cheating the revenue, has as its purpose the protection of the victim of the conspiracy. The difference between intending to make a profit at the claimant’s expense and intending to cause injury to the claimant is pretty fine and, in economic terms, artificial: that point emerges most clearly from the discussion in paras 130 to 134 in Lord Hoffmann’s opinion in <i>OBG</i>.</p>
<p class="para">222.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that the conclusion, at least on the facts of in this case, that the “mere” crime of cheating the Revenue can constitute unlawfulness for unlawful means conspiracy can be said to involve illegitimately creating a tort out of a crime, as mentioned in para 57 of <i>OBG</i>. First, there is the narrow point that the crime (or at least the crime primarily relied on in the Commissioners’ argument) in the present case is a common law one, and therefore there is no question of disregarding the legislature’s intention, which only arises where the tort is statutory. Secondly, there is the more general and telling point that the tort in this case involves the element of conspiracy, which is, of course, lacking in the tort considered in <i>OBG</i>. The importance of the ingredient of conspiracy has been examined and explained by Lord Walker and Lord Mance in their speeches, and is, as already mentioned, underlined in the field of economic torts by the anomalous tort of conspiracy to injure (or lawful means conspiracy). Thirdly, as already mentioned, the crime in the present case exists for the protection of the victim.</p>
<p class="para">223.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, in para 61 of his speech in <i>OBG</i>, Lord Hoffmann made it clear that his “discussion of unlawful means” was limited to cases involving “interference with the actions of a third party in relation to the plaintiff", and did not necessarily apply to “a case of ‘two party intimidation'", which, he said, “raises altogether different issues". In this case, as Lord Hope and Lord Mance have explained, the tort is of a “two party” nature, in that the conspiracy could be said to have been directed against the Commissioners. After all, it was directly intended (albeit for the purpose of enriching the conspirators) to deprive the Commissioners of money to which they were entitled, and, if successful, it was inevitably and foreseeably going to do so, and no tort, harm or crime as against any party other than the Commissioners was involved. As Lord Hoffmann implicitly recognised, it may therefore not be inappropriate to hold that the Commissioners have a cause of action in such circumstances, even though they might not have had a claim if they had suffered loss (particularly if it was as an incidental result) as a result of a crime directed at a third party.</p>
<p class="para">224.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the notion that the Commissioners have a claim here is not, in my view inconsistent with the reasoning of the majority in <i>OBG</i>,upon which Total relies. In any event, the notion of a single consistent approach as to what constitutes unlawfulness in relation to all the economic torts can be said to be inconsistent with what <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell </i>refer to as the “ramshackle” nature of the economic torts (at para 25-001) and with the statement in Stevens on <i>Torts and Rights </i>(2007) at p 297 that the economic torts “have no inherent unity” and that it is “a mistake to group these ‘torts’ together". I would in any event, at least in a case such as this, where injury to the claimant is the direct, inevitable and foreseeable result of the conspiracy succeeding, and where the crime can be said to exist for the protection of the victim, I would find it far less offensive to hold that unlawfulness can extend to a “mere” crime in unlawful means conspiracy, when it cannot do so in causing loss by unlawful means, than to hold that a “mere” crime cannot in any circumstances constitute unlawfulness in unlawful means conspiracy, when there is a tort of conspiracy to injure by means which are neither tortious nor criminal.</p>
<p class="para">225.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, I should record my agreement with Lord Walker and Lord Mance that, for the reasons they give, the tort of unlawful means conspiracy is not a form of secondary liability. Furthermore, although it involves an element of pulling oneself up by one’s own bootstraps, it is hard to see what role the tort of unlawful means conspiracy, whose existence is accepted by Total, could have if it did not apply in a case such as this. This is well illustrated by Stevens’s suggestion, at p 249, that there is no need for the tort of unlawful means conspiracy. This is on the basis that there are three well-established tortious principles which, between them, effectively “catch” almost all who would be caught by a claim in unlawful means conspiracy. First, there is the tort of causing loss by unlawful means, the tort considered in <i>OBG</i>. Secondly, there is the tort of conspiracy to injure, where injury to the claimant has to be the principle purpose of the conspiracy. Thirdly, there is the well-established principle that, where two or more parties join together in some way with a view to assisting or enabling one or more of them to commit a tort, all are liable for the tort as joint tortfeasors. </p>
<p class="para">226.&nbsp;&nbsp;On this basis, Stevens suggests that there is really no role for an additional tort of conspiring to injure by unlawful means. However, if a criminal act is sufficient unlawful means, at least in some circumstances (which Stevens challenges), the present case is an example of a claim which can (at least on the basis that the case has been argued by both parties) only succeed in unlawful means conspiracy. Conspiracy to injure cannot be relied on as injury to the Commissioners was not, it is apparently accepted by the Commissioners, the primary aim of the carousel fraud. Total could not be a joint tortfeasor if there is no claim in unlawful means conspiracy, because unlawful means conspiracy is the only tort relied on. There can be no claim in causing loss by unlawful means, as if the means involve a crime which is not civilly actionable, it does not count as unlawful means for that purpose (see <i>OBG </i>at para 57). </p>
<p class="para">227.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, in my view, on the basis of the arguments before your Lordships, a claim in unlawful means conspiracy could have been maintained on the Commissioners’ first basis of claim, as well as on the second basis, were it not precluded by the 1994 Act representing a “complete code". That is because, at least where the conspiracy has loss or damage to the claimant as the direct, foreseeable and inevitable consequence of its success, the fact that the means “only” involve a crime, at least where that is other than incidentally, appears to me to give rise to sufficient unlawfulness to establish a claim in unlawful means conspiracy.</p>
<p class="para">228.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it seems to me that, although this argument was abandoned by the Commissioners, it may be that the better route to this conclusion is that this is a case of conspiracy to injure, and that, as Stevens suggests, there is no need for the tort of unlawful means conspiracy. I referred earlier to the point that the reasoning in paras 130 to 134 of <i>OBG </i>supports the view that, in this case, there is little, if any, difference between the conspirators’ intention to make money and their intention to deprive the Commissioners of money: each is the obverse of the other. On that basis, it may well be that it could be said that the predominant purpose of Total and the other conspirators was indeed to inflict loss on the Commissioners just as much as it was to profit the conspirators, and hence the claim in tort is made out in conspiracy to injure. </p>
