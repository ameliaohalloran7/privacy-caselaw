<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77. Section 16(8) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 ("the Act") provides</p>
<p></p><ul>"Where the offices of First Minister and the deputy First Minister become vacant at any time an election shall be held under this section to fill the vacancies within a period of six weeks beginning with that time."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78. The requirement to hold an election within the six weeks is not discretionary but obligatory.  This is the effect of the word "shall": see <i>R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p Jeyeanthan</i> [2000]  1 WLR 354, 358 per<i> </i>Lord Woolf:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The requirement is never intended to be optional if a word such as "shall" or "must" is used."<p></p></ul>
<p>The principal question to be decided on this appeal is whether the requirement that the election be held within six weeks means that the vacancies cannot validly be filled by an election held after the expiry of that period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79. If the period of six weeks ends without a First Minister and deputy First Minister having been elected then section 32(3) provides that the Secretary of State shall propose a date for the election of a new Assembly.  In the ordinary way this will lead to the dissolution of the existing Assembly on a date fixed by Order in Council.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80. This gives rise to a secondary question whether, in proposing the date for the election of the new Assembly, the Secretary of State has a broad discretion allowing him to propose a date however far ahead so long only as it is not later than the date on which the existing Assembly would come to the end of its natural life; or whether it is a narrow discretion which allows him to take account of considerations of administrative convenience for the holding of an election in the immediate future but little else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81. The two questions are interdependent, for the width of the Secretary of State's discretion in proposing the date for the election of the new Assembly depends on whether it is possible to fill the vacancy by an election after the six week period has expired.  If it is not, then his discretion is necessarily narrow; if it is, then it is much less restricted. Thus the answer to either question supplies the answer to the other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82. Most of the argument both here and below has been taken up with the question whether the requirement to hold the election within the six week period is "mandatory" or "directory".  This is a shorthand way of referring to a question which arises whenever Parliament imposes a requirement that something 'shall' be done (meaning that it 'must' be done) without stating what are to be the consequences if it is not done. The requirement is said to be "mandatory" if failure to comply with it invalidates what follows; it is said to be "directory" when failure to comply does not do so.  This is a curious and distracting use of language.  It is curious, because as I have already explained the question is not whether the requirement must be complied with; it is distracting, because it distracts attention from the real question, which is what are the consequences of non-compliance.  It also leads to the mistaken idea that the use of the word "shall" itself provides an indication of the answer.  But it does not answer the question; it raises it. It means only that the requirement must be complied with; it does not indicate the consequences of non-compliance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83. Failure to comply with a condition as to time normally invalidates anything which is made conditional on compliance with it: see <i>Barker v Palmer</i> (1881)  8 QBD 9, 10; <i>Petch v Gurney</i> [1994]  3 All ER 731 CA.  Doing an act late is not the same as doing it in time. Accordingly, unless there is provision for the time to be extended, a time limit cannot be relaxed without being dispensed with altogether; and it usually cannot be dispensed with altogether without depriving the statutory requirement of all effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84. But this is not the question in the present case. Section 16(8) has been complied with.  An election to fill the vacancies was duly held within the six week period, but it was unsuccessful.  Section 32(3) caters for two situations; where no election is held within the time limited, and where an election is held within time but is unsuccessful.  The consequence in either case is expressly spelt out in the section; the Secretary of State is obliged to propose a date for the election of a new Assembly.  It is not necessary to treat either section 16(1) or 16(8) as invalidating an election held after the expiry of the six week period in order to give some effect to the time limits there laid down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85. In my opinion, therefore, the question is not whether the failure to fill the vacancies in the offices of First Minister and deputy First Minister within the time allowed invalidates an election held after that time has expired.  The present case raises the more fundamental and logically anterior question whether the Assembly has any power to hold any such election in the first place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86. The appellant submits correctly that the Assembly is a creature of statute.  It has only those powers which are conferred upon it expressly or by necessary implication by the Act.  It has no express power to hold elections for the office of First Minister and deputy First Minister. Any power to do so must be implied.  Such a power is, of course, implicit in sections 16(1) and 16(8); a requirement to hold an election within six weeks necessarily imports a power to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87. Wherever Parliament imposes a duty, it must be taken to have conferred a power to perform that duty. But ordinarily at least the power is coterminous with the duty.  So, the argument runs, by requiring the Assembly to hold an election within the period of six weeks Parliament must be taken to have conferred a power to hold it within that period. But there is no other source of the power.  Once the period has expired within which alone the Assembly has power to hold an election to fill the vacancies, an election to choose a new Assembly becomes both necessary and urgent, and the Secretary of State is obliged to exercise his discretion to propose a date for the holding of the necessary Assembly election within a narrow time frame.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88. This is a formidable argument. It is logically derived from the statutory language to which it gives full effect, and it produces a rational and coherent scheme.  But I do not think that it is correct. I prefer to start with the secondary question, which concerns the width of the discretion given to the Secretary of State to propose a date for the election of a new Assembly, in order to see whether it indicates a different answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89. As all the judges below  have acknowledged, the roles of the First Minister and deputy First Minister are crucial to the proper functioning of democratic government in Northern Ireland.  This was recognised by the Belfast Agreement, which the Act sought to implement.  The Assembly was to be the prime source of authority in respect of devolved matters; and the First Minister and deputy First Minister, elected with cross-community support from among the members of the Assembly, were to be the directing members of the new executive.  That is why the Assembly is given only six weeks to elect them.  And it is why, if it fails to do so within six weeks, the Assembly can be regarded as having failed and the Secretary of State is required to take steps for the election of a new Assembly.  The thinking is that if the Assembly cannot agree upon the election of a First Minister and deputy First Minister within six weeks, there had better be a new Assembly which can.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90. But the failure to elect a First Minister and deputy First Minister within the time limited does not result in the immediate and automatic dissolution of the Assembly.  It continues in existence for the time being until a date fixed by Order in Council on the recommendation of the Secretary of State.  It is his duty to propose the date for the election of the new Assembly.  No doubt he must act promptly, but he must be allowed a little time for consultations to take place, not only as to the appropriate dates for the dissolution of the existing Assembly and the holding of the election of a new one, but also as to the carrying on of government in the meantime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91. When, following such consultations, he proposes a date for the holding  of the election, he is bound to take account of anything which has happened since the six week period expired.  If in the short time which has elapsed since then the Assembly has succeeded in electing a First Minister and deputy First Minister, it cannot sensibly be regarded as having failed; the need to obtain a new Assembly as a matter of urgency in order to resolve the impasse will have disappeared.  It would subvert the purpose of the Act if the Secretary of State were obliged to take steps to dissolve an Assembly which had succeeded in electing a First Minister and deputy First Minister in order to obtain a new Assembly which might not be able to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92. This, of course, pre-supposes that the Assembly has power to elect a First Minister and deputy First Minister notwithstanding the expiry of the time limited by sections 16(1) and 16(8).  But it does suggest that Parliament is unlikely to have intended that the Assembly should lack such a power; that would be inconsistent with the purpose of the Act to secure stable government based on cross-community support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93. In my opinion the fallacy in the appellant's argument is that it seeks to derive the Assembly's power to elect a First Minister and deputy First Minister exclusively by implication from the terms of sections 16(1) and 16(8) alone.  I think that it is derived from the structure of the constitutional arrangements made by the Act and the provisions of Part III of the Act as a whole.  The basic requirement is that the First Minister and deputy First Minister are to be elected by the Assembly from among its members.  This requirement, which is contained in section 16(1), is not repeated in section 16(8), but it underlies the whole of the section, and is fundamental to the structure of democratic government in Northern Ireland. Section 16(2) and (3) subject the power of election to unusual conditions which were thought necessary in order to command wide popular support for the executive in the special circumstances of Northern Ireland.  Section 16(2) requires each candidate for either office to stand jointly with a candidate for the other office; section 16(3) provides that the successful candidates shall not be elected without the requisite cross-community support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94. I think that section 16(8) operates in a similar but in one respect significantly different way.  Like sections 16(2) and (3) it does not implicitly confer a power to elect the First Minister and deputy First Minister; it assumes the existence of such a power the source of which lies elsewhere.  It superimposes on that power a requirement that <i>an</i> election (not, it should be observed, <i>the</i> election) be held within the six week period, and provides for what is to happen if the vacancies are not filled within that time.  But what it conspicuously does not do is provide that the vacancies can be filled only within the time limited or by an election held within that time.  In other words, it does not expressly make the election conditional on its being held within the time allowed. In this respect section 16(8) is to be contrasted with sections 16(2) and (3), which make the election of the First Minister and deputy First Minister conditional upon their standing jointly and receiving the requisite cross-community support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95. I have not overlooked the fact that section 16(1) is worded differently. It provides that the Assembly: </p>
<p></p><ul>"shall, within a period of six weeks beginning with its first meeting, elect …… the First Minister and the deputy First Minister."<p></p></ul>
<p>But this cannot be taken literally. Parliament can require an election to be held within a stated period and provide for the consequences if such an election is unsuccessful; but it cannot command it to be successful. I would construe section 16(1) as I have construed section 16(8).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96. In my opinion the Assembly has power at any time to fill the offices of First Minister and deputy First Minister by election from among its members provided only that the requirements of section 16(2) and (3) are complied with. Sections 16(1) and 16(8) require the Assembly to hold elections to fill the vacancies within the relevant periods of six weeks, but they do not preclude it from filling the vacancies by an election held after the expiry of that time.  The only constraint upon the Assembly is that it should act speedily, for it must certainly act before it is dissolved and probably before the Secretary of State proposes the date of dissolution.</p>
