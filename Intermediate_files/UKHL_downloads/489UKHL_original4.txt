<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78.	In the construction of any agreement the problem for a court is to determine:</p>
<p></p><ul>"the meaning which the document would convey to a reasonable person having all the background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties in the situation in which they were at the time of the contract".<p></p></ul>
<i></i><p><i>Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd v West Bromwich Building Society</i> [1998] 1 WLR 896, 912, <i>per</i> Lord Hoffmann.  The knowledge reasonably available to them must include matters of law as well as matters of fact.  The problem is not resolved by asking the parties what they thought they intended.  It is the imputed intention of the parties that the court is concerned to ascertain.  The parties may well have never applied their minds to the particular eventuality which has subsequently arisen, so that they may never in fact have had any conscious intention in relation to that eventuality.  It is an objective approach which is required and a solution should be found which is both reasonable and realistic.  The meaning of the agreement is to be discovered from the words which they have used read in the context of the circumstances in which they made the agreement.  The exercise is not one where there are strict rules, but one where the solution is to be found by considering the language used by the parties against the background of the surrounding circumstances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79.	I agree with the view expressed in the Court of Appeal [2000] ICR 1410 that there are no "rules of equitable construction".  Such guides to construction as have been identified in the past should not be allowed to constrain an approach to construction which looks to commercial reality or common sense.  If they are elevated to anything approaching the status of rules they would deservedly be regarded as impedimenta in the task of construction.  But they may be seen as reflections upon the way in which people may ordinarily be expected to express themselves. Generally people will say what they mean.  Generally if they intend their agreement to cover the unknown or the unforeseeable, they will make it clear that their intention is to extend the agreement to cover such cases.  If an agreement seeks to curtail the possible liabilities of one party, he, if not both of them, will generally be concerned to secure that the writing clearly covers that curtailment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80.	On the face of it, if one were to take a strict or literal approach, the words of the agreement seem to include every claim of any kind, whether then identifiable or not, which Mr Naeem might have in any capacity against the bank at any time, then or in the future.  But such a comprehensive disclaimer would in my view be a remarkable thing for him to be giving, and indeed it is not suggested that its scope does extend to such a universality.  It is accepted that it does not relate to sums which Mr Naeem might have in any account which he had with the bank.  So this is not a case where the plain meaning of the words can be taken as conclusive.  There is then a real problem as to the precise scope of the disclaimer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81.	At one extreme the respondents in their statement of claim argued that the agreement properly construed was a compromise in respect of their claims for statutory redundancy pay, wages in lieu of notice and unfair dismissal only.  But that contention was not persisted in before Lightman J and it is clearly too narrow a solution.  It fails to recognise the reference to claims at common law or in equity, and the width of the reference to claims "of  whatsoever nature".  On the other hand the immediate context of the form COT-3 suggests that at least at the forefront of the parties' minds were the claims which Mr Naeem might present to an industrial tribunal.  Indeed Acas had been brought in to assist in the arrangements being made for the considerable number of cases where the bank was terminating employments and endeavouring to reach settlements of claims which would arise on such terminations. In the statement which had been prepared by Acas to explain the terms of the proposed settlement it was stated that Acas had been asked by the employer to "assist in reaching settlements of claims which might be made to an industrial tribunal arising out of the ending of your employment".  The statement went on to explain that in return for the sum of money and other benefits which were specified in the employer's letter:</p>
<p></p><ul>"you would agree to waive certain rights which you may have relating to possible claims to an industrial tribunal, (including unfair dismissal), or any other court."  <p></p></ul>
<p>The agreement was evidently intended to deal principally with claims which could be taken to the industrial tribunal. Hence the reference in the agreement "in particular" to claims of that kind.  But the reference to claims at common law and in equity of whatsoever nature must bring in matters beyond the scope of the jurisdiction of the industrial tribunal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82.	Claims at common law or in equity could at least include matters relating to the calculation or payment of past wages or other benefits to which the employee was entitled in terms of his contract.  A claim at common law for wrongful dismissal could also be included.  It seems to me that the context of the agreement is the termination of the employment and the desire of the employer to finalise any contractual debts due to the employees whose employment was being terminated  together with all statutory or common law obligations arising upon the termination of the contract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83.	Regard should also be given to the statements of redundancy disbursements  and redundancy payment calculation.  It appears from these documents that the basic package which the employer was offering sought to meet any claim for statutory redundancy pay and for sums due in lieu of notice.  It also allowed for settlement of other obligations and debts current between the parties in respect of mortgage subsidy, outstanding season ticket loan balance, current account overdraft and certain outstanding credit card debts.  These all seem to relate to a final accounting between the parties of any indebtedness by the employee towards the employer on the termination of their relationship.  But the employer was evidently to remain liable to the former employee in respect of any credit balances in any account he had with the bank and in respect of the pension rights expressly mentioned in the agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84.	The package also included an additional payment upon signing the form COT-3.  The sum appears to have been one twelfth of the gross annual salary.  Given that what the parties principally had in mind was the possibility of resort to the industrial tribunal it seems to me that an additional sum might not unreasonably be offered in order to secure finality and to avoid such a possibility.  The provisions of section 140(2)(d), (e) and (g) of the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978 are relevant in this connection.  By virtue of those provisions the involvement of Acas in the settlement of certain claims or potential claims to an industrial tribunal may exclude the operation of section 140(1), a section which otherwise would avoid any agreement such as the one here in issue to preclude an employee from bringing proceedings before the tribunal.  The benefit which the employer might well consider worth paying a month's salary for was the security of obviating any proceedings before the tribunal arising out of the termination of the employment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85.	The alternative is to suppose that the sum was meant to discharge all future claims whether they arose out of the termination of the employment or not.  While I can accept that it was intended to exclude any claims which the employee could then have made relating to the settlement of accounts at the termination of the employment, it seems to me improbable that the parties, in the context in which they were making this agreement, were intending to cut out all future claims of any kind not related to the termination.  It was not resolved in the course of the argument whether a claim for personal injury based on the negligence of the bank was meant to be covered by the agreement. I should have thought that if that had been intended , and if the amount of the month's salary was intended to cover that sort of future claim, some more specific indication of that would have been given in the terms of the agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86.	But the claim which the respondent now seeks to present for stigma damages is a far more remote possibility than a claim for personal injuries on the ground of negligence.  The stigma claim is one which neither party could have contemplated even as a possibility as the law stood at the time when the agreement was made. At that time it would not be known whether or not the employee would have any difficulty at all in finding alternative employment.  The bank's conduct had not yet achieved the notoriety which could create the stigma.  But even if those facts had been even suspected as a possibility the prospect of any liability falling on the bank to a former employee is something which must have been far beyond the reasonable contemplation of the parties.  Even without formulating any definition of the precise scope of the agreement, it seems to me that if the parties had intended to cut out a claim of whose existence they could have no knowledge they would have expressed that intention in words more precise than the generalities which they in fact used.  In so far as Mr Naeem may also seek to present a claim in tort for fraudulent misrepresentation inducing him to start the employment in the first place or to continue in it thereafter, while the legal basis for such a claim may not be particularly novel, the idea of such a claim at the time when the parties made the agreement at the termination of the employment seems to me correspondingly remote from what the parties might reasonably be taken in the circumstances to have contemplated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87.	The point has been stressed that claims for stigma damages may be extraordinarily difficult of proof and while the construction which I have preferred opens the door to Mr Naeem to present the claim, the hurdles which he may yet face may be very difficult to overcome.  But that is of course a consideration entirely irrelevant to the question of construction raised in this case.  Having reached the view which I have on the matter of construction it is unnecessary to say anything about any equitable considerations which might operate to prevent the bank relying upon the agreement, were it wide enough to comprehend the stigma claim.</p>
