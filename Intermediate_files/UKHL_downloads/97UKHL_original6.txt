<p class="para">132.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Rodger has set out in paras 112 to 114 the considerations which were taken into account in making the decision and I need not repeat them.  The feasibility reports make it abundantly plain that resettlement in the Chagos Islands, even with substantial financial support, would have been impracticable.  The whole substructure of their economy had disappeared and could not be recreated.  The practicability of starting replacement occupations was extremely doubtful.  The wisdom of settling in the atolls, given the ecological factors now pertaining, was questionable.  Looming over all considerations were the twin issues of prohibitive cost and the United Kingdom’s interests in co-operation with an important ally in maintaining a secure defence installation.  The Secretary of State was quite justified in taking all these factors into account.  Criticisms have been advanced of the validity of the reasons advanced on behalf of the United States for wanting to keep the whole of the Territory free from settlement, but even if it might be said that the concerns expressed appear exaggerated, the fact remains that the US clearly desired to keep a large clear area around the base.  Decisions about how far to accommodate such concerns and wishes are very much a matter for ministers, who have access to a range of information not available to the courts and are accountable to Parliament for their actions.  I think that courts should be more than a little slow to pin that butterfly to the wheel.  I accordingly conclude, in full agreement with Lord Hoffmann and Lord Rodger, that the Secretary of State’s decision should not be set aside on the ground of irrationality.</p>
<p class="para">133.&nbsp;&nbsp; The final issue which I want to discuss is that of legitimate expectation.  All members of the Court of Appeal were in agreement that the Chagossians had a legitimate expectation that they would be permitted to return, and that the prohibition contained in the 2004 Orders in Council brought about a breach of that.  The principles governing what is now known as substantive legitimate expectation were outlined by the Court of Appeal in <i>R v North and East Devon Health Authority, Ex p Coughlan </i>[2001] QB 213 in a judgment which has now become very familiar.  They have not yet been considered in depth by the House, although in <i>R (Reprotech (Pebsham) Ltd) v East Sussex County Council </i>[2003] 1 WLR 348, 354, para 34 Lord Hoffmann accepted <i>Coughlan </i>as correct.  I would therefore prefer not to express a concluded opinion on the limits of the concept.  I am content, however, for present purposes to accept that breach of such an expectation can give rise to an actionable claim and to consider the issue on that basis.</p>
<p class="para">134.&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the publication of the court’s decision in <i>Bancoult 1</i>, the Secretary of State issued the following press release on 3 November 2000:</p>
<p class="qt">“I have decided to accept the court’s ruling and the Government will not be appealing.  The work we are doing on the feasibility of resettling the Ilois now takes on a new importance.  We started the feasibility work a year ago and are now well underway with phase two of the study.  </p>
<p class="qt">Furthermore, we will put in place a new Immigration Ordinance which will allow the Ilois to return to the outer islands while observing our Treaty obligations.  </p>
<p class="qt">This Government has not defended what was done or said 30 years ago.  As Laws LJ recognised, we made no attempt to conceal the gravity of what happened.  I am pleased that he has commended the wholly admirable conduct in disclosing material to the court and praised the openness of today’s Foreign Office.”</p>
<p class="para">The respondent and the other Chagossians claim that this statement without more gave rise to a legitimate expectation on their part that they could return to the Chagos Islands.  As Lord Hoffmann has pointed out in para 61, the background to the statement was the feasibility study, reference to which was prominent in the press statement.  I agree with him that it could not be said that the statement gave an unequivocal assurance that they could be allowed to resettle the islands, irrespective of the conclusions of the feasibility study.  Their desire to be allowed to pay more transient visits is not at the centre of the dispute, and this has indeed been accommodated.  For the reasons given by Lord Hoffmann and Lord Rodger, I also consider that the Government did not give the Chagossians a clear and unambiguous promise that they would be allowed to return and resettle permanently on the outer islands.  I might add two other points.  The press statement was not an assurance directed towards one individual or a small number of people, whereas in <i>Coughlan, </i>para 60 the Court of Appeal regarded such a limitation as a significant feature in favour of the applicant’s claim.  Secondly, if the Government were obliged to resettle the Chagossians, the consequences could be more than financial, as it could give rise to friction with the United States (see <i>Coughlan, </i>para 60).  </p>
<p class="para">135.&nbsp;&nbsp;The basis of the jurisdiction is abuse of power and unfairness to the citizen on the part of a public authority: see <i>Coughlan,</i> para 82.  On this basis it has been held that two factors, both present in the case before the House, tend to show that there has not been an abuse of power.  The first is when the authority changes its policy on sufficient public grounds.  If there is an overriding public interest behind its change of policy, it will not be an abuse of power: <i>Coughlan, </i>para 57; <i>R v Secretary of State for Education and Employment, Ex p Begbie </i> [2000] 1 WLR 1115, 1130-1131.  The second factor is whether the claimant has relied on the promise or representation, in particular whether he has thereby suffered any detriment.  The Court of Appeal has affirmed the necessity for this.  In <i>Begbie </i>Peter Gibson LJ said at 1123-1124 that it would be</p>
<p class="qt">“wrong to understate the significance of reliance in this area of the law.  It is very much the exception, rather than the rule, that detrimental reliance will not be present when the court finds unfairness in the defeating of a legitimate expectation.”</p>
<p class="paraleft">Cf also <i>R (Bibi) v Newham London Borough Council </i>[2002] 1 WLR 237, 246, where the court adopted at para 29 the statement in Craig, <i>Administrative Law, </i>4th ed, p 619 that “detrimental reliance will normally be required.”  If it could be said, contrary to my opinion, that the press statement of 3 November 2000 did contain a sufficiently clear and unambiguous promise or representation, these factors would militate against affording a remedy to the Chagossians.</p>
<p class="para">136.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reasons which I have given I would allow the appeal and make the order proposed by Lord Hoffmann.  I do not do so through any lack of sympathy with the Chagossians.  They were undoubtedly treated very shabbily when they were removed from the Islands.  They were paid some compensation, but very tardily, while they suffered considerable privations after their removal.  No one could fail to feel distressed about their plight at that time.  It is the function of the courts, however, to adjudicate upon legal rights, and no matter how sympathetic they may be to a party who has been badly treated in the past, they are required to apply the law in the present and apply it properly and impartially - in the words of the Book of Common Prayer, truly and indifferently minister justice.  It is that imperative which has taken me to the conclusion which I have reached. </p>

<p class="lawlord">My Lords</p>
<i><p class="para">Introduction</p></i>
<p class="para">137.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a much traversed history to this latest appeal arising from the creation of the British Indian Overseas Territories (“BIOT”) in 1965 and its vacation over the next eight years by its inhabitants, the Ilois or Chagossians. Accounts will be found in paras 6 to 20 of the Divisional Court’s judgment in previous proceedings brought by Mr Bancoult, <i>R (Bancoult) v Secretary of State for the Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (“Bancoult I”) </i>[2001] QB 1067, in the judgments given by Ouseley J in <i>Chagos Islanders v Attorney General </i>[2003] EWHC 2222 (QB) and by the Court of Appeal in the same proceedings, [2004] EWCA Civ 997 as well as in the judgments below in the present case, [2006] EWHC 1038 (Admin) and [2007] EWCA Civ 498. The speech of my noble and learned friend, Lord Hoffmann, contains in paras 1 to 30 an outline of events up to the commencement of the present proceedings which I am happy to adopt for present purposes with few qualifications. </p>
<p class="para">138.&nbsp;&nbsp;One qualification concerns paras 15 and 23, in relation to which I note that it is clear that the 1971 Ordinance (Ordinance No 1 of 1971) was enacted by the Commissioner of BIOT on 16 April 1971 following a decision taken in London in or by March 1971 that all the Chagos Islands should be cleared of their “extremely unsophisticated” inhabitants; that the Chagossians’ objection to the 1971 Ordinance does not depend upon whether or not the 1971 Ordinance was the reason why they left; and that it is not in my view shown that the Chagossians have been, in <i>Bancoult I </i>or the present proceedings, engaged in a mere campaign to obtain United Kingdom government support for resettlement or to embarrass the United Kingdom and United States governments. Their wish for recognition of their historic connection, and on their case rights of abode, in relation to the Chagos Islands is deep-felt, longstanding and, in my view, understandable. Arguments that any right of abode is symbolic, since it would be impracticable to exercise without expensive government support to which it is accepted that there is no right and which would not be forthcoming, in my view miss the point. If anything, they indicate that the right claimed could be recognised without this being likely to have any practical effect on the present state of the Chagos Islands. These islands (apart from Diego Garcia) appear to exist as an unspoilt nature paradise to which an increasing number of long-distance yachtsmen venture to spend periods of months without noticeable disturbance to the operations of the United States base at Diego Garcia many miles away. </p>
<p class="para">139.&nbsp;&nbsp;BIOT consists of the Chagos Archipelago, originally a dependency of Mauritius, which was (after capture in 1810) ceded to the United Kingdom by France in 1814. Mr Bancoult was born in the Chagos Islands, living it appears on one of the islands, Peros Banhos (considerably more than 100 miles north of Diego Garcia), until March 1968. In 1965 the Chagos Islands together with three other islands previously part of the Seychelles (Aldabra, Desroches and Farquhar) were constituted a separate colony by the British Indian Ocean Territory Order 1965. The Order established the office of Commissioner and gave him the right to make laws for the peace, order and good government of BIOT. The Order was also expressed to reserve to Her Majesty “full power to make laws from time to time for the peace, order and good government of [BIOT] (including, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, laws amending or revoking this Order)". In 1976 Aldabra, Desroches and Farquhar were returned to the Seychelles as part of the preparation for the Seychelles’ independence. The 1965 Order was at the same time replaced by an Order in similar terms, but confining BIOT to the Chagos Islands. In the meanwhile, the Commissioner had enacted the 1971 Ordinance, providing that no-one should enter or be present in BIOT without a permit, and the Chagossians had in fact (it appears by the end of May 1973) all left the Chagos Islands. The Divisional Court’s judgment, handed down formally in <i>Bancoult I </i>on 3 November 2000 but no doubt distributed in draft some days beforehand, established that the 1971 Ordinance was <i>ultra vires </i>the Commissioner and the 1965 Order. </p>
<p class="para">140.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Foreign Secretary, then Mr Robin Cook, decided to accept the court’s decision and not to appeal, and, accordingly, on the day the judgment was handed down, issued the press release which my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann has set out in para 17. Also on 3 November 2000 the Commissioner made Ordinance No 4 of 2000 substituting, for the restrictive regime which had been held void of the 1971 Ordinance, a new regime. The new regime contained an exception from the requirement in section 4(1) to have a permit in order to enter or remain in BIOT, for any person being under the British Nationality Act 1981 “a British Dependent Territories citizen …. by virtue of his connection with [BIOT]” (section 4(3)).  On 10 June 2004 Her Majesty in Council enacted the British Indian Ocean Territory (Constitution) Order 2004 (“the BIOT Order 2004”), revoking the 1976 and other previous orders, re-enacting various constitutional provisions, but including section 9. Section 9 recites that, whereas BIOT “was constituted and is set aside to be available for defence purposes” of the governments of the United Kingdom and of the United States, “no person has the right of abode in the Territory” (section 9(1)) and that “Accordingly, no person is entitled to enter or be present in the Territory except as authorised by or under this Order or any other law for the time being in force in the Territory” (section 9(2)). By a separate Immigration Order on the same date, Her Majesty in Council prohibited any entry or presence without a permit which an immigration officer might issue or renew “acting in his entire discretion". Mr Bancoult’s present challenge is directed primarily at the validity of section 9 of the BIOT Order 2004, which is the basis for the Immigration Order. </p>
<p class="para">141.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the heart of this appeal lie questions as to the scope of the prerogative legislative power which Her Majesty in Council retains over BIOT and its vulnerability or otherwise to any form of review or challenge. I can identify at the outset some points on which I am in full agreement with my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann and one point which I prefer to leave open. First, the prerogative power of the Crown to legislate by order in council on the advice of Her Majesty’s ministers in relation to a territory such as BIOT is subject to judicial review. Dicey observed in his <i>Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution </i>(8th ed 1915) that “we may use the term ‘prerogative’ as equivalent to the discretionary authority of the executive” (p 421) and that “it applies …. also to that large and constantly increasing number of proceedings which, though carried out in the King’s name, are in truth wholly the acts of the Ministry” (p 422). Into the latter category fall the making of legislative orders in council such as the BIOT Order 2004. I see no good reason why they should not be reviewable in the same way as other steps, administrative or legislative, by the executive, and every reason why they should be, on the familiar grounds of legality, rationality and procedural propriety, due weight being of course given to the executive’s effective role as primary decision-maker. A recognition that a legislative order in council is invalid by a judgment given in proceedings such as the present directed against the Minister responsible for the making of the order no more involves the making of an impermissible order against the Sovereign than a successful challenge to any other prerogative act undertaken in Her name. </p>
<p class="para">142.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that the Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865 is no obstacle to such review in the present case, for the reasons given by my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann in paras 36 to 41. The third point is that, for the reasons given by Lord Hoffmann in paras 64 to 65, the Human Rights Act and Convention have no role to play in this litigation. The fourth point is one that, in the light of the other conclusions which I reach on this appeal, I prefer to leave for consideration in another case. It is whether and, if so, to what extent, international law may have any relevance to the exercise or to judicial review of the exercise of the power to make Orders in Council in respect of a territory such as BIOT (see also para 145 below).</p>
<i><p class="para">Scope of the prerogative power</p></i>
<p class="para">143.&nbsp;&nbsp;Logically prior to any question of judicial review of its exercise is the question whether the scope of the prerogative legislative power is subject to any relevant limit. That is any limit affecting the ability of the Crown to make an order in council precluding Chagossians, and Mr Bancoult in particular, from returning to BIOT without a permit. Mr Jonathan Crow QC for the Secretary of State relies heavily upon the equivalence, as he submits, of the power to make laws of Her Majesty in Parliament in the domestic sphere (in which it is now recognised that this is the only way in which laws can be made) and of Her Majesty in Council to make laws in the present sphere, where the Crown in Council remains the primary legislative authority in relation to BIOT, so long as Parliament has not by statute otherwise provided. He notes that in relation to other overseas territories Parliament has substituted for prerogative rule a statutory scheme (eg in the West Indies), and that BIOT and Gibraltar remain exceptions where prerogative rule survives, by inference by Parliament’s deliberate will.</p>
<p class="para">144.&nbsp;&nbsp;These are powerful considerations. But they do not lead necessarily to a conclusion that the Crown’s prerogative power in respect of a ceded colony or territory is without any limit. First, it is to be noted that in relation to settled territories the Crown’s prerogative power was at common law confined to establishing a constitution granting settlers the right to legislate for themselves: see Sir Kenneth Roberts-Wray QC’s <i>Commonwealth and Colonial Law </i>(1966) p 151 and <i>Sammut v Strickland </i>[1938] AC 678, 701, where Lord Maugham observed that “The Crown clearly had no prerogative right to legislate in such a case". This lack of power was addressed by the British Settlements Act 1887, which conferred on the Queen in Council power to make such laws as appear to her “necessary for the peace, order and good government of Her Majesty’s subjects and others within any British settlement". The aim was to equate the powers of the Queen in Council in British settlements with her powers over ceded colonies: see Roberts-Wray at pp 166-168. </p>
<p class="para">145.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, as Mr Crow points out, no express definition of the Queen’s powers over ceded colonies in terms of their “peace, order and good government", but the British Settlements Act suggests that this phrase reflects the generally understood nature of such powers. However, it is also, as Mr Crow submits, a phrase which has received the widest interpretation. “Once it is found that a particular topic of legislation is among those upon which a legislature may competently legislate under the relevant constitution", the words “authorise the utmost discretion of enactment for the attainment of the objects pointed to": see <i>Croft v Dunphy </i>[1933] AC 156 (PC), 163-164, per Lord Macmillan giving the opinion of the Board and quoting in the latter part <i>Riel v The Queen</i> (1885) 10 App Cas 675 (PC), 678, per Lord Halsbury LC; and see also <i>Winfat Enterprise (HK) Co Ltd v Attorney General of Hong Kong </i>[1985] AC 733. In <i>Croft v Dunphy </i>Lord Macmillan went on at p 165: “When a power is conferred to legislate on a particular topic it is important, in determining the scope of the power, to have regard to what is ordinarily treated as embraced within that topic in legislative practice and particularly in the legislative practice of the State which has conferred the power".  The permissible topics of legislation referred to in these authorities were expressed in the relevant constitutions. In <i>Croft v Dunphy </i>the Privy Council left open also a possibility that the power conferred in that case by the British North America Act 1867 on the Dominion Parliament might implicitly be limited to the enactment of legislation conforming with international law. This is the point that, as I have mentioned, I prefer to leave open. But the fact that the Privy Council contemplated the possibility underlines the difference between legislation by the Crown in Council and by the Crown in Parliament. This appeal raises the question whether there is any implied limitation as regards the topics upon which Her Majesty may at common law legislate in Council for a ceded territory such as BIOT.</p>
<p class="para">146.&nbsp;&nbsp;A second point is that the Crown in Council may suspend or divest itself of its prerogative power of legislation in a territory subject to the Crown, in contrast at least theoretically with the Crown in Parliament. The rule was established in <i>Campbell v Hall </i>(1774) 1 Cowp 204, where the court in a judgment delivered by Lord Mansfield held, after the case had been “very elaborately argued four several times", that in relation to the conquered colony of Grenada the Crown had, by issuing letters patent providing that subordinate legislation over the island should be exercised by an assembly with the consent of the governor and council, divested itself of the power to legislate by later letters patent relating to excise duties, something that “can only now be done, by the assembly of  the island, or by an Act of the Parliament of Great Britain” (pp 213-214). The scope of this limitation is discussed in Roberts-Wray at pp 157-162. The conclusion there reached is that the grant of legislative institutions is irrevocable, unless the power of revocation is reserved (a proposition vouched by <i>Sammut v Strickland </i>at p 704), but that amendment of a constitution not amounting to revocation of the grant remains within the prerogative rights of the Crown. For present purposes, what matters is that the Crown’s legislative prerogative in Council was not treated as parallel in all its features to the sovereign and inalienable power of the Crown in Parliament. </p>
<p class="para">147.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, in <i>Campbell v Hall </i>the court laid down six general propositions which it thought “quite clear” and which included limitations on the Crown’s power: the first was that a conquered country becomes a dominion of the King in right of his Crown and therefore necessarily subject to the legislature, the Parliament of Great Britain; the second, that the conquered inhabitants once received under the King’s protection, become subjects and are to be universally considered in that regard, not as enemies or aliens; the third, that the articles of capitulation and peace are sacred and inviolable according to their true intent and meaning; the fourth, that the law and legislative government of every dominion equally affects all persons and all property within the limits thereof; and is the rule of decision for all questions which arise there; the fifth, that the laws of a conquered country continue in force, until they are altered by the conqueror; and the sixth and last “that, if the King (and when I say the King, I always mean the King without the concurrence of Parliament) has a power to alter the old and to introduce new laws in a conquered country, this legislation being subordinate, that is, subordinate to his own authority in Parliament, he cannot make any new change contrary to fundamental principles: he cannot exempt an inhabitant from that particular dominion; as, for instance, from the laws of trade, or from the power of Parliament, or give him privileges exclusive of his other subjects; and so in many instances which might be put” (pp 208-209). </p>
<p class="para">148.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Liyanage v The Queen </i>[1967] AC 259 the appellants sought to invoke Lord Mansfield’s sixth proposition in the context of an argument that, since Ceylon’s independence was the product of one or more Orders in Council in 1946 rather than of Parliamentary legislation, the Ceylon Parliament could not have been granted greater powers than those of the Queen in Council, and that, as a result, legislation altering ex post facto the definition and procedures relating to certain criminal offences could be disregarded as contrary to fundamental principle and void. The Privy Council held that the Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865 had been passed to overcome any suggestion that colonial legislative acts might be regarded as void for any reason other than repugnancy to an Act of the United Kingdom, and that this had been repeated and extended by Act of the United Kingdom Parliament (the Ceylon Independence Act 1947) which provided that no law of the Ceylon Parliament should be void as repugnant to any existing or future Act of the United Kingdom Parliament. The Board did not accept that the removal of the fetter of repugnancy to English law “left in existence a fetter of repugnancy to some vague unspecified law of natural justice” (p 284G). Strictly, the decision does not touch the question whether Lord Mansfield’s sixth proposition still applies to the scrutiny in this jurisdiction of the BIOT Order 2004, for the reasons given by my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann in paras 40-41 of his speech. But it is right to add that the Board in <i>Liyanage </i>doubted “whether Lord Mansfield was intending to say that what was not repugnant to English law might yet be repugnant to fundamental principles or to set up the latter as a different test from the former” (p 285A), and it noted that “no case has been cited in which during the last 100 years any judgment (or, so far as one can see, any argument) has been founded on that portion of Lord Mansfield’s judgment” (p 285B). </p>
<p class="para">149.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the scope of the royal prerogative to legislate in council is “a pure question of English common law": <i>Sammut v Strickland </i>at p 697.  The principle goes back to <i>The Case of Proclamations </i>(1611) 12 Co Rep 74, 76, where Coke CJ said that “the King hath no prerogative, but that which the law of the land allows him". Lord Mansfield’s six propositions in <i>Campbell v Hall </i>demonstrate, first, that the Crown’s prerogative power to legislate in Council was not regarded as an equivalent or parallel power, but rather as subordinate, to the Crown’s power to legislate in Parliament, and that the primary legislative body was the latter, and, second, that the court was ready and able to attach what were at that time considered appropriate limits to the Crown’s power to legislate in Council. Further, in determining the scope of the royal prerogative, the courts will look for guidance to its previous mode of exercise. Considering the scope of the admittedly residual prerogative power to take property in times of war in <i>Burmah Oil Co (Burma Trading) Ltd v Lord Advocate </i>[1965] AC 75, 101D, Lord Reid said that the proper approach was “a historical one: how was it used in former times and how has it been used in modern times?". </p>
