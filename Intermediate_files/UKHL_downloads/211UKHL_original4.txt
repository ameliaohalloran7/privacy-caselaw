<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;71.&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Department and the TECs therefore envisaged was that initially the civil servants would not be offered employment by the various TECs but would be seconded to them.  There the "secondees" would remain employed as civil servants but would do what was required for the TECs to carry on their enterprise and training activities.  And - so far as anyone could see - that was indeed exactly what happened.  The Department continued to regard the secondees working in the TECs as Department civil servants, drawing their salaries from the Department and enjoying all the benefits, including the pension, to which civil servants of their grades were entitled.  More particularly, the respondents were not offered employment by Newtec, but when they started work with the company in September 1990, as the employment tribunal found, at para 13 of its decision, "there was no difference between tasks they performed with Newtec and the tasks they had with the Department of Employment the day before."  They were working in an office that was now run by Newtec, but they were doing so as civil servants of the Department on secondment.  They continued to work in this way until the summer of 1993.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime the government had gone on developing its policy on the future of the TECs and, in particular, on the status of those working in the TECs.  On 16 December 1991 the Secretary of State announced the arrangements which were to enable all TECs to become employers of their own staff by the end of their fifth year of operation.  A Question and Answer briefing of the same date shows that there had been meetings with various interested parties, including the trade unions.  The unions had "refused to accept the principle that secondments should end."  Although the decision that TECs should employ their staff had been announced, correspondence available to the employment tribunal shows that a lot more work still needed to be done behind the scenes because the TECs were apprehensive about the costs which they would incur if it were held that, when the secondments ended and the civil servants became their employees, the TUPE Regulations applied so as to make for continuity of employment.  There were also concerns about any liability for pensions.  Eventually, however, a package was worked out and the necessary funding arrangements were put in place with effect from 1 January 1993.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73.&nbsp;&nbsp;Newtec then moved to implement the policy of ending the use of secondees and of employing only its own staff.  In May 1993 the Managing Director wrote to the respondents offering them employment and enclosing a summary of the general terms and conditions of employment negotiated with the union.  Civil servants, such as the respondents, were not obliged to take up the offer of employment:  they could, if they wished, ask for a post elsewhere in the Department, but they could not continue to work for Newtec as seconded civil servants.  Both the respondents Deborah Hawkes and Julie Owens agreed to take up the offer of direct employment with Newtec from 1 July.  Miss Hawkes intimated her wish to resign from the civil service with effect from 1 July in a letter dated 2 July.  Miss Owens wrote on 1 July protesting at the way that she had "been resigned", and adding that "Whilst I am happy with my offer of employment and generally satisfied with the terms and conditions I would have preferred to remain on long term secondment from the Department.  I realise that this is not on offer."  John Astley and four others indicated that they intended to return to the Employment Service, but Mr Astley must later have changed his mind since the documents show that he became an employee of Newtec on 1 September 1993.  The respondents then worked as employees of Newtec until 1998 when Miss Hawkes was dismissed on the grounds of redundancy.  All three respondents then referred the question of the length of their period of continuous employment to the tribunal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74.&nbsp;&nbsp;In each case the respondent's statement of complaint to the tribunal in 1998 was in similar terms and began:  "On 31 August 1993 I became employed full time by Newtec and remained so until it was merged in April 1997 to form CELTEC."  Why the date of 31 August, rather than 1 July or 1 September 1993, was chosen is not clear - perhaps in the hope of avoiding any question about the applicability of the TUPE Regulations which had been amended with effect from the previous day.  For present purposes what matters, however, is that, when applying to the tribunal, all three respondents proceeded on the basis that they had been employed by the Department until the summer of 1993 and that it was only when they then resigned from the Department and accepted the offer of direct employment with Newtec that they became employees of Newtec.  This is hardly surprising since, as the narrative of events shows, that was precisely how the whole matter was seen by the Department, by the TECs, by the trade unions and, of course, by the respondents themselves.  It would have come as a considerable shock to the respondents, for example, if they had suddenly been told in the summer of 1993 that ever since September 1990 they had not, in fact, been civil servants and so their service during that period had not counted towards their civil service pension.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the hearing on the disposal of the appeal in light of the answers returned by the Court of Justice to the questions referred by the House, it was common ground that the ruling of the Court of Justice meant that the relevant part of the Department's undertaking was transferred to Newtec in September 1990.  For the appellant, Mr Bowers QC submitted that the appeal should accordingly be allowed, since the respondents' case had all along been perilled on the proposition that, in terms of article 3(1) of the Directive, the transfer to Newtec of the relevant part of the Department's undertaking, and hence of its obligations from its employment relationship with the respondents, occurred in 1993.  If, as the Court of Justice judgment now confirmed, the transfer of the relevant part of the undertaking occurred in 1990, then there was no transfer of the respondents' rights under their contracts of employment with the Department when, three years later, they became direct employees of Newtec.  By contrast, counsel for the respondents now argued that, since the Directive was to be interpreted as meaning that the relevant part of the Department's undertaking transferred in September 1990, by virtue of article 3(1) the Department's obligations under its employment relationship with the respondents must also have transferred to Newtec at that time.  So the Directive still operated to maintain the respondents' continuity of employment - even though not in a way that their legal representatives had envisaged at any previous stage in the proceedings from the lodging of their applications with the employment tribunal until now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76.&nbsp;&nbsp;Counsel for the appellant submitted that it was too late for the respondents to perform this somersault and the House should not entertain the argument.  If, however, the House were prepared to do so, the matter should be remitted to the employment tribunal so that the appellant could have an opportunity, if so advised, of leading further evidence about what happened in 1990.  In the light of that further evidence, the appellant would hope to persuade the tribunal that, even though normally the effect of transferring the relevant part of the undertaking would have been to transfer the employer's obligations from the Department to Newtec, this case should be regarded as exceptional since the respondents had so clearly decided that they wished to remain civil servants in the Department, rather than to transfer to the employment of Newtec.  Their deliberate choice should be respected.  Counsel was not unaware of the potential difficulty posed for any such contention by the fact that, in paras 37 and 38 of its judgment [2005] IRLR 647, 658, under reference to its previous case law, the Court of Justice envisages as "the sole reservation" to the transfer of the employment obligations from the transferor to the transferee the situation where "following a decision freely taken by [the workers themselves] they are at liberty, after the transfer, not to continue the employment relationship with the new employer".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the hearing, I was satisfied that, since this is a test case, it would not be appropriate to refuse to consider the respondents' new argument - even though it was a complete volte face.  On the other hand, it seemed to me that, precisely because the entire proceedings had been conducted on a completely different basis, justice to the appellant required that the matter should be remitted to the employment tribunal.  This would at least give the appellant an opportunity to advance its fallback argument on the basis of a more detailed examination of the events in 1990 than had been required in a hearing where the focus had been on the position in 1993.  The resulting further delay in the proceedings would be unfortunate but any resulting decision in the test case would be that much more securely based.  Essentially, my position was the same as Lord Mance's.  So, but for what I now go on to say, I would have taken much the same approach as he is to adopt in paras 114 and 115 of his speech.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78.&nbsp;&nbsp;More fundamentally worrying for me throughout the hearing, however, was the idea, implicit in both parties' submissions, that, unless a new exception could be recognised - which would assuredly require a further reference to the European Court of Justice - in this case article 3(1) of the Directive had the effect of obliterating what had actually happened and of putting in its place an entirely fictitious version of events.  In that alternative world the Department's civil servants were never seconded to Newtec in September 1990, never worked as secondees, never resigned from the civil service and never accepted an offer of employment from Newtec in 1993.  The special terms in that supposed offer of employment, which were designed to provide additional protection in respect of redundancy and certain other employment rights, would never have been needed and could never have had any effect.  For, it must now be held, by 1993 the civil servants were civil servants no more:  since September 1990 they had all along been working as employees of Newtec - blissfully unaware that they were not earning any enhancement to their civil service pension since, by virtue of article 3(3), the Department's pension obligations had not transferred to Newtec.  Similarly, the complex negotiations between the government and the TECs in 1991 and 1992 had been in vain since, unbeknown to anyone, the Department's obligations under its employment relationship with the relevant civil servants had already passed to those TECs, like Newtec, which had commenced operations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Directive really had to be interpreted as having this effect, this legal fiction would play as spectacular a role in the law of the European Community as fictions ever played in the law of ancient Rome.  More to the point perhaps, the fiction would produce apparently absurd and impractical results and difficulties.  What, for instance, would be the status of any pension "rights" which had apparently, but not actually, accrued between September 1990 and the summer of 1993?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80.&nbsp;&nbsp;Happily, closer inspection of the decision of the Court of Justice which is supposed to have spawned this troublesome fiction reveals a rather different picture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second recital in the preamble to the Directive ("Whereas it is necessary to provide for the protection of employees in the event of a change of employer, in particular, to ensure that their rights are safeguarded") reminds us that the only purpose of the Directive is to provide protection to employees in the event of a change in their employer.  In para 26 of its decision in the present case, the Court of Justice emphasises this point when it refers to its earlier case law and says [2005] IRLR 647, 657:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Directive 77/187 is intended to safeguard the rights of workers in the event of a change of employer by making it possible for them to continue to work for the new employer on the same conditions as those agreed with the transferor.  The purpose of the Directive is to ensure, as far as possible, that the contract of employment or employment relationship continues unchanged with the transferee, in order to prevent the workers concerned from being placed in a less favourable position solely as a result of the transfer…."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82.&nbsp;&nbsp;If one stops and asks whether in September 1990 the respondents were in need of the protection of a Directive which has this purpose, the answer is surely that they were not, because there was no change in their employer and it was never intended that there should be:  they remained, and were intended by all concerned to remain, employees of the Department with exactly the same rights as before, the only difference being that they had been seconded to work for Newtec for three years.  Employees need the protection of the Directive when there is a change of employer and they are at risk of finding that they have no job or that their conditions of employment have been changed for the worse.  Neither eventuality arose in September 1990.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Justice draws attention to the fact that the Directive applies to transfers "to another employer" in paras 31 and 32 of its opinion, [2005] IRLR 647, 657:</p>
<p></p><ul>"31  As is apparent from the actual wording of article 3(1) of Directive 77/187, the term transfer in the expression 'date of a transfer' in that provision is to be understood 'within the meaning of article 1(1) [of that Directive]'.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>32  It is apparent from the latter provision that Directive 77/187 applies to transfers of an undertaking, business or part of a business 'to another employer'.  In the words of the second recital in the preamble to the Directive, the Directive is intended to protect employees 'in the event of a change of employer'.  In article 2 of the Directive, the terms 'transferor' and 'transferee' are defined by reference to, respectively, ceasing to be or becoming 'the employer in respect of the undertaking, business or part of the business'."<p></p></ul>
<p>This in turn leads on to the court's identification of the decisive criterion for establishing whether there is a transfer for the purposes of article 3(1).  The court says, at paras 34 - 36, [2005] IRLR 647, 657-658 (emphases added):</p>
<p></p><ul>"34&nbsp;&nbsp;To establish whether there is a transfer within the meaning of Directive 77/187, it is necessary to assess whether the unit in question retains its identity, which follows in particular from the fact that its operation is actually continued or resumed <i>by the new employer</i>, with the same or similar economic activities (see case 24/85 <i>Spijkers</i> [1986] ECR 1119, paragraphs 11, 12 and 15, and case C-48/94 <i>Rygaard</i> [1996] ECR I-2745, paragraphs 15 and 16).<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>35&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows that the decisive criterion for establishing whether there is a transfer for the purposes of article 1(1) of Directive 77/187 is whether <i>a new employer</i> continues or resumes the operation of the unit in question, retaining its identity.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>36&nbsp;&nbsp;In those circumstances, the term 'date of a transfer' in article 3(1) of Directive 77/187 must be understood as referring to the date on which responsibility <i>as employer</i> for carrying on the business of the unit in question moves from the transferor to the transferee."<p></p></ul>
<p>This conclusion is reflected in para 1 of the operative part of the judgment, [2005] IRLR 647, 658:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Article 3(1) of Council Directive 77/187/EEC of 14 February 1977 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of businesses must be interpreted as meaning that the date of a transfer within the meaning of that provision is the date on which responsibility <i>as employer</i> for carrying on the business of the unit transferred moves from the transferor to the transferee.  That date is a particular point in time which cannot be postponed to another date at the will of the transferor or transferee."<p></p></ul>
<p>Again, I have emphasised the words "as employer" which are an essential part of the court's conclusion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84.&nbsp;&nbsp;The decisive criterion identified by the Court of Justice in para 35 of its judgment has to be applied to the facts as found by the employment tribunal.  In considering the facts it must be borne in mind that the tribunal specifically found, at para 22 of the extended reasons, that there had been no attempt whatsoever for purposes of the TUPE Regulations "to engineer any particular outcome or to evade liabilities in the way the transfer has been structured.  The rationale is justified in business and political terms."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85.&nbsp;&nbsp;The tribunal considered, at para 11, that the undertaking which was transferred from the Department to the TECs was the management of the government-funded post-16 vocational training and enterprise activities in England and Wales, together with the information systems and database, some staff and some premises.  The tribunal thought that this was a recognisable and definable economic entity.  In the hearing before the House, neither side sought to challenge that description of the relevant unit or undertaking, which has, of course, to be applied to the situation in North East Wales.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86.&nbsp;&nbsp;In para 13 the tribunal went on to consider whether the respondents were assigned to the part of the undertaking which was run by Newtec.  In its view, the respondents clearly were assigned to the undertaking "at the time of the transfer commencing" - by which the tribunal meant September 1990.  The tribunal was certainly entitled to reach the view that, when Newtec began operations in September 1990 using the civil servants who had been doing the job the day before, those civil servants were included in the part of the undertaking for the management of which Newtec was then responsible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87.&nbsp;&nbsp;That does not mean, however, that, for the purposes of article 3(1) of the Directive, there had been a transfer of the relevant part of the undertaking to Newtec in September 1990.  As the Court of Justice underlined in para 32 of its judgment, the reference back in article 3(1) to article 1(1) shows that the Directive applies to transfers of an undertaking, business or part of a business "to another employer".  And in this case, even although Newtec had taken over the running of the activities of enterprise and training, there is nothing in the tribunal's findings to show that it had done so "as employer".  On the contrary, the picture which emerges is of a situation where, from September 1990, the essential work of the unit was being carried on by staff who were not employed by Newtec.  As I have noted, Newtec did indeed employ some staff, but there is nothing in the case to suggest that they were concerned with the essentials of the operation.  From all that appears in the employment tribunal's extended reasons, the essential work continued to be done by the civil servants who had the necessary experience and who remained employees of the Department, but on secondment to Newtec for three years.  Newtec no more employed them or intended to employ them than it would have employed or intended to employ the employees of some company with which it might have contracted for the supply of the same necessary expertise.  In accordance with the understanding of all concerned - the Department, Newtec and the civil servants - the civil servants did not have, and were not meant to have, a new employer.  So, even though Newtec had taken over the offices, including presumably the desks and chairs on which the civil servants sat and the equipment which they operated, in terms of article 3(1) of the Directive, they had not done so "as employer" and so there was no transfer of the undertaking to them for the purposes of the Directive in September 1990.  Which is exactly what one would expect since at that stage there was no threat to the position of the civil servants who continued to be employed by the Department and to enjoy all their rights as civil servants.  There was no event or threat arising out of a change of employer for which they needed the protection of the Directive and so no reason why it should apply to them. I would add that this analysis appears to me to be consistent with the approach of the Court of Justice in <i>Foreningen af Arbejdsledere I Danmark v A/S Danmols Inventar  </i>(Case 105/84); [1985] ECR 2639, as explained by Lord Mance in paras 108 and 109 of his speech.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, contrary to the common position adopted by counsel at the hearing, I would hold that there was no transfer for the purposes of article 3(1) in September 1990 because, to adopt the terminology in para 35 of the judgment of the Court of Justice, the operation of the unit was not being continued by "a new employer".  This in turn means that the Directive does not stand history on its head and, to a great extent at least, the case can be considered on its real facts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89.&nbsp;&nbsp;In reality, then, on the facts found by the employment tribunal, the first moment when the respondents could be said to have faced the risk of suffering the kind of disadvantage for which the Directive affords protection came in 1993.  As part of the culmination of the government's original policy, Newtec decided to put an end to the use of secondees and, from 1 July onwards, to have the work done by its own employees.  Those working at the heart of Newtec's operations could no longer do so as seconded civil servants but had to choose either to seek employment elsewhere in the Department or to become employees of Newtec.  From that date, not only was Newtec continuing to run the unit or undertaking which had formed part of the Department's undertaking before September 1990 but, as envisaged in the overall scheme for the privatisation of the delivery of the enterprise and training activities, it was now doing so "as employer".  In my view, therefore, 1 July 1993 is the date on which, in terms of the test in para 1 of the operative part of the judgment of the Court of Justice, responsibility "as employer" for carrying on the business of the unit transferred moved from the transferor (the Department) to the transferee (Newtec).  On that date there was accordingly a transfer, within the meaning of article 3(1), of the relevant part of the Department's undertaking to Newtec.  It follows that the Department's obligations under its contracts of employment with the respondents transferred to Newtec on that date.  At the risk of introducing a little artificiality, I include the Department's obligations to Mr Astley, since, even though he had contemplated moving to another part of the Department, he changed his mind and there is nothing in the facts found by the tribunal to suggest that he was not employed by the Department in the unit immediately before Newtec took over responsibility as employer on 1 July.  So the Department's employment obligations to Mr Astley passed to Newtec on that date, some two months before he purported to become its employee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90.&nbsp;&nbsp;Had there been any question of the House deciding the appeal on the basis which I have outlined, it would have been necessary to put the case out for a further hearing in order to allow counsel for both parties to make submissions on the point.  Since, however, three of your Lordships are minded in any event to dismiss the appeal on the basis of the arguments at the hearing, a fresh hearing is, strictly speaking, unnecessary.  In these circumstances, I can express the conclusion which I have reached on the basis of the reasoning which I have just set out.  I would hold that, by virtue of the operation of article 3(1) of the Directive, the respondents' employment with Newtec should be regarded as continuous with their employment with the Department.  So in each case the appropriate date of commencement of continuous employment is the date on which the respondent was first employed as a civil servant.  In my respectful view the Court of Appeal reached the right conclusion even though, not having had the benefit of the judgment of the Court of Justice, it did so for different reasons.  In agreement with the majority of your Lordships but on quite a different basis, I would accordingly dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p><b>LORD CARSWELL</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the advantage of reading in draft the opinions prepared by my noble and learned friends Lord Bingham of Cornhill and Lord Hope of Craighead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reasons which they have given I agree that the date of transfer has to be taken to be September 1990 and that the respondents' contracts of employment must be deemed to have been handed over to Newtec on the date of the transfer.  I appreciate that this may be regarded as the product of what both my noble and learned friends Lord Bingham and Lord Rodger of Earlsferry have referred to as a fiction.  It is in many ways unsatisfactory: it fails to represent the commercial reality of the arrangement and very probably is the opposite of what the respondents themselves thought to be the case at the time.  I am also conscious of the force of the arguments put forward by Lord Rodger and his concern about the obliteration of reality in relation to such matters as the respondents' pension rights.  I nevertheless am compelled by the reasons given by Lord Bingham and Lord Hope to agree that the consequence of the decision of the ECJ must be that the date of transfer is to be regarded as September 1990.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p><b>LORD MANCE</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94.&nbsp;&nbsp;This appeal concerns the respondents' claim, under Directive 77/187/EEC, that their employment with the appellant North Wales Training and Enterprise Council Ltd, trading as Celtec Ltd. ("Celtec") and its predecessor, the North East Wales Training and Enterprise Council ("Newtec") in training and enterprise activities in the 1990s is to be regarded as continuous with their prior employment in the same activities as civil servants with the Department of Employment. Celtec and Newtec can for present purposes be treated as one. For simplicity I shall use "Celtec" to embrace both. The problem which the claim has to meet is that the Department transferred responsibility for such activities ("the undertaking") to Celtec in September 1990, whereas the respondents remained, on the face of it, civil servants employed by the Department and on secondment to Celtec until summer 1993 when they elected to forego civil servant status and to become employees of Celtec. So, the appellant asserts, there was no change of employer "by reason of" the transfer of the undertaking within the language of articles 2 and 3 of the Directive, and any change occurred separately and voluntarily some years later. Other (indeed a majority) of the civil servants ostensibly seconded by the Department to Newtec from September 1990 never elected to become employees of Newtec, but retired or resigned or returned to other posts in the Department from 1992 onwards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95.&nbsp;&nbsp;The respondents' claim succeeded in the employment tribunal, failed before the Employment Appeal Tribunal, but succeeded in the Court of Appeal. Their claim was pursued through all these instances, brought to this House and referred to the European Court of Justice on the mutual assumption that its outcome depended upon whether the date of the transfer of an undertaking within the meaning of articles 1(1) and 3(1) of the Directive is a single point in time or can take place "progressively or in distinct stages". Celtec have always contended for the former analysis and the respondents for the latter. The respondents have accepted, at every instance and in their written observations to the European Court, that they "were seconded [by the Department of the Environment to Celtec] rather than directly employed in the period September 1990 to 1993". The European Court having held on 26 May 2005 in favour of the appellant that transfer of an undertaking takes place at "a particular point in time", the respondents now submit that they should have leave to advance a new argument. This is that they were neither seconded by the Department of Environment nor therefore civil servants in the period September 1990 to 1993, but were on the contrary employed by Celtec from September 1990 onwards.</p>
