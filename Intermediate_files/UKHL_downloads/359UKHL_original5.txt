<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;128.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal rejected both those arguments: [2003] 4 All ER 384.  It held that "[i]t was open to the President to find on the facts that the nature reserve for which [the] land was needed was an integral part of the barrage project" (p 415, para 117), and it rationalised the Indian case as a two-scheme rather than single-scheme case, thereby defeating the appellants' reliance upon it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;129.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the appellants' contention before your Lordships that the Court of Appeal was wrong on both points.  Success on either, of course, would bring them victory.  If the scheme underlying this development were to be determined as narrowly as the appellants contend for, the second question, as to the extent of the disregard, would simply not arise.  Unless the scheme encompassed the barrage and thus the nature reserve's central role as compensation for the environmental losses entailed, on no view would the increased value of the land attaching to that compensatory role fall to be disregarded:  such increase would self-evidently not be "due to the scheme".  Similarly, of course, if, however the scheme is defined, WDA are required to pay whatever it would willingly have paid in friendly negotiations, then too the appellants will recover whatever key value the subject land may have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;130.&nbsp;&nbsp;These, then, were the issues debated at length before the House and upon which your Lordships' decision was invited.  Are they, however, the real questions which your Lordships should be determining or do they arise only upon a fundamentally false legal premise, namely that compensation for compulsory purchase is indeed properly to be determined by reference to the <i>Point Gourde</i> rule rather than simply by applying  the governing provisions of the 1961 Act?</p>
<i><p><i>Has the Pointe Gourde rule survived the 1961 Act?</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;131.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the advantage of reading in draft the speech to be given by my noble and learned friend, Lord Scott of Foscote, and this, I readily acknowledge, makes a telling case for regarding the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> rule, certainly as it has developed, as no more than a misconceived accretion to the legislative scheme which itself, therefore, ought henceforth to be disregarded.  But is it not, I wonder, too late in the evolution of this branch of the law to attempt a return to basics of this sort?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;132.&nbsp;&nbsp;Put aside the long series of post-1961 Act Court of Appeal authorities, all decided by reference to the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> rule and all treating it as not merely supplementing but in large part  supplanting the complexities of the legislation (itself regularly excoriated for its many obscurities)—see, for example, <i>Camrose v Basingstoke Corporation</i> [1966]  1 WLR 1100, <i>Wilson v Liverpool City Council</i> [1971]  1 WLR 302, <i>Myers v Milton Keynes Development Corporation</i> [1971]  1 WLR 696, <i>Birmingham City Council v Morris and Jacombs Ltd</i> (1976)  33 P &amp; CR 27, <i>Bird v Wakefield Metropolitan District Council</i> (1979)  37 P &amp; CR 478, <i>Batchelor v Kent County Council</i> (1989)  59 P &amp; CR 357, <i>Wards Construction (Medway) Ltd v Barclays Bank Plc</i> (1994)  68 P &amp; CR 391, <i>J A Pye (Oxford) Ltd v Kingswood Borough Council</i> [1998]  2 EGLR 159, and <i>Bolton Metropolitan Borough Council v Tudor Properties Ltd</i> (2000)  80 P &amp; CR 537. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;133.&nbsp;&nbsp;Put aside too the many references to the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> rule in the opinions given by your Lordships' House and the Privy Council, not, it is true, in cases necessarily dependent for their outcome upon the rule's continuing soundness and application but where invariably that assumption is made—see, for example, <i>Davy v Leeds </i>Corporation [1965]  1 WLR 445, <i>Rugby Joint Water Board v Foottit</i> [1973]  AC 202, <i>Melwood Units Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Main Roads</i> [1979]  AC 426, <i>Director of Buildings and Lands v Shun Fung</i> [1995]  2 AC 111 and <i>Fletcher Estates (Harlescott) Ltd v Secretary of State for the Environment </i> [2000]  2 AC 307.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;134.&nbsp;&nbsp;Put aside further the Law Commission's Report No 286 and the entire consultation process underlying it, all of which proceeded on the footing that the existing law is not simply that to be found in the legislation but also, unsatisfactory though this too may be, in the case law surrounding the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> rule.  As para D.68 of the Report explains:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Although the new statutory rules were seen as giving effect to the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> principle, it was not clear whether they were intended to be a self-contained code, or merely to supplement the existing judicial version of the rule.  Further, the convoluted wording of the section, made it very difficult to interpret or apply.  The solution eventually adopted by the Courts was to treat section 6 and the judicial rule as existing side-by-side as part of a single legal principle, so that in practice little distinction was made between the two, and literal interpretation of the statute was largely abandoned."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;135.&nbsp;&nbsp;What to my mind makes it particularly inappropriate at this late stage simply to ignore all the cases over the last 45 years save those few which have sought to construe and apply the governing legislation is what I take to be Parliament's own recognition, which itself dates back to 1980, that compensation may not fall to be assessed exclusively by reference to the statutory code but may also have to be determined, as to disregards, by "rule of law."   Paragraph 11 of Schedule 1 to the 1961 Act, added by section 145 (2) of the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980, provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"11.   Paragraph 10 of this Schedule [which makes special provision for urban development areas] shall have effect in relation to any increase or diminution in value to be left out of account by virtue of any rule of law relating to the assessment of compensation in respect of compulsory acquisition as it has effect in relation to any increase or diminution in value to be left out of account by virtue of section 6 of this Act."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;136.&nbsp;&nbsp;As Lord Scott notes in paragraph 107 of his speech, Lord Denning MR in <i>Wilson v Liverpool Corporation</i> [1971]  1 WLR 302, 309, contemplated that counsel might wish to challenge in the House of Lords his earlier decision in <i>Camrose v Basingstoke Corporation</i> [1966]  1  WLR 1100—to the effect that other disregards remain permissible beyond those to be found in the legislation.  To attempt this over 30 years later, however, and despite the further entrenchment of the rule in our jurisprudence, is quite another thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;137.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor, moreover, tempting though in one sense it might be to return to the unadorned language of the statute, should your Lordships regard with any particular enthusiasm the prospect of subjecting the next generation of litigants to the very real problems which that language has itself created, admirably summarised by Carnwath LJ in paras.70-80 of his judgment below. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;138.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, therefore, it is better that your Lordships should now seek to apply, and where necessary modify, the case law as it has evolved over recent years than discard it in its entirety.  In this way, moreover, English law will remain in harmony with that of other jurisdictions substantially modelled upon it.  Take, for example, section 56 of the Land Acquisition (Just Terms Compensation) Act 1991, operating in New South Wales:</p>
<p></p><ul>"'Market Value' of land … means the amount that would have been paid for the land if it had been sold … by a willing but not anxious seller to a willing but not anxious buyer, disregarding … <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;any increase or decrease in the value of the land caused by the carrying out of, or the proposal to carry out, the public purpose for which the land was acquired."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As was observed by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in <i>Roads and Traffic Authority (NSW) v Perry</i> (2001)  116 LGERA 244, 246: </p>
<p></p><ul>"The first part of this definition embodies the basic principle stated in … [the Indian case].  Paragraph (a) of the definition embodies the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> principle."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indian case is sufficiently described in paras 94-96 of Lord Scott's speech. What, of course, it established was that even where land has a particular value only for one potential purchaser, that purchaser will nonetheless be willing to pay for it.  The case, in short, resolved the differing views on this question which were expressed in the cases prior to the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act 1919 (the 1919 Act), most notably in <i>In re Lucas and</i> <i>Chesterfield Gas and Water Board</i> [1909] 1KB 16.  More particularly it may be taken to have determined the proper approach to what were first enacted as rules 1 and 2 of section 2 of the 1919 Act, now substantially reproduced in section 5 of the 1961 Act:</p>
<p></p><ul>"(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;No allowance shall be made on account of the acquisition being compulsory;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;The value of land shall, subject as hereinafter provided, be taken to be the amount which the land if sold in the open market by a willing seller might be expected to realise;"<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;139.&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott LJ, the chairman of the Committee whose report in 1918 had led to the 1919 Act, was later to say in <i>Horn v Sunderland Corporation</i> [1941]  2 KB 26, 40, that rule 1 had abolished "the 10% addition for compulsory purchase" and that rule 2 had reversed "the old sympathetic hypothesis of the unwilling seller and the willing buyer which underlay judicial interpretation of the Act of 1845".  Section 24 of the local legislation under consideration in the Indian case precluded the Court from taking into consideration:</p>
<p></p><ul>"First, the degree of urgency which has led to the acquisition;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Secondly, any disinclination of the person interested to part with the land acquired;"<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those provisions to my mind mirror our own rules 1 and 2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;140.&nbsp;&nbsp;True it is that in the Indian case, [1939] AC 302, 312, Lord Romer said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The disinclination of the vendor to part with his land and the urgent necessity of the purchaser to buy must alike be disregarded.  Neither must be considered as acting under compulsion."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It by no means follows, however, that the open market value to the seller will exclude whatever key value the land may have.  On the contrary, any such value properly falls to be taken into account, just as it was in <i>Stokes v Cambridge Corporation</i> (1961)  13 P &amp; CR 77, where the Lands Tribunal, determining the value of land compulsorily acquired by the Corporation, recognised that the landowner would himself have had to pay the key value of other land in order to realise the development potential of his own, and reduced the valuation of the order land  accordingly.  The recognition of the land's key value to a particular purchaser is merely an extreme manifestation of the approach taken in the Indian case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;141.&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the <i>Point Gourde</i> principle itself, said to be embodied in section 56 (1) (a) of the New South Wales statute, it hardly needs to be pointed out that a disregard in these terms is different, not merely from the various statutory disregards provided for under section 6 of the 1961 Act (none of which, of course, can ever apply to the order land itself) but also, and no less strikingly, from that to be found in rule 3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;142.&nbsp;&nbsp;I share entirely Lord Scott's view, expressed in paragraph 93 of his speech, that the unquarried stone in <i>Pointe Gourde</i> was a part of the land whose commercial potential, therefore, represented an element in the value of the land, and accordingly that any special need for the stone for the building of the naval base could and should properly have been disregarded under rule 3, rather than under some common law principle which, on a strict view, might well be thought not to have survived the 1919 Act.  But, as I have already observed, many years have  since passed and not merely has the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> principle apparently survived but rule 3 itself has been increasingly marginalised and the common law principle expanded to fill its place.  Paragraphs D.93 and D.94 of the Law Commission's report are instructive in this regard:</p>
<p></p><ul>"D.93&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already referred to the narrow interpretation of rule (3), adopted in <i>Pointe Gourde</i>, as the same time as the judicial rule was expanded to fill its place.  Subsequent cases have followed that lead, and the rule has been further cut down by statute [this is a reference to the repeal in 1991 of the original disregard, which had extended also to the 'the special needs of a particular purchaser'.]<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>D.94&nbsp;&nbsp;In practice, it appears to have little remaining purpose.  This sequence of decisions has established:<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;That the 'adaptability' must be a quality of the subject land itself, not a quality of its product (<i>Pointe Gourde</i>), or of the nature of the interest (<i>Lambe v Secretary of State for War</i> [1955]  2 QB 612);<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;That 'special' implies something 'exceptional in character, quality or degree', rather than qualities shared with other possible sites (<i>Batchelor v Kent County Council</i> (1989)  59 P &amp; CR 357, 362);<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;That the purchase requiring use of statutory powers must relate to the subject land, not to other land (<i>Ozanne v Herts County Council </i> [1991]  1 WLR  105, 110)<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;That the need for general forms of consent, such as planning permission or stopping-up orders, is not sufficient to bring the rule into play (<i>Ozanne</i> again);<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;That the 'market' may include a mere speculator, with no direct interest in the use of the land (<i>Blandrent Investment Developments Ltd v British Gas Corporation</i> (1979)  2 EGLR 18, 22) ."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;143.&nbsp;&nbsp;Again in common with Lord Scott (see his paragraph 112), I believe that rule 3 has hitherto been too narrowly construed, in particular by the Court of Appeal in <i>Batchelor v Kent County Council</i> 59 P &amp; CR 357.  But again, rather than attempt to put back the clock and reinstate rule 3 at the expense of the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> rule, I am inclined to treat the latter as the prevailing law.  For my part, therefore, I propose to address the arguments advanced on the appeal on the footing that the principle embodied in the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> line of decisions remains a rule of law.  But it must also be recognised that on this approach any key value that land may have is to be included within its open market value and is to be disregarded, if at all, solely by reference to the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> rule.</p>
<i><p><i>Argument 1: what was the relevant scheme or project?</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;144.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first of the appellants' arguments is, as stated, that the Court of Appeal erred in concluding that the nature reserve was an integral part of the barrage project.  The concept of determining the ambit of the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> rule by reference to whether or not the order land "forms an integral part" of the scheme postulated to have increased its value first appears in Lord Russell's opinion in <i>Melwood Units Pty Ltd v Main Roads Commissioner</i> [1979]  AC 426, 434 and was later crystallised in Lord Nicholls' succinct statement of the rule in <i>Director of Buildings and Land v Shun Fung Ironworks Ltd</i> [1995]  2 AC 111, 136: </p>
<p></p><ul>"A landowner cannot claim compensation to the extent that the value of his land is increased by the very scheme of which the [compulsory acquisition] forms an integral part."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;145.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appellants submit that the compulsory acquisition of their land was not an integral part of the barrage project.  That statutory project, they point out, itself contained no proposals whatever for mitigating its damaging environmental effects, and plainly did not envisage the acquisition of their particular land.  Nor did those promoting and executing the barrage project, in particular CBDC, themselves ever obtain powers of compulsory acquisition over the appellants' land; rather the land was acquired by LAW which itself had no statutory function with regard to the barrage project.  All these factors, submit the appellants, in particular taken together, were inconsistent with a conclusion that the creation of the nature reserve was an integral part of the barrage project.  Of course the need for the nature reserve arose out of the barrage project, but that is not to say that it was integral to it; rather it was a distinct project and to be regarded as such for the purposes of compensation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;146.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Holgate QC for the appellants invited us to examine this argument in the light of the Law Commission's report, the most directly relevant part of which, under the heading "The Statutory Project rule—Preferred version of the rule," reads:</p>
<p></p><ul>"7.16&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Consultation Paper, we noted the variety of formulations of the rule in cases over the last 100 years, and the different terms used (including 'scheme', 'project', 'undertaking', 'purpose').  Although generally presented as different formulations of the same rule, they seemed to us to embody at least three conflicting views of its scope:<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;The narrow version:  the purpose of the acquisition is not ignored; the valuer simply disregards the fact that the acquisition is compulsory, but he takes account of what the authority would have paid in 'friendly negotiations' to acquire the land for the same purpose. [This versions is said in a footnote to be exemplified by the Indian case].<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;The wide version:  the valuer disregards, not only the purpose of the particular acquisition, but also the 'underlying scheme', which may extend to the planning history over a much wider area, and dating back many years. [This version is said in a footnote to be taken from <i>Pointe Gourde</i> as interpreted in later cases starting with <i>Wilson v Liverpool City Council</i> [1971]  1WLR 302].<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle version: the valuer disregards altogether the immediate project for which the acquisition is made (not merely the element of compulsion), but not the underlying planning history.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>7.17&nbsp;&nbsp;We preferred the last.  We summarised our thinking in the Overview:<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>We propose to discard the word 'scheme', as it is too imprecise and it carries too much historical baggage.  We take as our starting-point a more precise definition of the 'relevant project', which is supported by existing authority.  The definition is intended to provide an analogy with the kind of project, which might in the past have been the subject of a special Act.  It is intended to direct attention to the particular project, for which the acquisition of the subject land is authorised, and of which the works or uses on the subject land will be an integral part.  Such a definition would be a marked improvement over the present mixture of statutory and judicial versions.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>7.18&nbsp;&nbsp;There was general agreement with this approach, which we have accordingly taken as the starting-point for our recommendations.<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;147.&nbsp;&nbsp;Those recommendations are to be found in rule 13 of the Law Commission's proposed New Code as follows:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Rule 13 The statutory project and blight<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>A new Code<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;All previous rules, statutory or judge-made, relating to disregard of 'the scheme' will cease to have effect.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Defining the project<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Code, 'the statutory project' means the project, for a purpose to be carried out in the exercise of a statutory function, for which the authority has been authorised to acquire the subject land.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;In cases of dispute, the area of the statutory project shall be determined by the Tribunal as a question of fact, subject to the following:<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The statutory project shall be taken to be the implementation of the authorised purpose within the area of the compulsory purchase order, save to the extent that it is shown (by either party) that it is part of a larger project;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Save by agreement or in special circumstances, the Tribunal shall not permit the authority to advance evidence of a larger project, other than one defined in the compulsory purchase order or the documents published with it.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Disregarding the project<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;In valuing the subject land at the valuation date:<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;it shall be assumed that the statutory project has been cancelled on that date; and<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;the following matters shall be disregarded:<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;the effects of any action previously taken (including acquisition of any land, and any development or works) by a public authority, wholly or mainly for the purpose of the statutory project;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;the prospect of the same, or any other project to meet the same or substantially the same need, being carried out in the exercise of a statutory function, or by the exercise of compulsory powers.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-rule (4) does not require or authorise (save to the extent specified in (b)) consideration of whether events or circumstances at any time (before or after the valuation date) would have been different in the absence of the statutory project."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[It has been convenient to include at this stage of the judgment sub-rules (4) and (5) although their relevance is rather to the second of the appellant's arguments on the appeal.]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;148.&nbsp;&nbsp;Insofar as "the wide version" of the rule described in para 7.16 (2) of the report involves the disregard of "the planning history over a much wider area [than the order land] and dating back many years", I too would deprecate it.  If, indeed, that is thought to be the approach required following <i>Pointe Gourde's</i> reference to the "underlying scheme" as subsequently interpreted, then in my opinion the rule has been developed impermissibly far and should now be narrowed down.  Clearly, for example, it cannot be right that the valuer must let his imagination "take flight to the clouds" as Lord Denning MR suggested in <i>Myers v Milton Keynes District Council </i>[1974]  1 WLR 696, 704—see para 78 of Carnwath LJ's judgment below.  As, however, Carnwath LJ also observed (in para 89), although the words in <i>Pointe Gourde</i>—"the scheme <i>underlying</i> the acquisition"—were new, it is clear from their context that they were not intended to differ from the words used by Lord Buckmaster in <i>Fraser v City of Fraserville </i>[1917]  AC 187, 194, "the scheme for which the property is compulsorily acquired".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;149.&nbsp;&nbsp;It will readily be seen from the proposed new rule 13 (3) that where the meaning of "the statutory project" is disputed, its area would in any event fall to be determined by the Lands Tribunal as a question of fact and it would be open to the acquiring authority (or, of course, the landowner, in a case involving depreciation due to blight) to establish that the order land is part of a larger project, provided, ordinarily, this had been defined in the compulsory purchase order or the documents published with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;150.&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed new rule 13 seems to me to point the way forward quite admirably and indeed to represent a sensible approach to the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> principle as it presently stands.  To my mind, however, it is clear that, even assuming the principle were to be applied in that way—or, indeed, that such a rule were already in force—the appellants' argument would fail: the statutory project here would inevitably be found as a question of fact to be the creation of the nature reserve as part of the larger project of the barrage development, that larger project being time and again referred to in the statement of reasons for the compulsory purchase order which included, under the heading History of the Scheme, the following paragraphs:</p>
<p></p><ul>"3.11&nbsp;&nbsp;On 17 January 1996 the planning application was submitted and the Secretary of State for Wales, William Hague, announced to Parliament that 'Plans to provide a bird reserve on the Gwent Levels between Uskmouth and Goldcliff to compensate for the loss of the Cardiff Bay habitat will proceed immediately.'<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>3.12&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hague went on to say 'I have invited [CBDC] to work with the [LAW] and [CCW] to take the project forward."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;151.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although describing the appellants' argument under this head as their "strongest point", Carnwath LJ rejected it for reasons appearing in paras 101-117 of his judgment.  I agree with them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;152.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since drafting this opinion I have had the advantage of reading the speech to be given by my noble and learned friend Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead.  At paragraph 58 he turns to consider "how the extent of a scheme should be identified in today's conditions", a most important issue which he then addresses in paragraphs 58-63 inclusive.  I respectfully agree with everything there said, all of which I believe to be entirely consistent with my own thoughts on the matter.</p>
<i><p><i>Argument 2: what properly must be disregarded?</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;153.&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn to the appellants' second argument by which they contend that, even assuming the statutory project ("the scheme for which the property [was] compulsorily acquired", to use Lord Buckmaster's formulation in <i>Fraser</i>) to be the barrage project, the key value of their land—its particular worth as a means of unlocking the value of the Cardiff Bay development which the European Commission might otherwise have thwarted—nevertheless falls to be regarded, not disregarded.  Summarised in the appellant's printed case the argument is put thus:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Once the scheme has been identified, whether a single or composite undertaking, the effect of the scheme disregard rule is only to ignore the acquisition of land and the actual carrying out of the works.  The law does not require the motivation of the promoter to obtain land in order to carry out the scheme to be left out of account and there is therefore no basis for distinguishing between single and linked schemes."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;154.&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-formulated in writing during the hearing the argument runs:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The judicial 'no scheme' rule recognises that one potential head of claim not found in the open market is the effect on land's value of a power of compulsory acquisition.  It requires the effect of this power to be disregarded in order to prevent the landowner from recovering more than he could get in the open market, in which such powers are not available.  For example, this disregard may require the valuer to make a deduction reflecting the extra speed that compulsory powers can bring to a development project: the acceleration of value due to the use of compulsory powers is to be disallowed.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>The cases on the 'no scheme' rule also show that the land must be valued for its unrealised potentiality as distinct from its realised potentiality . . . this aspect of the judicial 'no scheme' rule . . . deal[s] with the special facts of compulsory acquisition, recognising that compulsory powers are typically invoked in order to assemble land from more than one source.  So the valuer must not value land on the assumption that development elsewhere has actually occurred, only that it might occur.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul> … The principle is that acquiring authorities should not pay a price <i>inflated above open market value.</i>  But open market value includes the price that the acquiring authority would be willing to pay in friendly negotiations with the landowner, including having regard to the effect on its bid of the acquiring authority's motives, no less than the effect on their bids of the motives of everyone else in the market.  For the judicial 'no scheme' rule to place the acquiring authority in a privileged position in this respect would contravene the principle of equivalence.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul> … Potentiality is not excluded by the judicial rule.  However, rule 3 goes one stage further by excluding potentiality as well as realisation in the limited circumstances described in that rule.  Accordingly, the two rules are in harmony."<p></p></ul>
