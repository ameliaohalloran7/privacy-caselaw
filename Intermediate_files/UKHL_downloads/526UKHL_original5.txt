<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105. I emphasise the words "every case", because I believe that it would only be if there was a material risk of incompatibility with the article 6 Convention right in <i>all</i> such cases that it would be appropriate to lay down a rule of <i>general</i> application as to how, applying section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998, section 41(3) ought to be read in a way that is compatible with the Convention right or, if that were not possible, to make a declaration of general incompatibility.  I do not accept that there is such a risk.  This is because I do not regard the <i>mere</i> fact that the complainant had consensual sexual intercourse with the accused on previous occasions as relevant to the issue whether she consented to intercourse on the occasion of the alleged rape.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106. For these reasons I consider that it has not been shown that, if the ordinary principles of statutory construction are applied to them, the provisions of section 41 which are relevant to the respondent's case are  incompatible with his Convention right to a fair trial.  I would hold that the question whether they are incompatible cannot be finally determined at this stage, as no attempt has been made to investigate the facts to the required level of detail to show that section 41 has made excessive inroads into the Convention right.  It seems to me that it is neither necessary nor appropriate at this stage to resort to the interpretative obligation which is described in section 3 of the Human Rights Act in order to modify, alter or supplement the words used by Parliament.  I think that it would only be appropriate to resort to surgery of that kind in this case if the words used by Parliament were unable, when they were given their ordinary meaning, to stand up to the test of compatibility.   But that cannot, in my view be said of the allegations which the respondent makes as to the complainant's sexual behaviour with him prior to the incident of the alleged rape.  All he appears to be relying upon at present is the mere fact that on various occasions during the previous three weeks she had had consensual sexual intercourse with him in his flat.  As I have said, I consider that this fact alone - and nothing else is alleged about it - is irrelevant to his defence of consent.  So I would hold that the exclusion of evidence and questions which relate to it in regard to that defence (but not that of honest belief ) is not incompatible with his right to a fair trial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107. This does not mean that the question whether or not the respondent will have a fair trial is at an end.  I agree with Mr Perry for the Crown that it will only be in rare and isolated cases, that the question of fairness will be capable of being determined before the trial.  It was clearly right that this case should have been brought before your Lordships on appeal in view of the important issues of principle that were raised and the risk of exposing vulnerable witnesses to the risk of having to give evidence at a new trial.  But now that these issues have been resolved the case must go back to the Crown Court for trial.  The question whether the respondent did in the event have a fair trial will be open for consideration after the trial is over if he is convicted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108. I should like to add however that I would find it very difficult to accept that it was permissible under section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998 to read in to section 41(3)(c) a provision to the effect that evidence or questioning which was required to ensure a fair trial under article 6 of the Convention should not be treated as inadmissible.  The rule of construction which section 3 lays down is quite unlike any previous rule of statutory interpretation.  There is no need to identify an ambiguity or absurdity.  Compatibility with Convention rights is the sole guiding principle.  That is the paramount object which the rule seeks to achieve.  But the rule is only a rule of interpretation.  It does not entitle the judges to act as legislators.  As Lord Woolf CJ said in <i>Poplar Housing and Regeneration Community Association Ltd v Donogue</i> [2001] EWCA Civ 595, section 3 does not entitle the court to legislate; its task is still one of interpretation.  The compatibility is to be achieved only so far as this is possible.  Plainly this will not be possible if the legislation contains provisions which expressly contradict the meaning which the enactment would have to be given to make it compatible.  It seems to me that the same result must follow if they do so by necessary implication, as this too is a means of identifying the plain intention of Parliament: see Lord Hoffmann's observations in <i>R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p Simms</i> [2000]  2 AC 115, 131F-G.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109. In the present case it seems to me that the entire structure of section 41 contradicts the idea that it is possible to read into it a new provision which would entitle the court to give leave whenever it was of the opinion that this was required to ensure a fair trial.  The whole point of the section, as was made clear during the debates in Parliament, was to address the mischief which was thought to have arisen due to the width of the discretion which had previously been given to the trial judge.  A deliberate decision was taken not to follow the examples which were to be found elsewhere, such as in section 275 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995, of provisions which give an overriding discretion to the trial judge to allow the evidence or questioning where it would be contrary to the interests of justice to exclude it.  Section 41(2) <i>forbids</i> the exercise of such a discretion <i>unless</i> the court is satisfied as to the matters which that subsection identifies.  It seems to me that it would not be possible, without contradicting the plain intention of Parliament, to read in a provision which would enable the court to exercise a wider discretion than that permitted by section 41(2).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110. I would not have the same difficulty with a solution which read down the provisions of subsections (3) or (5), as the case may be, in order to render them compatible with the Convention right.  But if that were to be done it would be necessary to identify precisely (a) the words used by the legislature which would otherwise be incompatible with the Convention right and (b) how these words were to be construed, according to the rule which section 3 lays down, to make them compatible.  That, it seems to me, is what the rule of construction requires.  The court's task is to read and give effect to the legislation which it is asked to construe.  The allegations about the complainant's previous sexual behaviour with the respondent are so exiguous that I do not think that it would be possible for your Lordships in this case with any degree of confidence to embark upon that exercise.  I would leave that exercise to be undertaken by the trial judge in the light of such further information about the nature and circumstances of his relationship with the complainant that the respondent can make available if and when he renews his application.  If he finds it necessary to apply the interpretative obligation under section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998 to the words used in section 41(3)(c) of the 1999 Act, he should do so by construing those words, so far as it is possible to do so, by applying the test indicated in paragraph 46 of the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Steyn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111. The Court of Appeal reversed the decision of the trial judge on the question whether evidence and questions about the complainant's sexual behaviour with third parties would be admissible.  I agree with that part of their decision.  They also reversed the trial judge on the question whether evidence and questions about the complainant's sexual behaviour with the defendant would be admissible in relation to the defence of honest belief.  With that part of their decision I also agree.  But I am not satisfied that the respondent and his legal advisers have yet applied their minds sufficiently to the detailed requirements which must be met if his application for leave is to fall within the first alternative of the qualifying condition laid down in section 41(3)(c) in relation to the defence of consent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112. By its order of 15 January 2001 the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and reversed the ruling of the trial judge.  In the formal petition to the House the appellant asks that that order should be reversed, but in the event at the hearing of the appeal your Lordships were not invited to set aside the order by either party.  For those reasons I would dismiss the appeal.  But I would hold that the respondent should be given an opportunity, in the light of the decision of this House, to renew his application to the trial judge for leave to be given under section 41(3)(c).</p>
<p><b>LORD CLYDE </b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113. This appeal raises important and difficult questions about the meaning and effect of section 41 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999.  That section is one of three sections comprising Chapter III of Part II of the Act under the title "Protection of Complainants in Proceedings for Sexual Offences."  Section 41 deals with certain limitations on the leading of evidence and the asking of questions in cross-examination at the trial of a person charged with a "sexual offence", a phrase which is defined in section 62 and includes a charge of rape.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114. The protection of complainants, particularly in rape cases, has for a considerable time been a matter of very real concern.  In 1976 some attempt was made to relieve the situation by the passing of the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976. Section 2 of that Act provided that where any person charged with rape pled not guilty</p>
<p></p><ul>"then, except with the leave of the judge, no evidence and no question in cross-examination shall be adduced or asked at the trial, by or on behalf of any defendant at the trial, about any sexual experience of a complainant with a person other than that defendant."<p></p></ul>
<p>In terms of section 2(2) the judge was only to grant leave if he was satisfied "that it would be unfair to that defendant to refuse to allow the evidence to be adduced or the question to be asked".  It is to be noted that this provision dealt only with cases of rape and did not relate to sexual experience of a complainant with the defendant.  It left the leading of the evidence and the questioning as matter for the discretion of the trial judge.  That might on the face of it appear to provide a flexible and reasonable solution to a problem which can in so many cases turn upon the particular circumstances of the case.  But the very flexibility came to be seen as too uncertain a safeguard for the protection of the complainant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115. So another attempt has been made to resolve this difficult and delicate problem. Section 2 of the 1976 Act has been repealed and section 41 of the 1999 Act has taken its place.  The present appeal is concerned with construction of this new provision.  I do not take up space in repeating the full terms of the section here but the form which has been adopted deserves comment.  Subsection (1) of section 41 to an extent echoes the approach adopted in section 2(1) of the 1976 Act.  But apart from other less important differences, the new subsection is not confined to cases of rape but extends to a "sexual offence", a term which is explained in section 42(1)(d), and instead of being limited as section 2(1) was to "any sexual experience of a complainant with a person other than that defendant", the new section refers generally to "any sexual behaviour of the complainant".  When one comes to the cases where leave to lead evidence or ask questions about the complainant's sexual behaviour, instead of simply relying on the discretion of the trial judge, as was the approach taken in the 1976 Act, the new section seeks to specify with some particularity the matters in relation to which the judge may or may not grant leave. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116. Both in legislation and in academic writings various forms of provision have been conceived to provide the desired restraint on the giving of evidence or the asking of questions about the complainant's sexual history.  The forms vary from discretionary provisions to inflexible rules.  Diverse opinions have been expressed about the merits of one form as against others.  For example Temkin ("Evidence in Sexual Assault Cases: The Scottish Proposal and Alternatives" (1984) 47 MLR 625, 635) expressed the view that experience in jurisdictions outside Scotland "mostly suggests that the discretionary method is ineffective in controlling the use of sexual history evidence". McColgan ("Common Law and the Relevance of Sexual History Evidence" (1996) 16 Oxford Journal of Legal Studies 275, 307) expressed the view that a discretionary approach was wholly inadequate and considered that it was necessary to regulate the admission of sexual history evidence by means of tightly drawn legislation.  On the other hand attempts to legislate with a blanket exclusion and strictly defined exceptions have been criticised.  The constraints of what has been described as a "pigeon-hole approach" may not prove satisfactory. Sopinka J observed in <i>R v Morin</i> [1988]  2 SCR 345, 370-371, that</p>
<p></p><ul>"Attempts in the past to define the criteria for the admission of similar facts have not met with much success….The test must be sufficiently flexible to accommodate the varying circumstances in which it must be applied."<p></p></ul>
<p>In the Home Office Report "Speaking Up For Justice" (1998) (para 9.72) under recommendation 63 the working group favoured the Scottish approach subject to consultation on the precise formulation.  Various formulations have been described and discussed by Kibble in a valuable paper ("The Admissibility of Prior Sexual History with the Defendant in Sexual Offence Cases").  But while it is interesting to explore these alternatives the problem raised in the present case is not how the legislation should be drafted, but how section 41 is to be construed.  It is desirable next to set out the facts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117. The respondent, A, has been charged with rape.  The offence is said to have been committed in the early hours of 14 June 2000.  His defence is that sexual intercourse took place with the consent of the complainant.  It appears that the complainant had formed an intimate relationship with a friend of the respondent, Y, who was sharing a flat with him, and that at about 9.00 pm on 13 June 2000 the complainant and Y had had sexual intercourse at the flat in the absence of the respondent.  At a preparatory hearing counsel for the respondent explained to the court that the defence contention was that there had been a sexual history between the respondent and the complainant for some three weeks prior to the date of the alleged rape and that he had had consensual sexual intercourse with her on occasions during that period.  Counsel applied to cross-examine the complainant and to lead evidence about the alleged history.  The judge ruled that the act of consensual intercourse with Y could be put to the complainant in cross-examination, but that the complainant could not be cross-examined nor could evidence be led about her alleged sexual relationship with the respondent, nor could a prepared statement by the respondent which outlined his alleged relationship with her be put in evidence.  The judge also held that his ruling was prima facie<i> </i>in breach of article 6 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118. The respondent sought to challenge the judge's ruling by way of appeal to the Court of Appeal.  There the focus of the attack was on section 41(3)(b). The Court of Appeal [2001] EWCA Crim 4 took the view that it was impossible to construe that provision as applying to events even days before the alleged rape.  They considered that a fair trial might not be possible if there could not be adduced in support of the defence of consent evidence about previous sexual activity on the part of the complainant with the defendant.  But they allowed the appeal on the ground that the judge should not have excluded questioning and evidence about such activity altogether since, as was conceded before the court, that was permissible in relation to the issues of an honest belief of consent.  So also the statement by the defendant should have been admissible for that same purpose.  They also held the judge to have been wrong in admitting questions about the alleged sexual intercourse with Y on the night before the alleged rape.  That point was conceded by the respondent. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119. The question which has been certified by the Court of Appeal is:</p>
<p></p><ul>"May a sexual relationship between a defendant and a complainant be relevant to the issue of consent so as to render its exclusion under section 41 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 a contravention of the defendant's right to a fair trial?"<p></p></ul>
<p>Some preliminary observations fall to be made in relation to the question.  First, the admissibility of evidence is in itself a matter to be determined by the national law and not by article 6.  Article 6 guarantees the right to a fair trial and does not lay down rules as to the admissibility of evidence (<i>Schenk v Switzerland</i> (1988)  13 EHRR 242, 265-266, para 46).  The question under the article is whether the proceedings as a whole were fair (<i>Khan v United Kingdom, </i>The Times, 23 May 2000, para 34).  On the other hand the exclusion of evidence which is relevant to the defence may well render the trial unfair. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120. Secondly, the House is being asked to determine a matter of compliance with the Convention in advance of the trial.  Of course there are strong practical reasons for the taking of such a course and it has been adopted on other occasions.  <i>Brown v Stott </i>[2001]  2 WLR 817 is but one example.  But the course has this consequence that the issue can only be answered on a very preliminary basis at this stage.  The alleged previous sexual history of the complainant is claimed to be relevant to the matter of consent.  The critical question which arises as matters presently stand is whether that evidence is excluded by section 41.  If it is relevant to the defence and necessarily made inadmissible by the statute, then it would be difficult to resist the conclusion that the statute was incompatible with article 6 of the Convention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121. Thirdly, while in construing the section one may well first adopt the ordinary approach of looking to the meaning of the words and the purpose of the provision, where one is faced with a challenge to the compatibility of the provision with the Convention resort may well require to be had to the rule of interpretation embodied in section 3(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998, namely that "so far as it is possible to do so, primary legislation and subordinate legislation must be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights". If that cannot be done a declaration of incompatibility may require to be made in terms of section 4.  It is for Parliament to devise a provision which strikes a proper balance between the interests of the complainant and the interests of the defendant.  The question is whether a proper balance has been struck by section 41.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122. The recent development of the law in Canada in regard to the present problem is instructive.  Section 276 of the Criminal Code had been so drafted as to provide a blanket exclusion of any evidence on behalf of the accused concerning the sexual activity of the complainant with any person other than the accused unless it was led to rebut evidence led by the prosecution, or it was evidence seeking to incriminate another person as guilty of the offence, or it related to the occasion of the alleged offence and related to the consent which the accused alleged he believed was given by the complainant.  The provision came before the Canadian Supreme Court in <i>R v Seaboyer</i> [1991]  2 SCR 577 and by a majority was held to be unconstitutional.  In the course of the leading judgment McLachlin J identified several examples of evidence which the provision would exclude but which could be critical to the defence of the accused.  These comprised evidence to support a defence of honest belief, evidence to show a bias or motive to fabricate the evidence on the part of the complainant, evidence to explain physical evidence on which the prosecution might rely to show intercourse or the use of force, and evidence of a pattern of conduct.  However legitimate the aims of the legislation might be it was cast so widely as to deprive the accused of the ability to mount lines of defence which were relevant and legitimate. The section was thereafter revised.  The form of the revised version was to exclude evidence of sexual activity of the complainant with the accused or any other person to support an inference that by reason of that activity the complainant was more likely to have consented or was less worthy of belief.  That provision sought to lay to rest the so called twin myths relating to the effect of general sexual behaviour on matters of consent and credibility.  Further such evidence was to be excluded unless the judge determined that it was of specific instances of sexual behaviour, was relevant to an issue at trial and that it had significant probative value which was not substantially outweighed by the danger of prejudice to the proper administration of justice.  The revised version of the provision came before the court in <i>R v Darrach</i> (2000) 191 DLR (4th) 539  and was held to be compatible with the accused's right to make a full answer and defence and was in conformity with the Constitution. The approach taken by the revised provision and the philosophy behind it deserve careful attention.  The Canadian experience shows how important it is to secure a proper balance between the necessity to provide sufficient protection for the victim of a sexual offence at the trial of the person accused of the offence and the corresponding necessity to secure that the accused has the opportunity to present any relevant defence which he has to the charge.  It is right that the victim be protected. But it is also right that an accused should be allowed a fair trial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123. The question whether a complainant has consented to intercourse with the defendant is often a critical issue in a trial for rape.  So the question what evidence is or is not relevant to the matter of the giving or withholding of consent becomes of particular importance.  From at least the nineteenth century the belief seems to have been held that if the complainant had had sexual intercourse with some other man or men than the defendant she would be more likely to have consented to intercourse with the defendant.  It seems also to have been believed that such a complainant would be less worthy of belief than a woman of unblemished chastity.  These ideas have been labelled as myths in Canadian jurisprudence.  In <i>R v Seaboyer</i>  McLachlin J (p 630) considered that they had no place in a rational and just system of law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;124. Ideas which may have seemed sound in the nineteenth century should be discarded in the face of the very different society in which we now live.  The respect which is due to women in society requires that a proper recognition should be given to their independence of mind and the autonomy which they undoubtedly should enjoy.  General beliefs about the propensity of unchaste women to consent to intercourse or to be unworthy of credit which may have held sway in an age when the position of women in society bears little comparison with what it is today should now be seen as heresies and discarded as outmoded.  Any  general idea that because a woman has consented once she is likely to have consented on the occasion in dispute should be relegated to history. Evidence of a general reputation in relation to sexual matters is properly excluded under section 41(6).  The only matters to which evidence or questioning may be permitted are specific instances of alleged sexual behaviour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125. But there is one vital distinction which must be recognised among the generalities which are sometimes adopted in this context, and that is the distinction between a history of intercourse with the defendant and a history of intercourse with other men.  To an extent that distinction has been recognised in the past.  While questions could be asked in cross-examination of the complainant about someone other than the defendant evidence could not be called to contradict her answer since that would open the way to an inquiry into a multitude of collateral issues (<i>R v Holmes </i>(1871)  LR 1 CCR 334 ).  On the other hand evidence could be led to counter an answer where the question had been asked in relation to intercourse with the defendant (<i>R v Riley </i>(1887)  18 QBD 481). But the distinction should be recognised as going further.  It may readily be accepted that some evidence at least relating to sexual behaviour with the defendant outside the particular event which is the subject of the trial may be relevant as casting light on the question of the complainant's consent.  But I do not consider that evidence of her behaviour with other men should now be accepted as relevant for that purpose.  As Lord Justice-Clerk Macdonald said long ago in the Scottish case, <i>Dickie v H M Advocate</i> (1897)  24 R(J) 82, 84:</p>
<p></p><ul>"I am not aware that such evidence has ever been allowed, and indeed it could only be allowed upon the footing that female who yields her person to one man will presumably do so to any man - a proposition which is quite untenable."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;126. The distinction was noted and stressed in the Report of the Advisory Group on the Law of Rape (The Heilbron Committee) (1975) (Cmnd 6325), p 17, paras 100-101 where it was noticed that cross-examination of the complainant's relationship with other men has always stood on a different footing from cross-examination about her relationship with the accused, and that it was the former which causes the real problem.  The view is expressed in para 134 that questions and evidence as to the association with the accused will in general be relevant, but that the previous sexual history of the complainant with other men ought in general not to be introduced.  Their recommendations (p 36 of the Report) extended to the allowance of some such evidence but subject to leave and in circumstances which they specified.  But, as Kibble has pointed out (p 23), little attention has been paid in the literature in the United Kingdom to the relevance and admissibility of prior sexual history with the accused.  The context for discussion has sometimes been the admissibility of sexual history with third parties, and general references to "sexual history" can mask the fact that it is behaviour with third parties which is principally being considered.  The failure to draw the distinction can give rise to misunderstanding.  It is a distinction which has to be kept in mind when assessing the substance of the "twin myths".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;127. It is then somewhat surprising to find that section 41 does not recognise this distinction.  It deals throughout with sexual behaviour, an expression which is defined in section 42(1)(c) as meaning:</p>
<p></p><ul>"any sexual behaviour or other sexual experience, whether or not involving any accused or other person, but excluding (except in section 41(3)(c)(i) and (5)(a)) anything alleged to have taken place as part of the event which is the subject matter of the charge against the accused." <p></p></ul>
<p>Of course the admission of any evidence of sexual behaviour with anyone is subject to the obtaining of the leave of the court in terms of section 41(1) as more fully detailed in subsection (2).  But it should not be thought that evidence of sexual behaviour with other persons than the defendant is necessarily of equal standing in respect of relevance or of weight as sexual behaviour with the defendant himself.  It may be noted in passing that since "sexual behaviour" in section 41(1) includes anything alleged to have taken place as part of the event which is the subject matter of the charge against the accused (see section 42(1)(c)), no restraint seems to be imposed under section 41(1) on evidence or questions about such behaviour, no leave being required.  But that appears to conflict with the intention of section 41(5) which envisages some limitation being imposed on such evidence or questions.</p>
