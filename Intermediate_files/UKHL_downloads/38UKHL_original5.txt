<p class="para">104.&nbsp;&nbsp;As we have seen, section 225(4) of the 2003 Act applied section 28 of the 1997 Act to every IPP sentence and by the insertion of section 34(1)(2)(d) to the 1997 Act effected by section 230 of and paragraph 3 of Schedule 18 to the 2003 Act, added a defendant serving an IPP to the ambit of the phrase “life prisoner” in section 28 of the 1997 Act.  Therefore both indeterminate sentences are subject to identical release provisions. The assessment is left to the Parole Board.  For this purpose it acts as a judicial body independent of the Secretary of State, and having done so, if release is appropriate, it is not making a recommendation to the Secretary of State that release should follow, but giving a mandatory direction which must be implemented.  It is, in effect, making a court order with which he must comply.  Although the IPP prisoner may “require” that his case should be referred to the Parole Board, the entitlement is subject to a pre-condition that his tariff period should have expired.  In other words until the punitive element of the sentence has been served, the prisoner has no such statutory entitlement, and he cannot seek a reference in anticipation of the end of that period.</p>
<p class="para">105.&nbsp;&nbsp;The statutory regime for dealing with indeterminate sentences is predicated on the possibility that, save for those for whom the punitive element of the sentence requires that life imprisonment should indeed mean imprisonment for the rest of the offender’s natural life, prisoners may be reformed or will reform themselves.  A fair opportunity for their rehabilitation and the opportunity to demonstrate that the risk they presented at the date of sentence has diminished to levels consistent with release into the community should be available to them.  The IPP sentence does not require the abandonment of all hope for offenders on whom it is imposed.  They are not consigned to penal oblivion.  To the contrary, common humanity, if nothing else, must allow for the possibility of rehabilitation. As Lord Phillips CJ, in the Court of Appeal, giving the judgment of the court observed, at paragraph 41:</p>
<p class="qt">“We also accept that those who promoted the 2003 Act and Parliament that enacted it must have anticipated that the lifer regime …would be available to IPP prisoners so as to give them a fair chance of ceasing to be, and showing that they had ceased to be, dangerous.  This was the context in which the legislation was enacted.  To use Laws LJ’s phrase [2008] 1All ER 138, para 26, it was ‘a premise of the legislation'".</p>
<p class="paraleft">In this context, this premise of the legislation is not however synonymous with its purpose.  As we have seen, the statutory structure applicable to IPPs provides for two purposes, commensurate punishment and public protection.</p>
<p class="para">106.&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot be blind to the realities.  The reality for the offender subject to IPP is that the prison regime in which he may (or may not) be provided with the opportunity for rehabilitation is dependent on the structures provided by the Secretary of State.  The similar reality for the Parole Board is that the material on which to form its decision that the offender may (or may not) have ceased to represent a public danger is equally dependant on the regime structured for this different purpose by the Secretary of State.</p>
<p class="para">107.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 239 of the 2003 Act provides:</p>
<p class="qt">“(3) the Board must, in dealing with cases as respects which it makes recommendations under this Chapter or under Chapter 2 of Part 2 of the 1997 Act, consider -</p>
<p class="qt">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;any documents given to it by the Secretary of State, and</p>
<p class="qt">(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;any other oral or written information obtained by it…</p>
<p class="qt">(5)  Without prejudice to subsections (3) and (4) the Secretary of State may make rules with respect to the proceedings of the Board…</p>
<p class="qt">(6)  The Secretary of State may also give to the Board directions as to the matters to be taken into account by it in discharging any functions under this Chapter or under Chapter 2 of Part 2 of the 1997 Act; and in giving any such directions the Secretary of State must have regard to - </p>
<p class="qt">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;the need to protect the public from serious harm from offenders, and </p>
 
<p class="qt">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;the desirability of preventing the commission by them of further offences and of securing their rehabilitation.”</p>
<p class="paraleft">When exercising its responsibilities therefore the Parole Board must consider any documentary material provided by the Secretary of State, together with any oral or written information obtained by it, including material which the prisoner himself may submit.</p>
<p class="para">108.&nbsp;&nbsp;The test to be applied by the Parole Board is provided by section 28(6).  A direction that the prisoner should be released cannot be given unless the Parole Board is satisfied that the protection of the public <i>no longer</i> requires his detention.  This provision represents a direct link with the predictive judgment made by the sentencing court that the prisoner would continue to represent a danger at the expiry of the period. The sole basis on which a direction that the prisoner should be released can be given is the conclusion of the Parole Board that he no longer represents that danger.  If so, the purpose of the indeterminate sentence will have been served.  The protective element of the sentence will have been addressed and satisfied.  Thus continued detention is no longer necessary and release should follow.  If however the Parole Board is not so satisfied, the IPP continues to provide the legal justification for the prisoner’s continued detention.</p>
<i><p class="paraleft">The Public Law Duty of the Secretary of State</p></i>
<p class="para">109.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the IPP regime was created, the Secretary of State had exercised his powers under section 32(6) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 (the 1991 Act) (now section 239 (6) of the 2003 Act) to issue Direction 6.  This provides:</p>
<p>“In assessing the level of risk to life and limb presented by a lifer, the Parole Board shall consider the following information, <i>where relevant and where available</i>, before directing the lifer’s release…</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;whether the lifer has made positive and successful efforts to address the attitudes and behavioural problems which led to the commission of the index offence…</p>
<p>(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;the lifer’s awareness of the impact of the index offence, particularly in relation to the victim or victim’s family, and the extent of any demonstrable insight into his/her attitudes and behavioural problems and whether he/she has taken steps to reduce risk through the achievement of life sentence plan targets…”</p>
<p class="para">110.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rules issued by the Secretary of State under section 32(5) of the 1991 Act include the Parole Board Rules 2004 and the policy set out in the Prison Service Order 4700 (PSO 4700).  Rule 6, together with schedule 1, require the Secretary of State to provide the Parole Board with </p>
<p class="qt">“Current reports on the prisoner’s risk factors, reduction in risk and performance and behaviour in prison, including views on suitability for release on licence as well as compliance with any sentence plan".</p>
<p class="para">111.&nbsp;&nbsp;The offender’s sentence plan is covered by PSO4700.  More important to the present appeal specific provision relating to those described as short tariff lifers is made.  These are offenders sentenced to a sentence with a punitive element of 5 years or less.  Paragraph 4.13.1 provides:</p>
<p class="qt">“Short tariff lifers are normally regarded as those who have a tariff of 5 years or less.  The majority of these will be prisoners who have received an automatic life sentence…but there can occasionally be mandatory or discretionary lifers who also receive a short tariff and automatics who will have received tariffs longer than 5 years".</p>
<p class="paraleft">Paragraph 4.13.2 provides:</p>
<p class="qt">“Lifers with short tariffs are managed differently from lifers with longer tariffs because of the overall objective to release lifers on tariff expiry if risk factors permit.  The statutory entitlement to a review by the Parole Board may  for a short tariff lifer be triggered relatively shortly after conviction…  <i>They must be prioritised for offending behaviour programmes according to the length of time left till tariff expires.  The same principle must apply for all lifers, so that length of time to tariff expiry is taken into account when allocating offending behaviour programme resources.  In other words, lifers must be given every opportunity to demonstrate their safety for release at tariff expiry”</i>.<i> </i>(original emphasis)</p>
<p class="para">112.&nbsp;&nbsp;PSO4700 as well as the Parole Board Rules were both made before 4 April 2005 when the IPP regime was introduced.  At the time when they were promulgated, there will have been comparatively few short tariff lifers.  It was apparently not appreciated that that position would not and could not hold good for the new indeterminate sentence.  Surprisingly therefore when the IPP regime was introduced neither the policy nor the rules were reconsidered and amended.  They were simply transposed and applied expressly to IPPs in exactly the same way as they applied to sentences of life imprisonment.  Accordingly, in relation to IPPs the Secretary of State was under a public law duty to ensure that they were complied with.</p>
<p class="para">113.&nbsp;&nbsp;Statistics were made available to the Divisional Court from the Deputy Head of the Public Protection Unit at the National Offender Management Service.  The number of prisoners serving indeterminate sentences shortly before the IPP sentence was introduced was just short of 6000 (5807) and within two years had rocketed to virtually 9000 prisoners (8977).</p>
<p class="para">114.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are told on behalf of the National Offender Management Service and the Ministry of Justice that it was assumed that the “overall impact” of the new regime would be resource-neutral.  In other words, it was believed that the implementation of the provisions relating to imprisonment for public protection would create very little additional demand on all the relevant processes.</p>
<p class="para">115.&nbsp;&nbsp;The foundations for this belief are unclear and, given the express and clear legislative provisions, somewhat mysterious.  Perhaps the genesis of the problem can be traced to the recommendations of Mr John Halliday in his Report following a review of the sentencing framework, <i>Making Punishments Work</i>, published in July 2001, which provided the basis for many of the sentencing provisions which were subsequently enacted in the 2003 Act.  The IPP he recommended was quite different to the IPP as enacted.  If his proposals had been implemented IPP would not have involved indefinite detention.  Instead of automatic release halfway through their sentences (that is, what is now described as the tariff period), the offenders to whom IPP applied would have been liable to continue to be detained until the end of the determinate sentence. They would then have been entitled to be released.  The Parole Board would not have been involved in the process.  Direction 6 issued pursuant to section 239(6) of the 2003 Act and rule 6 of and Schedule 1 to the Parole Board Rules 2004 would not have applied to them.  Nor would PSO4700. If Mr Halliday’s recommendations had been implemented, fresh thought would presumably have been given to the situation faced by those sentenced to IPP, and appropriate policies to govern their release, if they ceased to be dangerous, before the end of their determinate sentences, would have been introduced.</p>
<p class="para">116.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Halliday’s Report emphasised that the successful implementation of his recommendations required the provision of adequate resources.  Thus, for example, one of three factors identified as critical to success was “comprehensive assessment of needs for investment in infrastructure and services, including…obtaining necessary human and financial resources".  In relation to what he described as the “main drivers of additional costs", he identified the “new sentence for dangerous offenders".  He expressly cautioned that “the framework should not be implemented until the necessary infrastructure and resources are available to all services, including offender assessment systems, and prisoner release planning systems".  This warning was unequivocal, and yet, although Mr Halliday’s recommended IPP was a more modest proposal and would have been less resource intensive than the IPP actually introduced by the 2003 Act there is no satisfactory evidence to demonstrate that the serious issue of consequent demands on resources was adequately addressed.</p>
<p class="para">117.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government’s response, <i>Justice for All</i>, was published in July 2002.  The Government wished to ensure that the public was adequately protected from those offenders whose offences did not currently attract a maximum penalty of life imprisonment but who were nevertheless assessed at dangerous.  “…such offenders should remain in custody until their risks are considered management in the community.  For this reason we propose to develop an indeterminate sentence for sexual and violent offenders who have been assessed and considered dangerous.  The offender would be required to serve a minimum term and would then remain in prison beyond this time, until the Parole Board was completely satisfied that the risk had sufficiently diminished for that person to be released unsupervised in the community".</p>
<p class="para">118.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was an inevitable consequence of the legislation, and the application of the statutory presumption in section 229(3) of the Act, that even when the punitive element appropriate to the offender’s crimes was measured in months rather than years, IPP would arise for consideration.  Sentencing judges loyally followed the unequivocal terms of the statute and very many more defendants than anticipated were made subject to IPPs.  However no extra resources were made available to address the consequent and inevitable increase in the number of inmates subject to indeterminate custody.  The result is the seriously defective structures identified in these appeals. Numerous prisoners have continued to be detained in custody after the expiration of the punitive element of their sentences, without the question either of their rehabilitation or of the availability of up to date, detailed information becoming available about their progress (or lack of it).  The National Offender Management Service acknowledges “that the need to ensure a proper allocation of resources across the prison estate has meant that a number of those serving IPP sentences have not had as full an opportunity to progress within the system as had been hoped".  This is hardly an exaggeration.</p>
<p class="para">119.&nbsp;&nbsp;The problems created by a vast increase in those serving indeterminate sentences resulted in a fast track review by the National Offender Management Service of indeterminate sentence prisoners, with particular reference to those sentenced to IPP.  The Lockyer Review was set up in April 2007.  Concerns which the Review was asked to address included the “clear weaknesses throughout the IPP offender journey, including; pre- and post-sentence assessments; custodial allocation; targeting of intervention; parole hearings; release and re-settlement; and consistent co-working and communications between the custodial and community sectors". The pressures on the system would become increasingly acute as more offenders passed their tariff dates.  Attention was drawn to criticism into the arrangements for IPP prisoners by the Chief Inspector of Prisons and, of particular significance in relation to the article 5(4) issues which arise, the Chairman of the Parole Board.  </p>
<p class="para">120.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Review, published in August 2007, acknowledged that “the current reliance on the lifer management arrangements for dealing with all IPP prisoners has failed.  IPPs are stacking in local prisons and are not moving to establishments where their needs can be assessed or better met.”  It noted that “places in the lifer estate are more costly and scarce, and there is no compelling case for managing IPPs within the traditional lifer management arrangement.  The profile of IPP is not similar to lifers (more high risk, more likely to suffer from personality disorder, and more sexual offences and robbery) and therefore assessment and intervention needs may not be the same.  Given the scarcity of lifer places and the growing number stacking up in local prisons, there is a real imperative for finding an alternative way of managing this population overall".  The Review referred to a bottleneck caused by a small number of specialised lifer centres, and pointed out that over 1,500 prisoners serving IPPs were held currently in local prisons because space in lifer centres was unavailable, and the problems posed by this number was exacerbated by an additional 1,000 prisoners serving sentences of life imprisonment who were similarly held in local prisons.</p>
<p class="para">121.&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation for the inevitable consequences of the new sentencing provisions relating to IPPs was wholly inadequate.  To put it bluntly, they were comprehensively unresourced.    The deficiencies are, at last, being made good.  Speaking very generally, courses and training are available and offenders may take advantage of them.  The information being made available to the Parole Board when considering whether the offenders should remain in custody is more extensive and evidence-based, and it can make better informed decisions.  In addition, the statute has been amended by the 2008 Act.  The statutory assumptions in section 229 have been eradicated.  With exceptions irrelevant for present purposes, imprisonment for public protection cannot now be imposed unless the determinate sentence for offences would be at least 4 years’ imprisonment, or a tariff period of 2 years: in any event it is now a discretionary rather than a mandatory sentence. (For a summary of these changes, see <i>R v C and others </i>[2008] EWCA Crim 2790).  This has led to a decline in the numbers of orders of IPP, but no less important for the administration of the sentence, for those subjected to IPP after 14 July 2008, there will at least be a reasonable time for the offender, and indeed the offender management system, properly to address IPPs and in particular, for the risks which led the sentencing court to conclude that the public needed protection to diminish while the punitive element of the sentence is being served.     </p>
<p class="para">122.&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the undoubted improvements in the processes effected following the Lockyer Review, the appellants and indeed other prisoners were victims of the systemic failures arising from ill considered assumptions that the consequences of the legislation would be resource-neutral.  Having applied the identical policies and rules relating to life imprisonment to IPPs, the Secretary of State failed to provide the resources to implement them.  As tariff periods expired, nothing had been done to enable an informed assessment by the Parole Board of the question whether the protection of the public required the prisoner’s continued detention.  That, of course, did not mean that they had become safe, or that the risk they presented had significantly diminished, but the conclusion that the Secretary of State was in breach of his public law duties owed to the appellants and many others subject to the IPP regime is inevitable.</p>
<p class="para">123.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, however, the Secretary of State’s breach of his public law duties cannot be converted into a re-enactment or amendment of the statutory provisions, and in particular section 28(6) of the 1997 Act. The provisions are clear.  The power to direct any such release is vested exclusively in the Parole Board which cannot direct release unless satisfied that the continued confinement of the prisoner for the protection of the public is no longer necessary.  The IPP sentence cannot be overridden or deprived of its effect either by the Secretary of State or indeed on the basis of the conclusion in proceedings for judicial review that the Secretary of State is in breach of his public law obligations.  The declaratory relief to that effect is appropriate: release from custody however is not.</p>
<i><p class="paraleft">Article 5(1) and Article 5(4) of the European Convention on Human Rights</p></i>
<p class="para">124.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the advantage of reading the opinion in draft of my noble and learned friend, Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood, about the application of articles 5(1) and 5(4) of the European Convention, as well as section 6(2)(a) of the Human Rights Act 1998, and I respectfully agree with his reasoning and his conclusions. In view of the difficulty posed by article 5(4) considerations, I shall add some brief observations of my own.</p>
<p class="para">125.&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 5(1) of the European Convention of Human Rights provides:</p>
<p class="qt">“Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person.  No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:</p>
<p class="qt">a)&nbsp;&nbsp;the lawful detention of a person after conviction by &nbsp;&nbsp;a competent court..".</p>
<p class="paraleft">Article 5(4) provides:</p>
<p class="qt">“Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful”</p>
<p class="para">126.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reasons already given, there is no doubt that, based on the order of the sentencing court, the continued detention of persons subject to IPP after the expiry of their tariff periods is lawful.  In relation to article 5(1) the question which arises is whether the breach of the Secretary of State’s public law duty should lead to the conclusion that the causal link between the original conviction and the continuing detention has been broken.  (For this principle, see, among other authorities, <i>Van Droogenbroeck v Belgium</i> (1982) 4 EHRR 443, <i>Weeks v United Kingdom</i> (1987) 10 EHRR 293 and <i>Stafford v United Kingdom</i> (2002) 35 EHRR 32.)  If one of the purposes of an IPP were rehabilitation, and if the continued detention after the expiry of the tariff period were dependent on a specific finding by the Parole Board that it would be inappropriate to direct the prisoner’s release it would then, of course, be arguable that the causal link between the IPP and any later detention of the appellants was broken.  As I have endeavoured to demonstrate from an analysis of the structure of the legislation, that proposition is ill founded.</p>
<p class="para">127.&nbsp;&nbsp;My view is reinforced by two decisions of the Court of Appeal,  <i>R (Noorkoiv) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</i> [2002] 1 WLR 3284 and <i>R (Cawser) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</i> [2004] UKHRR 101.  The principle is encapsulated in the observations of Lord Woolf CJ in <i>Noorkoiv</i> that : “…the justification for the detention of a prisoner sentenced to life imprisonment (whether discretionary or automatic or mandatory) is that sentence and not the fixing of the tariff period".  In <i>Walker</i>, Laws LJ summarised the effect of the decision in <i>Cawser,</i> to which he himself had been a party, in this way: “<i>Cawser’s</i> case closes off the possibility of argument in this court that the continued detention of a lifer past his tariff expiry date, incurred by reason of a failure to provide offending behaviour courses, might be held to breach article 5(1) of the Convention.”  <i>Noorkoiv</i> and <i>Cawser</i> were, of course, cases of imprisonment for life rather than IPPs: nevertheless the same reasoning holds good.  What is more, it is entirely consistent with the legislative structure relating to IPPs.</p>
<p class="para">128.&nbsp;&nbsp;I should perhaps add that, like Lord Brown, I should not exclude the possibility of an article 5(1) challenge in the case of a prisoner sentenced to IPP and allowed to languish in prison for years without receiving any of the attention which both the policy and the relevant rules, and ultimately common humanity, require.</p>
<p class="para">129.&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to article 5(4) there is an immediate forensic problem. The Secretary of State conceded that Mr Lee’s article 5(4) rights were contravened and he has not appealed the decision of Moses LJ to the same effect in the case of Mr Wells.  The Court of Appeal concluded that Mr James would be likely to establish such a breach at the time when the first Parole Board review took place. Although the factual basis for that finding is challenged on behalf of the Secretary of State, it is not contended that absent the opportunity for the prisoner to demonstrate that he ceased to represent the risk which led to the imposition of the IPP, any section 28(6) review by the Parole Board would, in the words of the Court of Appeal, be an “empty exercise", and accordingly that a breach of article 5(4) would be made out.</p>
<p class="para">130.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parole Board, as Intervener, suggests that these concessions were wrongly made and that no breach of article 5(4) has been established in any of these cases.  So we must examine whether such a breach is established in the context of concessions made by the Secretary of State with which the Parole Board disagrees, and when it is the Parole Board, not the Secretary of State, which in article 5(4) terms is “the court” vested with the responsibility for deciding whether the prisoner’s release should be ordered.</p>
<p class="para">131.&nbsp;&nbsp;Stripped to essentials, and without reference to authority, the right provided by article 5(4) postulates the requirement that everyone in detention shall be entitled to challenge the lawfulness of that detention.  This right predicates the availability of a tribunal vested with appropriate jurisdiction before which the prisoner is provided with the opportunity to address argument that it is not.</p>
