<p class="para">64.&nbsp;&nbsp;The respondent submits however that Parliament cannot be taken to have intended that a defence under section 31 was to be available to a person who is being prosecuted for using false documents in an attempt to leave the United Kingdom.  As Miss Montgomery was at pains to emphasise, the offence of dishonestly attempting to obtain air transportation services by deception is an offence that someone commits who is trying to get out of the country, not trying to get into it.  Her argument on this point assumed, contrary to her first submission, that article 31(1) applied to passengers who were found to be acting illegally when they were seeking to leave the country while they were still in transit.  Even so, she said, Parliament had deliberately narrowed its protection when it was considering how far it was to be available in the United Kingdom.  Section 31 of the 1999 Act had been framed in a way that ensured that it would be available to cases of illegal entry or presence, and no more. The omission of section 1(1) of the Criminal Attempts Act 1981 was not to be regarded as an oversight.  It was deliberate, because it was never intended that the section should protect acts of that kind. </p>
<p class="para">65.&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot accept this argument.  Section 31 does appear to have imposed an additional hurdle that refugees must cross before they will be entitled to make use of a defence based on article 31.  Section 31(2) deals with the case where the refugee, in coming from the country where his freedom was threatened, stopped in another country outside the United Kingdom before his arrival in this country.  The test which he must satisfy is not to be found in those terms in article 31(1).  This subsection has narrowed its scope in comparison with what was contemplated in <i>Adimi</i>.  But the section as a whole indicates that, once the prerequisites are all satisfied, a defence will be available in all cases that are within the reach of the article.  Subsections (8) and (9) refer to cases where, before the commencement of the section, it was not argued that “a defence based on article 31(1)” was available.  This suggests that no restriction on the kind of offences to which a defence under that article would be available was contemplated.</p>
<p class="para">66.&nbsp;&nbsp;A further indication is to be found in what  the Attorney General, Lord Williams of Mostyn, said at Third Reading about the amendment which introduced the clause that was to become section 31: Hansard (HL), 2 November 1990, col 784:</p>
<p class="qt">“The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that someone who comes within article 31(1) of the United Nations convention of 1951 is properly protected and does not have a penalty imposed on him on account of his illegal entry or presence.  As I told your Lordships on an earlier occasion, we have already put in place administrative procedures to identify at an early stage article 31(1) issues.  Ideally, therefore, in relevant cases the matter would never come to court.  Sometimes these arrangements will fail.  They will fail to identify someone who comes within article 31(1) and this amendment is therefore a further safeguard.  I told your Lordships on Report that subsection (1) draws on the terms of the article itself.”</p>
<p class="qt"> On Report he said that the government wanted an outcome which properly accommodated article 31(1) asylum seekers and the difficulties that had been raised by Simon Brown LJ in <i>Adimi</i>: Hansard (HL), 18 October 1999, col 855.</p>
<p class="para">67.&nbsp;&nbsp;These comments seem to me to reinforce the impression given by subsections (8) and (9) that, subject only to the limitation which is built in by subsection (2), it was the intention that someone who comes within article 31(1) should have a defence under section 31.   On this view the absence of section 1(1) of the Criminal Attempts Act 1981 must be regarded as an oversight.  I do not see it as a deliberate omission from the list, designed to restrict still further the scope of the protection that was contemplated by Simon Brown LJ in <i>Adimi </i>when, adopting Newman J’s formula, he said at p 677G-H that conduct that could be attributed to a bona fide desire to seek asylum whether here or elsewhere should be covered by article 31  </p>
<p class="para">68.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Fitzgerald QC submitted that the omission of section 1(1) of the 1981 Act from the list of offences in section 31(3) should be made good in one or other of four ways: (i) by recognising that there was a freestanding defence under article 31(1); (ii) by reading section 1(1) of the 1981 Act into the list; (iii) by legitimate expectation; or (iv) by holding that her prosecution under section 1(1) of the 1981 Act was an abuse of process.  </p>
<p class="para">69.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would reject the first three alternatives, essentially for the same reasons as those given by my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill.  The giving effect in domestic law to international obligations is primarily a matter for the legislature.  It is for Parliament to determine the extent to which those obligations are to be incorporated domestically.  That determination having been made, it is the duty of the courts to give effect to it.  There can be no free-standing defence, nor can there be any legitimate expectation that one will be provided, where Parliament has chosen in its own words to set out the scope of the defence that is to be available.  For the courts to add further offences of their own choosing to the list of those to which Parliament has said section 31 applies in England and Wales and Northern Ireland would not be to interpret the subsection but to legislate.  Our constitutional arrangements do not permit this.</p>
<p class="para">70.&nbsp;&nbsp;There remains the fourth alternative.  The margin between declining to add to the list in section 31(3) and declaring that it was an abuse for the appellant to be required to plead guilty to an offence that is not on the list when she was still being prosecuted for an offence for which the defence under that section is available is a narrow one.  But it is not illusory.  There is a substantial point to be made here.  The brief narrative that is given of the circumstances in each count shows that they arose out of precisely the same incident.  The appellant was accused in the first count of having the intention of inducing Mohammed Hussan to accept the false Italian passport as genuine.  He was the security officer at the Virgin Atlantic check-in desk.  She was then accused in the second count of dishonestly attempting to obtain air transportation services from Virgin Atlantic by falsely representing that she was authorised to use that passport and that it was genuine.  The evidence showed that the person to whom the representation was made was Mohammed Hussan, the security officer named in the first count.  </p>
<p class="para">71.&nbsp;&nbsp;The offences mentioned in each count are different, and the complainants named in each of them were different too - the security officer in one case, the airline in the other.  But they were two sides of the same coin.  As one attracted the section 31 defence and the other did not, the effect was to expose the appellant to the imposition of a penalty for doing something against which she was entitled to claim protection under that section.  It seems to me to be plain that it was an abuse for the prosecutor to undermine the protection in this way.  Section 31 must be read in the light of article 31(1) of the Convention, to which it was intended to give effect.  There is no room in this context for the formalistic argument that the omission from section 31(3) of section 1(1) of the Criminal Attempts Act 1981 enabled the prosecutor to take this course.  He was alleging that the appellant had committed one of the offences on the list.  The fact that it was a listed offence was a sufficient indication that it was the intention of Parliament that she should have the article 31(1) protection against the imposition of a penalty for her illegal act, provided the requirements of sections 31(1) and 31(2) were satisfied.  She ought not to have been required to plead to the second count until the jury had delivered its verdict on the first count.  As the jury found her not guilty on the first count, holding that the requirements of sections 31(1) and 31(2) had been satisfied, her prosecution on the second count should not have been proceeded with.  As it is, the way in which the prosecution was conducted in this case deprived her of the protection and it was an abuse.  </p>
<p class="hditl">Conclusion</p>
<p class="para">72.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons I would allow the appeal and quash the appellant’s conviction on the second count of the indictment.</p>
<p class="lawlord">LORD RODGER OF EARLSFERRY</p>
<p class="mylords">My Lords,</p>
<p class="para">73.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appellant, Ms Fregenet Asfaw, is from Ethiopia.  She was granted refugee status by the Home Office on 11 April 2007, almost thirteen months after the decision of the Court of Appeal in the criminal proceedings against her which are the subject of the present appeal.</p>
<p class="para">74.&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the appellant’s version of events, after she left Ethiopia to avoid further persecution, her ‘plane stopped in an unknown Middle Eastern country.  She remained there for about three hours before flying on to London.  On arriving at Heathrow on 14 February 2005, the appellant presented a false Ethiopian passport to the immigration officer on duty and so entered the United Kingdom.  Her intention, however, was not to stay in this country, but to travel on to the United States and claim asylum there.  So, having passed through immigration control, she waited, for something less than an hour, until an agent who was arranging her journey from Ethiopia brought her a ticket for a Virgin Atlantic flight to New York and a false Italian passport in the name of Hanams Gebrele.</p>
<p class="para">75.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Asfaw then presented the ticket and passport to the official on duty at the Virgin Atlantic check-in desk in Terminal 3.  He realised that the passport was a forgery and alerted the police.  The appellant was stopped at the departure gate.  She was taken to a police station where she was questioned.  After a private interview with a solicitor, the appellant claimed asylum.  She was eventually charged with using a false instrument with intent to use it as genuine, contrary to section 3 of the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981, and with attempting to obtain services by deception, contrary to section 1(1) of the Criminal Attempts Act 1981.</p>
<p class="para">76.&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 31(1) of the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (“the Convention”), which is headed “Refugees unlawfully in the country of refuge", provides:</p>
<p class="qt">“The Contracting States shall not impose penalties, on account of their illegal entry or presence, on refugees who, coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened in the sense of article 1, enter or are present in their territory without authorisation, provided they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence.”</p>
<p class="paraleft">With the aim of complying with the international law obligation imposed on the United Kingdom by this article, Parliament enacted section 31 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (“the 1999 Act”), which is headed “Defences based on Article 31(1) of the Refugee Convention".  Subsections (1) to (5) of section 31 provide:</p>
<p class="qt">“(1)  It is a defence for a refugee charged with an offence to which this section applies to show that, having come to the United Kingdom directly from a country where his life or freedom was threatened (within the meaning of the Refugee Convention), he— </p>
<p class="qt">(a)  presented himself to the authorities in the United Kingdom without delay;</p>
<p class="qt">(b)  showed good cause for his illegal entry or presence; and</p>
<p class="qt">(c)  made a claim for asylum as soon as was reasonably practicable after his arrival in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="qt">(2)  If, in coming from the country where his life or freedom was threatened, the refugee stopped in another country outside the United Kingdom, subsection (1) applies only if he shows that he could not reasonably have expected to be given protection under the Refugee Convention in that other country.</p>
<p class="qt">(3)  In England and Wales and Northern Ireland the offences to which this section applies are any offence, and any attempt to commit an offence, under—</p>
<p class="qt">(a)  Part I of the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981 (forgery and connected offences); …</p>
<p class="qt">(b)  section 24A of the 1971 Act (deception); or</p>
<p class="qt">(c)  section 26(1)(d) of the 1971 Act (falsification of documents).</p>
<p class="qt">(4)  In Scotland, the offences to which this section applies are those—</p>
<p class="qt">(a)  of fraud,</p>
<p class="qt">(b)  of uttering a forged document, …</p>
<p class="qt">(c)  under section 24A of the 1971 Act (deception), or</p>
<p class="qt">(d)  under section 26(1)(d) of the 1971 Act (falsification of documents),</p>
<p class="qt">and any attempt to commit any of those offences.</p>
<p class="qt">(5)  A refugee who has made a claim for asylum is not entitled to the defence provided by subsection (1) in relation to any offence committed by him after making that claim.”</p>
<p class="para">77.&nbsp;&nbsp;Two points about section 31 can be made straightaway.  First, the offence of entering the United Kingdom unlawfully, contained in section 24 of the Immigration Act 1971, is not listed in section 31(3).  Nor is the offence of attempting to obtain services by deception, contrary to section 1(1) of the Criminal Attempts Act 1981.  While, for the reasons I shall give, the omission of the second provision is entirely understandable and correct, as presently advised, I am at a loss to understand why the first of these provisions has been omitted from the lists in section 31(3) and (4), since section 24, like section 24A, falls four-square within the terms of article 31.  Article 31 is designed indeed for precisely that kind of offence.</p>
<p class="para">78.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both at first instance and before the Court of Appeal, those representing the prosecution proceeded on the basis that, if the jury accepted the appellant’s version of events, she would have a defence to the first count on the indictment, since the offence in question is included in the list in section 31(3) of the 1999 Act.  But the same did not apply to the second count on the indictment, since the relevant offence is not included in that list.  HH Judge Lowen upheld the prosecution position on the second count and rejected a defence argument that, despite the limited terms of section 31(3) of the 1999 Act, the appellant had a free-standing defence to the count by virtue of article 31 of the Convention.  The appellant then pleaded guilty to the second count.  After trial, the jury acquitted her of the first count.  The judge sentenced the appellant to 9 months’ imprisonment on the second count.  She appealed against her conviction.</p>
<p class="para">79.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal criticised the prosecuting authorities for including the second count on the indictment, on the ground that it really covered the same conduct as the first count, but did not afford the appellant the protection of a defence under section 31 of the 1999 Act.  The court disposed of the whole matter on a pragmatic basis, by dismissing her appeal against conviction, giving her leave to appeal against sentence and allowing that appeal and substituting an absolute discharge.  Ms Asfaw has appealed to this House against her conviction on the second count, not least because it could cause problems for her if, for instance, she wished to travel to the United States.</p>
<p class="para">80.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before this House counsel for the prosecuting authorities adopted a different position.  Ms Montgomery QC withdrew any concession made below and asserted that article 31 applies only to offences of entering and being present on the territory of a Contracting State and does not apply to offences committed by a refugee, such as the appellant, who is trying to leave that State and to travel on to settle in another country.  Section 31(1) has the same scope.  So it did not apply to either of the counts in the indictment against the appellant.  The logic of counsel’s position was, accordingly, that, even if the jury accepted the appellant’s version of events, she had no defence under section 31 (or indeed by virtue of article 31) to either count in the indictment.  So, although Ms Montgomery naturally stressed that she was not trying to appeal against the appellant’s acquittal on the first count, on her argument, the appellant should have pleaded guilty to the first, as well as the second, count.</p>
<p class="para">81.&nbsp;&nbsp;The confusion which has hitherto reigned on the part of the prosecution in these proceedings is remarkable, to say the least.  Nevertheless, the House must confront the actual legal issues to which the case gives rise.  The fundamental point is the scope of article 31.  If that article does not apply to a refugee who is trying to leave a Contracting State which he has entered, then there is no basis for arguing that section 31 of the 1999 Act should apply to such cases.  Similarly, a person in the appellant’s position could not have any kind of free-standing defence based on article 31.  Finally, unless the indictment were bad for duplicity - which the appellant has never argued and which was not the basis of the Court of Appeal’s criticism of the Crown - there could be no valid criticism of the Crown for prosecuting the appellant for attempting to obtain services by deception.</p>
<p class="para">82.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, I should like to think that anyone who simply read the words of article 31, in either of the official languages, would be as surprised as I was to be told that it covered offences committed by a refugee in order to leave the country.  On its face, the article is all about entry and presence and says nothing about leaving.  And the starting point of any interpretation of the article must indeed be the language itself:  <i>Adan v Secretary of State for the Home Department </i>[1999] 1 AC 293, 305, per Lord Lloyd of Berwick.  As I understood him, however, Mr Fitzgerald QC contended that article 31 must be approached as a living instrument.  It fell to be interpreted in the light of the development of air travel, which would not have been in the minds of those drafting the Convention in 1951.  The House should accordingly hold that a penalty imposed on refugees on account of their use of a false passport, in an attempt to leave the country and continue their flight from persecution, was imposed on account of their illegal presence in the country.  An interpretation to that effect was supported by the decision of the Divisional Court in <i>R v Uxbridge Magistrates’ Court , Ex p Adimi </i>[2001] QB 667, which had been approved, indeed welcomed, by commentators on the Convention.</p>
<p class="para">83.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Fordham QC, who appeared for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, argued, in support of the appellant’s position, that article 31 should be interpreted as applying to refugees who presented a false passport when trying to leave the country in order to pursue their flight from persecution.</p>
<p class="para">84.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that commentators and the High Commissioner support the interpretation of article 31 advocated by the appellant does not excuse your Lordships from the duty of forming a considered view of the proper scope of the article.  Indeed, nothing in the relevant passages in the commentaries or other extra-judicial material cited by counsel actually grapples with the text of article 31 or shows how, on the preferred interpretation, article 31 fits into the overall scheme of the Convention.  For my part, I have come to the clear conclusion that the interpretation favoured by the appellant is not only impossible on the language, but is actually at odds with the scheme of the Convention and with its true humanitarian philosophy.</p>
<p class="para">85.&nbsp;&nbsp;The approach which is to be adopted in construing the terms of the Convention was considered by my noble and learned friend, Lord Bingham of Cornhill, in <i>R (European Roma Rights Centre) v Immigration Officer at Prague Airport (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees intervening)</i> [2005] 2 AC 1.  Having described an impossible contention not advanced by Lord Lester of Herne Hill QC, Lord Bingham continued, at pp 18-19, para 18:</p>
<p class="qt">“Instead, Lord Lester urged that the Convention should be given a generous and purposive interpretation, bearing in mind its humanitarian objects and purpose clearly stated in the Preamble quoted in full in para 6 above.  This is, in my opinion, a correct approach to interpretation of a Convention such as this and it gains support, if support be needed, from article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties which, reflecting principles of customary international law, requires a treaty to be interpreted in the light of its object and purpose.  But I would make an important caveat.  However generous and purposive its approach to interpretation, the court’s task remains one of interpreting the written document to which the contracting states have committed themselves.  It must interpret what they have agreed.  It has no warrant to give effect to what they might, or in an ideal world would, have agreed.  This would violate the rule, also expressed in article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention, that a treaty should be interpreted in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context.”</p>
<p class="paraleft">I accept this guidance.  In my view, however, it has little to do with the real question in this case.</p>
<p class="para">86.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in the travaux préparatoires suggests that those who drafted the Convention had commercial air travel in mind.  That is not surprising since it was still in its infancy in 1951 and refugees would have been unlikely to be in a position to use it.  So the words of the Convention have to be applied to a form of transport which those framing the Convention cannot have had at the forefront of their minds, if they thought of it at all.</p>
<p class="para">87.&nbsp;&nbsp;As counsel for the appellant emphasised more than once, a feature of international air travel is that people transfer from one flight to another, and from one airline to another.  The appellant flew into Heathrow and wanted to change on to a Virgin Atlantic flight to Washington.  Had she been an ordinary passenger, she might well have been able to do so while remaining airside as a transit passenger, waiting for her Washington flight in a transit lounge and never presenting herself to the United Kingdom immigration authorities for entry into this country.  Arrangements of these kinds have been developed in the decades since the Convention was agreed.  The Convention has, of course, to be applied in a world where they are a feature.  On any view, however, the appellant did not remain airside.  Instead, she entered the United Kingdom on one false passport and then used another false passport to try to board a Virgin Atlantic flight to Washington.</p>
<p class="para">88.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when she was stopped, the appellant was changing ‘planes in the United Kingdom.  Changing ‘planes is, simply an example of changing from one conveyance to another in the course of a journey.  People in 1951 were more than familiar with changing trains, changing buses, changing from buses to trains or from boats to trains, and any number of other combinations of modes of transport.  The Oxford English Dictionary cites a passage from a 1955 novel of Elizabeth Bowen, set during the First World War, for the first use of “transit passenger” in a written publication.  Even assuming that she may have been guilty of an anachronism, in all probability she was using a term that was already familiar in spoken English before 1955.  Since few refugees would travel first class, and many of them would be anxious to avoid the attention of hostile authorities, their journeys would tend to involve frequent changes and long waits in-between.  So the idea that transfers from one aircraft or airline to another would have introduced a novel type of problem, undreamed of in 1951, is wide of the mark.  Such transfers are simply one modern version of a process which would have been well known to anyone concerned with refugees in 1951.</p>
<p class="para">89.&nbsp;&nbsp;The language of article 31 shows that what cannot be penalised is a refugee’s unlawful entry to, or presence in, a state.  But the entitlement of refugees to this impunity is subject to the proviso that they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence.  The French text, “et leur exposent", suggests that what is envisaged is that the refugees present themselves to the authorities and, at that stage, show the authorities why they had good cause for entering or being present in the country illegally.</p>
<p class="para">90.&nbsp;&nbsp;Refugees may cross a border away from a frontier post, or land from a boat, or in a light aircraft, at a spot where there are no immigration officials.  Being unauthorised, their entry and presence in the country will be illegal.  Alternatively, refugees may arm themselves with false papers and present them to immigration officials.  If the papers are accepted as genuine, the refugees will then be given official authorisation to enter the country, but that authorisation will have been obtained by deception.  It is common ground that article 31 is apt to cover both types of stratagem:  in either event the refugees’ entry or presence will be illegal for purposes of the article.</p>
<p class="para">91.&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to enjoy the protection of article 31, then, the refugees have to present themselves to the authorities without delay and explain to them why they have entered or are present illegally.  Of course, as refugees, their most basic need will be that the authorities should not throw them out or return them to the country where they were exposed to persecution.  Article 33 ensures that the Contracting State concerned cannot send them back.  In this respect, therefore, all refugees who present themselves to the authorities can be thought of as claiming asylum, if not expressly, then at least impliedly.  Correspondingly, for the purposes of, inter alia, section 31(1)(c), section 167(1) of the 1999 Act defines a “claim for asylum” broadly, as meaning “a claim that it would be contrary to the United Kingdom’s obligations under the Refugee Convention for the claimant to be removed from, or required to leave, the United Kingdom.”  So a refugee fulfils the requirement in section 31(1)(c) merely by asking the authorities not to remove him or to require him to leave the United Kingdom in breach of the Convention.</p>
