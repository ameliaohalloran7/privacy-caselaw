<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;62. Mr Leach spoke to Mr Sims by telephone and discussed the proposed undertaking. He told Mr Sims that he would obtain confirmation from Mr Yardley as to the purpose of the loan.  As for     Mr  Sims' undertaking to retain the money, "that was a matter for him" and he "appreciated his difficulty".  He told Mr Sims that the moneys would be held by his firm in a separate account "until they are required by Mr Yardley".  It was, however, for Mr Sims to decide as he was giving the undertaking and must be satisfied with its wording.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;63. Mr Leach then spoke to Mr Yardley and was told that the money would be used in connection with property acquisitions at Stourport, Apperley Bridge and Droitwich. Mr Leach duly faxed Mr Sims and told him that he had spoken to Mr Yardley and could confirm that the money was to be used for the purchase of property.  Mr Leach sent a copy of the fax to Mr Yardley and asked for his instructions to be confirmed by fax.  He told Mr Yardley that he would notify him as soon as the moneys were received "so that the funds may be utilised in connection with the purchase of the property you have notified to me".  Mr Yardley faxed his confirmation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;64. All this took place on 23 December before the undertaking was finally signed by Mr Sims on the following day.  On the same day, and in anticipation of the receipt of the money from Twinsectra, Mr Sims gave the necessary instructions to his bank to make telegraphic transfers of the bulk of the money to Mr Leach's firm.  They were implemented on 29 December.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;65. Mr Leach received £949,985 on 29 December 1992 and a further sum of £14,810 on 19 January 1993.  The money was credited to a client account. Over a period between 29 December 1992 and 31 March 1993 the money was disbursed in accordance with the instructions of    Yardley or one of his co-directors.  Three of the payments totalling £580,875 were applied in the acquisition of property at Stourbridge, Droitwich and Apperley Bridge.  The judge held that these payments were within the spirit if not the letter of the undertaking and his finding was upheld by the Court of Appeal.  It has not been challenged before us.  Three sums totalling £22,000 were retained by Mr Leach in payment of his conveyancing fees.  These were the subject of a claim in "knowing receipt".  Other sums totalling £357,720.11 were applied on                 Mr Yardley's instructions otherwise than in connection with the acquisition of property and in breach of paragraph 2 of the undertaking. These were the subject of a claim for "dishonest assistance."</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The judgments below
</i>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66. The judge found that the undertaking did not create a trust and accordingly dismissed the action.  As a result he did not need to make a specific finding of Mr Leach's state of mind in relation to the disbursements.  But in summarising his conclusions he stated that he had found that "he was not dishonest, but that he did deliberately shut his eyes to the implications of the undertaking".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;67. The Court of Appeal allowed Twinsectra's  appeal. They held that paragraphs 1 and 2 of the undertaking created a <i>Quistclose</i> trust or a trust analogous thereto (which they described as "an express purpose trust") and upheld a tracing claim for proprietary relief against             Mr Yardley's companies, which were in administration.  They reversed the judge's conclusion that Mr Leach had not been dishonest, holding that the judge's conclusions were consistent only with a finding of what they described as "Nelsonian dishonesty", and gave judgment against him for £379,720.11 and interest.</p>
<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Was there a Quistclose trust?</i></p><i>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;68. Money advanced by way of loan normally becomes the property of the borrower.  He is free to apply the money as he chooses, and save to the extent to which he may have taken security for repayment the lender takes the risk of the borrower's insolvency.  But it is well established that a loan to a borrower for a specific purpose where the borrower is not free to apply the money for any other purpose gives rise to fiduciary obligations on the part of the borrower which a court of equity will enforce. In the earlier cases the purpose was to enable the borrower to pay his creditors or some of them, but the principle is not limited to such cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;69. Such arrangements are commonly described as creating "a Quistclose trust", after the well-known decision of the House in <i>Quistclose Investments Ltd v Rolls Razor Ltd</i> [1970]  AC 567 in which Lord Wilberforce confirmed the validity of such arrangements and explained their legal consequences.  When the money is advanced, the lender acquires a right, enforceable in equity, to see that it is applied for the stated purpose, or more accurately to prevent its application for any other purpose.  This prevents the borrower from obtaining any beneficial interest in the money, at least while the designated purpose is still capable of being carried out.  Once the purpose has been carried out, the lender has his normal remedy in debt.  If for any reason the purpose cannot be carried out, the question arises whether the money falls within the general fund of the borrower's assets, in which case it passes to his trustee-in-bankruptcy in the event of his insolvency and the lender is merely a loan creditor; or whether it is held on a resulting trust for the lender.  This depends on the intention of the parties collected from the terms of the arrangement and the circumstances of the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70. In the present case Twinsectra contends that paragraphs 1 and 2 of the undertaking which Mr Sims signed on 24 December created a <i>Quistclose</i> trust.  Mr Leach denies this and advances a number of objections to the existence of a trust.  He says that Twinsectra lacked the necessary intention to create a trust, and relies on evidence that Twinsectra looked exclusively to Mr Sims' personal undertaking to repay the loan as its security for repayment.  He says that commercial life would be impossible if trusts were lightly inferred from slight material, and that it is not enough to agree that a loan is to be made for a particular purpose.  There must be something more, for example, a requirement that the money be paid into a segregated account, before it is appropriate to infer that a trust has been created.  In the present case the money was paid into Mr Sims' client account, but that is sufficiently explained by the fact that it was not Mr Sims' money but his client's; it provides no basis for an inference that the money was held in trust for anyone other than Mr Yardley.  Then it is said that a trust requires certainty of objects and this was lacking, for the stated purpose "to be applied in the purchase of property" is too uncertain to be enforced. Finally it is said that no trust in favour of Twinsectra could arise prior to the failure of the stated purpose, and this did not occur until the money was misapplied by Mr Yardley's companies.<i></i></p><i>
</i>
<i><p>Intention</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;71. The first two objections are soon disposed of. A settlor must, of course, possess the necessary intention to create a trust, but his subjective intentions are irrelevant.  If he enters into arrangements which have the effect of creating a trust, it is not necessary that he should appreciate that they do so; it is sufficient that he intends to enter into them.  Whether paragraphs 1 and 2 of the undertaking created a <i>Quistclose</i> trust turns on the true construction of those paragraphs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72.  The fact that Twinsectra relied for its security exclusively on   Mr Sims' personal liability to repay goes to Twinsectra's subjective intention and is not relevant to the construction of the undertaking, but it is in any case not inconsistent with the trust alleged.  Arrangements of this kind are not intended to provide security for repayment of the loan, but to prevent the money from being applied otherwise than in accordance with the lender's wishes.  If the money is properly applied the loan is unsecured.  This was true of all the decided cases, including the <i>Quistclose</i> case itself.</p>
<i><p>The effect of the undertaking</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73. A <i>Quistclose</i> trust does not necessarily arise merely because money is paid for a particular purpose.  A lender will often inquire into the purpose for which a loan is sought in order to decide whether he would be justified in making it.  He may be said to lend the money for the purpose in question, but this is not enough to create a trust; once lent the money is at the free disposal of the borrower.  Similarly payments in advance for goods or services are paid for a particular purpose, but such payments do not ordinarily create a trust.  The money is intended to be at the free disposal of the supplier and may be used as part of his cash-flow. Commercial life would be impossible if this were not the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74. The question in every case is whether the parties intended the money to be at the free disposal of the recipient: <i>In re Goldcorp Exchange Ltd</i> [1995]  1 AC 74, 100 per<i> </i>Lord Mustill.  His freedom to dispose of the money is necessarily excluded by an arrangement that the money shall be used <i>exclusively </i>for the stated purpose, for as Lord Wilberforce observed in the <i>Quistclose</i> case [1970] AC 567, 580:</p>
<p></p><ul>"A necessary consequence from this, by a process simply of interpretation, must be that if, for any reason, [the purpose could not be carried out,] the money was to be returned to [the lender]: the word 'only' or 'exclusively' can have no other meaning or effect."<p></p></ul>
<p>In the <i>Quistclose</i> case a public quoted company in financial difficulties had declared a final dividend.  Failure to pay the dividend, which had been approved by the shareholders, would cause a loss of confidence and almost certainly drive the company into liquidation. Accordingly the company arranged to borrow a sum of money "on condition that it is used to pay the forthcoming dividend".  The money was paid into a special account at the company's bank, with which the company had an overdraft.  The bank confirmed that the money</p>
<p></p><ul>"will only be used for the purpose of paying the dividend due on 24 July 1964".<p></p></ul>
<p>The House held that the circumstances were sufficient to create a trust of which the bank had notice, and that when the company went into liquidation without having paid the dividend the money was repayable to the lender.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75. In the present case paragraphs 1 and 2 of the undertaking are crystal clear. Mr Sims undertook that the money would be used <i>solely </i>for the acquisition of property <i>and for no other purpose; </i>and was to be retained by his firm until so applied. It would not be held by Mr Sims simply to Mr Yardley's order; and it would not be at Mr Yardley's free disposition.  Any payment by Mr Sims of the money, whether to          Mr Yardley or anyone else, otherwise than for the acquisition of property would constitute a breach of trust.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76. Mr Leach insisted that such a payment would, no doubt, constitute a breach of contract, but there was no reason to invoke equitable principles merely because Mr Sims was a solicitor.  But        Mr Sims' status as a solicitor has nothing to do with it. Equity's intervention is more principled than this.  It is unconscionable for a man to obtain money on terms as to its application and then disregard the terms on which he received it.  Such conduct goes beyond a mere breach of contract.  As North J explained in <i>Gibert v Gonard</i> (1884)  54 LJ Ch 439, 440:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is very well known law that if one person makes a payment to another for a certain purpose, and that person takes the money knowing that it is for that purpose, he must apply it to the purpose for which it was given.  He may decline to take it if he likes; but if he chooses to accept the money tendered for a particular purpose, it is his duty, and there is a legal obligation on him, to apply it for that purpose." <p></p></ul>
<p>The duty is not contractual but fiduciary.  It may exist despite the absence of any contract at all between the parties, as in <i>Rose v Rose</i> (1986)  7 NSWLR 679; and it binds third parties as in the <i>Quistclose</i> case itself.  The duty is fiduciary in character because a person who makes money available on terms that it is to be used for a particular purpose only and not for any other purpose thereby places his trust and confidence in the recipient to ensure that it is properly applied.  This is a classic situation in which a fiduciary relationship arises, and since it arises in respect of a specific fund it gives rise to a trust. </p>
<i><p>The nature of the trust</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77. The latter two objections cannot be so easily disposed of.  They call for an exploration of the true nature of the <i>Quistclose</i> trust, and in particular the location of the beneficial interest while the purpose is still capable of being carried out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78. This has been the subject of much academic debate. The starting point is provided by two passages in Lord Wilberforce's speech in the <i>Quistclose</i> case [1970] AC 567.  At p 580, he said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"That arrangements of this character for the payment of a person's creditors by a third person, give rise to a relationship of a fiduciary character or trust, in favour, as a primary trust, of the creditors, and secondarily, if the primary trust fails, of the third person, has been recognised in a series of cases over some 150 years."<p></p></ul>
<p>Later, at p 581, he said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"[W]hen the money is advanced, the lender acquires an equitable right to see that it is applied for the primary designated purpose (see <i>In re Rogers</i> [(1891)]  8 Morr 243 where both Lindley LJ and Kay LJ recognised this)."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79. These passages suggest that there are two successive trusts, a primary trust for payment to identifiable beneficiaries, such as creditors or shareholders, and a secondary trust in favour of the lender arising on the failure of the primary trust. But there are formidable difficulties in this analysis, which has little academic support. What if the primary trust is not for identifiable persons, but as in the present case to carry out an abstract purpose? Where in such a case is the beneficial interest pending the application of the money for the stated purpose or the failure of the purpose? There are four possibilities: (i) in the lender; (ii) in the borrower; (iii) in the contemplated beneficiary; or (iv) in suspense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80. (i).<i> The lender.  </i>In "The Quistclose Trust: Who Can Enforce It?" (1985)  101 LQR, 269, I argued that the beneficial interest remained throughout in the lender. This analysis has received considerable though not universal academic support: see for example Priestley J "The Romalpa Clause and the Quistclose Trust" in <i>Equity and Commercial Transactions, </i>ed Finn (1987) 217, 237; and Professor M Bridge "The Quistclose Trust in a World of Secured Transactions"<i> </i>(1992) 12 OJLS 333, 352; and others.  It was adopted by the New Zealand Court of Appeal in <i>General Communications Ltd v Development Finance Corporation of New Zealand Ltd</i>; [1990] 3 NZLR 406 and referred to with apparent approval by Gummow J in <i>In re Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust</i> (1991)  102 ALR 681.  Gummow J saw nothing special in the <i>Quistclose</i> trust, regarding it as essentially a security device to protect the lender against other creditors of the borrower pending the application of the money for the sated purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81. On this analysis, the <i>Quistclose</i> trust is a simple commercial arrangement akin (as Professor Bridge observes) to a retention of title clause (though with a different object) which enables the borrower to have recourse to the lender's money for a particular purpose without entrenching on the lender's property rights more than necessary to enable the purpose to be achieved.  The money remains the property of the lender unless and until it is applied in accordance with his directions, and insofar as it is not so applied it must be returned to him.  I am disposed, perhaps pre-disposed, to think that this is the only analysis which is consistent both with orthodox trust law and with commercial reality.  Before reaching a concluded view that it should be adopted, however, I must consider the alternatives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82. (ii). <i>The borrower</i>. It is plain that the beneficial interest is not vested unconditionally in the borrower so as to leave the money at his free disposal.  That would defeat the whole purpose of the arrangements, which is to prevent the money from passing to the borrower's trustee-in-bankruptcy in the event of his insolvency.  It would also be inconsistent with all the decided cases where the contest was between the lender and the borrower's trustee-in-bankruptcy, as well as with the <i>Quistclose</i> case itself: see in particular <i>Toovey v Milne</i> (1819)  2 B &amp; A 683; <i>In re Rogers, Ex p Holland and Hannen </i>(1891) 8 Morr 243 (supra)<i>.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83. The borrower's interest pending the application of the money for the stated purpose or its return to the lender is minimal.  He must keep the money separate; he cannot apply it except for the stated purpose; unless the terms of the loan otherwise provide he must return it to the lender if demanded; he cannot refuse to return it if the stated purpose cannot be achieved; and if he becomes bankrupt it does not vest in his trustee in bankruptcy.  If there is any content to beneficial ownership at all, the lender is the beneficial owner and the borrower is not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84. In the present case the Court of Appeal adopted a variant, locating the beneficial interest in the borrower but subject to restrictions. I shall have to return to this analysis later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85. (iii). <i>In the contemplated beneficiary.  </i>In the <i>Quistclose</i> case itself [1970] AC 567, as in all the reported cases which preceded it, either the primary purpose had been carried out and the contest was between the borrower's trustee-in bankruptcy or liquidator and the person or persons to whom the borrower had paid the money; or it was treated as having failed, and the contest was between the borrower's trustee-in-bankruptcy and the lender. It was not necessary to explore the position while the primary purpose was still capable of being carried out and Lord Wilberforce's observations must be read in that light.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86. The question whether the primary trust is accurately described as a trust for the creditors first arose in <i>In re Northern Developments Holdings Ltd </i>(unreported) 6 October 1978, where the contest was between the lender and the creditors.  The borrower, which was not in liquidation and made no claim to the money, was the parent company of a group one of whose subsidiaries was in financial difficulty.  There was a danger that if it were wound up or ceased trading it would bring down the whole group.  A consortium of the group's banks agreed to put up a fund of more than £500,000 in an attempt to rescue the subsidiary.  They paid the money into a special account in the name of the parent company for the express purpose of "providing money for the subsidiary's unsecured creditors over the ensuing weeks" and for no other purpose. The banks' object was to enable the subsidiary to continue trading, though on a reduced scale; it failed when the subsidiary was put into receivership at a time when some £350,000 remained unexpended. Relying on Lord Wilberforce's observations in the passages cited above, Sir Robert Megarry V-C held that the primary trust was a purpose trust enforceable (inter alios) by the subsidiaries' creditors as the persons for whose benefit the trust was created.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87. There are several difficulties with this analysis.  In the first place, Lord Wilberforce's reference to <i>In re Rogers</i> 8 Morr 243 makes it plain that the equitable right he had in mind was not a mandatory order to compel performance, but a negative injunction to restrain improper application of the money; for neither Lindley LJ nor Kay LJ recognised more than this.  In the second place, the object of the arrangements was to enable the subsidiary to continue trading, and this would necessarily involve it in incurring further liabilities to trade creditors.  Accordingly the application of the fund was not confined to existing creditors at the date when the fund was established.  The company secretary was given to understand that the purpose of the arrangements was to keep the subsidiary trading, and that the fund was "as good as share capital". Thus the purpose of the arrangements was not, as in other cases, to enable the debtor to avoid bankruptcy by paying off existing creditors, but to enable the debtor to continue trading by providing it with working capital with which to incur fresh liabilities.  There is a powerful argument for saying that the result of the arrangements was to vest a beneficial interest in the subsidiary from the start. If so, then this was not a <i>Quistclose</i> trust at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88. In the third place, it seems unlikely that the banks' object was to benefit the creditors (who included the Inland Revenue) except indirectly. The banks had their own commercial interests to protect by enabling the subsidiary to trade out of its difficulties. If so, then the primary trust cannot be supported as a valid non-charitable purpose trust: see <i>In re Grant's Will Trusts</i> [1980]  1 WLR 360 and cf <i>In re Denley's Trust Deed</i> [1969]  1 Ch 373.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89. The most serious objection to this approach is exemplified by the facts of the present case.  In several of the cases the primary trust was for an abstract purpose with no one but the lender to enforce performance or restrain misapplication of the money.  In <i>Edwards v Glyn</i> (1859)  2 E &amp; E the money was advanced to a bank to enable the bank to meet a run. In <i>In re EVTR, Gilbert v Barber</i> [1987]  BCLC 646 it was advanced "for the sole purpose of buying new equipment". In <i>General Communications Ltd v Development Finance Corporation of New Zealand Ltd</i> [1990]  3 NZLR 406 the money was paid to the borrower's solicitors for the express purpose of purchasing new equipment.  The present case is another example. It is simply not possible to hold money on trust to acquire unspecified property from an unspecified vendor at an unspecified time.  There is no reason to make an arbitrary distinction between money paid for an abstract purpose and money paid for a purpose which can be said to benefit an ascertained class of beneficiaries, and the cases rightly draw no such distinction. Any analysis of the <i>Quistclose</i> trust must be able to accommodate gifts and loans for an abstract purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90. (iv) <i>In suspense.  </i>As Peter Gibson J pointed out in <i>Carreras Rothmans Ltd v Freeman Matthews Treasure Ltd</i> [1985]  Ch 207, 223 the effect of adopting Sir Robert Megarry V-C's analysis is to leave the beneficial interest in suspense until the stated purpose is carried out or fails. The difficulty with this (apart from its unorthodoxy) is that it fails to have regard to the role which the resulting trust plays in equity's scheme of things, or to explain why the money is not simply held on a resulting trust for the lender.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91. Lord Browne-Wilkinson gave an authoritative explanation of the resulting trust in <i>Westdeutsche Landesbank Girpcentrale v Islington Borough Council</i> [1996]  AC 669, 708C and its basis has been further illuminated by Dr R Chambers in his book <i>Resulting Trusts</i> published in 1997.  Lord Browne-Wilkinson explained that a resulting trust arises in two sets of circumstances. He described the second as follows:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Where A transfers property to B<i> on express trusts</i>, but the trusts declared do not exhaust the whole beneficial interest."<p></p></ul>
<p>The <i>Quistclose</i> case [1970] AC 567 was among the cases he cited as examples. He rejected the argument that there was a resulting trust in the case before him because, unlike the situation in the present case, there was no transfer of money on express trusts. But he also rejected the argument on a wider and, in my respectful opinion, surer ground that the money was paid and received with the intention that it should become the absolute property of the recipient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92. The central thesis of Dr Chambers' book is that a resulting trust arises whenever there is a transfer of property in circumstances in which the transferor (or more accurately the person at whose expense the property was provided) did not intend to benefit the recipient. It responds to the absence of an intention on the part of the transferor to pass the entire beneficial interest, not to a positive intention to retain it. Insofar as the transfer does not exhaust the entire beneficial interest, the resulting trust is a default trust which fills the gap and leaves no room for any part to be in suspense. An analysis of the <i>Quistclose</i> trust as a resulting trust for the transferor with a mandate to the transferee to apply the money for the stated purpose sits comfortably with Dr Chambers' thesis, and it might be thought surprising that he does not adopt it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93. (v). <i>The Court of Appeal's analysis</i>. The Court of Appeal were content to treat the beneficial interest as in suspense, or (following       Dr Chambers' analysis) to hold that it was in the borrower, the lender having merely a contractual right enforceable by injunction to prevent misapplication.  Potter LJ put it in these terms [1999] Lloyd's Rep Bank 438 , 456, para 75:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The purpose imposed at the time of the advance creates an enforceable restriction on the borrower's use of the money.  Although the lender's right to enforce the restriction is treated as arising on the basis of a 'trust', the use of that word does not enlarge the lender's interest in the fund. The borrower is entitled to the beneficial use of the money, subject to the lender's right to prevent its misuse; the lender's limited interest in the fund is sufficient to prevent its use for other than the special purpose for which it was advanced."<p></p></ul>
<p>This analysis, with respect, is difficult to reconcile with the court's actual decision insofar as it granted Twinsectra a proprietary remedy against Mr Yardley's companies as recipients of the misapplied funds. Unless the money belonged to Twinsectra immediately before its misapplication, there is no basis on which a proprietary remedy against third party recipients can be justified.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94. Dr Chambers' "novel view" (as it has been described) is that the arrangements do not create a trust at all; the borrower receives the entire beneficial ownership in the money subject only to a contractual right in the lender to prevent the money being used otherwise than for the stated purpose. If the purpose fails, a resulting trust in the lender springs into being. In fact, he argues for a kind of restrictive covenant enforceable by negative injunction yet creating property rights in the money. But restrictive covenants, which began life as negative easements, are part of our land law. Contractual obligations do not run with money or a chose in action like money in a bank account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95. Dr Chambers' analysis has attracted academic comment, both favourable and unfavourable. For my own part, I do not think that it can survive the criticism levelled against it by Lusina Ho and P St J Smart: "Reinterpreting the Quistclose Trust: A Critique of Chambers' Analysis<i>"</i> (2001)  21 OJLS 267.  It provides no solution to cases of non-contractual payment; is inconsistent with Lord Wilberforce's description of the borrower's obligation as fiduciary and not merely contractual; fails to explain the evidential significance of a requirement that the money should be kept in a separate account; cannot easily be reconciled with the availability of proprietary remedies against third parties; and while the existence of a mere equity to prevent misapplication would be sufficient to prevent the money from being available for distribution to the creditors on the borrower's insolvency (because the trustee-in-bankruptcy has no greater rights than his bankrupt) it would not prevail over secured creditors.  If the bank in the <i>Quistclose</i> case [1970] AC 567 had held a floating charge (as it probably did) and had appointed a receiver, the adoption of Dr Chambers' analysis should have led to a different outcome.</p>
