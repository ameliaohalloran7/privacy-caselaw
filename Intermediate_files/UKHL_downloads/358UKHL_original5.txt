<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle expressed himself similarly in <i>Re L (a minor) </i>[1997] AC 16, when he said at page 25 that in the case of communications between solicitor and client "the privilege attaches to all communications whether related to litigation or not."  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is relevant also to inquire, since this doctrine is a judge-made development, what view other common law jurisdictions have taken of the nature of legal professional privilege.  One finds a similar approach in Australia and Canada.  In <i>Baker v Campbell </i>(1983) 153 CLR 52 in the High Court of Australia Wilson J stated at page 94 that the privilege is not limited to a rule of evidence confined to judicial and quasi-judicial proceedings.  This statement was followed in <i>Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation</i> (1999) 201 CLR 49, para 35, per Gleeson CJ and in <i>Daniels International Corporation Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission</i>, (2002) 192 ALR 561, para 44, per McHugh J, and para 85, per Kirby J.  In <i>Descoteaux v Mierzwinski </i>(1982) 141 DLR (3d) 590 in the Supreme Court of Canada Lamer J, giving the judgment of the court, defined at pages 604-5 the substantive rule of privilege, as distinct from the evidentiary rule applying in court proceedings, in terms which were clearly meant to encompass any circumstances in which a client consults a solicitor, irrespective of any existing or anticipated litigation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95.&nbsp;&nbsp;A statement of the rationale of legal privilege which is consistent with the approach in the cases which I have cited may be found in the European case-law in the opinion of Mr Advocate-General Sir Gordon  Slynn in <i>Case 155/79 A M &amp; S Europe Ltd v Commission </i>[1983] QB 878, 913:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Whether it is described as the right of the client or the duty of the lawyer, this principle has nothing to do with the protection or privilege of the lawyer. It springs essentially from the basic need of a man in a civilised society to be able to turn to his lawyer for advice and help, and if proceedings begin, for representation; it springs no less from the advantages to a society which evolves complex law reaching into all the business affairs of persons, real and legal, that they should be able to know what they can do under the law, what is forbidden, where they must tread circumspectly, where they run risks."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96.&nbsp;&nbsp;The branch of legal professional privilege which is classified under the name of litigation privilege had a later origin in three cases decided in the later part of the 19th century, which were discussed in detail by the Court of Appeal in <i>Three Rivers (No 5).  </i>The first was <i>Anderson v Bank of British Columbia </i>(1876) 2 Ch D 644, to which I have already referred briefly.  The management of the defendant bank, whose headquarters were in London, apprehended litigation concerning the conduct of an account in a branch in Portland, Oregon.  The London manager accordingly cabled the branch manager in Portland, requesting "fullest particulars" of the transactions in question.  The latter duly sent details by letter, which was discussed with the Bank's solicitor at a meeting of the board of directors in London.  In the ensuing litigation privilege was claimed for the letter, but refused by Jessel MR and the Court of Appeal.  As Bingham LJ observed in <i>Ventouris v Mountain </i>[1991] 1 WLR 607 at 612, on modern principles the Oregon manager's letter would be regarded as privileged as a letter written for the purpose of laying before a solicitor in order to obtain legal advice.  The importance of the case, however, lies not in the conclusion reached but in the statements of the law propounded by the judges who heard the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessel MR defined the extent of the rule at pages 649-50:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Now, as to the extent of the rule. It goes not merely to a communication made to the professional agent himself by the client directly, it goes to all communications made by the client to the solicitor through intermediate agents, and he is not bound to write letters through the post, or to go himself personally to see the solicitor; he may employ a third person to write the letter, or he may send the letters through a messenger, or he may give a verbal message to a messenger, and ask him to deliver it to the solicitor, with a view to his prosecuting his claim, or of substantiating his defence.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Again, the solicitor's acts must be protected for the use of the client. The solicitor requires further information, and says, I will obtain it from a third person. That is confidential. It is obtained by him as solicitor for the purpose of the litigation, and it must be protected upon the same ground, otherwise it would be dangerous, if not impossible, to employ a solicitor. You cannot ask him what the information he obtained was. It may be information simply for the purpose of knowing whether he ought to defend or prosecute the action, but it may be also obtained in the shape of collecting evidence for the purpose of such prosecution or defence. All that, therefore, is privileged."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Court of Appeal James LJ described the principle shortly at page 656 as being</p>
<p></p><ul>"that as you have no right to see your adversary's brief, you have no right to see that which comes into existence merely as the materials for the brief."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mellish LJ at page 658 said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"To be privileged it must come within one of two classes of privilege, namely, that a man is not bound to disclose confidential communications made between him and his solicitor, directly, or through an agent who is to communicate them to the solicitor; or, secondly, that he is not bound to communicate evidence which he has obtained for the purpose of litigation."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second case of this trilogy, <i>Southwark and Vauxhall Water Co v Quick </i>(1878) 3 QBD 315, documents prepared with the intention of laying them before the plaintiff company's solicitor in order to obtain his advice were held to be privileged.  I need not to go into the facts of the case, which I cite only for the statement of law by Brett LJ at page 320, which he deduced from the judgments in <i>Anderson v Bank of British Columbia</i>:</p>
<p></p><ul>" … it is clear that if a party seeks to inspect a document which comes into existence merely as the materials for the brief, or that which is equivalent to the brief, then the document cannot be seen, for it is privileged. It has been urged that the materials, or the information obtained for the brief, should have been obtained 'at the instance' or 'at the request' of the solicitor; but I think it is enough if they come into existence merely as the materials for the brief, and I think that phrase may be enlarged into 'merely for the purpose of being laid before the solicitor for his advice or for his consideration'". <p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the third case, <i>Wheeler v Le Marchant </i>(1881) 17 Ch D 675 the defendants sought privilege for reports obtained by their solicitors from estate agents/surveyors in the course of previous administration proceedings unconnected with the instant action brought by the plaintiff for specific performance of an agreement.  The Court of Appeal, reversing the order of Bacon V-C, held that the documents were not privileged.  Jessel MR at pages 680-1 discussed the limits of the privilege granted to documents obtained by a solicitor from third parties for the purposes of existing or anticipated litigation:</p>
<p></p><ul>"What they contended for was that documents communicated to the solicitors of the Defendants by third parties, though not communicated by such third parties as agents of the clients seeking advice, should be protected, because those documents contained information required or asked for by the solicitors, for the purpose of enabling them the better to advise the clients. The cases, no doubt, establish that such documents are protected where they have come into existence after litigation commenced or in contemplation, and when they have been made with a view to such litigation, either for the purpose of obtaining advice as to such litigation, or of obtaining evidence to be used in such litigation, or of obtaining information which might lead to the obtaining of such evidence, but it has never hitherto been decided that documents are protected merely because they are produced by a third person in answer to an inquiry made by the solicitor."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At page 682 he described the rule as being "established and maintained solely for the purpose of enabling a man to obtain legal advice with safety."  Brett and Cotton LJJ expressed the rule in similar terms, Cotton LJ stating at pages 684-5:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Hitherto such communications have only been protected when they have been in contemplation of some litigation, or for the purpose of giving advice or obtaining evidence with reference to it. And that is reasonable, because then the solicitor is preparing for the defence or for bringing the action, and all communications he makes for that purpose, and the communications made to him for the purpose of giving him the information, are, in fact, the brief in the action, and ought to be protected. But here we are asked to extend the principle to a very different class of cases, and it is not necessary, in order to enable persons freely to communicate with their solicitors and obtain their legal advice, that any privilege should be extended to communications such as these."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100.&nbsp;&nbsp;The limits of this litigation privilege were defined by your Lordships' House in relatively recent times in <i>Waugh v British Railways Board </i>[1980] AC 521.  The appeal concerned a report made very shortly after a railway accident, based on a joint internal enquiry conducted by the board's personnel.  The report was prepared, in Lord Wilberforce's words,</p>
<p></p><ul>"for a dual purpose: for what may be called railway operation and safety purposes and for the purpose of obtaining legal advice in anticipation of litigation."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House rejected the claim for privilege, holding that it extended to such documents only if the latter purpose was the dominant one.  It was made clear in the speeches given by their Lordships that the context was purely that of what is now termed litigation privilege, not legal advice privilege.  So Lord Edmund-Davies said at page 542 that litigation, apprehended or actual, was the hallmark of this privilege, and that preparation with a view to litigation was the essential purpose which protects a communication from disclosure in such cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101.&nbsp;&nbsp;An exception to the availability of litigation privilege appears in the decision of your Lordships' House in <i>Re L (a minor) </i>[1997] AC 16.  The majority held that a party could not rely upon it in proceedings which were not adversarial.  The jurisdiction concerned in that case was care proceedings under Part IV of the Children Act 1989.  Such proceedings, as Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle stated at page 27,</p>
<p></p><ul>"are so far removed from normal actions that litigation privilege has no place in relation to reports obtained by a party thereto which could not have been prepared without the leave of the court to disclose documents already filed or to examine the child." <p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102.&nbsp;&nbsp;The conclusion to be drawn from the trilogy of 19th century cases to which I have referred and the qualifications expressed in the modern case-law is that communications between parties or their solicitors and third parties for the purpose of obtaining information or advice in connection with existing or contemplated litigation are privileged, but only when the following conditions are satisfied:</p>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;litigation must be in progress or in contemplation;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;the communications must have been made for the sole or dominant purpose of conducting that litigation;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;the litigation must be adversarial, not investigative or inquisitorial.<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sumption relied on the cases which I have cited as a foundation for his submission that no fundamental distinction should be drawn between communications in connection with litigation and others.  He submitted that Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead was correct in his statement in <i>Re L (a minor) </i>[1997] AC 16 at 33 when he described the two sub-headings of legal advice privilege and litigation privilege as integral parts of a single privilege.  The only area in which the distinction became relevant was that of third party communications.  Mr Pollock quoted, however, a passage to the opposite effect from the 16th Report of the Law Reform Committee, produced in 1967.  In discussing what in present terminology is legal advice privilege, the Committee stated at paragraph 18:</p>
<p></p><ul>"This privilege, which is generally referred to as legal professional privilege, extends to all communications between the client or his agents and the client's legal advisers made for the purpose of obtaining legal advice other than communications made for the purpose of obtaining advice to enable the client to commit a crime or a fraud.  It differs from the other two kinds of privilege in aid of litigation in that it is not necessary to show that, at the time the advice was sought, any litigation was contemplated by the client in respect of the subject-matter of the advice.  For this reason, the privilege might also be classified as a privilege in protection of a confidential relationship.  Nevertheless, we think that its true rationale is as a privilege in aid of litigation."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It went on to say in paragraph 19, in a passage relied upon by the Court of Appeal in paragraph 25 of its judgment in the present appeal:</p>
<p></p><ul>"What distinguishes legal advice from other kinds of professional advice is that it is concerned exclusively with rights and liabilities enforceable in law, i.e. in the ultimate resort by litigation in the courts or in some administrative tribunal. It is, of course, true that on many matters on which a client consults his solicitor he does not expect litigation and certainly hopes that it will not occur; but there would be no need for him to consult his solicitor to obtain <i>legal</i> advice unless there were <i>some</i> risk of litigation in the future in connection with the matter upon which advice is sought. As Lord Brougham pointed out, it is to minimise that risk by ensuring that he so conducts his affairs as to make it reasonably certain that he would succeed in any litigation which might be brought in connection with them, that the client consults his solicitor at all."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104.&nbsp;&nbsp;In so stating the Committee does not appear to have meant merely that the operation of legal professional privilege is restricted to occasions when a party wishes to resist production of documents in litigation in a court of law, for it is apparent from cases such as <i>Parry-Jones v The Law Society </i>[1969] 1 Ch 1 and <i>R (on the application of Morgan Grenfell &amp; Co Ltd) v Special Commissioner of Income Tax </i>[2003] 1 AC 563 that it may operate in other situations.  The approach of the Committee may owe something to the reasoning of the Court of Appeal in <i>Parry-Jones v The Law Society, </i>to which it bears some similarity.  In their judgments in that case Lord Denning MR and Diplock LJ (who was a member of the Law Reform Committee) confined the definition of legal professional privilege to the principle whereby a party can resist production of documents in a court of law.  They classified what is now termed legal advice privilege as a confidence which is created by an implied term in the contract between solicitor and client.  This restriction of the ambit of legal professional privilege was, however, rejected by Lord Hoffmann, with whom the other members of the House agreed, in the <i>Morgan Grenfell </i>case, when he said at paragraph 30:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is not the case that LPP does no more than entitle the client to require his lawyer to withhold privileged documents in judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings, leaving the question of whether he may disclose them on other occasions to the implied duty of confidence.  The policy of LPP requires that the client should be secure in the knowledge that protected documents and information will not be disclosed at all."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all respect to the eminence of the jurists who comprised the membership of the Law Reform Committee, accordingly, I think that paragraph 18 of its Report would require to be rephrased in the light of modern case-law and the correctness of the statements in paragraph 19 requires consideration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sumption submitted, in my opinion correctly, that the cases establish that, so far from legal advice privilege being an outgrowth and extension of litigation privilege, legal professional privilege is a single integral privilege, whose sub-heads are legal advice privilege and litigation privilege, and that it is litigation privilege which is restricted to proceedings in a court of law in the manner which the authorities show.  The conclusions which the Court of Appeal sought in paragraph 25 of its judgment to draw from the authorities cited by it do not appear to me to be well founded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal also expressed some doubts in paragraph 39 of its judgment about the justification for legal advice privilege. The Law Society at paragraph 18 of its helpful written case stated:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In the course of giving instructions to draw a will, confidential information may be given about matrimonial or financial difficulties; about anticipated inheritance; about the parentage or adoption of children; about the perceived unsuitability of a former spouse to act as guardian; about the physical or mental health of the testator or spouse or other family member; about pensions, or businesses, or other assets.  If a testator is to be free to supply the frank and full information necessary for the drafting of a will, he must be sure that what he says will remain confidential even though litigation is not 'anticipated'".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to family matters it stated at note 36:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Family lawyers similarly receive a great deal of sensitive information, not only about businesses and assets, but also about family behaviour.  Particularly while taking initial instructions, when litigation may well not be 'anticipated', this information can be very wide.  To learn that some or all of this information might not be privileged would not only worry clients but also might lead to a failure to disclose."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One can add to these observations the experience of lawyers who have advised on taxation matters.  This applies in particular to inheritance tax planning, where the focus is on the disposition of assets and litigation is not in prospect.  It is essential that the legal adviser has a complete picture of financial matters, some of which may be highly confidential, especially when dealing with family businesses.  Many clients seeking such advice would be very dismayed to think that the information they have made available to their lawyers might not remain confidential.  In my view there is substantial force in the Law Society's submissions, and a well founded case has been made out for the retention of legal advice privilege in its present form</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sumption then relied on the proposition which I have accepted concerning the basis of legal professional privilege as a foundation for his argument on the main issue to be decided, which is the ambit of the term "legal advice" in legal advice privilege.  His contention was that the content of legal advice qualifying for the protection of privilege was the same in respect of both legal advice privilege and litigation privilege and that the creation of a special head for litigation privilege would conflict both with principle and with the authorities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some statements about the ambit of the privilege may be garnered from the earlier authorities.  In the passage which I have quoted from <i>Greenough v Gaskell </i>(1833) 1 My &amp; K 98 Lord Brougham LC referred at page 102 to "matters that come within the ordinary scope of professional employment" and in <i>Carpmael v Powis </i>(1846) 1 Ph 687 at 692<i> </i>Lord Lyndhurst LC used the same phrase and defined it further as "a transaction in which solicitors are ordinarily employed by their client".  In <i>Herring v Clobery </i>(1842) 1 Ph 91<i> </i>Lord Lyndhurst referred at page 96 to "professional business", while in <i>Pearse v Pearse </i>(1846) 1 De G &amp; Sm 12 at 26 Knight Bruce V-C uses the phrase "communications made in confidence professionally".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ambit of the privilege was examined in more depth in the Court of Appeal and your Lordships' House in <i>Minter v Priest</i>  [1929] 1 KB 655; [1930] AC 558.  One of the issues was whether conversations between a solicitor and his client relating to the business of obtaining a loan for the deposit on the purchase of real estate were privileged from disclosure.  The Court of Appeal held that they were privileged.  In the course of his judgment Lawrence LJ referred at pages 675 and 678 to "the ordinary scope" of a solicitor's business or duties, while Greer LJ at page 684 used the phrase "ordinary scope of a solicitor's employment".  This House allowed the plaintiff's appeal, on the ground that the defendant was not acting as a solicitor at the relevant time because he was not undertaking the duty of a solicitor on the proposal made to him but had made a proposal involving "a malicious scheme" (per Lord Buckmaster at p 569) to keep the plaintiff out of the transaction, with a view to making a profit from it himself.  The House defined the ambit of the privilege, however, in essentially the same terms as the Court of Appeal.  Lord Buckmaster referred at page 568 to "the ordinary scope of a solicitor's business".  Lord Atkin at page 580 spoke of professional communications for the purpose of getting legal advice, but his explanation at page 581 of what is covered by legal advice appears wider than that adopted by the Court of Appeal in the present case:</p>
<p></p><ul>"If therefore the phrase is expanded to professional communications passing for the purpose of getting or giving professional advice, and it is understood that the profession is the legal profession, the nature of the protection is I think correctly defined."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At pages 584-5 he was more specific, expressing the opinion that:</p>
<p></p><ul>"If a person goes to a professional legal adviser for the purpose of seeing whether the professional person will give him professional advice, communications made for the purpose of indicating the advice required will be protected.  And included in such communications will be those made on occasions such as the present where the parties go to a solicitor for the purpose of seeing whether he will either himself advance or procure some third person to advance a sum of money to carry out the purchase of real property.  Such business is professional business, and communications made for its purpose appear to me to be covered by the protection, whether the solicitor eventually accedes to the request or not."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110.&nbsp;&nbsp;Other decided cases are reviewed by Taylor LJ in <i>Balabel v Air India </i>[1988] Ch 317, but it is always necessary to take account of the context in which such statements were made, for the ambit of legal advice may not have been in issue.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111.&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue in <i>Balabel v Air India </i>was whether the plaintiffs, who had sued the defendant airline for specific performance of an agreement for an underlease, could obtain discovery of various documents generated by the airline and its solicitors relating to the proposed underlease.  After examining the authorities in detail, Taylor LJ said at page 330:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Although originally confined to advice regarding litigation, the privilege was extended to non-litigious business. Nevertheless, despite that extension, the purpose and scope of the privilege is still to enable legal advice to be sought and given in confidence. In my judgment, therefore, the test is whether the communication or other document was made confidentially for the purposes of legal advice. Those purposes have to be construed broadly. Privilege obviously attaches to a document conveying legal advice from solicitor to client and to a specific request from the client for such advice. But it does not follow that all other communications between them lack privilege. In most solicitor and client relationships, especially where a transaction involves protracted dealings, advice may be required or appropriate on matters great or small at various stages. There will be a continuum of communication and meetings between the solicitor and client. … Where information is passed by the solicitor or client to the other as part of the continuum aimed at keeping both informed so that advice may be sought and given as required, privilege will attach. A letter from the client containing information may end with such words as 'please advise me what I should do'. But, even if it does not, there will usually be implied in the relationship an overall expectation that the solicitor will at each stage, whether asked specifically or not, tender appropriate advice. Moreover, legal advice is not confined to telling the client the law; it must include advice as to what should prudently and sensibly be done in the relevant legal context."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a later passage at pages 331-2 relied upon by the Court of Appeal as support for its conclusions Taylor LJ stated:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It follows from this analysis that those dicta in the decided cases which appear to extend privilege without limit to all solicitor and client communications upon matters within the ordinary business of a solicitor and referable to that relationship are too wide. It may be that the broad terms used in the earlier cases reflect the restricted range of solicitors' activities at the time. Their role then would have been confined for the most part to that of lawyer and would not have extended to business adviser or man of affairs. To speak therefore of matters 'within the ordinary business of a solicitor' would in practice usually have meant the giving of advice and assistance of a specifically legal nature. But the range of assistance given by solicitors to their clients and of activities carried out on their behalf has greatly broadened in recent times and is still developing. Hence the need to re-examine the scope of legal professional privilege and keep it within justifiable bounds."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the view expressed by Colman J in <i>Nederlandse Reassurantie Groep Holding NV v Bacon &amp; Woodrow Holding </i>[1995] 1 All ER 976 at 982 that the statement of the law in <i>Balabel v Air India </i>does not disturb or modify the principle affirmed in <i>Minter v Priest</i>, that all communications between a solicitor and his client relating to a transaction in which the solicitor has been instructed for the purpose of obtaining legal advice will be privileged, notwithstanding that they do not contain advice on matters of law or construction, provided that they are directly related to the performance by the solicitor of his professional duty as legal adviser of his client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112.&nbsp;&nbsp;There must, as Taylor LJ said, be limits to the scope of privilege, but in my opinion the Court of Appeal has set them too tightly in concluding that it is confined to advice relating to the legal rights and obligations of the client.  It has, I think, been too restrictive in its view, perhaps because of the doubts expressed by the Master of the Rolls about the justification for legal advice privilege.  It is of course important not to permit a party to withhold production of information which may be of significant importance when the court is reaching its decision.  As Bingham LJ put it in <i>Ventouris v Mountain </i>[1991] 1 WLR 607 at 612:</p>
<p></p><ul>" … disclosure being generally regarded as beneficial, any exception has to be justified as serving the public interest which gives rise to the exception."<p></p></ul>
