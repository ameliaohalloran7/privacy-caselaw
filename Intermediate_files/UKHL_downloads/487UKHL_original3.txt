<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60. For all these reasons I agree with the interpretation of sub-clause 2(iii)(a) favoured by the Court of Appeal.  I would therefore dismiss the cross-appeal.  In that situation it is necessary to consider the council's appeal against the Court of Appeal's declaration that it was unreasonable of them to refuse consent to the respondents' application to assign the lease to Mountstar.</p>
<i><p><i>Did the Council Withhold Consent Unreasonably?</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;61. The covenant in clause 2(viii), providing that the demised land is not to be assigned without the previous consent of the council, "such consent not to be unreasonably withheld in the case of a respectable and responsible assignee", is of a familiar kind.  Its purpose is well settled.  In <i>Bates v Donaldson</i> [1896]  2 QB 241  A L Smith LJ rejected any suggestion that a similar clause had been inserted so as to allow the landlord to regain possession of the premises before the expiry of the lease.  He went on, at p 247:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It was in my judgment inserted alio intuitu altogether, and in order to protect the lessor from having his premises used or occupied in an undesirable way or by an undesirable tenant or assignee…".<p></p></ul>
<p>The clause must be interpreted and applied so as to give effect to this purpose.  It is equally well settled that, under such a clause, </p>
<p></p><ul>"a landlord is not entitled to refuse his consent to an assignment on grounds which have nothing whatever to do with the relationship of landlord and tenant in regard to the subject matter of the lease" (<i>International Drilling Fluids Ltd v Louisville Investments (Uxbridge) Ltd</i> [1986]  Ch 513, 520 per Balcombe LJ).<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;62. Here the council's refusal of consent relates to the likely use of the premises for a purpose which they consider to be in breach of the non-user covenant in sub-clause 2(iii)(a).  The respondents contend that, even so, consent is "unreasonably withheld" in terms of the clause if it is withheld simply because the prospective assignee is likely to wish to use the premises for a purpose that the landlord considers would be in breach of one of the terms of the lease.  Mr Lewison outlined the situation in the present case in this way.  Mountstar considered that sub-clause 2(iii)(a) did not restrict the use of the premises.  If Mountstar were right on that point, then the council accepted that they would have to give consent to the assignment.  But even if Mountstar were wrong on that point, there would be an issue as to whether the proposed use was indeed in contravention of the restriction in sub-clause (iii)(a).  Finally, if the proposed use did indeed fall foul of the restriction, then an application might be made to the Lands Tribunal to vary the terms of the covenant.  All these were legitimate points for Mountstar to take and there was no question of them acting unlawfully in breach of the covenant.  In that situation it was unreasonable for the council to withhold consent to the proposed assignment to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;63. While counsel was, rightly, at pains to place the legal issue within the proper factual context, the respondents' submission does not depend on the facts of the case.  Their fundamental contention is that, as a matter of law, the words "unreasonably withheld" in the sub-clause must be interpreted as meaning that the council <i>cannot </i>withhold consent simply on the ground that the prospective assignee is unwilling to comply with the terms of the lease.  So, even if it appeared likely that the prospective assignee would actually breach the terms of the lease, it would nevertheless be unreasonable for the landlord to withhold consent.  It was by persuading the court to apply this reasoning that the respondents secured victory in the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;64. Uninstructed by the case law on this matter, I confess that I should have found the respondents' proposition startling.  It derives support, however, from the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Killick v Second Covent Garden Property Co Ltd</i> [1973]  1 WLR 658.  The case involved a lease of premises in the City of London.  The lease contained a user covenant preventing the premises being used</p>
<p></p><ul>"for any other purpose than the trade or business of a printer nor have or permit any sale by auction in or upon the demised premises or any part thereof without [the landlords'] written consent which shall not be unreasonably withheld".<p></p></ul>
<p>The underlessee had indeed used the premises for their trade or business as printers but, as Stamp LJ observed, at p 661 A:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is common ground that, owing to the situation of the premises in the City and for reasons which I need not specify, that trade or business can no longer  be profitably carried on there."<p></p></ul>
<p>In the circumstances the lessee and sublessee applied for the landlord's consent to assign their leases to Primaplex, a company who were not printers and who proposed to apply for planning permission to use the premises as offices and to do the necessary works to convert them for that purpose.  The landlords did not give the necessary consent and the lessee and underlessee applied for a declaration that the landlords had unreasonably withheld their consent to the assignments.  The judge at the Mayor's and City of London Court made the declaration and the Court of Appeal refused the landlords' appeal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;65. Stamp LJ records that the ground on which the landlords sought to justify their refusal of consent as not being unreasonable was "simply that it will be a necessary consequence that there will be a breach of the user covenant".  In advancing that view the landlords interpreted the covenant as absolute while the other parties argued that it was qualified.  The critical passage in the judgment of Stamp LJ then follows, at p 661 D - F:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Mr. Priday, on behalf of the landlords, submitted that a landlord may reasonably refuse consent to an assignment if the assignment would necessarily involve a breach of covenant, and I will accept that submission as being well founded.  But whatever view one takes as to the construction of the user covenant, I cannot accept that, if the landlords did consent to the proposed assignments, there would as a necessary consequence be a breach of the user covenant.  As a result of the assignments Primaplex would step into the shoes of the lessee and underlessee and would thereupon become subject to the user covenant.  The landlords would be in the same position, neither better nor worse, to enforce the user covenant as would be the case if the present underlessee was itself proposing to seek planning permission for use of the premises as offices and proposed so to use them.  On that short ground I would hold that the landlords' withholding of consent is unreasonable."<p></p></ul>
<p>In the present case Chadwick LJ, with whom Waller LJ agreed, considered that the Court of Appeal was bound by the decision in <i>Killick</i> and on that basis they allowed the respondents' appeal and made the third declaration.  Chadwick LJ put the matter in this way, at pp 23 - 24:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In my view the decision in the <i>Killick</i> case precludes this court from holding that the belief of the landlord, however reasonable, that the proposed assignee intends to use the demised premises for a purpose which would give rise to a breach of a user covenant is, of itself, a ground for withholding consent to assignment.  Provided that, when giving consent to the assignment, the landlord does not disable himself, necessarily and inevitably (by waiver, estoppel, or otherwise), from continuing to insist on due observance of the user covenant by the assignee, he is in no worse a position, following assignment, than he would have been if the assignor had himself proposed to use the demised premises for that purpose.  This is not a case in which the giving of consent (coupled, if the Council thinks fit, with notice to Mountstar that it intends to enforce the restrictions as to user contained in sub-clause 2(iii)(a) of the 1969 lease) will disable the Council from continuing to insist on due observance of those restrictions.  It is not inevitable that, following assignment, there will be a breach of the user restrictions.  Mountstar may succeed in its present contention that the use proposed by its planning application is within Use Class IV of the 1963 discharge or modification of the restriction - see section 84(12) of the Law of Property Act 1925.  The Council is not entitled, by refusing consent, to compel the appellant to accept its interpretation of the user covenant.  Nor is it entitled, as it seems to me, to refuse consent to assignment on the grounds that the proposed assignee may wish to exercise the rights which the law allows to a tenant under this lease."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66. As one part of his argument Mr Pymont submitted that too much had been read into the passage in the judgment of Stamp LJ in <i>Killick</i>.  As he pointed out, it appears that, perhaps because of the particular circumstances to which Stamp LJ alluded, counsel for the landlords had chosen to pitch his submission at the highest level:  he had contended that a breach of the user covenant would be "a necessary consequence" of an assignment to Primaplex.  All that the Court of Appeal decided was that, on the facts, a breach of the covenant was not a necessary consequence and, for that reason, they rejected the landlords' submission.  While that is indeed a possible interpretation of the case, it is plain, not least from the decision in the Court of Appeal in the present case, that <i>Killick</i> has been treated as laying down law which has to be applied in interpreting covenants of this kind.  In the course of a somewhat chequered career the decision has even won the accolade of being "the refuge of the desperate" (J. Gaunt, "Principle and Pretext:  The rules governing landlords' consent" (1987) 284 EG 1371).  But that is only an additional reason why, when the point has been fully argued, the House should consider the principle that it has been thought to enshrine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;67. The test of reasonableness is to be found in many areas of the law and the concept has been found useful precisely because it prevents the law becoming unduly rigid. In effect, it allows the law to respond appropriately to different situations as they arise.  This has to be remembered when a court is considering whether a landlord has "unreasonably withheld" consent to the assignment of a lease.  In this context I would follow Viscount Dunedin's advice in <i>Viscount Tredegar v Harwood</i> [1929]  AC 72 at p 78 that one "should read reasonableness in the general sense".  I have derived the greatest assistance, however, from the comments of Lord Denning MR in a passage in <i>Bickel v Duke of Westminster</i> [1977]  QB 517.  The Grosvenor Belgravia Estate had refused to consent to the assignment of the head lease of a house in Burton Mews off Chester Square to a lady who, if she had become tenant under the head lease and had remained so for five years, would have been entitled to buy the freehold from the Estate.  Having referred to a number of earlier cases, Lord Denning said this, at p 524 C - G:</p>
<p></p><ul>"If those cases can properly be regarded as laying down propositions of law, I would agree that we ought to hold the landlords' refusal to be unreasonable.  But I do not think they do lay down any propositions of law, and for this reason.  The words of the contract are perfectly clear English words:  'such licence shall not be unreasonably withheld.'  When those words come to be applied in any particular case, I do not think the court can, or should, determine by strict rules the grounds on which a landlord may, or may not, reasonably refuse his consent.  He is not limited by the contract to any particular grounds.  Nor should the courts limit him.  Not even under the guise of construing the words.  The landlord has to exercise his judgment in all sorts of circumstances.  It is impossible for him, or for the courts, to envisage them all.  When this lease was granted in 1947 no one could have foreseen that 20 years later Parliament would give a tenant a right to buy up the freehold.  Seeing that the circumstances are infinitely various, it is impossible to formulate strict rules as to how a landlord should exercise his power of refusal.  The utmost that the courts can do is to give guidance to those who have to consider the problem.  As one decision follows another, people will get to know the likely result in any given set of circumstances.  But no one decision will be a binding precedent as a strict rule of law.  The reasons given by the judges are to be treated as propositions of good sense - in relation to the particular case - rather than propositions of law applicable to all cases.  It is rather like the cases where a statute gives the court a discretion.  It has always been held that this discretion is not to be fettered by strict rules:  and that all that can be properly done is to indicate the chief considerations which help to arrive at a just conclusion:  see <i>Blunt v Blunt</i> [1943]  AC 517; <i>Ward v James</i> [1966]  1 QB 273."<p></p></ul>
<p>That statement of the general approach to be taken was endorsed by Roskill and Lawton LJJ, with whom Megaw LJ concurred, in <i>West Layton Ltd v Ford </i> [1979]  QB 593, at p 604 H, 606C-D.  I would respectfully adopt it.  In <i>International Drilling Ltd v Louisville Investments </i>[1986] Ch 513 Balcombe LJ distilled a number of propositions from the earlier authorities on covenants of this kind but then, under reference to <i>Bickel</i> and <i>West Layton</i>, added, at p 521D:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Subject to the propositions set out above, it is in each case a question of fact, depending upon all the circumstances, whether the landlord's consent to an assignment is being unreasonably withheld…."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;68. Approaching the matter in this way, I am satisfied that it cannot be said, as a matter of law, that the belief of a landlord, however reasonable, that the proposed assignee intends to use the demised premises for a purpose which would give rise to a breach of a user covenant cannot, of itself, be a reasonable ground for withholding consent to the assignment.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;69. I accept that, as Mr Lewison stressed, in proceedings such as the present the court is not concerned with whether or not the terms of the contract are reasonable as between the parties.  The court is  concerned only with the assignment and with whether or not it is reasonable for the landlord to withhold consent to that assignment.  But in determining that matter, as <i>Bickel </i>shows, the correct approach is to consider what the reasonable landlord would do when asked to consent in the particular circumstances.  The rule of law derived from <i>Killick</i> introduces a rigidity which makes it impossible to apply that approach.  It should, for that very reason, be rejected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70. Indeed the reasoning in <i>Killick</i> requires the landlord to proceed in a way in which, it appears to me, no reasonable landlord would actually proceed.  It is accepted, by analogy with the position where a landlord is asked to consent to a sublease, that a landlord may act reasonably if he refuses consent where the assignment of the lease will necessarily result in a breach of a user covenant: <i>Packaging Centre Ltd v Poland Street Estate Ltd</i> (1961) 178 EG 189 and <i>Granada TV Network Ltd v Great Universal Stores Ltd</i> (1963) 187 EG 391;<i>Killick</i> [1973] 1 WLR 658, at pp 661G-662A.  And one can easily see that a reasonable landlord faced with such a prospect could well decide to withhold consent.  But one can equally easily see that a reasonable landlord, faced with the prospect that the assignment of the lease is likely to result in a breach of a user covenant, could well reach precisely the same decision.  After all, a landlord considering whether to accept a tenant in the first place would almost certainly reject a person who would probably, even if not necessarily, use the premises in breach of a covenant in the lease.  His decision to do so would be both rational and reasonable.  In my view it may be equally rational and reasonable for a landlord to withhold consent to an assignment to a prospective assignee who will probably, even though not necessarily, breach the covenant.  In deciding whether to withhold consent to an assignment reasonable landlords need not confine their consideration to what will necessarily happen;  like everyone else taking an important decision, they may have regard to what will probably happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;71. The central plank in the reasoning of the court in <i>Killick</i> seems to be that it would be unreasonable for the landlord to withhold consent because the assignment does not change the legal relationship between the landlord and the tenant.  So the landlord would have exactly the same powers to prevent a breach of covenant by the assignee as by the existing tenant.  The landlord would therefore be in the same position, neither better nor worse, to enforce the user covenant.  As an analysis of the landlord's legal position that is undoubtedly correct.  But the reality is that a reasonable landlord could well look at the matter more broadly and see that his position would be significantly altered by the assignment.  It is one thing to have a tenant who complies with the user covenant in the lease and against whom there is no need to take steps to enforce the covenant.  It is quite another to have a new tenant who does not comply with, or who challenges the interpretation of, the user covenant and against whom the landlord might need to take steps to enforce it or to contest the tenant's interpretation, with all the inconvenience and potential cost involved.  It is also a different thing to have a new tenant who intends to apply to the Lands Tribunal under section 84 of the Law of Property Act 1925 to discharge or modify the user covenant.  Again the landlord would face the prospect of becoming embroiled in legal proceedings.  If they occurred, all or any of these matters would make a huge practical difference to the landlord.  So the prospect that one or other of them will probably happen is one which a reasonable landlord must be entitled at least to take into account when asked to consent to the assignment of a lease.  It is therefore in my view wholly unrealistic to suggest, as <i>Killick</i> does, that no reasonable landlord, faced with the probability of real changes of these kinds, would withhold consent to an assignment simply because, technically, his legal position and his legal remedies would remain the same.  I accordingly reject the central strand of the reasoning on which the decision in <i>Killick</i> depends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72. Mr Lewison submitted that, if the council were permitted to withhold consent in a case like the present, they would in effect have the power to impose their interpretation of the user covenant and the tenant would have no real interest to pursue the matter.  So far as the tenant's interest is concerned, the history of the present proceedings, where the respondents have pursued a point of interpretation all the way to this House, would seem in itself to show that the argument cannot be pressed too far.  For the rest, it is simply not the case that the landlord would have power to impose his particular interpretation of a user covenant.  On the contrary, a tenant who is faced with a refusal of consent based on a particular interpretation may always apply to the county court for a declaration as to the proper interpretation.  If the ruling shows that the landlord's interpretation is wrong, then it would plainly be unreasonable for the landlord to continue to withhold consent on that basis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73. For these reasons I would reject the supposed rule of law that the Court of Appeal derived from <i>Killick</i>.  In so far as <i>Killick</i> is thought to lay down any such rule, it should be overruled.  Since the decision of the Court of Appeal to make the third declaration was based solely on an application of <i>Killick</i>, it follows that the council's appeal against that part of the court's order must be allowed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74. It is important not to exaggerate the effect of overruling <i>Killick</i>.  In particular, it does not establish any contrary rule of law that it will always be reasonable for a landlord to withhold consent to an assignment simply on the ground that the proposed assignee intends to use the premises for a purpose which would give rise to a breach of a user covenant.  While that will usually be a reasonable ground for withholding consent, there may be circumstances where refusal of consent on this ground alone would be unreasonable.  As Lord Denning stressed, it will depend on the circumstances of the particular case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75. I would add this.  In the course of his submissions Mr Lewison referred to the Landlord and Tenant 1988 and in particular to section 1(3) and (6)(c):</p>
<p></p><ul>"(3)  Where there is served on the person who may consent to a proposed transaction a written application by the tenant for consent to the transaction, he owes a duty to the tenant within a reasonable time -<p></p></ul>
(a) <p></p><ul><ul>to give consent, except in a case where it is reasonable not to give consent,<p></p></ul></ul>
(b) <p></p><ul><ul>to serve on the tenant written notice of his decision whether or not to give consent specifying in addition -<p></p></ul></ul>
(i) <p></p><ul><ul><ul>if the consent is given subject to conditions, the conditions,<p></p></ul></ul></ul>
(ii) <p></p><ul><ul><ul>if the consent is withheld, the reasons for withholding it.<p></p></ul></ul></ul>
…
<p></p><ul>(6)  It is for the person who owed any duty under subsection (3) above -<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul><ul>…<p></p></ul></ul>
<p></p><ul><ul>(c)  if he did not give consent and the question arises whether it was reasonable for him not to do so, to show that it was reasonable,<p></p></ul></ul>
<p></p><ul>and, if the question arises whether he served notice under that subsection within a reasonable time, to show that he did."<p></p></ul>
<p>Mr Lewison commented on the succinct reply which the council official, Mr Hook, had sent to the respondents' agents on 16 September 1997 and appeared to suggest that it might somehow limit the range of evidence or argument which the council could deploy in seeking to show that it had been reasonable for the council not to give consent on the ground set out in the letter.  I would deprecate any such suggestion.  As my noble and learned friend Lord Scott pointed out in the course of argument, the degree of detail contained in such a letter is likely to depend to a large extent on what is said by the tenant in the application to which the landlord is responding.  In practice a dialogue may develop.  Here, to judge from the terms of the letter from the respondents' solicitors on 16 July, the application for consent was brief and contained no elaboration.  In those circumstances an equally succinct reply was to be expected.  Had the respondents continued the correspondence and elaborated their application in the light of the council's reply, then the council might well have developed their thinking in more detail.  Of course, once the landlord has stated in writing the ground on which he refuses consent, he cannot later rely on any other ground.  But that does not mean to say that, when seeking to show that it was reasonable for him not to consent on the stated ground, he is confined to what he has said in his letter.  Section 1(6)(c) contains no such restriction.  And rightly so.  Otherwise, instead of being a straightforward practical document, the notice containing the landlord's reasons for withholding consent would soon become a battleground for litigants and an increasingly sophisticated playground for conveyancers.  Such cannot have been the intention of Parliament in enacting the legislation.</p>
