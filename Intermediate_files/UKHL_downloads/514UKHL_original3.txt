<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;64. This experience has not been confined to this country.  Exemplary damages continue to discharge a role, perceived to be useful and valuable, in other common law jurisdictions.  Indeed, the restrictions on exemplary damages imposed by <i>Rookes v Barnard</i> and <i>Broome v Cassell &amp; Co Ltd</i> did not strike a receptive chord, for instance, in Canada, Australia or New Zealand.  Outside the United Kingdom <i>Rookes v Barnard</i> received a generally negative reception.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;65. If exemplary damages are to continue as a remedial tool, as recommended by the Law Commission after extensive consultation, the difficult question which arises concerns the circumstances in which this tool should be available for use.  Stated in its broadest form, the relevant principle is tolerably clear: the availability of exemplary damages should be co-extensive with its rationale.  As already indicated, the underlying rationale lies in the sense of outrage which a defendant's conduct sometimes evokes, a sense which is not always assuaged fully by a compensatory award of damages, even when the damages are increased to reflect emotional distress. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66. In <i>Rookes v Barnard </i>[1964]  AC 1129, 1226 , Lord Devlin drew a distinction between oppressive acts by government officials and similar acts by companies or individuals.  He considered that exemplary damages should not be available in the case of non-governmental oppression or bullying.  Whatever may have been the position 40 years ago, I am respectfully inclined to doubt the soundness of this distinction today.  National and international companies can exercise enormous power.  So do some individuals.  I am not sure it would be right to draw a hard-and-fast line which would always exclude such companies and persons from the reach of exemplary damages.  Indeed, the validity of the dividing line drawn by Lord Devlin when formulating his first category is somewhat undermined by his second category, where the defendants are not confined to, and normally would not be, government officials or the like.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;67. Nor, I may add, am I wholly persuaded by Lord Devlin's formulation of his second category (wrongful conduct expected to yield a benefit in excess of any compensatory award likely to be made).  The law of unjust enrichment has developed apace in recent years.  In so far as there may be a need to go further, the key here would seem to be the same as that already discussed: outrageous conduct on the part of the defendant.  There is no obvious reason why, if exemplary damages are to be available, the profit motive should suffice but a malicious motive should not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;68. As I have said, difficult questions arise here.  In view of the limited scope of the submissions made by the parties on this appeal, this is not the occasion for attempting to state comprehensive conclusions on these matters.  For the purposes of the present appeal it is sufficient, first, to express the view that the House should now depart from its decision in <i>Broome v Cassell &amp; Co Ltd </i>[1972]  AC 1027, in so far as that decision confirmed the continuing existence of what has subsequently been described as the 'cause of action' condition and, secondly, to note that the essence of the conduct constituting the court's discretionary jurisdiction to award exemplary damages is conduct which was an outrageous disregard of the plaintiff's rights.  Whether the conduct of PC Cavendish satisfies that test in this case is a matter to be resolved at trial.  I would allow this appeal.</p>
<i>Vicarious liability</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;69. The only defendant in this action is the Chief Constable of Leicestershire Constabulary.  The claim against him is made solely on the basis of vicarious responsibility for the conduct of PC Cavendish as a serving police officer.  On this appeal the Chief Constable has not sought to say that, as a matter of law, his vicarious liability stops short of any claim there may be for exemplary damages.  This was not one of the issues raised on the appeal.  In the circumstances I express no view on this topic.</p>
<p><b>LORD HUTTON</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70. The issue which arises on this appeal is whether exemplary damages can be awarded where a plaintiff establishes that the defendant has committed the tort of misfeasance in public office. The facts which it alleged constitute the tort in the present case are set out in the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;71. There has been considerable debate on the question whether  exemplary damages should continue to be a part of the law of England. The opinion has been expressed that exemplary or punitive damages should have no place in the awarding of damages which are intended to compensate the plaintiff for the loss or injury which he has suffered by reason of a tort.  The matter has been considered by the Law Commission in its Report on Aggravated, Exemplary and Restitutionary Damages (1997) (Law Com No 247), and its recommendation was that exemplary damages should continue to be part of the law of England although on a more extensive basis than at present.  However the Government has stated that it does not propose to bring forward legislation to give effect to this recommendation and the Government has further observed that further judicial development of the law in this area may help to clarify the issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72. The parties have chosen not to present arguments on the issue whether exemplary damages should continue to be awarded but have been content to approach the appeal on the basis that the law as stated by the House in <i> Rookes v Barnard</i> [1964]  AC 1129 and <i>Broome v Cassell &amp; Co</i> <i>Ltd</i> [1972]  AC 1027 should govern the present case. Therefore the preliminary question arises whether your Lordships should express an opinion on the important issue which arises on this appeal, when the House has not had the advantage of hearing argument on the fundamental question whether exemplary damages should continue to be awarded at all and on the principles which can be advanced to justify the award of exemplary damages or to oppose such an award.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73. My Lords, whilst the speeches in <i>Rookes v Barnard</i> and <i>Broome v Cassell &amp; Co Ltd </i>recognised that the award of exemplary damages is anomalous, the speeches nevertheless accepted that exemplary damages constitute part of the law of England.  Thus in <i>Rookes v Barnard </i>[1964] AC 1129<i>, </i>after considering the authorities, Lord Devlin stated, at pp 1225-1226:</p>
<p></p><ul>"These authorities convince me of two things.  First, that your Lordships could not, without a complete disregard of precedent, and indeed of statute, now arrive at a determination that refused altogether to recognise the exemplary principle."<p></p></ul>
<p>And in <i>Broome v Cassell &amp; Co Ltd </i>[1972] AC 1027 Lord Reid, referring to Lord Devlin's speech in <i>Rookes v Barnard</i>, said, at p 1087:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Critics appear to have thought that he was inventing something new.  That was not my understanding.  We were confronted with an undesirable anomaly.  We could not abolish it.  We had to choose between confining it strictly to classes of cases where it was firmly established, although that produced an illogical result, or permitting it to be extended so as to produce a logical result.  In my view it is better in such cases to be content with an illogical result than to allow any extension."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74. Moreover, in <i>Rookes v Barnard</i> Lord Devlin gave guidance, with which the other members of the House concurred, as to the categories of cases in which exemplary damages should be awarded.  In these circumstances, whilst I recognise that it would have been more helpful if the House had heard argument on the fundamental question whether exemplary damages should continue to be awarded, I consider that it is right that the House should express an opinion on the issue raised before it and on which the Recorder and the Court of Appeal have given judgments, the opinion to be given on the basis that the parties accept that the law on exemplary damages is that stated in <i>Rookes v Barnard</i> and <i>Broome v Cassell &amp; Co Ltd.</i>  But I consider that if on a future occasion a party sought to argue that the law should be changed and that exemplary damages should no longer be awarded, it would be open to the House under the Practice Statement of 1966 (<i>Practice Statement (Judicial Precedent</i>) [1966] 1 WLR 1234) to hear such an argument and to rule upon it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75. As the point has not been argued I express no concluded opinion on the question whether exemplary damages should continue to be awarded in England, but I think that a number of cases decided by the courts in Northern Ireland during the past 30 years of terrorist violence give support to the opinion of Lord Devlin in <i>Rookes v Barnard</i> [1964] AC 1129, 1223, 1226 that in certain cases the awarding of exemplary damages serves a valuable purpose in restraining the arbitrary and outrageous use of executive power and in vindicating the strength of the law.  Members of the security forces seeking to combat terrorism face constant danger and have to carry out their duties in very stressful conditions.  In such circumstances an individual soldier or police officer or prison officer may, on occasion, act in gross breach of discipline and commit an unlawful act which is oppressive or arbitrary and in such cases exemplary damages have been awarded.  I refer to two of these cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76. In <i>Lavery v Ministry of Defence</i> [1984]  NI 99, on a morning after a night of rioting in some areas of Belfast, an Army patrol stopped a young man of 16 who was walking along a street.  A soldier of the patrol asked him his name and address and where he was coming from and going to.  He gave this information and the soldier told him to sit down on the ground.  He asked "what for?" and the soldier's response was to strike him in the groin with his knee and then to strike him on the head with the butt of his rifle, which knocked the young man to the ground and cut his head so that it bled freely.  The soldier then handcuffed his ankles.  The young man sued the Ministry of Defence in the County Court for damages for assault and battery committed by the soldier.  The Ministry of Defence admitted liability and at the hearing no mitigating circumstances were suggested and there was no suggestion that the plaintiff had been guilty of any provocative conduct.  The County Court judge awarded damages of £1,000 which included a sum for aggravated damages but not for exemplary damages.  On appeal to the High Court, Kelly LJ sitting in the Queen's Bench Division increased the damages to £2,500 which included exemplary damages.  In awarding exemplary damages, after citing passages from the speech of Lord Devlin in <i>Rookes v Barnard </i>[1964] AC 1129<i>, </i>the Lord Justice said, at p 106:</p>
<p></p><ul>"I ask the question what total sum is sufficient not only to compensate the plaintiff for the assault suffered in all the circumstances, but to teach the defendant that this sort of conduct does not pay and hopefully deter its repetition.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"I think the conduct of the soldier concerned, some of which was acquiesced in by the other members of the patrol, was a deliberate and unjustifiable abuse of the lawful power to stop and question a citizen.  This power is a necessary one, entrusted to the security forces to aid their difficult task of maintaining law and order in the streets of this city and elsewhere throughout the Province.  It is a power which at times must be exercised frequently to maintain an efficient standard of peace-keeping.  Inevitably it involves confrontation between soldier and citizen and police officer and citizen and a sensitive confrontation at that with the power to stop search and question delicately poised against the rights of the citizen.  The lawful exercise of these powers demands moderation and tact on the part of the security forces at all times and when they seek to exercise them in confrontation with unco-operative citizens in hostile and dangerous areas, it demands forbearance and discipline, as well.  Nevertheless the security forces must be reminded that these powers which necessarily and lawfully reduce the freedom and privacy of the subject must not be abused.  The present case was a blatant and quite unjustified abuse of lawful powers.  It should not happen again, the defendants should be told.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"I do not think that the award of £1,000 by the learned county court judge is adequate to include the elements of punishment or deterrence.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"My conclusion is that a proper award to include exemplary damages, should be £2,500."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77. In <i>Pettigrew v Northern Ireland Office </i> [1990]  NI 179 there had been a mass escape of convicted terrorist prisoners from H Block 7 in the Maze Prison.  In the course of the escape one prison officer died, one prison officer in H Block 7 was shot in the head and seriously wounded and other prison officers were injured.   When the prisoners escaped from H Block 7 they left a number of prison officers tied up.  It was clear that some of the prisoners who remained in H Block 7 had helped in varying degrees those who succeeded in escaping.  After the escape the remaining prisoners in H Block 7 were moved to H Block 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78. The plaintiff, who was one of the remaining prisoners moved to H Block 8, brought an action against the Northern Ireland Office for damages for assault and battery by prison officers, alleging that in the course of the move he had been kicked and punched by prison officers and that prison officers who were dog-handlers had not restrained their dogs from nipping and biting him.  In the High Court it was held that it was probable that prison officers, angered by the death of a colleague and the wounding of other colleagues in the course of the escape, had given vent to their anger by kicking or punching the plaintiff and that dog handlers had failed adequately to restrain their dogs.  The plaintiff was awarded exemplary damages and I refer, if I may, to what I said in giving judgment, at pp 181-182:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In this case I consider that the conduct of the dog handlers who deliberately did not restrain their dogs from nipping or biting the plaintiff and the conduct of the prison officers who kicked or punched the plaintiff was oppressive conduct by servants of the Government.  Notwithstanding that the prison officers had real and understandable grounds for anger, it was their duty to restrain that anger, and in my opinion their conduct calls for an award of exemplary damages to mark the disapproval of the court, to teach that such conduct does not pay, and to act as a deterrent against this type of conduct against prisoners being repeated in the future.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"Mr Campbell submitted that as the purpose of awarding exemplary damages is to punish a defendant whose conduct was oppressive and in the opinion of the court deserves punishment, exemplary damages should not be awarded against the Northern Ireland Office because it had done nothing deserving of punishment.  There could be no suggestion that the Northern Ireland Office connived at or condoned the conduct of the prison officers responsible for the attacks on the plaintiff, and when allegations were made of attacks upon the prisoners the Northern Ireland Office caused an investigation to be carried out.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"I accept Mr Campbell's submission that there are no grounds upon which exemplary damages could be awarded against the Northern Ireland Office in respect of its own conduct as a Government department.  But there are a number of decisions in this jurisdiction which make it clear that exemplary damages can be awarded against a defendant where that defendant is vicariously liable for the conduct of its or his servants or agents and the conduct of those servants or agents calls for exemplary damages.  These cases are <i>Lavery v Ministry of Defence</i> [1984]  NI 99, <i>Walsh v Ministry of Defence </i> [1985]  4 NIJB and <i>Hamilton v Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary</i> [1986]  15 NIJB.  The same view of the law is implicit in the judgments of the Court of Appeal in England in <i>Holden v Chief Constable of Lancashire</i> [1987]  QB 380."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79. In my opinion the power to award exemplary damages in such cases serves to uphold and vindicate the rule of law because it makes clear that the courts will not tolerate such conduct.  It serves to deter such actions in future as such awards will bring home to officers in command of individual units that discipline must be maintained at all times.  In my respectful opinion the view is not fanciful, as my noble and learned friend Lord Scott of Foscote suggests, that such awards have a deterrent effect and such an effect is recognised by Professor Atiyah in the passage from his work on Vicarious Liability cited by Lord Scott of Foscote in his speech. Moreover in some circumstances where one of a group of soldiers or police officers commits some outrageous act in the course of a confused and violent confrontation it may be very difficult to identify the individual wrongdoer so that criminal proceedings may be brought against him to punish and deter such conduct, whereas an award of exemplary damages to mark the court's condemnation of the conduct can be made against the Minister of Defence or the Chief Constable under the principle of vicarious liability even if the individual at fault cannot be identified.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80. In <i>Rookes v Barnard</i> [1964] AC 1129 in the well known passage of his speech, at p 1226, Lord Devlin stated that (in addition to cases in which exemplary damages are expressly authorised by statute) there are two categories of cases where exemplary damages can be awarded.  The first category is where there is oppressive, arbitrary or unconstitutional action by the servants of the government.  The second is where the defendant's conduct had been calculated by him to make a profit for himself which may well exceed the compensation payable to the plaintiff.  The question debated by counsel on this appeal is whether a plaintiff, to be entitled to recover exemplary damages, must establish not only that his case falls within one or other of Lord Devlin's categories, but also that his claim is in respect of a tort for which exemplary damages had been awarded before 1964 when <i>Rookes v</i> <i>Barnard</i> was decided.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81. It is clear from Lord Devlin's speech, at p 1226, that he was intending to restrict the range of cases in which exemplary damages could be awarded, but I can see nothing in the speech which suggests that if a case fell within one of the two categories, Lord Devlin intended that an award of exemplary damages should not be made unless the tort for which the plaintiff sued was one for which such damages had been awarded in the past.  In my opinion, in referring to certain categories of cases, and particularly in referring to the first category, Lord Devlin was referring to the manner in which the defendant committed the tort, to his behaviour and conduct in carrying out the tort, and not to the particular cause of action upon which the plaintiff relied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82. Mr Mansfield QC for the defendant relied on the point that it appears from the report of the argument of counsel, at p 1164, that in <i>Rookes v Barnard</i> Mr Gerald Gardiner QC for the defendants conceded that intimidation by threat of breach of contract may be a tort for which exemplary damages can be awarded.  But in my opinion Lord Devlin did not base his judgment on a concession made by counsel but was concerned to state, as a matter of principle, the approach which the courts should take in future to the award of exemplary damages.  Therefore, if the present case fell to be determined by the application of Lord Devlin's judgment, I consider (assuming that the conduct of the police constable constituted conduct of the nature described in Lord Devlin's first category) that the plaintiff should succeed in this appeal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83. Mr Mansfield submitted, however, that the requirement that the plaintiff must establish that exemplary damages had been awarded for the tort prior to 1964 (the cause of action test), whilst not laid down expressly in Lord Devlin's judgment, was implicit in it and was made express by the dicta in the speeches of the members of the House in <i>Broome v Cassell &amp; Co Ltd</i> [1972] AC 1027.  As Sir Thomas Bingham MR recognised in <i>AB v South West Water Services Ltd</i> [1993] QB 507, 530 F-G, this submission gives rise to a difficult point, as is apparent from the difference of opinion in the carefully reasoned judgments of the Court of Appeal in this case and in <i>AB v South West Water Services Ltd</i>.  I regard the point as a difficult one because, like my noble and learned friend, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, I find it difficult to obtain clear guidance from the dicta in <i>Broome v Cassell &amp; Co Ltd </i>[1972] AC 1027<i>.</i></p>
<i>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84. The passage in <i>Broome v Cassell &amp; Co</i> <i>Ltd </i>which gives most support to Mr Mansfield's submission is the passage in the speech of Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone LC, at p 1076:</p>
<p></p><ul>"<i>Did Rookes v Barnard extend exemplary damages to fresh torts?<p></p></i></ul><i>
</i>
<p></p><ul>	"Having rejected the theory that Lord Devlin's speech can be pushed aside as having been delivered per incuriam, I hope I may now equally dispose of another misconception.  I do not think that he was under the impression either that he had completely rationalised the law of exemplary damages, nor by listing the 'categories' was he intending, I would think, to add to the number of torts for which exemplary damages can be awarded.  Thus I disagree with the dictum of Widgery LJ in <i>Mafo v Adams</i> [1970]  1 QB 548, 558 (which, for this purpose can be treated as an action for deceit) when he said:<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>'As I understand Lord Devlin's speech, the circumstances in which exemplary damages may be obtained have been drastically reduced, but the range of offences in respect of which they may be granted has been increased, and I see no reason since <i>Rookes v Barnard</i> [1964]  AC 1129 why, when considering a claim for exemplary damages, one should regard the nature of the tort as excluding the claim.'<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"This would be a perfectly logical inference if Lord Devlin imagined that he was substituting a completely rational code by enumerating the categories and stating the considerations. It is true, of course, that actions for deceit could well come within the purview of the second category.  But I can see no reason for thinking that Lord Devlin intended to extend the category to deceit, and counsel on both sides before us were constrained to say that, though it may be paradoxical, they were unable to find a single case where either exemplary or aggravated damages had been awarded for deceit, despite the fact that contumelious, outrageous, oppressive, or dishonest conduct on the part of the defendant is almost inherently associated with it.  The explanation may lie in the close connection that the action has always had with breach of contract:  see the discussion in <i>Mayne and McGregor</i> <i>on Damages</i> 12th ed (1961) chapter 41, especially at paragraph 968 (p 809)."<p></p></ul>
<p>But the weight of this passage is somewhat lessened by the subsequent recognition by Lord Hailsham, at p 1080B-C, that the question whether exemplary damages can be awarded in an action for deceit has not been finally determined.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85. However, as Auld LJ observed in the Court of Appeal, Lord Reid, Lord Wilberforce and Lord Diplock placed emphasis on Lord Devlin's reference to categories or classes of cases and did not refer to causes of action.  Lord Reid said, at p 1086, referring to <i>Rookes v Barnard </i>[1964] AC 1129:</p>
<p></p><ul>"We thought we had to recognise that it had become an established custom in certain classes of case to permit awards of damages which could not be justified as compensatory, and that that must remain the law.  But we thought and I still think it well within the province of this House to say that that undesirable anomaly should not be permitted in any class of case where its use was not covered by authority.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"In order to determine the classes of case in which this anomaly had become established it was of little use to look merely at the words which had been used by judges because, as I have said, words like punitive and exemplary were often used with regard to damages which were truly compensatory.  We had to take a broad view of the whole circumstances<p></p></ul>
<p>See also the passage already cited (ante, para 4), at p 1087.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86. Lord Wilberforce also referred to a category of cases and to the excessive and insolent use of power, and not to causes of action.  He said, at p 1120:</p>
<p></p><ul>"There is not perhaps much difficulty about category 1:  it is well based on the cases and on a principle stated in 1703— 'if <i>public officers </i>will infringe men's rights, they ought to pay greater damages than other men to deter and hinder others from the like offences':  <i>Ashby v White</i> (1703)  2 Ld Raym 938, 956  per<i> </i>Holt C.J.  Excessive and insolent use of power is certainly something against which citizens require as much protection today:  a wide interpretation of 'government' which I understand your Lordships to endorse would correspond with Holt CJ's 'public officers' and would partly correspond with modern needs."<p></p></ul>
<p>Lord Diplock also referred to categories of cases and to factual situations, at p 1128:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The purpose of Lord Devlin's division of them into three categories was in order to distinguish between factual situations in which there was some special reason still relevant in modern social conditions for retaining the power to award exemplary damages, and factual situations in  which no such special reason still survived."<p></p></ul>
<p>See also at p 1124B.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87. Earlier in his speech Lord Diplock said, at pp 1123-1124:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It was necessary as a matter of decision of the cross-appeal for this House to determine whether the facts in <i>Rookes v Barnard </i>brought it within a category of cases in which exemplary damages were recoverable at common law.  This House determined that they did not and ordered a new trial.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"There were two different processes of reasoning by which it would have been possible to reach this conclusion of law. One, which was not adopted by this House, was to hold that the particular tort of intimidation was one in which the common law did not permit of exemplary damages.  The other, which was adopted by this House, was to state the categories of cases in which alone exemplary damages might be awarded at common law and to determine whether the facts in <i>Rookes v Barnard</i> brought it within one of these categories."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88. In my opinion in this passage Lord Diplock stated, in effect, the two tests, the cause of action test and the categories of cases test, and recognised that in <i>Rookes v Barnard</i>  [1964] AC 1129 the House did not accept the cause of action test.  I recognise, as Mr Mansfield submitted, that the defendant can seek to rely on a later passage in Lord Diplock's speech, at p 1130-1131:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Finally, on this aspect of the case I would express my agreement with the view that <i>Rookes v Barnard</i> was not intended to extend the power to award exemplary or aggravated damages to particular torts for which they had not previously been awarded; such as negligence and deceit.  Its express purpose was to restrict, not to expand, the anomaly of exemplary damages."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89. But in my respectful opinion in this later passage, Lord Diplock was not endorsing the cause of action test and was not intending to depart from the view he had expressed in the earlier passage, and I incline to the view that Lord Diplock was of the opinion that negligence and deceit did not fall within Lord Devlin's first and second categories. Accordingly, I would hold that a plaintiff is entitled to recover exemplary damages if the circumstances in which the tort of misfeasance in public office is committed bring it within Lord Devlin's first category and I consider that in <i>AB v. South West Water Services Ltd</i> the Court of Appeal was in error in holding that the cause of action test must be applied.</p>
