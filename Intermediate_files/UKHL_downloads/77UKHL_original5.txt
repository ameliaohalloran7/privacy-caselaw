<p class="para">99.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the two reasons given for distinguishing this case, the first is not easy to understand. While it is true that the Council were relying on the terms of the contractual tenancy, which was left after the secure tenancy had been destroyed by operation of law, it is not clear why a contractual claim should be treated any differently from any other irresistible claim to possession, whether it arises under a statute or at common law, for example against a trespasser.  The legal relationship between landlord and tenant always depends upon their contract, although in some cases Parliament has intervened to give the tenant great protection.  The second, however, is an important distinction between the facts of the two cases. If I am right in my conclusion that the eviction in this case was not for a reason related to the tenant’s disability, the two cases are not in conflict.</p>
<p class="para">100.&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, however, although Mr Goudie places great weight on the passage from <i>Floyd</i> quoted at para 98 above, the second reason given for distinguishing this case does not suggest that the DDA can never be a defence to what would otherwise be an unbeatable claim to possession. It is consistent with the view that an unlawful act of discrimination <i>could</i> constitute such a defence. </p>
<p class="para">101.&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the unlawful acts prohibited by the DDA is eviction. Clearly that must apply to an eviction which would otherwise be lawful. If it were unlawful for other reasons there would be no need to prohibit it. The DDA makes unlawful many other acts which would otherwise be perfectly within the law. Section 25(1) of the DDA provides that a claim under Part III of the Act “may be made the subject of civil proceedings in the same way as any other claim in tort". Normally this would be a claim for damages after a <i>fait accompli</i>, and section 25(2) makes it clear that these may include compensation for injury to feelings. But there is nothing to exclude the normal availability of an injunction to restrain a threatened tort in appropriate circumstances. Furthermore, para 5(2) of Schedule 3 expressly preserves the making of an application for judicial review, to restrain a public authority from acting unlawfully. Thus the DDA must contemplate, not only that victims be compensated after the event but also that the unlawful discrimination be prevented from taking place at all. </p>
<p class="para">102.&nbsp;&nbsp;As already mentioned, the Equality and Human Rights Commission favour a middle course. They reject the course taken by the Court of Appeal, that possession should be refused in all cases where the possession claim or notice to quit is tainted by unlawful discrimination. They recognise that this would lead to unsatisfactory results, particularly where a private person was thereby deprived of property rights in potential breach of article 1 of the First Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights, but also where there were good public interest grounds for a public authority to regain possession. No doubt, the Commission would not wish to see the whole idea of disability discrimination brought into disrepute, as it could so easily be if a person in the position of Mrs Floyd, or of the Council in this case, were unable to recover possession or to take other entirely justified action against a tenant simply because of their disability. Equally, the Commission reject the other extreme, that the remedy for any unlawful discrimination is limited to damages. They argue for a middle course in which the court has a discretion whether or not to grant the possession order, having weighed up all the competing interests.</p>
<p class="para">103.&nbsp;&nbsp;I entirely agree with the Commission that such a discretion would be much the best solution. Furthermore, far and away the simplest way to provide for it would be by expanding the list of potential justifications for the landlord’s actions in section 24(3). This could be done by regulations made under section 24(5) for that very purpose.  Whatever the outcome of this appeal, I urge that this be done as a matter of urgency. If <i>Clark v Novacold Ltd </i>survives, and applies to section 24(1)(a) in the same way as it applies to what was section 5(1)(a), as I believe that it both should and does, then all these cases will turn on the closeness of the connection between the disability and the landlord’s reason for acting as he did. This would mean that the closer the connection between the disability and the tenant’s inability to pay the rent or otherwise comply with the obligations of the tenancy - the more obvious it was that the tenant had fallen into arrears because of his disability - the more difficult it would be for the landlord to take action to recover either the rent or the property.  Yet it cannot have been intended that a landlord should be obliged in effect to lend their property indefinitely to a person with no prospect of paying the rent.  That would indeed bring the DDA into disrepute.  Your Lordships’ approach to the comparator question avoids this inconvenient result.</p>
<p class="para">104.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, however, it is difficult to find a way to arrive at  any discretion. If the Notice to Quit is an unlawful act under the DDA, the landlord should not be able to rely upon it for the purpose of claiming possession. If, as in this case, the notice to quit is not unlawful, because at that stage the landlord did not know of the disability, bringing the possession claim might still be unlawful. If it were unlawful, then I agree with Lord Bingham that the court cannot be expected to give legal effect to an unlawful act. Unlike Lord Bingham, however, I would have expected the defence to be made out quite often, unless the courts are readily prepared to accept that the reasons for the landlords’ actions are related to their rights and responsibilities as landlords and landowners rather than to the disabilities of their tenants.  Mr Jan Luba QC, who appears for Mr Malcolm, was prepared to accept that if the Council had said that their reason for proceedings was that they always evicted non-occupiers, that would have taken them out of the Act. But although I also take the view that, at present, the answer lies in the landlord’s reason for his conduct, I cannot think that it is strong enough to bear the weight which must be placed on it if just results are to be achieved in the large numbers of cases in which the issue might arise.</p>
<p class="para">105.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, however, I would hold that there was no unlawful discrimination against Mr Malcolm, because the reason for the Council’s actions was not related to Mr Malcolm’s disability.  In agreement with your Lordships in the result, and on most of the issues, therefore, I would allow the appeal and restore the order of the circuit judge.      </p>
<p class="lawlord">LORD BROWN OF EATON-UNDER-HEYWOOD</p>
<p class="mylords">My Lords,</p>
<p class="para">106.&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the obligation placed upon landlords towards the disabled under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995?  Is it the obligation to treat the disabled no less favourably than those not disabled?  Or is it to treat them more favourably?  That is the central question for your Lordships’ determination on this appeal.</p>
<p class="para">107.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays—since the 2005 amendments to the Act—in certain respects a landlord must treat the disabled more favourably: he must make reasonable adjustments in relation to the premises.  And that, indeed, equates to what has always been the position with regard to employers and those who provide goods, facilities and services: they from the outset have been under a duty to make reasonable adjustments to cater for disability and have been liable for discrimination if they fail to do so—see for example the decision of the House in <i>Archibald v Fife Council</i> [2004] UKHL 32, 2004 ICR 954.  But where providers (be they employers, suppliers or landlords) are under no express statutory duty to make adjustments of this nature, are they nonetheless, under the primary non-discrimination provisions of the 1995 Act (sections 5(1)(a), 20(1)(a), and 24(1)(a)), forbidden to treat the disabled in the same way as they would treat anyone else?  All three provisions are in materially identical terms.  Section 24(1)(a) being at the heart of this appeal, that is the one I shall set out:</p>
<p class="qt">“[A] person . . . discriminates against a disabled person if (a) for a reason which relates to the disabled person’s disability, he treats him less favourably than he treats or would treat others to whom that reason does not or would not apply . . . “</p>
<p class="para">108.&nbsp;&nbsp;The question arose in the employment context in <i>Clark v Novacold</i> [1999] ICR 951 where an employee was dismissed following serious injuries likely to prevent his return to work for about a year.  Plainly his dismissal was for a reason which related to his disability.  But was he thereby being treated less favourably than the employer would have treated “others to whom that reason [did] not or would not apply"?  It was accepted on all sides that any employee proposing a year’s absence from work would also have been dismissed.  That notwithstanding, however, the Court of Appeal held that the disabled employee had been treated less favourably than others would have been treated because the comparison to be made was with those employees who were not disabled and who were therefore continuing to do their work.  My noble and learned friend, Lord Scott of Foscote, has already cited extensively from Mummery LJ’s leading judgment in the Court of Appeal and I need not repeat it here.</p>
<p class="para">109.&nbsp;&nbsp;By the same token, argued the tenant in <i>S v Jacqueline Floyd (Equality and Human Rights Commission intervening)</i> [2008]  EWCA Civ 201, her landlord’s action in seeking to evict her on the statutory ground of non-payment of rent for over eight weeks (in fact for 132 weeks)—arrears which it was contended had accrued because of the tenant’s disability—constituted unlawful discrimination under section 24(1)(a) because the landlord was treating her less favourably than he would have treated a tenant who was up to date with the rent.</p>
<p class="para">110.&nbsp;&nbsp;And again by the same token the respondent tenant in the present appeal argues (as he did with success before the Court of Appeal) that the appellant landlord’s treatment of him should be compared, not to how they would have treated any other tenant who sublet, but rather to someone keeping to the terms of his tenancy.</p>
<p class="para">111.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>S</i> failed in her appeal and it is convenient at this stage to note Mummery LJ’s reasoning in the leading judgment in the Court of Appeal:</p>
<p class="qt">“The 1995 Act was enacted to provide remedies for disabled people at the receiving end of unlawful discrimination.  It was not aimed at protecting them from lawful litigation or at supplying them with a defence to breach of a civil law obligation.  Like other anti-discrimination legislation, the 1995 Act created statutory causes of action for unlawful discrimination in many areas, such as employment, the provision of goods, facilities and services and the disposal or management of premises, but it did not create any special disability defence to the lawful claims of others, such as a landlord’s claim for possession of premises for arrears of rent.  The legislation is not about disability per se: it is about unlawful acts of discrimination on a prohibited ground, ie, unjustified less favourable treatment for a reason which relates to the disabled person’s disability.” (para 48)</p>
<p class="para">112.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Lord Scott, I too find that paragraph convincing but at the same time difficult to reconcile with what the learned Lord Justice had earlier said in <i>Clark v Novacold</i>.  What difference in principle is there, I respectfully ask, between a “civil law obligation” on the one hand to pay rent or otherwise vacate (or be evicted from) the premises, and on the other hand to do one’s work or otherwise vacate (or be dismissed from) the job?  I cannot see why the same reasoning dictating the failure of  <i>S’s</i>  appeal should not also have defeated Mr Clark’s claim.  If, indeed, as Mummery LJ said in <i>Floyd</i>, “The legislation is not about disability per se: it is about . . . unjustified less favourable treatment for a reason which relates to the disabled person’s disability", then it cannot be right to construe section 24(1)(a) (or sections 5(1)(a) or 20(1)(a)) in such a way that the requirement to show less favourable treatment will always and by definition be satisfied.  Toulson LJ pointed that out (at para 155) in the judgment below and my noble and learned friend Baroness Hale of Richmond recognises it at para 71 of her opinion: the construction adopted in <i>Clark v Novacold</i> “reduces the comparison test to one which will always be met".</p>
<p class="para">113.&nbsp;&nbsp;To my mind—and here again I am in agreement with Lord Scott (para 32)—Parliament must rather have intended “a meaningful comparison in order to distinguish between treatment that was discriminatory and treatment that was not".  A meaningful comparison requires also that treatment cannot be discriminatory unless the supposed discriminator knows of the disability (although obviously he need not know that it satisfies the statutory definition of disablement).  This alternative and narrower approach to the section thus solves the further very real problems which otherwise arise as to whether, and if so what, knowledge is required for discrimination to be established under the Act.</p>
<p class="para">114.&nbsp;&nbsp;I recognise, of course, that this approach to the section reduces its reach: it confines it largely if not entirely to the proscription of direct discrimination only.  But that perhaps is not, after all, so surprising.  Disabilities are too diverse in their nature for the concept to lend itself easily to the notion of indirect discrimination—the imposition of requirements ostensibly neutral but in fact having a disproportionate and unjustifiable impact on those sought to be protected.  What indirect discrimination against the disabled would equate to, say, a requirement for employees to be at least six feet tall—presumably indirectly discriminatory against both women (sex) and those of Asian origins (race)?  The needs of the disabled are rather different and require sometimes to be met by positive action.  As I noted at the outset, where Parliament is clearly intent not merely on levelling the playing field for the disabled but in securing positive discrimination in their favour it does so by requiring reasonable adjustments to be made to cater for their special difficulties.  As Lady Hale observes (at para 74), section 21(1) is, for example, apt to cater for the blind man’s need to bring his guide-dog into the restaurant—the most frequently deployed illustration of the problems of disablement.  If landlords similarly are to be required to allow guide-dogs into tenanted premises (assuming ordinarily that animals are forbidden), or to make other specific provision for the disabled over and above what they would ordinarily provide or permit, then (insofar as the 2005 amendments have not already achieved this) legislation can be enacted accordingly.</p>
<p class="para">115.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether, however, it would ever be thought appropriate to legislate sufficiently beneficially towards disabled tenants to allow them to remain in possession despite running up huge arrears (as in <i>Floyd</i>) or subletting all or part of the premises (as here) may be doubted.  There must come a point at which the wider interests of the disabled would actually be <i>dis</i>advantaged by such legislation, when landlords would begin to entertain a real reluctance (section 22 of the Act notwithstanding) to grant them tenancies in the first place.  Those considerations, however, are for the future.</p>
<p class="para">116.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in no doubt that, unamended, the 1995 Act did not avail this respondent in the particular circumstances of this case.  However favourably from his point of view the court might have viewed the facts—even supposing, that is, he was disabled at the material time, that but for his disablement he would not have sublet the premises, and that the Council knew this to be so—these possession proceedings could not properly have been held discriminatory contrary to section 24(1)(a).</p>
<p class="para">117.&nbsp;&nbsp;If, of course, this is right, it becomes unnecessary to address either of the factual issues arising.  For what it is worth, however, I am inclined—again, I think, in common with Lord Scott to share my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill’s view that the Court of Appeal was entitled to find the respondent disabled at the material time, and Lady Hale’s view that there was no adequate connection between that and his subletting of the premises.</p>
<p class="para">118.&nbsp;&nbsp;I too would allow this appeal and restore the order of Judge Hallon at first instance.</p>
<p class="para">LORD NEUBERGER OF ABBOTSBURY</p>
<p class="mylords">My Lords,</p>
<p class="para">119.&nbsp;&nbsp;This appeal raises a number of points relating to the scope and meaning of the provisions of Part III of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (“the 1995 Act”) insofar as they apply to “Premises". In particular, the competing arguments appear to require a choice to be made between two interpretations of the definition of discrimination in section 24, one of which (supported by the appellant, the London Borough of Lewisham) would give the anti-discrimination provisions of section 22 an unattractively restrictive effect, and the other of which (supported by the respondent, Mr Courtney Malcolm) would give those provisions an extraordinarily far-reaching scope. </p>
<p class="para">120.&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts and centrally relevant statutory provisions have been clearly set out and explained by my noble and learned friends, Lord Scott of Foscote and Baroness Hale of Richmond, whose opinions I have had the privilege of reading in draft. I gratefully adopt what they have said for the purposes of this opinion, in which all references to statutory provisions are to those of the 1995 Act in its original form, unless the contrary is stated.</p>
<i><p class="para">The issues</p>
</i><p class="para">121.&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears to me that that Mr Malcolm can only defeat Lewisham’s claim for possession on the ground that he would be subject of unlawful discrimination contrary to section 22(3)(c), if he can establish the following six propositions: </p>
<p class="para">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;He must have been suffering at the relevant time from a “disability” within section 1(1); </p>
<p class="para">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;He must have been “treat[ed]” by Lewisham in a manner falling within section 22(3)(c);</p>
<p class="para">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;The “reason” for the treatment must “relate to” the disability within section 24(1)(a); </p>
<p class="para">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;The treatment must, also under section 24(1)(a), be “less favourabl[e]” than the actual or hypothetical treatment accorded to a comparator, namely a non-disabled person;  </p>
<p class="para">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;The discrimination cannot be “justified” by Lewisham pursuant to section 24(2);</p>
<p class="para">(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;The resultant discrimination gives him a defence to the action for possession. </p>
<p class="para">122.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no substantial difference of principle between the parties on issues (a) and (b), although there is disagreement whether the Court of Appeal was entitled to interfere with the Judge’s conclusion on issue (a). As to issue (c), there are three questions of principle, namely how one assesses the “reason", how closely connected it has be with the disability; and whether it is necessary for the alleged discriminator to know of the disability in order for his action to be unlawful; also, on the facts of this case, Lewisham contends that the Court of Appeal was not entitled to interfere with the Judge’s conclusion. </p>
<p class="para">123.&nbsp;&nbsp;Issue (d) raises what is the most difficult and probably the most significant point of in the appeal, namely how one characterises the comparator. Lewisham does not contend that, if there is unlawful discrimination, it can be justified, so issue (e) does not arise. Issue (f) raises a point of principle as to the effect of unlawful discrimination.</p>
<p class="para">124.&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose to deal with issues (a), disability, and (b), treatment, first, as they are relatively self-contained and uncontroversial. However, issue (c), the reason’s link with the disability, and issue (d), the comparator, are connected. It is convenient to take issue (d) before issue (c), partly because issue (c) has more than one strand and partly because it is easier to deal with once issue (d) has been resolved. Issue (f), remedy, is best considered immediately after issue (d). </p>
<i><p class="qt">Did Mr Malcolm suffer from a disability?</p>
</i>
<p class="para">125.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is rightly common ground that the question whether Mr Malcolm suffered from a disability is to be determined as at the time he granted the unlawful subtenancy. By section 1(1), a person suffers from a disability “if he has a physical or mental impairment which has a substantial and long-term effect on his ability to carry on normal day-to-day activities", and there are supplementary provisions in schedule 1. The Judge held that Mr Malcolm’s schizophrenia did not have a “substantial and long-term adverse effect on his ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities” as at the time he effected the subletting. This conclusion was reversed by the Court of Appeal on the grounds that she applied, or must have applied, the wrong test for substantiality and that she did not properly consider the long-term aspect (see per Arden LJ at paras 76 to 94). </p>
<p class="para">126.&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as the proper approach is concerned, Lewisham, correctly in my opinion, did not challenge the Court of Appeal’s view that “substantial” in section 1(1) of the 1995 Act requires the effect of the disability simply to be more than minor or trivial (in accordance with the guidance given by the Employment Appeal Tribunal in <i>Goodwin v The Patent Office </i>[1999] ICR 302 at 310C). The Judge did not expressly refer to this rather low threshold, but that may well have been because it was common ground before her. </p>
<p class="para">127.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Judge’s decision on this issue was one with which any appellate court should have been slow to interfere, especially as it was commendably carefully considered and expressed. Nonetheless, I think the Court of Appeal was right to reverse it. I will give my reasons very shortly, as the facts and arguments were comprehensively explored by Arden LJ in paras 76 to 94 of her judgment. </p>
<p class="para">128.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not agree that the Judge failed properly to consider the long-term aspect: she did not have much evidence about it, and she took what evidence she had into account. However, in agreement with the Court of Appeal, I consider that the Judge was wrong to conclude that Mr Malcolm’s disability was not “substantial". It appears to me that the unchallenged evidence of the two doctors and the social worker established Mr Malcolm’s case on the issue. </p>
<p class="para">129.&nbsp;&nbsp;Much of Dr Sivasathan’s evidence is set out in para 76 of Arden LJ’s judgment. Dr Steadman said that “any decisions” made by Mr Malcolm at the relevant time “would have been likely to have been made within the context of impaired thinking and in such an impaired state, it is common for people to make decisions which are not in their best interests and this may well have been the case here.” That left open the possibility that it was not “the case” that his schizophrenia caused Mr Malcolm to effect the subletting, but it shows that Dr Steadman believed that Mr Malcolm suffered from a disability within section 1(1). </p>
<p class="para">130.&nbsp;&nbsp;It may well be that, in reaching her conclusion (which she described as “knife-edge”), the Judge was influenced by her conclusion that, when deciding to proceed with the subletting, Mr Malcolm was not significantly influenced by his schizophrenia, but that is a different question from whether he fell within section 1(1). It is true that Dr Sivasathan’s assessment, and hence Dr Steadman’s assessment, were partly based on what Mr Malcolm said, and the Judge was unimpressed with his testimony. Nonetheless, bearing in mind the relatively low threshold which a person with an undoubted disability needs to cross in order to bring himself within section 1(1), the correct conclusion in the present case was that a sufficient degree of disability was established. </p>
<i><p class="para"> The treatment to which Mr Malcolm was subjected</p>
</i>
<p class="para">131.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an uncontroversial issue in general terms, but it is not entirely easy to analyse by reference to sections 22(3)(c) and 24(1)(a). The treatment to which Mr Malcolm was, and is being, subjected can be divided up into a number of actions, namely being served with a notice to quit, being served with a claim for possession of the flat, having the action heard, having an order for possession made against him, and (albeit potentially) having a warrant of possession executed against him. Alternatively, it can be seen as a single composite action, starting with the notice to quit and ending with the execution of the warrant. Either way, it appears clear that these steps fall within the ambit of section 22(3)(c), as they either are part of the process of “evicting” Mr Malcolm or they involved “subjecting him to [an] other detriment".</p>
<p class="para">132.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would hold that, for the purposes of section 22(3)(c), a landlord should, at least normally, be treated as involved in a single exercise of “evicting” a tenant from the moment the notice to quit is served until the possession claim is concluded. That accords with the reality of the matter; each step from the decision to serve the notice to quit was taken for the purpose of evicting Mr Malcolm. It would, at least normally, not only be artificial to treat individual stages of a single exercise as discrete acts; it would also run the risk of unnecessary complication.</p>
