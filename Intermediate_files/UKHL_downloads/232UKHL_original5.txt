<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no suggestion that the revenue raised any objection to the procedural course which I have just described.  Nor did the revenue dispute that national law deprived non-resident companies of any possibility of a group income election (see the Advocate-General's opinion at p 627, para 12).  That was the basis on which the United Kingdom government fought the case in the ECJ, arguing that the differential between resident and non-resident companies was justified and was not discriminatory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first and second questions raised the main issues as to the alleged breaches of EU law.  The ECJ, agreeing with the Advocate-General, found the breaches established.  The first question was answered as follows (p 661, para 76):</p>
<p></p><ul>"The answer to the first question must therefore be that it is contrary to article 52 of the Treaty for the tax legislation of a member state, such as that in issue in the main proceedings, to afford companies resident in that member state the possibility of benefiting from a taxation regime allowing them to pay dividends to their parent company without having to pay advance corporation tax where their parent company is also resident in that member state but to deny them that possibility where their parent company has its seat in another member state."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question was answered as follows (p 665, para 96):</p>
<p></p><ul>"where a subsidiary resident in one member state has been obliged to pay advance corporation tax in respect of dividends paid to its parent company having its seat in another member state even though, in similar circumstances, the subsidiaries of parent companies resident in the first member state were entitled to opt for a taxation regime that allowed them to avoid that obligation, article 52 of the Treaty requires that resident subsidiaries and their non-resident parent companies should have an effective legal remedy in order to obtain reimbursement or reparation of the financial loss which they have sustained and from which the authorities of the member state concerned have benefited as a result of the advance payment of tax by the subsidiaries. The mere fact that the sole object of such an action is the payment of interest equivalent to the financial loss suffered as a result of the loss of use of the sums paid prematurely does not constitute a ground for dismissing such an action. While, in the absence of Community rules, it is for the domestic legal system of the member state concerned to lay down the detailed procedural rules governing such actions, including ancillary questions such as the payment of interest, those rules must not render practically impossible or excessively difficult the exercise of rights conferred by Community law."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of these rulings it was unnecessary to answer the third and fourth questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth question is restated in the judgment of the ECJ at pp 665-666, para 98, but with the addition at the end of 20 words which give a clue as to the court's eventual answer:</p>
<p></p><ul>"By its fifth question, the national court is seeking in substance to ascertain whether it is contrary to Community law for a national court to refuse or reduce a claim brought before it by a resident subsidiary and its non-resident parent company for reimbursement or reparation of the financial loss which they have suffered as a consequence of the advance payment of corporation tax by the subsidiary, on the sole ground that they did not apply to the tax authorities in order to benefit from the taxation regime which would have exempted the subsidiary from making payments in advance and did not therefore make use of the legal remedies available to them to challenge the refusals of the tax authorities, by invoking the primacy and direct effect of the provisions of Community law, where upon any view national law denied resident subsidiaries and their non-resident parent companies the benefit of that taxation regime."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118.&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequent paragraphs of this part of the judgment (paras 98-107) make clear that the ECJ was considering the issue as an alleged defence, in line with the principles stated in <i>Brasserie du Pecheur</i> and <i>Factortame</i> [1996] QB 404, based on a lack of reasonable diligence on the part of the claimant.  Nevertheless these paragraphs also emphasise the futility of requiring a claimant to adopt, at the outset of his claim, a special and possibly burdensome procedure which was doomed to failure from the start: see paras 103 ("it is not disputed that, had the claimants applied for that taxation regime, their application would have been refused by the inspector of taxes"); 104 ("since no such right to reimbursement exists under English law"); 105 ("it is thus criticising the claimants for complying with national legislation and for paying advance corporation tax without applying for the group income election regime or using the available legal remedies to challenge the refusal with which the tax authorities would inevitably have met their application"); and 106 ("had not applied for a tax advantage which national law denied them").</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119.&nbsp;&nbsp;The same line of thought is reflected in the conclusion in para 107:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The answer to the fifth question must therefore be that it is contrary to Community law for a national court to refuse or reduce a claim brought before it by a resident subsidiary and its non-resident parent company for reimbursement or reparation of the financial loss which they have suffered as a consequence of the advance payment of corporation tax by the subsidiary, on the sole ground that they did not apply to the tax authorities in order to benefit from the taxation regime which would have exempted the subsidiary from making payments in advance and that they therefore did not make use of the legal remedies available  to them to challenge the refusals of the tax authorities, by invoking the primacy and direct effect of the provisions of Community law, where upon any view national law denied resident subsidiaries and their non-resident parent companies the benefit of that taxation regime." <p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first criticism which Dr Plender made of the Court of Appeal's treatment of <i>Hoechst</i> (made by reference to the very first sentence in the judgment of Peter Gibson LJ) was that the effect of the decision was too widely stated.  I see little force in this criticism (the second sentence in the judgment qualifies the generality of the first) and little relevance in any element of criticism that might survive.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second criticism (central to Dr Plender's submissions) needs fuller examination.  It is true that the ECJ, in dealing with the fifth question, was not concerned at all with the issue of the jurisdiction of any national court, but only with whether relief should be reduced (or even refused completely) on the ground that the claimant had not shown reasonable diligence in seeking domestic remedies.  That criticism is, so far as it goes, correct.  The ECJ was not faced with the argument that the High Court did not have jurisdiction, because the revenue chose not to contest that point.  But I do not consider that this takes the revenue very far.  The clear and robust terms in which the ECJ dealt with the fifth question in paras 103 to 107 of its judgment (and the similarly robust and clear language in para 58 of the Advocate-General's opinion) leave little room for doubt that, had the question of jurisdiction been raised, it would have been disposed of in the same way, and for the same reasons.</p>
<i><p><i></i></p>
<p><i>Conclusions</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, I have set out the background to this appeal, and the issues which it raises, at some length—I fear at tedious length.  I can however state my opinion fairly shortly, especially as I have the misfortune to differ from the majority of your Lordships. With great respect to Park J, who has exceptional knowledge and experience in tax cases, I think (as the Court of Appeal did) that he underestimated the impact, in these cases, of the superior legal order constituted by EU law.  I also think that he took too narrow a view of the High Court's jurisdiction in proceedings with a tax content.  I prefer the formulation put forward by Lord Wilberforce in  <i>Vandervell</i>'<i>s </i>case [1971]  AC 912, 939 F-H (with which Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest agreed, and with which none of their Lordships positively disagreed).  That passage is quoted in the opinion of my noble and learned friend, Lord Hope of Craighead, and I need not repeat it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also respectfully differ from the view of the Court of Appeal that because of the Community principle of effectiveness it was unnecessary to address the question of jurisdiction in its purely domestic context.  The Court of Appeal had very little time to consider this difficult matter, and cannot have had the benefit of such fully developed argument as your Lordships have had.  But the general guidance given by the ECJ in <i>Peterbroeck</i> [1995]  ECR I-4599, 4621, para 14 (which I have already set out) suggests that whenever an issue is raised as to the principle of effectiveness, it is necessary to analyse the position under national jurisdictional and procedural rules.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;124.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not in this context discern any bright line between jurisdictional and procedural limitations.  Dr Plender contended that there is an important distinction, drawing attention to the phrase "in a case within its jurisdiction" used in <i>Simmenthal</i> [1978]  ECR 629, 643,  para 16, and reflected in later cases (including <i>Peterbroeck</i> [1995]  ECR I-4599,4623, para 21—"seised of a matter falling within its jurisdiction").  Jurisdiction is "an expression which is used in a variety of senses and takes its colour from its context" (Diplock LJ in <i>Anisminic Ltd v Foreign Compensation Commission</i> [1968]  2 QB 862, 888).   I am not sure what precise shade of meaning the ECJ intended it to have in this context, but I think it likely that it was being used in a fairly broad sense.  I am sure that the ECJ would have rejected as absurd (in much the same way as in <i>Peterbroeck</i> it rejected the notion that there was no court or tribunal capable of making a reference to the ECJ) any suggestion that, because tax law is involved, there is in the United Kingdom no court or tribunal with jurisdiction to hear the respondents' claims alleging serious breaches of EU law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the contrary, as the argument before your Lordships developed it seemed that each side was embracing the notion that the "remarkable impact" of EU law (the expression used by Advocate-General Jacobs in <i>Peterbroeck</i> [1995]  ECR I-4599, 4611, para 43) could if necessary transform the jurisdiction and powers of either the High Court or the special commissioners.  Dr Plender came close to submitting (though he did not put it in these colloquial terms) that the principle of effectiveness made it a zero-sum game in which anything the High Court could do, the special commissioners could do better (the same thought appears briefly in the judgment of Park J at p 608, para 38).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;126.&nbsp;&nbsp;I must with great respect differ from the view expressed in para 41 of the opinion of my noble and learned friend, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, that if taxpayer companies are time-barred before the Special Commissioners their remedy necessarily lies elsewhere.  If the companies are compelled to seek their remedy before the Special commissioners, that tribunal would have the power (and indeed the duty) to disapply any time limits which were incompatible with Community law, even if this involved an extension of their jurisdiction: see the decisions of the Court of Appeal (handed down on the same day) in two appeals from the Employment Appeal Tribunal, <i>Biggs v Somerset County Council</i> [1996]  ICR 364, 370 and <i>Staffordshire County Council v Barber </i>[1996]  ICR 379, 395 both of which expressly approve passages from the judgments of Mummery J in the Employment Appeal Tribunal ([1995] 1CR 811, 826-827 and [1995] 1 RLR 452, 459).  But if (as in those cases) the time limit was compatible with Community law, and the claimant had no remedy in the statutory tribunal, she had come to the end of the road.  Similarly the out-of-time category (i) claimants would, as it seems to me, find that they can go no further if they are required to go to the special commissioners as their first port of call, and are there held to be time-barred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;127.&nbsp;&nbsp;I come back to the position under domestic law.  As Mr Aaronson made clear in answering questions from your Lordships at the beginning of the third day of the hearing, the complaint in the test cases under the GLO is not that the claimants are entitled to group loss relief.  It is perfectly clear from the legislation ("on any view" as the ECJ said in <i>Hoechst</i> [2001] Ch 620, 666, para 98) that they are not entitled to group loss relief.  Their complaints (seeking a restitutionary remedy and/or damages, interest and costs) are that their non-entitlement to group loss relief is a serious breach of EU law (in that sense it is impossible to look at the matter in an entirely domestic context, since but for EU law, there would be no complaint.)  These claims are in my view within the jurisdiction of the High Court, in line with Lord Wilberforce's observation in <i>Vandervell</i> [1971] AC 912, 939 F-H.   They are miles away from the sort of artificial expedient which was adopted in <i>Argosam,</i> and was rightly held to be an abuse of process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;128.&nbsp;&nbsp;In paragraph 16 of his opinion my noble and learned friend, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, describes the effect of an inconsistency between a United Kingdom statute and a directly applicable provision of Community law, citing <i>R v Secretary of State for Transport, Ex p Factortame</i> [1990] 2 AC 85, 140 and <i>Imperial Chemical Industries plc v Colmer (Inspector of Taxes)</i> [1999] 1 WLR 2035, 2041.  In the latter case Lord Nolan explained (at p 2041) that the relevant provisions of the taxing statute took effect as if enacted as being "without prejudice to the directly enforceable Community rights of companies established in the Community."  It is not a matter of construing the taxing statute, but of determining whether it is overridden by a rule from a higher legal order which gives the taxpayer companies a restitutionary claim. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;129.&nbsp;&nbsp;The conclusion which I have reached seems to me to be confirmed by (but is by no means wholly dependent on) the practical difficulties and disadvantages, including the absence of GLOs, which the appellants would face in bringing their claims before the special Commissioners.  Like the Court of Appeal I think that those difficulties (which I need not repeat) are formidable and that Park J did not give enough weight to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;130.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, and for the reasons stated in the opinion of my noble and learned friend, Lord Hope of Craighead, I would dismiss these appeals.  I do not think your Lordships have to express a definite view about the tiny handful of cases (not before the House) in which there is said to be an issue on the OECD non-discrimination article and no corresponding issue of EU law.  At present my view is that they should properly go to the special commissioners, because of the plain terms of section 788 (3) of ICTA 1988.  But the revenue will no doubt consider (as Dr Plender hinted they might) whether to press for that course if it is wasteful of time and costs on both sides.</p>
