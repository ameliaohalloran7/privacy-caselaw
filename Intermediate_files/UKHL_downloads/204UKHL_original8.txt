<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;170.&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the decision of Lambeth to seek possession of the properties occupied by the <i>Bruton</i> tenants, I agree with and adopt the conclusion expressed by Lord Bingham in para 47 of his opinion.  No facts have been pleaded or alleged by the appellants which outweigh the right and the duty of Lambeth to manage its housing stock.  The wide margin of appreciation referred to in <i>Blecic</i> must be accorded to Lambeth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;171.&nbsp;&nbsp;The article 8 defences were struck out by Judge Roger Cooke.  They were in my opinion rightly struck out.  If a defendant does not plead or allege sufficient facts which, if made good, could constitute a defence, the defence can be struck out.  On the facts pleaded and alleged in the article 8 defences the defences could not have succeeded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;172.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor, in my opinion, where a home occupier has no contractual or proprietary right to remain in possession as against the owner of the property, could an article 8 defence based on no more than the personal circumstances of the occupier and his family ever succeed.  <i>Connors </i>is no authority to the contrary.  The successful article 8 defence in <i>Connors </i>was founded on a combination of Mr Connors inability to enjoy the security of tenure advantages afforded by statute to occupiers of privately owned caravan sites and on the Strasbourg court's perception (which I think was an unjustified perception) of a lack of sufficient procedural safeguards enabling him to dispute the grounds which had led the council to terminate his site licence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;173.&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the <i>Leeds </i>appeal, first, it is inconceivable, I repeat, that the part of the recreation ground occupied by the caravans could in two days have become the Maloney home for article 8 purposes.  But, second, even if that were not so, Leeds had an unimpeachable right to evict them and restore the site to use as a recreation ground for the benefit of the public generally.  No court, domestic or in Strasbourg, has ever suggested that a person who enters and remains on land as a trespasser can assert an article 8 right to respect for the home he has unlawfully established on the land as a defence to the owner's eviction proceedings.  In <i>Connors </i>the defendant did not enter as a trespasser.  He had for some fourteen years held a licence entitling him to park his caravans on the caravan site.  When the article 8(2) balance is struck in a case with facts like those in the <i>Leeds</i> case the balance must at once come down with a resounding clank in favour of the local authority.  An article 8 defence in such a case could not ever succeed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;174.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, and in agreement with the reasons given by my noble and learned friends Lord Hope of Craighead, Baroness Hale of Richmond and Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood, these appeals should in my opinion be dismissed. And, for the avoidance of any doubt I wish to express my agreement, in particular, with the whole of Lord Hope's para 110.</p>
<p><b>LORD WALKER OF GESTINGTHORPE</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;175.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the advantage of reading in draft the speeches of my noble and learned friends Lord Bingham of Cornhill and Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead.  I agree that these appeals should be dismissed for the reasons which they give.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;176.&nbsp;&nbsp;In an earlier draft of this speech I tried to envisage the sort of highly exceptional circumstances in which (as in <i>Connors v United Kingdom</i> (2004) 40 EHRR 189) domestic law might fail to show the respect for the home required by article 8 of the Convention.  On reflection, however, I think that such an exercise would be speculative and unhelpful.  As Lord Bingham says, the practical experience of county court judges is likely to prove the surest guide, so long as they bear in mind the stringency of the test.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;177.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in full agreement with Lord Bingham on the issue of judicial precedent.  I am also in full agreement with my noble and learned friend Lord Scott of Foscote on the private law issue which arises in the <i>Lambeth</i> appeal. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BARONESS HALE OF RICHMOND</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;178.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the advantage of reading, indeed of re-reading several times, the draft opinions circulated by your Lordships. I agree with, and have nothing to add to, the opinions of my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill, on the question of precedent, and of my noble and learned friend, Lord Scott of Foscote, on the issue of domestic law arising in the <i>Lambeth</i> cases. On the main issues, however, while there are many points upon which we are all agreed, there is one matter upon which we remain divided. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;179.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there is no reason to suppose that the actual outcome of the decision of this House in <i>Harrow London Borough Council v Qazi</i> [2004] 1 AC 983 was incompatible with Mr Qazi's right to respect for his home guaranteed by article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The European Court of Human Rights would not otherwise have found his complaint inadmissible. However, if the <i>ratio decidendi</i> of the majority's decision was that the enforcement of a right to possession in accordance with the domestic law of property can <i>never</i> be incompatible with that right, then it must now be modified in the light of the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in <i>Connors v United Kingdom</i> (2004) 40 EHRR 189. There both the local authority and the court had acted entirely in accordance with the domestic law but the United Kingdom was nevertheless held to have acted in breach of article 8.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;180.&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, however, we are all agreed that in the vast majority of cases, the right of a public landowner to enforce a claim to possession of his own land in accordance with the relevant domestic law would automatically supply the justification required by article 8(2) for an interference with the occupier's right to respect for his home. By definition, it would be "in accordance with the law"; it would serve the legitimate aim of protecting the property rights of the landowner and in some cases the rights of neighbouring occupiers; and it would be proportionate to that aim, the proper balance between the competing rights having been struck by Parliament: see Lord Bingham at paras 35, 36. If that is so, in most cases, granting a possession order in accordance with the domestic law would be the only means available of protecting the right which the landowner wished to assert, and thus could not be disproportionate in the individual case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;181.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we are all agreed that there can be no question of requiring the public landowner to plead and prove individual justification for that interference in every case: see Lord Bingham at para 29. This was Mr Luba's bold submission to us on behalf of the occupiers in these cases. He was right to make that submission, as he recognised that it was the logical consequence of the case which he was putting forward: that the analysis adopted by the Strasbourg court in the cases found admissible should also be adopted in county and sheriff courts up and down the land when considering any claim for the possession of premises where a person lives. Is it the defendant's home? Will the order interfere with his right to respect for that home? Is that interference in accordance with the law? Does it serve a legitimate aim? Is the interference "necessary in a democratic society", ie proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued? </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;182.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I understand it, none of your lordships accepts that the sequential approach adopted in Strasbourg to the cases which it declares admissible should be adopted in the general run of possession actions. This is because the court is entitled to make two assumptions. The first is that the domestic law has struck the right balance between the competing interests involved: those of a person occupying premises as his home and those of the landowner seeking to regain possession of those premises in accordance with the law. The second is that the landowner, if a public authority, has acted compatibly with the Convention rights of the individual occupier in deciding to enforce its proprietary rights. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;183.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence it is only if the occupier advances grounds for challenging either or both of those assumptions that there need be any modification to present practice. Under the Civil Procedure Rules, rule 24(2), the court may give summary judgment against a defendant if it considers that the defendant has no real prospect of successfully defending the claim. This is similar to but wider than the power to strike out all or part of the written statement of case in CPR, rule 3.4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;184.&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, so good. Let us next suppose a <i>Connors</i> type of case. There an argument could readily be raised that United Kingdom property law did not strike the right balance. Someone who had lived, perfectly lawfully, on a designated gypsy caravan site for many years could be evicted without any good cause being shown, whereas someone who lived on a site governed by the Mobile Homes Act 1983 could only be evicted for cause. The gypsies had no means of challenging the reasons why the local authority wanted to evict them. This discrimination could not be justified. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;185.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, we are all agreed that it must be possible for the defendant in a possession action to claim that the balance between respect for his home and the property rights of the owner,  struck by the general law in the type of case of which his is an example, does not comply with the Convention. We also agree that the cases in which such a claim will have a real prospect of success are rare. This is an area of the law much trampled over by the legislature as it has tried to respond to shifting and conflicting social and economic pressures. If there were enough suitable and affordable housing to share amongst those who needed it there would be no problem. But there is not, so priorities have to be established, either by Parliament or by the public sector landlord, who has to allocate this scarce resource in accordance with the priorities set by Parliament. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;186.&nbsp;&nbsp;The balance has changed over time in accordance with what were perceived to be the needs of the time. Once upon a time, it was thought necessary to control the freedom of private landlords to let for such terms and on such rents as the market allowed. Public sector landlords, on the other hand, could be left to manage the public housing stock in a responsible manner. Then things changed. Controls over private landlords were progressively relaxed, although never abandoned, with a view to expanding the supply of privately rented homes. Controls over public sector landlords, on the other hand, were increased and public sector tenants were given the security which previously only private sector tenants had enjoyed. This and other measures reduced the supply of public sector rented homes. These were all intensely political judgments. The extent to which, and the terms on which, public authorities should be engaged in providing housing for those who for whatever reason cannot or will not buy it on the private market was one of the most politically controversial issues of the 20th century. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;187.&nbsp;&nbsp;To the extent that a court insists that a public authority does not rely upon its right to evict an occupier, it is obliging that public authority to continue to supply that person with a home in circumstances where Parliament has not obliged (and may not even have empowered) it to do so. In this politically contentious area of social and economic policy, any court should think long and hard before intervening in the balance currently struck by the elected legislature.  There may be more scope for argument in a case not covered by statute, but the most obvious example of that is a trespasser who has never had any right to occupy the premises in question. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;188.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also agreed as to the procedural route whereby a challenge to the general law may be made. The Human Rights Act 1998, section 7(1),  provides that a person who wishes to rely upon his Convention rights may do so either in a free-standing action or by defending an action brought against him by a public authority. In those very rare cases where a person may be evicted from his home without any court order at all, a challenge would have to raised by way of a free-standing action or judicial review. Otherwise, a defence can be raised in the possession action itself. However, the county court will not always be able to supply a remedy. In some cases the statute under which it is operating may be sufficiently flexible to enable the argument to be accommodated. But in many others, it will not. The very source of the complaint of incompatibility will be the inflexibility of the statutory scheme, leaving no discretion to the county court. The court will then have to decide whether the interpretative obligation in section 3 of the 1998 Act will enable it to solve the problem. If not, the matter could only be resolved by a declaration of incompatibility in the High Court, which would have no effect upon the outcome of the individual case. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;189.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus far I believe that we are all agreed. But, as I understand it, some of your Lordships would go further and accept that there may be highly exceptional cases in which the occupier could argue that his individual personal circumstances made the application of the general law disproportionate in his case.  When, if at all, should the court be able to say that, even though there is no obligation to continue to provide housing in these circumstances, it is not "necessary in a democratic society" to permit the landowner to assert its property rights?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;190.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, I myself do not think that the purpose of article 8 was to oblige a social landlord to continue to supply housing to a person who has no right in domestic law to continue to be supplied with that housing, assuming that the general balance struck by domestic law was not amenable to attack and that the authority's decision to invoke that law was not open to judicial review on conventional grounds. It should not be forgotten that in an appropriate case, the range of considerations which any public authority should take into account in deciding whether to invoke its powers can be very wide: see eg <i>R v Lincolnshire County Council and Wealden District Council, Ex p Atkinson, Wales and Stratford</i> (1995) 8 Admin LR 529, <i>R (Casey and others) v Crawley Borough Council</i> [2006] EWHC 301 (Admin).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;191.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that article 8 entails both negative obligations - not to interfere - and positive obligations - to secure the right to respect for a person's private and family life, his home and his correspondence. But it does not confer any right to health or welfare benefits or to housing. The extent to which any member state assumes responsibility for supplying these is very much a matter for that member state. In this country, housing law defines the extent of the obligation and the power to provide housing at public expense. Social services law defines the extent of the obligation to provide services (which sometimes includes assistance with housing) for vulnerable people, such as children, the elderly, the sick and the disabled. If social services law does not provide assistance to an occupier whose personal circumstances are said to make eviction from this particular accommodation disproportionate, then I question whether housing law should be made to do so. In an appropriate case, it is incumbent upon the housing authority to liaise with the social services and education authorities before deciding to take action. There is nothing in the jurisprudence to indicate that article 8 requires more of them than is already required. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;192.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Convention began life as a code of individual civil and political rights, not a code of social and economic rights. The distinction between the two is not clear cut, particularly in the context of article 8. But to refuse to allow a landowner to recover possession of the dwelling to which he is entitled is to impose upon him a positive obligation to continue to make those premises available to the occupier. There might be more scope for argument where the claim lies in common law unregulated by legislation, but in such cases the landowner is likely to be a private person, upon whom no such positive obligation could be laid, or the occupiers are likely to be squatters who have never had a right to occupy the premises. There is nothing yet in the Strasbourg jurisprudence to require a reconsideration of the rule in <i>McPhail v Persons, Names Unknown</i> [1973] Ch 447. In common, therefore, with my noble and learned friends Lord Scott of Foscote and Lord Brown of Eaton under Heywood, I agree with the conclusions reached by my noble and learned friend, Lord Hope of Craighead, set out in paragraph 110. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;193.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of the cases before us is a classic example of one in which a defence based upon article 8 would have no real prospect of success. In the <i>Leeds</i> case, it cannot plausibly be asserted that the respondents had established a home on the recreation ground. There was therefore no Convention right to be interfered with. In the <i>Lambeth</i> cases, the occupiers had undoubtedly established homes in the dwellings but they had done so on terms which made them vulnerable, like many sub-tenants, to the superior claims of the landowner.  Lambeth's attempts to evict them were in accordance with the law and in pursuit of the legitimate aim of regaining control over this short life housing stock.  All the "<i>Bruton</i> tenants" were offered alternative accommodation. It would take a very different case from that pleaded to give their claims to remain in the particular dwellings occupied a real prospect of success. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;194.&nbsp;&nbsp;In agreement with all of your lordships, therefore, I would dismiss both appeals.</p>
<p><b>LORD BROWN OF EATON-UNDER-HEYWOOD</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;195.&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important single question arising upon these appeals is to my mind whether a trial judge, seised of a home repossession claim, must in every case where the occupier seeks to raise an article 8 defence consider, however peremptorily, whether the particular facts of the case enable (indeed require) him to make an order (either withholding or postponing possession) more favourable to the occupier than would be permissible under the applicable domestic property law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;196.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Harrow London Borough Council v Qazi</i> [2004]  1 AC 983, the House by a majority held that "contractual and proprietary rights to possession cannot be defeated by a defence based on article 8" (Lord Hope of Craighead para 84); "there is no lack of respect and no infringement of article 8, where the [possession] order is made in favour of the person entitled to possession by national law" (Lord Millett para 107); "Article 8 cannot be raised to defeat contractual and proprietary rights to possession" (Lord Scott of Foscote para 149).  The dissenting view of the minority (Lord Bingham of Cornhill and Lord Steyn) was that in every home repossession case the question of justification under article 8(2), if raised, has to be considered although the domestic property law is "likely to be crucial" (Lord Bingham para 12) and "the occasions on which a court would be justified in declining to make a possession order would be very highly exceptional" (Lord Bingham para 25).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;197.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now contended by the appellants that two subsequent decisions of the European Court of Human Rights, <i>Connors v United Kingdom</i> (2004)  40 EHRR 189 and <i>Blecic v Croatia</i> (2004)  41 EHRR 185, are inconsistent with the majority view in <i>Qazi</i> and support instead the approach of the minority.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;198.&nbsp;&nbsp;For my part I would accept that the recent Strasbourg jurisprudence requires some qualification to be placed on the <i>Qazi</i> principle; I cannot, however, agree that it requires, as the minority in <i>Qazi</i> suggested, the consideration (even if usually only the most cursory consideration) of an article 8 defence every time it is raised.  My opinion is rather, and at this stage I state it very broadly, that although article 8 is clearly engaged in every home repossession case, its requirements are satisfied provided only and always, first, that the substantive domestic law under which the order is sought strikes an acceptable balance between the competing needs and rights at stake and, secondly, that that law is properly applied by the domestic court with the occupier being given a fair opportunity to invoke any defence available to him under it.  If either of those two conditions is not satisfied then, I accept, a complaint would properly sound under article 8.  But, as I shall seek to show, it by no means follows that article 8 provides the occupier in such cases with a freestanding defence independent of whatever rights he may have under domestic law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;199.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Connors</i> exemplifies a failure of the first condition: the domestic law under which possession was sought and ordered could not be justified: only gypsies (indeed only gypsies living on local authority caravan sites) were excluded from the protection afforded by the Mobile Homes Act 1983 to those living in caravans or mobile homes as their only or main residence.  I shall return to <i>Connors</i> in a little more detail later.  <i>Blecic</i> illustrates the application of both conditions although in the event the European Court of Human Rights found that both were satisfied: Croatia's domestic law, under which a specially-protected tenancy was terminable if the tenant was unjustifiably absent for six months, was held to be within the wide margin of appreciation available to a state in implementing social and economic policy; and the domestic law had been reasonably and fairly applied—"the bodies, judicial amongst others, that are called upon to interpret and apply the laws in force" being afforded the same "wide margin of appreciation" as "the domestic legislature" (para 65).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;200.&nbsp;&nbsp;The modest qualification which <i>Connors</i> now requires to be made to the <i>Qazi</i> principle is that a defence to possession proceedings based upon the contention that our domestic law is incompatible with the occupier's article 8 rights is theoretically available to him.  I say <i>theoretically available</i> because it seems to me that it will not in fact be open to the trial judge (whether in the High Court or, as will almost invariably be the case, the county court) to decide the case other than in accordance with the domestic law.  Take, for example, the case of <i>Connors</i> itself.  Because the local authority there, once the defendant had disputed the original ground (essentially nuisance in breach of his licence conditions) on which possession was sought, relied instead on its absolute right to terminate his licence on notice, there was simply no answer to the claim under domestic law.  The European Court Human Rights found this law unjustifiable; the government having failed in its attempt to justify the exclusion of local authority gypsy sites from the protection otherwise available under the Mobile Homes Act.  Rather the Court concluded, consistently with its judgment in <i>Chapman v United Kingdom</i> (2001)  33 EHRR 399 (a planning case, of course, not a possession case), that, because of "the vulnerable position of gypsies as a minority", article 8 imposes "a positive obligation" on the state "to facilitate the gypsy way of life" (para 84).  The Court therefore concluded that the eviction "was not attended by the requisite procedural safeguards, namely the requirement to establish proper justification for the serious interference with his rights and consequently cannot be regarded as justified by a 'pressing social need' or proportionate to the legitimate aim being pursued" and so was in violation of article 8 (para 94).  That this was because of the deficiency in the substantive domestic law, however, is plain from the terms in which the Court rejected Mr Connors' further complaint under article 13:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Article 13 does not go so far as to guarantee a remedy allowing a contracting state's primary legislation to be challenged before a national authority on grounds that it is contrary to the Convention.  The applicant's complaints related in essence to the exemption conferred on local authority gypsy sites by the Mobile Homes Act 1983." (para 109)<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, indeed, a striking resemblance between <i>Connors</i> and the earlier (non-gypsy) case of <i>Larkos v Cyprus</i> (1999)  30 EHRR 597 in which the European Court of Human Rights found a violation of article 14 taken in conjunction with article 8 because Larkos<i>,</i> as a government tenant, did not enjoy the same security of tenure under domestic law as was enjoyed by tenants of private landlords.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;201.&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the decision in <i>Connors</i> the domestic legislation was amended.  With effect from 18 January 2005 section 4 of the Caravan Sites Act 1968 was amended by section 211 of the Housing Act 2004 to permit the county court to suspend, for up to twelve months at a time, any possession order in respect of a local authority caravan site which the court would otherwise be bound to make.  Now, therefore, the county court would be entitled to suspend the order made against someone in Mr Connors' position; previously, it was not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;202.&nbsp;&nbsp;By the same token moreover that the county court judge would have been unable, under the pre-existing law, to decline or postpone a possession order in the case of someone in Mr Connors' position, so too in my judgment he is unable in other cases to give greater effect or weight to the occupier's right to respect for his home than is allowed for under domestic law, whether that law is to be found in legislation or under the common law, or indeed a mixture of both.  I refer to a mixture of both because there will be many cases where the landlord's contractual or proprietorial rights fall to be determined essentially under the common law but which nevertheless are affected by general statutory provisions.  Section 3 of the Protection from Eviction Act 1977, for example, under the heading, Prohibition of eviction without due process of law, precludes the owner from enforcing his right to recover possession of his premises once the tenancy comes to an end "otherwise than by proceedings in the court".  And section 89 of the Housing Act 1980, under the heading, Restriction on discretion of court in making orders for possession of land, prevents the court in certain cases from postponing (whether by the order or any variation, suspension or stay of execution) the giving up of possession of premises for more than 14 days, save where that would cause "exceptional hardship" when the total permitted postponement is extended to six weeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;203.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, where the domestic law requires the court to make a judgment (most notably perhaps in those cases under Schedule 2 to the Housing Act 1985 where repossession can only be ordered if the court considers it reasonable), or to exercise a discretion, the judge will bear in mind that he is performing this task in the context of the defendant's article 8 right to respect for his home.  But where under domestic law the owner's right to possession is plainly made out (whether at common law or, for example, under the legislation providing for assured short-hold tenancies or introductory tenancies), the judge in my opinion has no option but to assume that our domestic law properly strikes the necessary balances between competing interests (as envisaged in paras 32 and 33 of my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham's judgment) and that in applying it properly he is accordingly discharging his duty under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.  Where section 89 of the Housing Act 1980 applies, the judge will to that extent have a discretion to postpone possession.  That apart, however, he has no discretion and the order must be made, leading to the eventual execution of the warrant for possession. Where no statutory protection is afforded to occupiers that should be assumed to be Parliament's will: sometimes that will be clearly evident from the terms of  the governing legislation (as in the cases considered by Lord Bingham in para 35); even, however, where the owner's rights arise at common law, the absence of statutory protection must surely be, as my noble and learned friend Lord Hope suggests, the result of a deliberate decision by Parliament to leave the owner's right to recover possession in these cases unqualified.  As Lord Bingham observes at para 36, it is not unrealistic to regard the general law as striking the required balance.</p>
