<p class="para">67.&nbsp;&nbsp;A probation officer’s pre-sentence report assessed Mr Lee as a medium risk of reconviction but a high risk of causing serious harm to Mrs Lee “or alternatively any other woman with whom he may form a close attachment".  A consultant forensic psychiatrist, Dr Wilson, said that during childhood Mr Lee had developed a range of emotional and behavioural problems with poor temper control and a limited ability to cope with stress and he could therefore be said to suffer from a personality disorder with a mixture of dissocial, emotionally unstable and obsessional traits.</p>
<p class="para">68.&nbsp;&nbsp;Following sentence, reports at his local prison, HMP Forest Bank, described Mr Lee as motivated to change and actively seeking out offending behaviour programmes.  No accredited coursework was, however, available to him.</p>
<p class="para">69.&nbsp;&nbsp;Following a hearing on 30 June 2006 (some four and a half months after his tariff expiry date) the Parole Board noted that, through no fault of his own, Mr Lee had yet to attend the required programmes to address the risk factors which Mr Wilson had identified.  The Board concluded that “the alcohol and violence risk factors must be addressed in closed conditions before your risk is sufficiently reduced to enable you to be transferred to open conditions".</p>
<p class="para">70.&nbsp;&nbsp;Over a year later, on 21 August 2007, the prison probation officer reported that “due to the current overcrowding and difficulties with allocation of IPP prisoners to first stage lifer prisons, Mr Lee has not had the opportunity to sit a sentence plan Board” and that he needed accredited courses.</p>
<p class="para">71.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parole Board had intended a further review of Mr Lee’s case in January 2008 but for want of the necessary assessments and reports the hearing was postponed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">72.&nbsp;&nbsp;On 7 March 2008, following Mr Lee’s judicial review application on 27 February 2008, he was transferred to HMP Wymott where a number of assessments were then carried out.  On 20 June 2008 it was recommended that Mr Lee be assessed for the Healthy Relationships Programme (HRP) to explore what psychological risk factors were present.</p>
<p class="para">73.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lee’s judicial review hearing before Moses LJ was on 24 and 25 July 2008.  Also on 25 July the Parole Board reviewed Mr Lee’s case but deferred their decision until receipt of Moses LJ’s judgment (which they did not get until 6 October).  In the meantime, on 18 September 2008, Mr Lee was transferred to HMP Erlestoke to be assessed for the HRP.  For this reason the Parole Board on 24 October 2008 again deferred their review of the case until after Mr Lee’s assessment for, and, if found suitable, completion of, the HRP.</p>
<p class="para">74.&nbsp;&nbsp;The three months’ HRP was due to start on 30 October 2008 but in the event did not.  Quite why is a matter of dispute but essentially it appears that there were aspects of the course which Mr Lee was not prepared to undertake because of his concern about their impact on his mental health (he having previously suffered from depression), at any rate without assurances of adequate support in this regard.</p>
<p class="para">75.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the result, the Parole Board issued further decisions respectively on 22 December 2008 and 12 January 2009 expressing deep concern about the apparent impasse now reached.  The Secretary of State for his part contends that it is not for the Parole Board to manage Mr Lee’s sentence and that they should cease deferring his case and instead decide it.  None of this, of course, is entirely satisfactory but clearly none of it can affect the outcome of these appeals.</p>
<p class="paraleft">Mr Wells</p>
<p class="para">76.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Wells is aged 25.  On 14 November 2005, for the attempted robbery of a taxi driver, he was sentenced at Bolton Crown Court to IPP with the minimum term of 12 months less 58 days on remand, consecutive to an extended sentence with a custodial term of 12 months imposed at the same court on 15 August 2005 for offences of criminal damage, theft, common assault and assault with intent to resist arrest, and a concurrent sentence of two years for possession of a class B drug.  He had previous convictions from 1997 onwards for both violent and acquisitive offences, linked to the misuse of drugs, his first custodial sentence being nine months in a Young Offender Institution at the age of 15.  He had been remanded in custody on 10 June 2005 so that his tariff expiry date was 17 September 2006.</p>
<p class="para">77.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pre-sentence reports assessed him at high risk of reconviction but as posing a low risk of causing serious harm save for a medium risk with regard to prison staff.</p>
<p class="para">78.&nbsp;&nbsp;In March 2006 HMP Forest Bank reported that Mr Wells was motivated to address his offending behaviour but was having difficulties in prison including seven adjudications against him.  The report recommended that he engage in programmes for PASRO (Prison: Addressing Substance Related Offending), ETS (Enhanced Thinking Skills), CALM (Controlling Anger and Learning to Manage It) and Victim Awareness.  None of these, however, was available to him.</p>
<p class="para">79.&nbsp;&nbsp;On 23 March 2007 Mr Wells issued his first judicial review application (as to which see para 30(i) of this opinion).  On 19 April 2007 Sullivan J ordered the Parole Board to hear Mr Wells’s case on 9 May which it duly did.  On 15 May 2007, however, the Board decided not to direct his release.  It accepted that Mr Wells wanted to undertake the necessary offending behaviour courses and that it was not his fault that they were unavailable to him, and indeed would remain so until he was moved to another prison.  Until they were completed, however, the Board’s view was that his risk would remain high.</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p class="para">80.&nbsp;&nbsp;On 18 December 2007 an OASys (Offender Assessment System) rated Mr Wells as at high risk of reconviction and as posing a high risk of harm to the public.</p>
<p class="para">81.&nbsp;&nbsp;On 29 March 2008 Mr Wells was recommended for the same courses as had been recommended two years previously and which still remained unavailable to him.  On 29 May 2008 his supervisor recorded Mr Wells’s “almost intolerable” frustration with his lack of progress, a hardly surprising reaction on his part.  </p>
<p class="para">82.&nbsp;&nbsp;On 26 June 2008, shortly after his second judicial review application was issued on 4 June, Mr Wells was transferred to HMP Risley.  Whilst there he has undertaken the PASRO course (between 22 August and 26 September 2008, making extremely positive progress), the ETS course (between 28 October and 3 December 2008), and the CALM course (begun on 6 January 2009 and due to be completed on 3 March 2009).</p>
<p class="paraleft">Mr James</p>
<p class="para">83.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr James is aged 23.  On 28 September 2005 in the Leeds Crown Court he was sentenced to IPP (with a tariff of two years less time on remand) having pleaded guilty to unlawful wounding with intent: on 14 August 2005 he had smashed two beer glasses into a man’s face at a public house.  On 26 August 2005 he was remanded in custody.  His tariff period therefore expired on 20 July 2007.</p>
<p class="para">84.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr James had previous convictions from the age of 17 for, amongst other things, battery, common assault, affray, disorderly behaviour, racially abusive behaviour and assault occasioning actual bodily harm.</p>
<p class="para">85.&nbsp;&nbsp;After sentence Mr James remained at his local prison, HMP Doncaster, and whilst there took all such courses as he was able to take: an IT course through “Learn Direct", a first aid course and a Think First course (similar to an ETS).  More particularly recommended, however, were ASRO (Addressing Substance Related Offending), CALM and PASRO courses, none of which were available to him whilst he remained at HMP Doncaster.  He was not transferred to HMP Lindholme, a first stage prison, until 21 December 2007, five months after his tariff expiry date.  Meanwhile, on 21 May 2007 (before his tariff expired) Mr James had issued judicial review proceedings and (as stated at para 30(ii) of this opinion) on 20 August 2007 obtained from Collins J an order for his immediate release, stayed pending appeal.  On 14 September 2007, in the light of that order and at the request of Mr James’s counsel, the Parole Board granted deferral of their hearing until after the appeal.  Ultimately, on 14 March 2008 (some six weeks after the Court of Appeal’s decision) Mr James was released on the Board’s recommendation without ever in fact undergoing the recommended courses in the circumstances explained in para 53 of this opinion.</p>
<p class="lawlord">LORD MANCE</p>
<p class="mylords">My Lords,</p>
<p class="para">86.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the benefit of reading in draft the speeches of my noble and learned friends, Lord Hope of Craighead, Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood and Lord Judge. In agreement with all of their speeches and for the reasons they give, I also agree that all three appeals fail and must be dismissed.</p>
<p class="lawlord">LORD JUDGE</p>
<p class="mylords">My Lords,</p>
<p class="para">87.&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of the dangerous offender is perennial. The sentence for imprisonment for public protection (IPP) created by section 225 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (the 2003 Act) represents the penal system’s most recent endeavour to address the problem. The sentence of imprisonment for life (whether mandatory or discretionary) is familiar and needs no further discussion.  IPP is the second indeterminate sentence now available to sentencing courts.  The relevant provisions were brought into effect on 4 April 2005.  The previous provisions relating to dangerous offenders found in the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 (the 2000 Act), other than those related to imprisonment for life, were entirely replaced.  With effect from 14 July 2008 many of the provisions relating to the new sentence were amended by the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 (the 2008 Act).  These appeals are concerned with the effect of the legislation in force before the latest amendments.</p>
<i><p class="paraleft">The Legislative Structures</p></i>
<p class="para">88.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before 4 April 2005, section 79(2)(b) of the 2000 Act, itself repeating section 2(2)(b) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991, as subsequently amended, provided the sentencing court with power to pass a “longer than commensurate sentence” on a dangerous offender who had committed a violent or sexual offence (as defined in the legislation).  The court was required to assess the sentence which would be commensurate with the seriousness of the offence, or the combination of one or more offences associated with it, and to order “…such longer term (not exceeding that maximum) as in the opinion of the court is necessary to protect the public from serious harm from the offender".</p>
<p class="para">89.&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence was not an indeterminate sentence.  To provide public protection it could and sometimes did result in the imposition of very prolonged periods of imprisonment, significantly beyond the normal punitive level. Release was subject to the ordinary principles which applied to determinate sentences.</p>
<p class="para">90.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parole Board was responsible for the release of prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment.  This was governed by section 28 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 (the 1997 Act).  This provides:</p>
<p class="qt">“… (5)  As soon as -</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;a life prisoner to whom this section applies has served the relevant part of his sentence,</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;the Parole Board has directed his release under this section,</p>
<p>it shall be the duty of the Secretary of State to release him on licence.</p>
<p>(6) The Parole Board shall not give a direction under sub-section (5) above with respect to a life prisoner to whom this section applies unless -</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;the Secretary of State has referred the prisoner’s case to the Board; and</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;the Board is satisfied that it is no longer necessary for the protection of the public that the prisoner should be confined.</p>
<p>(7)    A life prisoner to whom this section applies may require the Secretary of State to refer his case to the Parole Board at any time - </p>
<p>(a)  after he has served the relevant part of his sentence; and</p>
<p>(b)  where there has been a previous reference of his case to the Board, after the end of the period of 2 years beginning with the disposal of that reference; and</p>
<p>(c)  where he is also serving a sentence of imprisonment or detention for a term, after he has served one half of that sentence…”</p>
<p class="para">91.&nbsp;&nbsp;The long understood residual jurisdiction of the Secretary of State to order the release of a prisoner on compassionate grounds is currently embodied in section 30(1) of the 1997 Act.  This provides:</p>
<p class="qt">“The Secretary of State may at any time release a life prisoner on licence if he is satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist which justify the prisoner’s release on compassionate grounds.”</p>
<p class="paraleft">The exercise of the Secretary of State’s power has nothing to do with the administration of the prison regime, nor with the amelioration of its deficiencies. Rather it addresses circumstances personal to or involving the individual prisoner, or his family, which properly justify the exercise of executive clemency.  Section 30(1) does not abrogate or amend any of the specific responsibilities exclusively vested in the Parole Board by section 28(6) of the Act, nor provide a route by which the Secretary of State may assume or exercise these responsibilities for himself.</p>
<p class="para">92.&nbsp;&nbsp;The structures for dealing with dangerous offenders were radically altered by Chapter 5 of the 2003 Act.  Section 225 provides :</p>
<p class="qt">“(1)  This section applies where -</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;a person aged 18 or over is convicted of a serious offence committed after the commencement of this section, and</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;the court is of the opinion that there is significant risk to members of the public of serious harm occasioned by the commission by him of further specified offences.”</p>
<p class="para">93.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 225 continues:</p>
<p class="qt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(2) If -</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;the offence is one in respect of which &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the offender apart from this section be &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;liable to imprisonment for life, and</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;the court considers that the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seriousness of the offence, or of the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offence and one or more offences &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;associated with it, is such as to justify &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the imposition of a sentence of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;imprisonment for life,</p>
<p>the court must impose a sentence of imprisonment for life.</p>
<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;In a case not falling within sub-section (2), the court must impose a sentence of imprisonment for public protection.</p>
<p>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;A sentence of imprisonment for public protection is a sentence of imprisonment for an indeterminate period, subject to the provisions of Chapter 2 of Part 2 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 as to the release of prisoners and duration of licences… “ </p>
<p class="para">94.&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar provisions are made for sentencing young offenders to detention for public protection, but they need no special attention in the present context.  More significant is the creation of the new extended sentence (new, that is, in substance, but confusingly, not in name, because the name of an earlier utterly different sentence found in section 85 of the 2000 Act is reused).  The release of the prisoner during the second half of the custodial term involves the recommendation of the Parole Board.  Section 247(3) of the 2003 Act therefore adds yet further to its burdens.</p>
<p class="para">95.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 224(3) defines serious harm as “death or serious personal injury, whether physical or psychological", and for the purposes of IPP must result from the commission of “specified offences” as defined in section 224(1) and (3).  The number of such offences is multitudinous; some are at what can properly be described as the lower end of criminality, but all, or virtually all, involve danger to life or limb or interference with sexual autonomy.  In the course of an invaluable analysis of the statutory provisions, intended to provide sentencing judges with guidance about the circumstances in which the new sentence should be imposed, in <i>R v Lang and others</i> [2006] 1 WLR 2509 Rose LJ observed that the imposition of the sentence required that risk should be established “in relation to two matters: first, the commission of further specified, but not necessarily serious, offences; and, secondly, the causing thereby of serious harm to members of the public".  He emphasised that the risk must be a significant risk, and that the threshold was higher than the “mere possibility of occurrence".  However, all that said, when addressing a possible IPP the sentencing court is not exercising a broad sentencing discretion.  In truth it is making a predictive judgment whether the offender represents a significant risk to public safety.  If he does, but a sentence of imprisonment for life would be inappropriate, an IPP must be ordered.  There is no broad judicial discretion by the exercise of which an offender may be permitted to escape from the consequences of a finding that he represents the risk described in the statute.</p>
<p class="para">96.&nbsp;&nbsp;In making this judgment, the court is directed to consider and apply section 229 of the Act.  This provides that in making the assessment of the dangerousness of the offender who has not previously been convicted of any relevant offence, the court</p>
<p class="qt">“(a) must take into account all such information as is available to it about the nature and circumstances of the offence,</p>
<p class="qt">(b)  may take into account any information which is before it about any pattern of behaviour of which the offence forms part, and</p>
<p class="qt">(c)  may take into account any information about the offender which is before it.” (sub-s(2))</p>
<p class="para">97.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, however, the offender has previous relevant convictions, that is convictions for any specified offence,</p>
<p class="qt">“…the court must assume that there is such a risk as is  mentioned in sub-section (1)(b) unless, after taking into account - </p>
<p class="qt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)  all such information as is available to it about &nbsp;&nbsp;the nature and circumstances of each of the &nbsp;&nbsp;offences,</p>
<p class="qt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)  where appropriate, any information which is &nbsp;&nbsp;before it about any pattern of behaviour of &nbsp;&nbsp;which any of &nbsp;&nbsp;the offences forms part, and</p>
<p class="qt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)  any information about the offender which is &nbsp;&nbsp;before it,</p>
<p class="paraleft">&nbsp;&nbsp;the court considers that it would be unreasonable to conclude that &nbsp;&nbsp;there is such a risk".</p>
<p class="para">98.&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, IPP may be ordered whether or not an adult offender has previous convictions, if in the judgment of the court he is dangerous. However in making the assessment in relation to an offender with relevant previous convictions, there is an assumption that he is to be assessed as dangerous, unless this conclusion would be unreasonable.  In the end, however, section 229 is directed to evidential questions, appropriate to inform the judgment of the court: it does not affect the consequences which would follow from that judgment.</p>
<p class="para">99.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>R v Johnson and others</i> [2007] 1 CAR (S) 112, the Court of Appeal Criminal Division considered a number of cases which raised questions arising from the dangerous offender provisions in section 225.  The court observed:</p>
<p class="qt">“…Before analysing the relevant provisions, we should emphasise that even a cursory glance at them makes it plain that the sentence is concerned with <i>future </i>risk and public protection.  Although punitive in its effect, with far reaching consequences for the offender on whom it is imposed, strictly speaking it does not represent punishment for past offending.  As any such assessment of future risk must be based on the information available to the court when sentence is passed, the potential for distraction from the real issue is obvious.  Nevertheless, when the information before the court is evaluated, for the purposes of this sentence, the decision is directed not to the past, but to the future, and the future protection of the public".</p>
<p class="para">100.&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the many changes to the sentencing framework brought about by the 2003 Act, section 142(1) requires every court passing sentence to have regard to five specific purposes of sentencing. These are </p>
<p class="qt">“(a) the punishment of offenders,</p>
<p class="qt">(b) the reduction of crime (including its reduction by        deterrence),</p>
<p class="qt">(c)  the reform and rehabilitation of offenders,</p>
<p class="qt">(d)  the protection of the public, and</p>
<p class="qt">(e)  the making of reparation by offenders to persons  affected by their offences.</p>
<p class="paraleft">Importantly for present purposes, by section 142(2)(c) section 142(1) is expressly disapplied to sentences imposed under “any of sections 225-228 of the Act (dangerous offenders),…".  The reason is plain.  The first and obvious purpose of these provisions is the protection of the public from the risks posed by dangerous offenders.</p>
<p class="para">101.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second purpose is punishment.  It is a well understood responsibility of the sentencing court that,  as part of and integral to the IPP, it must address and specify the punitive element of the sentence, that is, the minimum term to be served by the offender before any question of his release may arise.  This is the “relevant part” of the sentence or its “minimum term". This second element of the sentence requires an assessment of the appropriate level of punishment which, irrespective of and ignoring any risk to the public posed by the offender, properly reflects the seriousness of the instant offence, or the combination of the offence and one or more offences associated with it, in the light of the aggravating and mitigating features. Thereafter, to ensure consistency with the release provisions which apply to those serving determinate sentences, the punitive term falls to be halved.  It is unnecessary to stumble through the maze of statutory provisions which leads to the conclusion that section 82A(2) of the 2000 Act applies to each IPP.  They are summarised in paragraphs 4-6 of the judgment the Court of Appeal, and for present purposes they are uncontroversial.  It remains to add by way of footnote that, again to ensure consistency, under section 240 of the 2003 Act, credit must be given for any period on remand served by the prisoner sentenced to IPP, which must be set against the punitive element of the sentence.</p>
<p class="para">102.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is plain therefore that there are two elements to the IPP sentence.  The first is the appropriate measure of punishment for the offender’s crimes; the second is the protection of the public from the further and indefinite risk he represents.  The punitive element of the sentence is not concerned with the potential dangerousness of the offender, and the minimum term or tariff period should not be longer than commensurate with the seriousness of the crime: future risk is addressed by the protective element of the IPP.  If there is no predictive risk that, in the sense specified in section 225(2)(b) as explained in <i>R v Lang and others</i>, the defendant will be dangerous at the end of the tariff period, an IPP would be unjustified.  There would be no sufficient risk of serious harm to members of the public for the purposes of the statute. Even if the ambit of section 225(2)(b) extends to prison officers and fellow inmates (and I believe that it does) the prison regime itself is intended to and should reduce the risk of serious harm to acceptable levels, and in any event, an IPP would not offer them greater protection than that which would be provided by a determinate sentence. Therefore if therefore the tariff period sufficiently addresses the element of future danger, an IPP would be inappropriate and should not be ordered.  This principle was recently confirmed in <i>R v Terrell</i> [2008] 2 CAR (S) 49 where it was decided that an IPP should not be passed where other available sentences, including, for example, a sexual offences prevention order, would minimise the risk otherwise presented by the offender.</p>
<p class="para">103.&nbsp;&nbsp;As the court is required to make an informed predictive assessment at the date of sentence, and the justification for detention beyond the tariff period is found in the judgment of the court that an IPP is indeed necessary,  I respectfully disagree with the views expressed by Laws LJ in the Divisional Court in <i>R (Walker)</i> that what he described as “further detention” after the expiry of the tariff period was “not at all justified by or at the time of sentence, for the very reason that the extent to which, or the time for which, the prisoner will remain a danger is unknown at the time of sentence…The justification for detention during the tariff period is of course spent; it is spent the moment the tariff expires".  For the same reasons I am unable to accept the observations of Moses LJ in <i>R (Lee) and R (Wells)</i> in the Administrative Court, no doubt reflecting the earlier judgment of Laws LJ, that “the position of a prisoner whose level of dangerousness cannot be ascertained is the same as one who ceases to be a danger.  The original justification for the sentence, namely his dangerousness, has ceased to exist".  In my judgment detention beyond the tariff period is justified just because the sentencing court has decided that the prisoner would continue to be dangerous at the expiry of the punitive element of the sentence.  The necessary predictive judgment will have been made.</p>
