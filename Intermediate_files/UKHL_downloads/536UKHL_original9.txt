<p align="right"><a href="regina-8.htm">(back to preceding text)</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the passage of his speech which I have already cited Lord Pearce said at p 157D:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Parliament might, of course, have taken what was conceded in argument to be a fair and sensible course.  It could have said, in appropriate words, that a person is to be liable unless he proves that he had no knowledge or guilty mind."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;197. My Lords, when judges of such eminence considered that transferring the burden of proof in relation to knowledge would not result in an unfair trial to the defendant, I consider that thirty years later when the problem has not changed there is no reason for this House to take a different view.  Section 2 of the 1998 Act now requires the House in determining a question which has arisen in connection with a Convention right to take into account judgments of the European Court and decisions of the European Commission, but in my opinion the judgments and decisions to which I have referred provide no basis for the view that under the jurisprudence of the European Court the transfer of the onus of proof as to knowledge in drugs cases would constitute a violation of Article 6(2).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;198. Therefore my conclusion is that the difficulty in some cases of convicting those guilty of the crime of possession of a controlled drug with intent to supply, if the burden of proving knowledge beyond a reasonable doubt rests on the prosecution, is not resolved by placing an evidential burden on the defendant, and that it is necessary to impose a persuasive burden as subsections 28(2) and (3) do.  I further consider that the transfer of the onus satisfies the test that it has a legitimate aim in the public interest and that there is a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised.  Accordingly I am of the opinion that subsections 28(2) and (3) do not violate Article 6(2) and I am in full agreement with the Court of Appeal on this issue.</p>
<i><p>Is there an infringement of article 6(2) if the appellant has suffered no injustice?</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;199. However if, contrary to the view which I have taken, the imposition of the persuasive burden on the defendant in relation to knowledge constitutes an infringement of the presumption of innocence, a further issue arises for consideration.  The case against the appellant was an extremely strong one and I agree with my noble and learned friend Lord Steyn that even if the judge had directed the jury on the basis that only an evidential burden rested on the appellant, the jury would have been bound to convict.  Therefore the question arises whether, notwithstanding that the jury would have certainly convicted him on such a direction, it would be right for an appellate court to hold that there had been a violation of Article 6(2) resulting in an unfair trial and that consequently the conviction was unsafe and must be quashed.  One answer would be to hold that there would be a breach of Article 6(2) if, on ordinary principles of construction, sections 5 and 28(2)(3) have the effect of imposing a persuasive burden, and that accordingly under section 3 of the 1998 Act those sections should be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with Article 6(2), so that they impose only an evidential burden, and then to hold that a jury would have been bound to convict if they had been directed on the basis that only an evidential burden rested on the defendant with the result that the conviction was not unsafe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;200. However I would take a different view and I would accept the second of the written propositions submitted by counsel for the appellant:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Proposition 1 <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>In principle, a legal burden on the defendant to prove his defence under s.28 of the MDA 1971 infringes Article 6 (2) because it is possible in such circumstances that the defendant may be convicted where there is a reasonable doubt as to his guilt.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Proposition 2<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>If, on analysis of the facts, it is clear that a properly directed jury would inevitably have convicted, there is by definition no doubt as to guilt, notwithstanding the direction given, and therefore no actual breach of Article 6 (2) and, accordingly, the conviction is not unsafe under s. 2 CAA 1995."<p></p></ul>
<p>(My understanding is that counsel advanced this second proposition because their principal concern was to obtain a ruling of principle on the issues debated before the House.)</p>
<p>On my reading of the European jurisprudence the European Court pays particular attention to the facts of the individual case before it and does not make a finding of a violation of article 6 if the applicant has suffered no injustice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;201. In <i>Hoang v. France</i> 1992  16 EHRR 53, 78-80 where the Court held that there was no violation of article 6, it stated at paragraph 33: </p>
<p></p><ul>"33. As was pointed out in the <i>Salabiaku</i> judgment of 7 October 1988, Article 6 requires States to confine presumptions of fact or of law provided for in their criminal law within reasonable limits which take into account the importance of what is at stake and maintain the rights of the defence.  However, the Court is not called upon to consider in the abstract whether Articles 369(2), 373, 392(1) and 399 of the Customs Code conform to the Convention.  Its task is to determine whether they were applied in the instant case in a manner compatible with the presumption of innocence and, more generally, with the concept of a fair trial… ."<p></p></ul>
<p>In <i>R v Togher</i> Lord Woolf CJ stated at para 33:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The requirement of fairness in the criminal process has always been a common law tenet of the greatest importance . . . Fairness in both jurisdictions is not an abstract concept.  Fairness is not concerned with technicalities.  If a defendant has not had a fair trial and as a result of that injustice has occurred, it would be extremely unsatisfactory if the powers of this Court were not wide enough to rectify that injustice."<p></p></ul>
<p>In <i>Brown v Stott</i> Lord Bingham of Cornhill stated at p 836C :</p>
<p></p><ul>"The general language of the Convention could have led to the formulation of hard-edged and inflexible statements of principle from which no departure could be sanctioned whatever the background or the circumstances.  But this approach has been consistently eschewed by the court throughout its history.  The case law shows that the court has paid very close attention to the facts of particular cases coming before it, giving effect to factual differences and recognising differences of degree.  Ex facto oritur jus."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;202. There will be cases where a conviction cannot stand and must be quashed irrespective of the strength of the evidence against the defendant because the trial as a whole is judged to be unfair.  But in my opinion in this case where the unfairness is claimed to arise from the transfer of the onus and it was open to the appellant to seek to rebut the presumption, and where there can be no doubt that the jury would have convicted if only an evidential burden had rested on the appellant, then the imposition of a persuasive burden as to knowledge resulted in no injustice and accordingly, in my opinion no breach of Article 6(2).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;203. For the reasons which I have given I would answer the first certified question in accordance with paragraphs 183-185 of this speech, the second certified question "No", and the third certified question "No" in relation to an alleged breach of his Convention rights by the trial court and I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
