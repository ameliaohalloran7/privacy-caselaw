<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, paragraph 4(3)(d) provides that rules of court <i>must secure</i></p><i>
</i>
<p></p><ul>"that the relevant court is required to give permission for material not to be disclosed where it considers that disclosure of the material would be contrary to the public interest;"<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is carried through into CPR rule 76.2(2):</p>
<p></p><ul>"The court must ensure that information is not disclosed contrary to the public interest."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, in rule 76.29(8):</p>
<p></p><ul>"The court must give permission to the Secretary of State to withhold closed material where it considers that the disclosure of that material would be contrary to the public interest."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disclosure contrary to the public interest is widely defined in rule 76.1(4):</p>
<p></p><ul>"For the purpose of this Part, disclosure is contrary to the public interest if it is made contrary to the interests of national security, the international relations of the United Kingdom, the detection and prevention of crime, or in any other circumstances where disclosure is likely to harm the public interest."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;69.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the face of it, therefore, the judge is precluded from ordering disclosure even where he considers that this is essential in order to give the controlled person a fair hearing. This would not matter if he were then in a position to refuse to uphold the order. However, he will have had all the relevant material which was available to the Secretary of State placed before him: see Schedule, para 4(3)(a) and CPR rule 76.27. The obvious intention is that he should take it into account even though it remains closed to the controlled person. Section 3(12) allows him to quash the order, to quash one or more of the obligations in the order, or to direct that the Secretary of State revoke or modify the order, but only if he considers that a decision of the Secretary of State was flawed. Section 3(13) provides that:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In every other case the court must decide that the control order is to continue in force."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the judge is also a public authority for the purpose of the Human Rights Act and thus under a duty to act compatibly with the convention rights unless precluded from doing so by primary legislation which cannot be read in any other way: see 1998 Act, s 6(1),(2) and (3), and 2005 Act s 11(2). If, despite all the efforts of the judge and the special advocates to ensure that there is a fair hearing, the judge determines that the hearing cannot be fair unless more material is disclosed, the convention rights require that he be in a position to quash the order. On the face of it, therefore, section 3(13) of the Act may on occasions produce a result which is incompatible with the convention rights. However, this will not be so in every case. Indeed, my view is that the procedures can be made to work fairly and compatibly in many cases. It would not, therefore, be appropriate to make a declaration of incompatibility. The matter can be dealt with in a different way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;71.&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar situation arose in <i>R (Hammond) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </i>[2005] UKHL 69, [2006] 1 AC 603. This concerned paragraph 11(1) of Schedule 22 to the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which provided that a single judge should set minimum terms for certain prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment "without an oral hearing". Yet in some but not all cases a hearing would be necessary if the judge was to adjudicate fairly. Rather than declare the provision incompatible, it was read subject to an implied condition that the judge had power to order a hearing where this was required in order to comply with the prisoner's rights under article 6. Admittedly, in that case it was not argued that such an interpretation was not possible under section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998: the Government invited the court to take that course (mindful no doubt that a very similar course was taken in the leading case of <i>R v A (No 2) </i>[2002] 1 AC 45 and wishing to save the provision if it could). In this case the Secretary of State has argued that such an interpretation of the 2005 Act is not possible, but has not convincingly explained why it was possible in <i>Hammond</i> and is not possible here. I share the view of Lord Bingham, in para 44 above, that this would be a possible course. If it is possible, then section 3(1) of the 1998 Act requires that it be done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, therefore, paragraph 4(3)(d) of the Schedule to the 2005 Act, should be read and given effect "except where to do so would be incompatible with the right of the controlled person to a fair trial". Paragraph 4(2)(a) and rule 76.29(8) would have to be read in the same way. This would then bring into play rule 76.29(7), made under paragraph 4(4) of the Schedule. Where the court does not give the Secretary of State permission to withhold closed material, she has a choice. She may decide that, after all, it can safely be disclosed (experience elsewhere in the world has been that, if pushed, the authorities discover that more can be disclosed than they first thought possible). But she may decide that it must still be withheld. She cannot then be required to serve it. But if the court considers that the material might be of assistance to the controlled person in relation to a matter under consideration, it may direct that the matter be withdrawn from consideration by the court. In any other case, it may direct that the Secretary of State cannot rely upon the material. If the Secretary of State cannot rely upon it, and it is indeed crucial to the decision, then the decision will be flawed and the order will have to be quashed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only, in my view, are we required by Parliament to take this course if it is possible. There are several reasons why it is desirable for us to do so. First, when Parliament passed the 2005 Act, it must have thought that the provisions with which we are concerned were compatible with the convention rights. In interpreting the Act compatibly we are doing our best to make it work. This gives the greatest possible incentive to <i>all</i> parties to the case, and to the judge, to conduct the proceedings in such a way as to afford a sufficient and substantial measure of procedural justice. This includes the Secretary of State, who will, of course, be anxious that the control order be upheld. A declaration of incompatibility, on the other hand, would allow all of them to conduct the proceedings in a way which they knew to be incompatible. Secondly, there is good reason to think that Strasbourg would find proceedings conducted in accordance with the Act and rules compatible in the majority of cases. Inviting a derogation in order to cater for the minority where it might not so find may risk even greater incursions into the fundamental requirements of a fair trial which have not yet been shown to be necessitated by the exigencies of the situation. Thirdly, and above all, there are powerful policy reasons in support of procedures which enable cases to be proven through the evidence of infiltrators and informers rather than upon evidence which may have been obtained through the use of torture. Not only is the latter abhorrent, there is good reason to believe that it is generally unreliable and counter-productive. This House has ruled that such evidence is always inadmissible, but has placed the burden of proving this upon the person who wishes to challenge it: see <i>A and others v Secretary of State for the Home Department (No 2) </i>[2005] UKHL 71, [2006] 2 AC 221. It is particularly difficult for a person subject to control order proceedings to do this. Devising a sufficient means of challenging the evidence is an incentive to the authorities to rely on better and more reliable sources of intelligence. That may sometimes mean keeping their identity, and sometimes some of the surrounding circumstances, secret. But that is an overall price worth paying for the good of all. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74.&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows that I cannot share the view of Lord Hoffmann, that the use of special advocates will always comply with article 6; nor do I have the same difficulty as Lord Bingham, in accepting that the procedure could comply with article 6 in the two cases before us. It is quite possible for the court to provide the controlled person with a sufficient measure of procedural protection even though the whole evidential basis for the basic allegation, which has been explained to him, is not disclosed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of <i>MB</i>, the Court of Appeal corrected the major premise which underpinned the declaration of incompatibility made by the trial judge: that the court was limited to reviewing the Secretary of State's decision on the basis of the information available to her when that decision was made. But the Court of Appeal also took the view that the use of a special advocate constituted an appropriate safeguard: [2007] QB 415, para 86. They allowed the Secretary of State's appeal and ordered that the validity of the control order be reconsidered. That remains the appropriate outcome, although the case now falls to be reconsidered in the light of the majority opinions in this House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76.&nbsp;&nbsp;The case of <i>AF </i>is more difficult, because of the judge's view that there had been a "substantial and sufficient measure of procedural protection". It is tempting, therefore, simply to allow the Secretary of State's appeal on the first (the deprivation of liberty) issue and leave the control order in place. However, the judge had already concluded that the control order should be quashed as a deprivation of liberty; moreover he was bound by the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>MB</i>. In fairness, AF should have the opportunity of having his case heard in accordance with the approach approved in this House. I would therefore send that case back also.  </p>
LORD CARSWELL
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77.&nbsp;&nbsp;The four issues in AF's appeal have been set out in paragraph 3 of the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill and I need not repeat them.  The issue in MB's appeal is similar to that in the fourth issue of AF's appeal, and is in essence whether the control orders can stand in the light of the withholding of closed material from the appellants, taking into account the use of special advocates at their hearings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first issue in AF's case, whether the effect of the control order was a deprivation of his liberty within the meaning of article 5 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms ("the Convention"), I would refer to my opinion in <i>JJ and others v Secretary of State for the Home Department </i>[2007] UKHL 45. For the reasons which I set out in that opinion I do not consider that AF was deprived of his liberty by the control order.  I cannot agree with Ouseley J's conclusion on this issue, on which the Secretary of State is entitled to succeed.  The second issue accordingly does not arise.  I would allow the Secretary of State's appeal on these issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79.&nbsp;&nbsp;The third issue is whether non-derogating control order proceedings constitute the determination of a criminal charge within the meaning of article 6 of the Convention.  I agree with the conclusion expressed by Lord Bingham (para 24 of his opinion in this appeal) that it does not, and with his reasons for reaching that conclusion.  It is not in dispute that the civil limb of article 6(1) applies to the examination of control orders by the courts and the person subject to such an order (to whom I shall refer for convenience, albeit inelegantly, as the controlee) is entitled to a fair hearing.  The question of what prevents a hearing from being fair brings one to the fourth issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80.&nbsp;&nbsp;The necessity to furnish a controlee with sufficient material to understand the case made against him and to be in a position to contest it is very clearly established, and it is not necessary for me to cite the many authorities on the point.  It is recognised, however, both in domestic law and in the Strasbourg jurisprudence that in some contexts it may be legitimate to withhold a certain amount of significant material from a party where there are sufficiently strong countervailing reasons to set against the individual's right grounded in article 6 to have knowledge of and be able to contest the case against him.  The European Court of Human Rights accepted in <i>Edwards and Lewis v United Kingdom </i>(2004) 40 EHRR 593, para 46, p 609 that the safeguarding of an important public interest may at times justify the withholding of evidence.  In <i>Rowe v United Kingdom </i>(2000) 30 EHRR 1 the Court said at paragraphs 61-62:</p>
<p></p><ul>"61. However, as the applicants recognised, the entitlement to disclosure of relevant evidence is not an absolute right.  In any criminal proceedings there may be competing interests, such as national security or the need to protect witnesses at risk of reprisals or keep secret police methods of investigation of crime, which must be weighed against the rights of the accused. In some cases it may be necessary to withhold certain evidence from the defence so as to preserve the fundamental rights of another individual or to safeguard an important public interest.  However, only such measures restricting the rights of the defence which are strictly necessary are permissible under article 6(1).  Moreover, in order to ensure that the accused receives a fair trial, any difficulties caused to the defence by a limitation on its rights must be sufficiently counterbalanced by the procedures followed by the judicial authorities.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>62. In cases where evidence has been withheld from the defence on public interest grounds, it is not the role of this Court to decide whether or not such non-disclosure was strictly necessary since, as a general rule, it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them. Instead, the European Court's task is to ascertain whether the decision-making procedure applied in each case complied, as far as possible, with the requirements of adversarial proceedings and equality of arms and incorporated adequate safeguards to protect the interests of the accused."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need to protect a state's citizens from the risk of terrorist attack is one of the most important and pressing competing interests, as the ECtHR has recognised in a series of decisions: see, eg, <i>Klass v Germany </i>(1978) 2 EHRR 214, <i>Murray v United Kingdom </i>(1994) 19 EHRR 193 and <i>Chahal v United Kingdom </i>(1996) 23 EHRR 413.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ECtHR has also accepted that expedients such as the use of special advocates may in principle give sufficient protection to the individual's rights to satisfy the requirements of article 6.  In <i>Chahal v United Kingdom </i>(1996) 23 EHRR 413 it said at paragraph 131 of its judgment:</p>
<p></p><ul>"131. The Court recognises that the use of confidential material may be unavoidable where national security is at stake.  This does not mean, however, that the national authorities can be free from effective control by the domestic courts whenever they choose to assert that national security and terrorism are involved.  The Court attaches significance to the fact that, as the intervenors pointed out in connection with Article 13, in Canada a more effective form of judicial control has been developed in cases of this type.  This example illustrates that there are techniques which can be employed which both accommodate legitimate security concerns about the nature and sources of intelligence information and yet accord the individual a substantial measure of procedural justice."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reference to these techniques is to the use of special advocates to represent the interests of the individual concerned, which the Court described in more detail in paragraph 144.  Similarly, in <i>Al-Nashif v Bulgaria </i>(2002) 36 EHRR 655 the Court noted United Kingdom legislation providing for the appointment of special counsel and went on to say (para 97):</p>
<p></p><ul>"97 Without expressing in the present context an opinion on the conformity of the above system with the Convention, the Court notes that, as in the case of <i>Chahal</i>, there are means which can be employed which both accommodate legitimate national security concerns and yet accord the individual a substantial measure of procedural justice."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court did, however, define a limit to this in <i>Tinnelly &amp; Sons Ltd and McElduff &amp; Others v United Kingdom </i> (1998) 27 EHRR 249 at paragraph 72, where it stated that limitations must not restrict or reduce the individual's access to the court "in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired."   The House was referred to a litany of cases in which the ECtHR held that where material had been withheld from an individual there was a breach of article 6, but in none of them was a special advocate employed to represent his interests, and accordingly the assistance to be derived from these decisions is limited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82.&nbsp;&nbsp;The House has had occasion to consider the use of special advocates on a couple of occasions.  One cannot obtain much assistance from the decision in <i>R v H, R v C </i>[2004] UKHL 3, [2004] 2 AC 134, where the issues which arose were not comparable with those in the present appeals.  More can be gained, however, from <i>R (Roberts) v Parole Board </i>[2005] UKHL 45, [2005] 2 AC 738, notwithstanding the differences in context and governing legislation.  This case has been discussed by Lord Bingham in paragraph 34 of his opinion, and I shall not rehearse the details of the issues.  The members of the Appellate Committee were all conscious of the grave extent of the disadvantage imposed upon the individual if material is withheld from his legal representatives as well as himself and his interests are represented only by a special advocate.  As in <i>Roberts, </i>I would not seek to minimise these disadvantages, and in the present context the impact upon the individual's interests is at least as significant as in a parole hearing.  The majority were, however, prepared to accept that the Parole Board had in principle power to withhold information and appoint special advocates to represent prisoners' interests, while declining to decide at that stage on the fairness of their use in the appeal before the House.  They emphasised that their decision only extended to accepting in principle that the use of a special advocate did not necessarily infringe the right to a fair hearing, but were not prepared to hold that that procedure would constitute a fair procedure in all cases.  Lord Woolf said at paragraph 83:</p>
<p></p><ul>"What will be determinative in a particular case is whether looking at the process as a whole a decision has been taken by the board using a procedure that involves significant injustice to the prisoner.  If there has been, the decision should be quashed."  <p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case one has to balance two interests, that of the controlee and the public interest, without the added factor of protecting the informant.  Both interests are clear and strong, but in my opinion it is possible to accommodate both with an appropriate balance.  The House was referred to a number of expressions of concern about the limits on the value of the representation of a controlee's interests afforded by a special advocate.  Lord Woolf CJ remarked, however, in the Court of Appeal in <i>M v Secretary of State for the Home Department </i>[2004] EWCA Civ 324 [2004] 2 All ER 863, para 34:</p>
<p></p><ul>"(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;Having read the transcripts, we are impressed by the openness and fairness with which the issues in the closed session were dealt with by those who were responsible for the evidence given before SIAC (ii) We feel the case has additional importance because it does clearly demonstrate that, while the procedures which SIAC have to adopt are not ideal, it is possible by using special advocates to ensure that those detained can achieve justice and it is wrong therefore to undervalue the SIAC appeal process."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84.&nbsp;&nbsp;In MB's case Sullivan J concluded that there was inherent unfairness in a hearing under section 3(10) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 and proceeded to make a declaration of incompatibility.  But that remedy is to be regarded as a measure of last resort, to be avoided unless it is plainly impossible to do so: <i>R v A (No 2) </i>[2001] UKHL 25, [2002] 1 AC 45, para 44, per Lord Steyn.  I do not consider that the provisions of the 2005 Act and CPR Part 76 are necessarily incapable of being made to operate compatibly with article 6.  It seems to me possible to imply into them, and in particular into paragraph 4(2)(a) and 4(3)(d) of the Schedule to the 2005 Act, a qualification that the powers conferred do not extend to withholding particulars of reasons or evidence where to do so would deprive the controlee of a fair trial.  The House adopted a comparable course in <i>R v A (No 2) </i>[2001] UKHL 25, [2002] 1 AC 45, when it was willing (Lord Hope of Craighead dubitante<i>) </i>to imply a provision into section 41 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 that evidence or questioning which was required to ensure a fair trial under article 6 should not be treated as inadmissible: see para 45, per Lord Steyn.  Similarly, in <i>R (Hammond) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </i>[2005] UKHL 69, [2006] 1 AC 603, the Divisional Court was willing to interpolate a qualification such as that which I propose into paragraph 11(1) of Schedule 22 to the Criminal Justice Act 2003.  Before the House the Secretary of State expressly accepted that if paragraph 11(1) was found to be incompatible with the Convention, it should be read subject to such an implied condition.  It was therefore unnecessary to reach a considered decision on whether such an interpolation would be sustainable, but although Lord Hoffmann described it as a "bold exercise in 'interpretation'", the House accepted it.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a very wide spectrum of cases in which closed material is relied on by the Secretary of State.  At one extreme there may be cases in which the sole evidence adverse to the controlee is closed material, he cannot be told what the evidence is or even given its gist and the special advocate is not in a position to take sufficient instructions to mount an effective challenge to the adverse allegations.  At the other end there may be cases where the probative effect of the closed material is very slight or merely corroborative of strong open material and there is no obstacle to presenting a defence.  There is an infinite variety of possible cases in between.  The balance between the open material and the closed material and the probative nature of each will vary from case to case.  The special advocate may be able to discern with sufficient clarity how to deal with the closed material without obtaining direct instructions from the controlee.  These are matters for the judge to weigh up and assess in the process of determining whether the controlee has had a fair trial.  The assessment is, as Lord Woolf said in <i>Roberts </i>at paragraph 77, fact-specific.  The judge who has seen both the open and the closed material and had the benefit of the contribution of the special advocate is in much the best position to make it.  I do consider, however, that there is a fairly heavy burden on the controlee to establish that there has been a breach of article 6, for the legitimate public interest in withholding material on valid security grounds should be given due weight.  The courts should not be too ready to hold that a disadvantage suffered by the controlee through the withholding of material constitutes a breach of article 6.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86.&nbsp;&nbsp;In MB's case Sullivan J stated at paragraph 67 of his judgment, and it has not been the subject of dispute, that the evidence implicating MB in terrorist activities is wholly contained within the closed material.  He stated his view in paragraph 74 that where the substantial part of the case against him was not disclosed to the controlee, it was difficult to see how the very essence of his right of access to the court was not impaired.  He did take the view, however, which the Court of Appeal declared to be incorrect, that the court could not take into account any potentially exculpatory information identified by the special advocate which might cast a different and less unfavourable light on the closed material.  I would send the matter back to the Administrative Court to review the overall fairness of the appeal hearing in the light of the opinions of the House and those of the Court of Appeal.  The Court of Appeal proposed to take this course and I accordingly would uphold its decision and dismiss MB's appeal, though for my own somewhat differing reasons, which accord with those given by my noble and learned friends Baroness Hale of Richmond and Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87.&nbsp;&nbsp;In AF's case Ouseley J accepted at paragraph 146 of his judgment that "no, or at least no clear or significant, allegations of involvement in terrorist-based activity are disclosed by the open material, nor have any such allegations been gisted."  Again, this finding has not been challenged.  As in MB's case, it is difficult to see how this could constitute a fair hearing, unless the contribution of the special advocate was such as to make a significant difference.  At paragraph 167 the judge referred to "the way in which the Special Advocates were able to and did deal with the issues on the closed material", but it is not spelled out in the judgment how significant their contribution was.  The judge has not made a decision on the overall fairness of the hearing and its compliance with article 6, and in these circumstances I would allow the Secretary of State's appeal, reverse the judge's order quashing the control order and send the case back to the Administrative Court for reconsideration in the light of the opinions expressed by the House.</p>
<p><b>LORD BROWN OF EATON-UNDER-HEYWOOD</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the advantage of reading in draft the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill and gratefully adopt his exposition of the relevant facts and law and his identification of the issues now arising on these two appeals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89.&nbsp;&nbsp;AF's control order subjected him to a fourteen hour curfew.  For the reasons given in my judgment in JJ's case I do not regard that as involving a sufficient degree of physical confinement to constitute a deprivation of liberty as opposed to a restriction of AF's freedom of movement.  Plainly it is a very severe restriction on that freedom and by virtue of that restriction together with the various additional restrictions inherent in the other conditions and circumstances of AF's order it interferes too with a number of AF's Convention rights (most notably perhaps those under articles 8, 9 and 10).  But these are all qualified rights (as too would be AF's right to freedom of movement had the UK in fact conferred it upon him by ratifying Protocol 4) and it is noteworthy that neither AF nor, indeed, any of the other appellants before your Lordships have sought to challenge the justification for these various restrictions nor their proportionality. I accordingly agree with all your Lordships that the Secretary of State's appeal should succeed on this aspect of AF's case.</p>
