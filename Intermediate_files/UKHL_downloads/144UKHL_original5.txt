<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91.&nbsp;&nbsp;The length of time for which any cars can be parked on the servient land by virtue of this ancillary right is another significant issue.  Lord Marnoch considered, 2005 1 SC 281, 289, para 24, that a visitor would be entitled:</p>
<p></p><ul>"to park his vehicle for the duration of his visit which might extend over hours, nights, weeks or even months.  And, once that is accepted, there is, in my opinion, no real distinction between what I have just described and a right on the part of the occupier to park for unlimited periods of time in connection with the reasonable use of his property."<p></p></ul>
<p>For Lord Philip, 2005 1 SC 281, 306, para 90, if the dominant proprietor were prohibited</p>
<p></p><ul>"from parking his vehicle [near the top of the steps] until he wished to leave again (whenever that might be) he would be obliged to remove it to a place beyond the third defender's land and to gain ultimate access to his property on foot.  In those circumstances he could not gain personal access to his property in a vehicle of a kind permitted by the grant.  His right of vehicular access would therefore, in my view, effectively be defeated."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92.&nbsp;&nbsp;The defenders sought to derive an argument against that approach from the decision, in a rather different area of the law, in <i>Crown Estate Commissioners v Fairlie Yacht Slip Ltd </i>1976 SC 161.  In that case the defenders laid down moorings on the seabed in Fairlie Bay.  They argued that the right to lay moorings was a necessary incident of the public right of navigation.  The pursuers maintained, however, that the right to anchor was restricted to temporary anchorage in the course of passage and that it did not extend to quasi-permanent anchorage between voyages.  Lord Dunpark, at p 166, came to the conclusion</p>
<p></p><ul>"that the public right of navigation is restricted in the manner for which the pursuers contend.  In my opinion, the earliest point of time when navigation begins is when a vessel is being prepared for a voyage, and navigation ends when the ship is left, either unmanned or with a caretaker crew, at the end of a voyage.  A ship moored between voyages is not being navigated….  The laying up of a vessel is, in my opinion, an incident of ownership;  it cannot properly be regarded as a <i>necessary </i>incident of the right of navigation."<p></p></ul>
<p>As already indicated, by analogy, it could be said that parking a car in the interval between reaching the dominant property and leaving again was not a necessary incident of a servitude of access.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93.&nbsp;&nbsp;In his submissions on behalf of the defenders, Mr Mitchell QC sought to distinguish the <i>Fairlie</i> case by arguing that parking near the dominant tenement could always be seen as an integral part of the exercise of the proprietor's servitude of access, since the car would be sitting there after the proprietor had driven to his property by the access route, in order to be available for him to make the round trip back out by the same route.  But that is plainly an unsound argument.  An owner who comes home in his own car across the servitude track is under no obligation to go out in the same way.  He can walk out if he wishes.  In theory at least, in this case he can leave by boat.  A friend can pick him up by car to go for a night out.  He can be picked up by taxi and taken to the airport to begin a journey of many months.  But even though I would reject that particular argument, it does respectfully seem to me that, if the implied right of parking on the servient land is held to be necessary in order to make the right of vehicular access effective, then cars must indeed be able to park for as long as Lord Marnoch and Lord Philip suggest.  The impact would probably not be very great in this case where the servient land is relatively extensive, but the position might well be very different in other cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94.&nbsp;&nbsp;Various solutions to the difficulties in defining the scope of any accessory right of parking have been suggested.  Reference has been made to Bankton's observation in his Institute 2.7.18 that where a right of way is granted at large, or indefinitely, the dominant proprietor "may chuse it in any place most commodious for him, but not invidiously to the other's detriment."  But Bankton merely means that the dominant proprietor must not "invidiously", ie, deliberately, choose a route for the right of way which will harm the servient proprietor.  His point has nothing to do with the present problem.  The idea that questions of how and precisely where the right to park is to be exercised ought to be capable of being resolved by the parties acting sensibly is nothing more than a pious hope in a situation, such as the present, where, for years, the parties have been quite unable to reach any such agreement.  I therefore need not explore the issues relating to the effect of any such agreement between the proprietors.  It is well defined servitudes that make good neighbours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, it is said that such questions can, if necessary, be decided by reference to the rule that the servitude right must be used civiliter.  But, as Lord Hamilton pointed out, 2005 1 SC 281, 301-302, para 73, in part at least, this contention rests on a misunderstanding of that doctrine, which only comes into play once the scope of the servitude has been determined.  The civiliter requirement:</p>
<p></p><ul>"is concerned with the manner of the exercise of a servitude right, not with the prior question of the true extent of it.  In <i>Robson v Chalmers Property Investment Co Ltd</i> Lord Kissen cited with approval the passage from Rankine on <i>Landownership </i>(p 417) where the learned author states:  'The presumption [for freedom] acts in three ways:  first, by demanding certain known modes of constitution;  next, after proof of the existence of some right of servitude, by presuming in favour of that degree thereof which shall be least burdensome to the servient tenement;  and lastly, when the servitude and its degree have been made out, by directing that it shall be exercised civiliter'.  Thus, any question of exercise civiliter arises only after the extent of the right has been identified."<p></p></ul>
<p>So, once the servitude right and its scope are established, it "must be rendered as little burdensome to the servient tenement as is consistent with its fair exercise" (<i>Sutherland v Thomson </i>(1876) 3 R 485, 495 per Lord Gifford) or it must be exercised "so as to impose the least possible burden on the servient tenement, consistently with the fair enjoyment of this right by the dominant proprietor (<i>Hill v Maclaren </i>(1879) 6 R 1363, 1366 per Lord Justice Clerk Moncreiff).  For example, where I have a servitude of vehicular access over your land but the route is unspecified, I must take the route which is practicable for me but least burdensome for you, whether that is the shortest route or a longer route that does not cut across your best arable land.  But the crucial point is that the civiliter doctrine does not itself determine the extent of the servitude right;  it only comes into play in order to regulate how that right is to be exercised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in the present case, the civiliter doctrine could not be used to determine how many cars could be parked by reason of any accessory right or to curtail the time for which cars could be parked.  These points relate to the extent of the pursuers' servitude.  At most, the civiliter doctrine might be used to help fix where on the servient land any right of parking could be exercised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, for all these reasons, to judge by the sheriff's written findings of fact, I should myself have rejected the idea that in the circumstances of this case an implied right to park a car or cars on the servient land was necessary to make the express grant of vehicular access to Da Store effectual.  On the other hand, I am conscious that I may have underestimated the disadvantages to the owners or visitors in having to park at the top of the lower branch public road and walk to and from the house - a trip which would necessarily involve "a significantly steep pedestrian descent or climb in open and exposed country" (finding in fact 16).  As his fourth finding in fact and law shows, these disadvantages clearly weighed heavily with the sheriff who had inspected the property.  I cannot exclude the possibility that relevant and unusual aspects of the physical situation, which are not fully apparent from the text of finding in fact 16, may have helped to shape his determination that a right to park was, in effect, necessary for the convenient use of the property.  While the test the sheriff was applying is not well formulated, I am satisfied that, given his appreciation of the situation, he would equally have considered that an implied right to park on the servient land was necessary to make the express grant of vehicular access effectual.  With considerable hesitation, I have accordingly concluded that, although it is open to an appellate court to differ from the sheriff on this kind of finding in fact and law, it would be unsafe to do so in this case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the particular circumstances, I am therefore prepared to yield to the sheriff's conclusion that a right to park should be implied into the right of access.  In reaching that view, I have, of course, had regard to the fact that, in substance, your Lordships share the sheriff's appreciation of the situation.  I emphasise two points, however.  First, I am unable to accept Lord Philip's approach that, in itself, the absence of a right to park on the servient land would effectively defeat any grant of vehicular access to a dominant tenement which had no room for parking.  Secondly, I am by no means satisfied that a right to park on the servient land should readily be implied into the grant of a servitude of access simply because there is no possibility of parking on the dominant land and the nearest place to park, apart from the servient land, is up a slope and some 150 yards away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons I would dismiss the appeal.  For the reasons given by Lord Hope, I would also leave the interdict standing.</p>
LORD MANCE
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the benefit of reading in draft the opinions of all of your Lordships.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101.&nbsp;&nbsp;In agreement with Lord Hope of Craighead and for the reasons he gives, I consider that, in the light of the Sheriff's findings and the unusual topography of the two properties, the express servitude right of vehicular access possessed by the respondents as owners of Da Store over the appellants' land carried with it an ancillary right to park vehicles on the appellants' land in the area near Da Store, available for exercise so far as reasonably necessary for the enjoyment of the servitude. I find compelling the reasons that Lord Hope gives in paragraphs 31 to 36 for reaching this conclusion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having read what Lord Scott of Foscote and Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury say on the point, I also see great force in the alternative way in which the respondents put their case, viz, that a right to park vehicles in the relevant area is both capable of existing in law and, in the light of the Sheriff's findings and the topography, to be implied here as a servitude necessary for the convenient and comfortable enjoyment of Da Store in its contemplated use as a residence. If, as I consider, a right to park can exist as impliedly ancillary to an express servitude right of access over property retained, I find it difficult to think that it cannot exist as an independent servitude over the property retained when this is impliedly necessary for the convenient and comfortable enjoyment of the property disposed of. However, it is not I think necessary for me to express a final view on this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree with Lord Hope's reasons for considering a permanent interdict to be appropriate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104.&nbsp;&nbsp;I too would therefore dismiss the appeal and adhere to the Extra Division's interlocutor.</p>
LORD NEUBERGER OF ABBOTSBURY
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the privilege of reading in draft the opinions of my noble and learned friends, Lord Hope of Craighead and Lord Scott of Foscote, both of whom have set the history of this unfortunate matter. I agree with them that this appeal should be dismissed substantially for the reasons they give. However, not least because my mind has changed, I would like to express in my own words the reasons for my conclusion on the central issue. That issue is whether the conveyance of Da Store together with 'a right of access from the branch public road through Sandsound' in the disposition of 3 September 1973 ("the Disposition") carried with it the right in the purchasers to park (by which I mean to leave on a relatively long term basis) motor vehicles on the servient tenement, i.e. on the land retained by the vendors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106.&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons advanced on behalf of the appellants as to why the Disposition did not carry with it the right to park appeared to have three strands. First, that the words of the grant cannot expressly, and do not impliedly, carry with them a right to park. Secondly, that no right to park could have been intended because it would be virtually limitless in nature. (In a sense, this point can be said to be an aspect of the first, but it is conveniently considered separately). Thirdly, that, even if the right to park were otherwise to be implied, it could not, as a matter of law, have been included in the grant, at least so as to bind successors of the vendors. I propose to consider those three arguments in turn. </p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first argument: the words of grant do not include a right to park</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the words 'a right of access' from a <i>terminus a quo</i>, i.e. the beginning of the way, to a <i>terminus ad quem</i>, i.e. the end of the way, do not as a matter of ordinary language carry with them a right to park a motor vehicle at or near the latter terminus. However, the fact that a right to park has not been expressly granted does not of itself automatically prevent such a right being claimed by the owner of the dominant tenement. The authorities relied on by the respondents show that such a right could, at least in principle, be claimed on two bases, which are conceptually, if somewhat subtly, different, although, as Lord Scott has pointed out, they may well involve very similar considerations, at least in many cases. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first basis is that explained by Lord Campbell LC in <i>Ewart v Cochrane</i> (1861) 4 Macq 117 at 122-123, quoted in paragraph 27 of Lord Hope's speech. It amounts to this, that where the grantor disposes of part of his property, there is to be implied for the benefit of the grantee 'anything which was used, and was necessary for the comfortable enjoyment of that part of the property which is granted'; and, in this connection, necessity is to be judged by reference to what is 'necessary for the convenient and comfortable enjoyment of the property as it existed before the time of the grant'. In England and Wales, there is a similar principle, namely that, on the sale of part of a piece of land owned by the grantor, 'there will pass to the grantee all those continuous and apparent easements (by which, of course, [is meant] quasi-easements), or, in other words, all those easements which are necessary to the reasonable enjoyment of the property granted, and which have been and are at the time of the grant used by the owners of the entirety for the benefit of the part granted' - see <i>Wheeldon v Burrows</i> (1879) 12 Ch D 31 at 49. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that the enjoyment of the right or quasi-right may be temporarily suspended at the time of the disposition, because the property in question is vacant, cannot, to my mind, invalidate the application of this principle. If the property has been recently used for a specific purpose (in the present case, as a residence), and it is apparent that the grantee will pretty shortly be putting it to some use (particularly if it is the same or a similar use, as in my view it would have been here), then this principle (whether in Scotland or in England and Wales) would, in my opinion, at least normally apply. It could represent an artificial trap for a grantee, and would be contrary to the good sense of the principle, if it were otherwise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110.&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the second basis, there is clear authority in English law for the proposition that 'the grant of an easement is <i>prima facie</i> also the grant of such ancillary rights as are reasonably necessary to its exercise or enjoyment' - per Parker J in <i>Jones v Pritchard</i> [1908] 1 Ch 630 at 638. Subsequently, in <i>Pwllbach Colliery Company Ltd v Woodman</i> [1915] AC 634 at 646 to 647, the same judge, then Lord Parker of Waddington, described the decision in <i>Jones v Pritchard </i>as being within a 'class of cases in which easements impliedly may be created', not because of 'the terms of the grant itself', but because of 'the circumstances under which the grant was made'. In para 12.124 of their book, <i>Servitudes and Rights of Way</i> (1998), Cusine and Paisley state that 'not only does a servitude permit activity falling squarely within its scope, but also activities which are ancillary to that primary activity', and they go on to say that Parker J's formulation is also 'a statement of the position in Scots law'. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111.&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be surprising if that were not the law in Scotland. It accords with good sense, and it is a point on which one would not expect Scots and English law to differ. While some aspects of the juridical nature, origin and incidents of servitudes in Scotland are different from those of easements in England and Wales, there are many aspects of similarity, as can be appreciated even from a quick perusal both of Cusine and Paisley and of Gale on <i>Easements </i>(17th edition, 2002). Servitudes and easements are inherently very similar, and there is very little difference between life-styles and standards north and south of the Cheviots. Further, courts in both jurisdictions have expressly and beneficially relied on each other's analyses and developments in this area of law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, there are cases where a right is implied where it is necessary for 'the comfortable enjoyment' or "the convenient and comfortable enjoyment" of the hereditament which is severed (as in <i>Ewart</i>), and there are cases where a right is implied because it is 'reasonably necessary' for the 'exercise or enjoyment' of an expressly granted right (as in <i>Jones v Pritchard</i>). In the latter type of case, it seems to me important to focus on the dual nature of the requirement that the alleged implied right be 'reasonably necessary'. Without the necessity, there would be the danger of imposing an uncovenanted burden on the servient owner, based on little more than sympathy for the dominant owner; without the reasonableness, there would be a danger of imposing an unrealistically high hurdle for the dominant owner. In the former type of case, it seems to me that the test is effectively the same: the references to "<i>comfortable</i> enjoyment" and "<i>convenient and comfortable </i>enjoyment" being equivalent to the reasonableness in the latter type of case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it appears to me that these two types of case are no more than examples of the application of a general and well established principle which applies to contracts, whether relating to grants of land or other arrangements. That principle is that the law will imply a term into a contract, where, in the light of the terms of the contract and the facts known to the parties at the time of the contract, such a term would have been regarded as reasonably necessary or obvious to the parties. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114.&nbsp;&nbsp;The respondents primarily put their case on the second of the two bases identified above, but they also rely on the first. Accordingly, the case was argued on the basis that the questions to be decided were (a) whether the right to park vehicles on the servient tenement at the end of the way, that is at all near the gate at the top of the stairway referred to in paragraph 3 of Lord Hope's speech, would, at the time of the grant, that is in 1973, have been necessary for the convenient and comfortable enjoyment of the right of access granted by the Disposition, and/or (b) whether such a right would have been necessary for the convenient and comfortable enjoyment of the land granted by the Disposition. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115.&nbsp;&nbsp;These questions raise issues which are primarily to be determined by the first instance tribunal, namely Sheriff Scott Mackenzie. After a full and careful analysis of the evidence, he reached a number of conclusions, of which the following are directly relevant (with emphasis added): </p>
<p></p><ul>"4.&nbsp;&nbsp;The dominant tenement is not reasonably capable of comfortable enjoyment without there being rights attached thereto to turn, to stop, to load, and unload vehicles and, as part of that unloading process, temporarily to place goods on the servient tenement (but with no right to store goods thereon) <i>and to park on the servient tenement adjacent to the dominant tenement…such number of vehicles as are reasonably necessary for the use of the dominant tenement</i>. Accordingly, the said rights were impliedly granted in the said Disposition <i>as necessary incidents of said right of access</i>. <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further and in any event were it the case that the right to park on the servient tenement had not been granted <i>as an incident of the right of access</i> <i>such a right being reasonably necessary for the comfortable enjoyment of the dominant tenement</i> it would fall to be regarded as having been impliedly granted as a separate right in the said disposition".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116.&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to one possible point, I consider that, at least on their face, the conclusions reached by the Sheriff in these two paragraphs, namely that the respondents had made out their case both on the second basis and on the first basis, are unexceptionable. He appears to have directed himself by reference to what was 'reasonably necessary for the comfortable enjoyment',which is the right test. The only possible criticism is that, at least until the last sentence of para 4, he seems to have directed himself in that paragraph by reference to what was reasonably necessary for the enjoyment of the dominant tenement, namely Da Store, rather than for that of the expressly granted servitude. However, it is clear from what the Sheriff said in the last sentence of that paragraph, and indeed in the first part of the passage I have emphasised in para 5, that in para 4 he was considering the second basis and correctly directed himself in accordance with the test in <i>Jones</i>, whereas in para 5 he was considering the first basis and correctly directed himself in accordance with <i>Ewart</i>.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, it appears to me to follow that the only way in which the appellants can succeed on their first argument in this appeal is if they are able to establish that there was no evidence on which the Sheriff could fairly have concluded that it was reasonably necessary, (a) for the enjoyment of the expressly granted right of way and/or (b) for the enjoyment of the dominant tenement, for the grantee under the Disposition to have the right to park motor vehicles near the gate at the top of the stairway. On this point, the unusual facts of the present case, particularly when taken together, lead me to the conclusion that the Sheriff was indeed entitled to reach the decision that he did, although I would rest the conclusion on a slightly different juridical basis from either of those adopted by the Sheriff. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118.&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as the centrally important facts are concerned, they appear to me to be as follows. First, it must have been clear at the time of the Disposition that the grantee, Mrs Stuart, was purchasing Da Store for a use which would require vehicular access along the way. It seems to me almost certain that that intended use would have been anticipated to be residential, which again was not really challenged by the appellants (although, bearing in mind its previous use, it is just conceivable that it would additionally have been for retail purposes). As is realistically accepted by the appellants, such a use would have undoubtedly required vehicular access (hence the grant of the servitude) along the way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119.&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the whole of the dominant tenement was on a significantly different level from the servient tenement, and in particular from the way over which the servitude was granted. The only land-based access to the dominant tenement was through the gate and down the stairway to which I have already referred. Accordingly, the parties would have realised that it simply would not have been physically possible for vehicles using the way to obtain access onto, let alone to stop turn or park on, the dominant tenement itself. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, in the light of the relative narrowness of the way, and assuming that there was no right to park as claimed, the nearest location where motor vehicles used to gain access to the dominant tenement could have been parked would have been on or near the branch road, i.e. further from the dominant tenement than the <i>terminus a quo</i> of the way. In other words, for anyone wishing to spend more than a transitory time in Da Store, the vehicular access along the way would have been largely illusory (at least unless the person concerned was a passenger in a motor vehicle): the vehicle would have to be parked on or near the branch road, so that access to the dominant tenement would have to be achieved by foot along the way. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, at least as at the date of the Disposition, access to or from the dominant tenement from the branch road would have involved 'a significantly steep pedestrian descent or climb in open and exposed country' along the way, a route of around 150 metres, according to primary findings of fact made by the Sheriff. Particularly bearing in mind that the dominant tenement might be occupied by a family with young children, and, indeed, members who were elderly or infirm, this seems to me to be a relevant factor. Admittedly, such people could be dropped off and picked up by the able-bodied adult driver of a vehicle, who could park the vehicle on or near the highway. However, that would be inconvenient (and potentially worse than inconvenient at night or in very inclement weather), and could entail having to leave very young or very infirm people alone for a time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, the way in question was actually a public highway at the time of the Disposition. Subject to the possibility that the parties to the Disposition overlooked that fact, it strikes me as suggestive of the notion that the parties intended the grantee of the servitude to enjoy rather more rights than what would be enjoyed by a member of the public. That would tend to support the proposition that a right to park on the servient tenement would have been intended. I rely on this fifth point with some diffidence because it was not the subject of significant argument. </p>
