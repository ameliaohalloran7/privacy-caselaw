<p class="para">85.&nbsp;&nbsp;Another line of Strasbourg cases, of which <i>Klass v Germany </i>(1978) 2 EHRR 214, <i>Valenzuela Contreras v Spain </i>(1999) 28 EHRR 483 and <i>Erdem v Germany </i>(2002) 35 EHRR 383 are examples, concerns covert surveillance by telephone tapping, but not specifically of legal consultations.  Girvan LJ cited these cases, along with <i>Kopp v Switzerland </i>(1999) 27 EHRR 91, for the proposition that domestic law must lay down a clear and precise set of rules, giving the citizen adequate indication of the circumstances and conditions under which public authorities may adopt such measures.  Mr Macdonald QC for the appellants C and A adopted the same argument, submitting that the provisions of RIPA and the Home Office Covert Surveillance Code of Practice do not satisfy this criterion.  Mr Fordham QC for the Prison Service of Northern Ireland and the Secretary of State for the Home Department urged caution in drawing conclusions from this line of authorities.  He pointed out that RIPA covers a wider range of actions and circumstances than the discrete matter of telephone tapping.  Since Strasbourg has not equated the two in its decisions, he submitted, our courts should regard it as inappropriate to make this equation without much clearer consonance between them.  I think that there is substance in this argument, and I should myself be slow to accept that the type of prescription required in telephone tapping cases is necessary for covert surveillance to be valid.</p>
<p class="para">86.&nbsp;&nbsp;What is clear is that the ECtHR contemplates both in the legal consultation cases and the telephone tapping cases that some exceptions to the general prohibition may exist.  I have referred to <i>Brennan v UK </i>and <i>Ocalan v Turkey </i>for this proposition in legal consultation cases, and in <i>Klass v Germany </i>and <i>Erdem v Germany </i>the Court was prepared to accept the possibility of the existence of exceptional circumstances, which may be related to abuse of the privilege or the interests of national security or the prevention of crime.  This approach tends to support the proposition that covert surveillance of legal consultations should not be regarded as prohibited and unlawful in all possible circumstances.</p>
<p class="para">87.&nbsp;&nbsp;RIPA deals with a number of areas in which the state sets out to acquire information about matters going on within or without the jurisdiction and, as its title indicates, is designed to regulate the methods by which information is gathered.  The portion which is material for the purposes of these appeals is Part II, entitled “Surveillance and Covert Human Intelligence Sources.”  It divides the conduct with which this Part deals into three, directed surveillance, intrusive surveillance and the conduct and use of covert human intelligence sources.  Directed surveillance, which by common consent is the head which is material in these appeals, is defined by section 26(2) as follows:</p>
<p class="qt">“(2) Subject to subsection (6), surveillance is directed for the purposes of this Part if it is covert but not intrusive and is undertaken—</p>
<p class="qt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) for the purposes of a specific investigation or a &nbsp;&nbsp;specific operation;</p>
<p class="qt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) in such a manner as is likely to result in the &nbsp;&nbsp;obtaining of private information about a person &nbsp;&nbsp;(whether or not one specifically identified for the &nbsp;&nbsp;purposes of the investigation or operation); and</p>
<p class="qt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) otherwise than by way of an immediate &nbsp;&nbsp;response to events or circumstances the nature of &nbsp;&nbsp;which is such that it would not be reasonably &nbsp;&nbsp;practicable for an authorisation under this Part to be &nbsp;&nbsp;sought for the carrying out of the surveillance.”</p>
<p class="paraleft">Surveillance is defined by section 48(2) as including</p>
<p class="qt">“(a) monitoring, observing or listening to persons, their movements, their conversations or their other activities or communications;</p>
<p class="qt">(b) recording anything monitored, observed or listened to in the course of surveillance; and</p>
<p class="qt">(c) surveillance by or with the assistance of a surveillance device.”</p>
<p class="paraleft">It is defined by section 26(9)(a) as “covert” --</p>
<p class="qt">“if, and only if, it is carried out in a manner that is calculated to ensure that persons who are subject to the surveillance are unaware that it is or may be taking place".</p>
<p class="para">88.&nbsp;&nbsp;Intrusive surveillance is defined by section 26(3) as follows:</p>
<p class="qt">“(3) Subject to subsections (4) to (6), surveillance is intrusive for the purposes of this Part if, and only if, it is covert surveillance that—</p>
<p class="qt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) is carried out in relation to anything taking place &nbsp;&nbsp;on any residential premises or in any private &nbsp;&nbsp;vehicle; and</p>
<p class="qt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) involves the presence of an individual on the &nbsp;&nbsp;premises or in the vehicle or is carried out by &nbsp;&nbsp;means of a surveillance device.”</p>
<p class="para">89.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 27(1) provides:</p>
<p class="qt">“(1) Conduct to which this Part applies shall be lawful for all purposes if—</p>
<p class="qt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) an authorisation under this Part confers an &nbsp;&nbsp;entitlement to engage in that conduct on the person &nbsp;&nbsp;whose conduct it is; and</p>
<p class="qt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) his conduct is in accordance with the &nbsp;&nbsp;authorisation.”</p>
<p class="paraleft">Section 28 governs the authorisation of directed surveillance.  Subsections (1) to (3) provide:</p>
<p class="qt">“28 (1) Subject to the following provisions of this Part, the persons designated for the purposes of this section shall each have power to grant authorisations for the carrying out of directed surveillance.</p>
<p class="qt">(2) A person shall not grant an authorisation for the carrying out of directed surveillance unless he believes—</p>
<p class="qt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) that the authorisation is necessary on grounds &nbsp;&nbsp;falling within subsection (3); and</p>
<p class="qt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) that the authorised surveillance is proportionate &nbsp;&nbsp;to what is sought to be achieved by carrying it out.</p>
<p class="qt">(3) An authorisation is necessary on grounds falling within this subsection if it is necessary—</p>
<p class="qt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) in the interests of national security;</p>
<p class="qt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) for the purpose of preventing or detecting crime &nbsp;&nbsp;or of preventing disorder;</p>
<p class="qt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) in the interests of the economic well-being of &nbsp;&nbsp;the United Kingdom;</p>
<p class="qt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) in the interests of public safety;</p>
<p class="qt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) for the purpose of protecting public health;</p>
<p class="qt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) for the purpose of assessing or collecting any &nbsp;&nbsp;tax, duty, levy or other imposition, contribution or &nbsp;&nbsp;charge payable to a government department; or</p>
<p class="qt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) for any purpose (not falling within paragraphs &nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to (f)) which is specified for the purposes of this &nbsp;&nbsp;subsection by an order made by the Secretary of &nbsp;&nbsp;State.”</p>
<p class="paraleft">The persons designated to grant authorisations for the Police Service of Northern Ireland are, by virtue of section 30 and the Regulation of Investigatory Powers (Directed Surveillance and Covert Human Intelligence Sources) Order 2003 (SI 2003/3171), specified officers of at least the rank of superintendent.</p>
<p class="para">90.&nbsp;&nbsp;Intrusive surveillance is governed by a distinct regime with stricter controls, requiring a higher level of authorisation.  The initial authorisation has to be given by a specified senior officer, in the case of the PSNI the Chief Constable or Deputy Chief Constable (section 32(6)).  By section 36 it is not to take effect until its grant has been approved by a Surveillance Commissioner and written notice of the approval has been given.  Section 32(2) and (3) provide:</p>
<p class="qt">“(2) Neither the Secretary of State nor any senior authorising officer shall grant an authorisation for the carrying out of intrusive surveillance unless he believes—</p>
<p class="qt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) that the authorisation is necessary on grounds &nbsp;&nbsp;falling within subsection (3); and</p>
<p class="qt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) that the authorised surveillance is proportionate &nbsp;&nbsp;to what is sought to be achieved by carrying it out.</p>
<p class="qt">(3) Subject to the following provisions of this section, an authorisation is necessary on grounds falling within this subsection if it is necessary—</p>
<p class="qt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) in the interests of national security;</p>
<p class="qt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) for the purpose of preventing or detecting &nbsp;&nbsp;serious crime; or</p>
<p class="qt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) in the interests of the economic well-being of &nbsp;&nbsp;the United Kingdom.”</p>
<p class="paraleft">Provision is made in sections 37 to 39 for the quashing of an approval by a Surveillance Commissioner and for appeals to the Chief Surveillance Commissioner against the refusal or quashing of authorisations.</p>
<p class="para">91.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under RIPA section 71 the Secretary of State must issue codes of practice relating to the exercise and performance of the powers and duties conferred or imposed, otherwise than on the Surveillance Commissioners, by various statutory provisions, including Part II of the Act.  By subsection (4) the draft code is to be laid before both Houses of Parliament.  Section 72 requires every person exercising or performing such duties to have regard to the provisions of every relevant code of practice in force.  The Secretary of State issued such a code, which dealt in detail with the procedures to be followed by those concerned with covert surveillance.</p>
<p class="para">92.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Code of Practice so issued makes specific and quite detailed provision for dealing with legally privileged information.  Paragraph 3.1 requires particular care to be taken where “confidential information” is involved, defined as including matters subject to legal privilege.  A higher level of authorisation must be obtained where it is likely that knowledge of confidential information will be obtained; in the case of PSNI, it is to be obtained from a Deputy Chief Constable (Annex A to the Code).  It is to be noted, however, that no provision was made in Annex A for a nomination of a person in the Prison Service from whom that higher level of authorisation should be obtained.  The definition of matters covered by legal privilege in article 12 of the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (SI 1989/1341 (NI 12)) is incorporated by paragraph 3.3, and this clearly extends to the legal consultations in the case of the appellants C, A and McE and by analogy to M’s medical consultation.  Paragraphs 3.5 to 3.9 contain detailed instructions for dealing with legally privileged information, providing additional safeguards.  It is noted in para 3.5 that such information “is extremely unlikely ever to be admissible as evidence in criminal proceedings".  An application for surveillance is to be made only in exceptional and compelling circumstances, with detailed reasons being given, and further advice to be obtained and notification to a Surveillance Commissioner in appropriate circumstances.  The details of the handling of the surveillance are not in point in the present appeals, which are concerned with the existence of power to conduct any surveillance of legal consultations.  What is quite clear, however, is that those who drafted the code were very clearly aware that surveillance under RIPA was likely to be carried out of legal consultations.  The draft was duly laid before Parliament and no objection is recorded as having been taken to the inclusion of legal consultations in RIPA surveillance or the power to do so.</p>
<p class="para">93.&nbsp;&nbsp;The four appellants, together with an applicant known as W who has not appealed to your Lordships’ House, brought applications for judicial review, seeking declarations that they were entitled to consult with their legal and medical advisers without being subject to covert surveillance and that the failure of the several authorities concerned to provide assurances that they would not be so subject was unlawful.  The Divisional Court gave written judgments on 30 November 2007, whereby they allowed the applications and granted declarations.  Kerr LCJ and Campbell LJ held that it was the intention of Parliament that RIPA applied to consultations between legal advisers and their clients.  Girvan LJ dissented on this issue and concluded that the more generalised provisions of RIPA could not have been intended to interfere with legal professional privilege in a wider context.  All three judges agreed, however, that directed surveillance was not proportionate in terms of the interference that the surveillance involves and the degree of protection for the interests that can be achieved.  In the absence of an enhanced authorising regime such as that prescribed for intrusive surveillance, monitoring of lawyer/client or doctor/patient consultations could therefore not be justified under article 8(2) of the Convention.  They found no violation of article 6, as there was no evidence that any of the applicants had been deprived of a fair hearing.  The court made declarations in the following terms:</p>
<p class="qt">“1. that the monitoring of consultations of each of the applicants’ legal or medical consultations would be unlawful;</p>
<p class="qt">2.  that the refusal of the respondents to give the assurances that no such monitoring would take place constituted a violation of the applicants’ article 8 rights.</p>
<p class="paraleft">The Divisional Court certified in the case of C, A and McE that the following points of law of general public importance arose:</p>
<p class="qt">“1. Does section 28 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 override or qualify the right of a person to consult in private with a legal adviser (i) at common law; or (ii) under any of the following statutory provisions: (a) article 59 of the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989; (b) paragraph 7 of Schedule 8 to the Terrorism Act 2000; and (c) Rule 71 of the Prison and Young Offenders Centre Rules (Northern Ireland) 1995 by permitting covert directed surveillance of such onsu1tations?</p>
<p class="qt">2. Do paragraphs 3.1 to 3.10 of the Home Office Code of Practice on Covert Surveillance apply to solicitor/client consultations?”</p>
<p class="paraleft">In M’s case the following was substituted for paragraphs 1 and 2 above:</p>
<p class="qt">“1. Does section 28 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 override or qualify the common law right of a person to consult privately with a medical practitioner by permitting covert directed surveillance of such consultation?”</p>
<p class="paraleft">The court certified the following question in relation to all four appeals:</p>
<p class="qt">“3. Would covert directed surveillance of lawyer/client consultations or doctor/patient consultations, carried out under section 28 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 and in accordance with the Home Office Code of Practice, infringe the rights of the client/patient under article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, contrary to section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998?”</p>
<p class="para">94.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appellants have brought this appeal in order to challenge the finding of the majority of the Divisional Court that RIPA was intended to extend to legal or medical consultations.  The respondents did not cross-appeal against the making of the declarations, although their counsel did attempt to argue that the surveillance was proportionate, claiming to be able to do so on the terms of the certificate.  The Secretary of State has, however, stated that she is willing to make an order under section 47(1)(b) of RIPA characterising surveillance of consultations between detainees and their legal advisers as intrusive surveillance, with the safeguards which go with that level of surveillance.  If done, this would make consideration of directed surveillance of such consultations superfluous.  It is regrettable, however, that no step has yet been taken to make the necessary order, notwithstanding the fact that the present practice was declared unlawful over a year ago, and no appeal was brought against the court’s decision.  Having said this, I do not propose to enter into further discussion of the proportionality of directed surveillance of legal or medical consultations, save to say that I agree with the conclusion reached by the Divisional Court.</p>
<p class="para">95.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a factor peculiar to McE’s case which led to a concession by counsel for the Prison Service that the surveillance in his case was not proportionate.  As I have said (para 92 above), no officer was specified in Annex A to the Code as being permitted to authorise surveillance in cases likely to result in knowledge of matters subject to legal privilege.   In consequence it was difficult for the Prison Service to maintain that there was sufficient basis for claiming that the interference with the exercise by McE of his article 8 rights was “in accordance with the law".</p>
<p class="para">96.&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue on which the Divisional Court was divided was whether Parliament intended RIPA to extend to consultations normally protected by legal professional privilege or a like privilege in a doctor-patient consultation.  The appellants relied on two main principles of construction, which may operate together, as indicia of a contrary intention.  The first is the presumption known as the principle of legality, that a statute is not generally intended to override fundamental human rights.  The second is the maxim of statutory interpretation <i>generalia specialibus non derogant.</i></p>
<p class="para">97.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first principle was reviewed by the House of Lords in <i>R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Simms </i>[2000] 2 AC 115.<i>  </i>The issue was the lawfulness of the Secretary of State’s policy to operate the Prison Service Standing Orders in such a way as to forbid interviews of prisoners by journalists unless the journalists signed written undertakings not to publish any part of the interviews.  The House upheld a claim by the appellants that journalists should be entitled to interview them and publish the interviews when investigating the question whether they had been wrongly convicted through a miscarriage of justice.  Lord Hoffmann said at page 131:</p>
<p class="qt">“But the principle of legality means that Parliament must squarely confront what it is doing and accept the political cost.  Fundamental rights cannot be overridden by general or ambiguous words.  This is because there is too great a risk that the full implications of their unqualified meaning may have passed unnoticed in the democratic process.  In the absence of express language or necessary implication to the contrary, the courts therefore presume that even the most general words were intended to be subject to the basic rights of the individual.”</p>
<p class="paraleft">The same principle was applied in <i>R (Morgan Grenfell &amp; Co Ltd) v Special Commissioner of Income Tax </i>[2002] UKHL 21, [2003] 1 AC 563, where section 20 of the Taxes Management Act 1970, as amended, entitled an inspector of taxes to require a taxpayer to deliver to him such documents as were in his possession or power.  Section 20B(8), however, provided that a barrister, advocate or solicitor was not obliged to deliver or make available, without his client’s consent, any document with respect to which a claim to professional privilege could be maintained.  The House held, relying on the principle of legality, that an exclusion must be implied in section 20 for documents subject to professional privilege.</p>
<p class="para">98.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second principle is summarised in Halsbury’s Laws of England, 4th ed, vol 44(1), para 1300:</p>
<p class="qt">“It is difficult to imply a repeal where the earlier enactment is particular, and the later general.  In such a case the maxim <i>generalia specialibus non derogant</i> (general things do not derogate from special things) applies.  If Parliament has considered all the circumstances of, and made special provision for, a particular case, the presumption is that a subsequent enactment of a purely general character would not have been intended to interfere with that provision; and therefore, if such an enactment, although inconsistent in substance, is capable of reasonable and sensible application without extending to the case in question, it is prima facie to be construed as not so extending.  The special provision stands as an exceptional proviso upon the general.  If, however, it appears from a consideration of the general enactment in the light of admissible circumstances that Parliament’s true intention was to establish thereby a rule of universal application, then the special provision must give way to the general.”</p>
<p class="paraleft">The principle descends clearly from decisions of the House of Lords in <i>The Vera Cruz </i>(1884) 10 App Cas 59 and the Privy Council in <i>Barker v Edger </i>[1898] AC 748, and has been affirmed and put into effect on many occasions.  Lord Cooke of Thorndon pointed out, however, in <i>Effort Shipping Co Ltd v Linden Management SA </i>[1998] AC 605, 627, that the maxim is not a technical rule peculiar to English statutory interpretation, rather it “represents simple common sense and ordinary usage".  It is based, like other linguistic canons of construction, “on the rules of logic, grammar, syntax and punctuation, and the use of language as a medium of communication generally” (Bennion, <i>Statutory Interpretation,</i> 5th ed (2008), p 1155).  It has to be remembered, as Lord Wilberforce observed in <i>Associated Minerals Consolidated Ltd v Wyong Shire Council </i>[1975] AC 538, 554, that it is still a matter of legislative intention, which the courts endeavour to extract from all available indications.</p>
<p class="para">99.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appellants submitted that it was not the intention of Parliament that the general surveillance provisions of RIPA should override the specific provisions in the earlier enactments which conferred statutory rights upon persons detained to be interviewed by lawyers in such a manner as to be able to speak in confidence.  Section 58 of PACE and its Northern Ireland equivalent provide that a person held in custody in a police station is entitled “to consult a solicitor privately at any time.”  Paragraph 7 of Schedule 8 to the Terrorism Act 2000 similarly provides that a person detained may consult with a solicitor “privately” as soon as practicable.  In both cases the exercise of the right may be deferred in certain circumstances, but subject to that it is not restricted.  Rule 71 of the Prison and Young Offenders Centre Rules (Northern Ireland) 1995 requires reasonable facilities to be allowed for the legal adviser of a prisoner to interview in the sight but not in the hearing of an officer.  These provisions are not the classic s<i>pecialia</i>, which are most clearly represented by the statute of Charles II exempting certain lands from all manner of taxes (see <i>Sinclair v Cadbury Brothers Ltd </i>(1933) 18 TC 157).  As Mr Fordham pointed out in his printed case, RIPA could properly be regarded more as a specific than a general enactment and the privacy of interview provisions as general.  Be that as it may, I regard the issue basically as one of attempting to ascertain from all the <i>indicia </i>whether Parliament intended to make legal/medical consultations subject to the surveillance provisions.</p>
<p class="para">100.&nbsp;&nbsp;I commence with the wording of RIPA.  In its natural and ordinary sense it is capable of applying to privileged consultations and there is nothing in its wording which would operate to exclude them.  The reason given by Lord Hoffmann in the passage which I have quoted from <i>Ex parte Simms </i>is that the full implications of the unqualified meaning of the statutory words may have passed unnoticed in the democratic process.  It seems to me unlikely that the possibility of RIPA applying to privileged consultations could have passed unnoticed.  On the contrary, it is an obvious application of the Act, yet no provision was put in to exclude them.</p>
<p class="para">101.&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I do not consider that it is at all a clear case for the application of the maxim <i>generalia specialibus non derogant.  </i>When the earlier provisions relied on by the appellants were enacted, there was no equivalent of RIPA relating to powers of surveillance.  Those provisions were simply designed to ensure that the various categories of detained persons could have professional consultations in private, there being no question that covert surveillance might be carried out.  They were not special exceptions to be preserved when a general rule was passed into law.</p>
<p class="para">102.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, there is the need to incorporate exceptions to the inviolability of privileged consultations.  One such is the <i>Cox &amp; Railton </i>exception: if it were not possible to exercise covert surveillance of legal consultations where it is suspected on sufficiently strong grounds that the privilege was being abused, the law would confer an unjustified immunity on dishonest lawyers.  There may be other situations where it would be lawful to monitor privileged consultations, for example, if it is necessary to obtain information of an impending terrorist attack or to prevent the threatened killing of a child.  The limits of such possible exceptions have not been defined and I shall not attempt to do so, but they could not exist if the rule against surveillance of privileged consultations were absolute.</p>
