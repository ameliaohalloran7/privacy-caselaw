<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88. The Director's refusal to give the undertaking has not disturbed or interfered with Mrs Pretty's right to life.  Nothing that he has done in response to her request is contrary to any law which is designed to safeguard life.  On the contrary, his act in declining to give the undertaking to enable Mr Pretty to assist in his wife's suicide is compatible with the opening words of the second sentence of the article.  It provides that no-one shall be deprived of his life intentionally.  As the Divisional Court pointed out in para 41 of its judgment, for a third person to take active steps deliberately to deprive another of life, even with the consent of the person thus deprived, is forbidden by the article.  The article is all about protecting life, not bringing it to an end.  It is not possible to read it as obliging the state to allow someone to assist another person to commit suicide.  I would hold that her claim does not engage any of her rights under this article.</p>
<i><p><i>(b) article 3</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89. The argument with regard to this article is that Mrs Pretty will inevitably suffer inhuman or degrading treatment if the disease is allowed to run its course.  It is not suggested that the Director has done anything which is directly prohibited by the article.  The argument concentrates on its positive effects - what the state must do to ensure that the individual does not suffer treatment of the kind that it prohibited.  The terminal stages of motor neurone disease provide the background.  The inability to swallow leads to breathlessness and to the sensation of choking, as muscle power in the mouth and throat degenerates.  But awareness and mental function is usually unimpaired.  The patient can be expected to suffer increasing anxiety and mental anguish, as she succumbs to the symptoms of the disease.  Death usually results from respiratory failure and pneumonia.  Mrs Pretty says that by declining to give the undertaking the Director has taken a decision which will subject her to these tragic consequences.  She says that he has subjected her to inhuman and degrading treatment within the meaning of the article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90. The European Court has repeatedly said that article 3 prohibits torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in terms which are absolute: <i>Chahal v United Kingdom</i> (1996)  23 EHRR 413, 456-457, para 79; <i>D v United Kingdom</i> (1997)  24 EHRR 423, 447-448, paras 47, 49.  From this proposition two things follow.  First, only serious ill-treatment will be held to fall within the scope of the expression "inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."  The Court said in <i>A v United Kingdom</i> (1998)  27 EHRR 611, 629, para 20, that ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of the article.  It also said that the assessment of this minimum is relative, as it depends on all the circumstances of the case such as the nature and context of the treatment which is in issue.  Second, although the absolute prohibition is not capable of modification on grounds of proportionality, issues of proportionality will arise where a positive obligation is implied.  The jurisprudence of the European court shows that where positive obligations arise they are not absolute.  In <i>Osman v United Kingdom</i> (1998)  29 EHRR 245, 305, para 116 the court recognised that such obligations must be interpreted in way which does not impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities.  This approach is consistent with that which the court takes where other rights than those expressly stated are read into an article as implied rights: see <i>Brown v Stott</i> [2001]  2 WLR 817, 851B-E.  This makes it necessary to pay close attention to the question whether the act in question is one which is expressly prohibited or is based upon a positive obligation which is implied into the article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91. As for the question whether the consequences of not giving the undertaking will attain the required minimum level of severity, the facts must be seen in their whole context.  Mrs Pretty cannot be forced to accept medical treatment for her condition as it reaches the terminal stages, but it is relevant to her case to see what is on offer.  In its Response to the Report of the Select Committee on Medical Ethics (May 1994, Cm 2553) the government stated, in its comment on para 288 of the Report, that it would encourage the development of palliative care in all settings to ensure that patients received sensitive care and relief from pain and other distressing symptoms.  Your Lordships were informed that nursing care and palliative treatment is already being provided to Mrs Pretty and that it will continue to be available.  The use of drugs such as opiates in the form of morphine may be helpful in the terminal stages in relieving the distress of breathlessness and the sensation of choking.  It has not been possible in these proceedings to examine the facts in detail.  But there is enough information available to us to cast serious doubt on the question whether the consequences of the refusal, taken as a whole in the context of the treatment which is available, attain the minimum level of inhuman or degrading treatment within the meaning of the article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92. Then there is the nature of the Director's act.  It is clear that he is not directly responsible for the disease or for its consequences.  Nothing has been identified that he has done and should be restrained from doing in order to remove or alleviate these consequences.  I would conclude that we are not dealing here with a case with an act which is expressly prohibited.  The argument is that the article applies positively, as it requires the Director to do something to avoid the incompatibility.  This raises the question whether the Director's refusal to give the undertaking is incompatible with article 3 because it is disproportionate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93. Three matters fall to be considered where questions arise as to whether an interference with a Convention right is proportionate.  In <i>de Freitas v Permanent Secretary of Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, Lands and Housing</i> [1999]  1 AC 69,  Lord Clyde adopted the analysis of Gubbay CJ in <i>Nyambiri v National Social Security Authority</i> [1996]  1 LRC 64 drawing on jurisprudence from South Africa and Canada: see also <i>Rodriguez v Attorney General of Canada</i> [1994]  2 LRC 136, 161H-J per Lamer CJ.  The first is whether the objective which is sought to be achieved is sufficiently important to justify limiting the fundamental right.  The second is whether the means chosen are rational, fair and not arbitrary.  The third is whether the means used impair the right as minimally as is reasonably possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94. As to these issues, the following points seem to me to point conclusively in favour of the Director.  First, there is the objective.   The Director is entitled to regard the purpose of section 2(1) of the 1961 Act as being to protect the vulnerable from pressure to end their own lives.  In its Response to para 295 of the Report of the Select Committee on Medical Ethics the government stated that it could see no basis for permitting assisted suicide as this would be open to abuse and would put the lives of the weak and vulnerable at risk.  So the decriminalisation of attempted suicide in 1961 was accompanied by an unequivocal statement of the prohibition of acts calculated to end another person's life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95. Then there is the question whether the Director's refusal is rational, fair and not arbitrary.  In my opinion he is entitled to take into account the nature of the act which he was asked to sanction in this case.  All he was told was that Mrs Pretty would be helped by her husband to commit suicide.  Where, when and how this was to be done was not and probably cannot at this stage be specified.  There is no suggestion that medical assistance will be available or that the act will be supervised by anybody.  Sopinka J observed in <i>Rodriguez v Attorney-General of Canada </i>[1994]  2 LRC 136, at p 189H-J that the official position of various medical associations, including the British Medical Association, is against decriminalising assisted suicide.  It is common knowledge that most members of the medical profession are opposed to any involvement in this activity.  A clear distinction is preserved between the withdrawal of treatment and palliative care on the one hand and acts on the other whose sole purpose is to destroy life.  Moreover, the margin between assisting suicide and euthanasia is so slender in Mrs Pretty's case as to be impossible to determine in the absence of a detailed account of the proposed act.  All of this points to the conclusion that the Director is entitled to take the view that it is impracticable for him to give an undertaking in advance of the event that he will not prosecute.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96. Then there is the third issue, which is whether the means used to achieve the objective are proportionate.  The object of section 2(1) of the 1961 Act is to avoid an abuse which would put the lives of the weak and vulnerable at risk.  In this way it seeks to preserve life.  I would be willing to give full weight to Mrs Pretty's assertion that she is not weak or vulnerable in this sense - that she has sufficient mental strength not to be vulnerable to pressure to commit suicide.  I can appreciate her objection that vulnerability should not be imposed upon her simply because her physical condition prevents her from doing so.  But this does not meet the Director's argument.  It is not unreasonable for him to think that, if he were to sanction one act of assisted suicide, this might lead to requests from others less well equipped to stand up to the unscrupulous.  Separating out the good from the bad would be an impossible task for him, as he lacks the resources that would be needed to conduct the exercise.  He is entitled to think that the public interest is best served by holding the line against granting undertakings of this kind.  In the present uncertain climate of public opinion, where there is no consensus in favour of assisted suicide and there are powerful religious and ethical arguments to the contrary, any change in the law which would make assisted suicide generally acceptable is best seen as a matter for Parliament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97. I would hold therefore that the object which section 2(1) was designed to achieve struck the right balance between the interests of the individual and the public interest which seeks to protect the weak and vulnerable.  Great weight must be attached to the state's interest in protecting the lives of its citizens.  It was a proportionate response for Parliament to conclude that that interest could only be met by a complete prohibition on assisted suicide.  I would also hold that, although the effect of the Director's decision that he had no power to give the undertaking is likely to be to expose Mrs Pretty to acute distress as she succumbs to her illness, his act cannot be said to be unfair or arbitrary or to have impaired her Convention right more than is reasonably necessary.  It was not disproportionate to the object of section 2(1).</p>
<i><p><i>(c) articles 8 and 9</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98. I take these two articles together, as they are both invoked in support of the same argument.  This is that they confer a right to self determination through the right to private life and the right to freedom of expression which prohibits a blanket ban on assisted suicide.  The object of these articles is to protect the individual against arbitrary interference by the public authorities.  They compel the state to abstain from acts which are incompatible with the Convention rights.  But, in addition to the negative undertaking, here too positive obligations may be implied into them: see <i>X and Y v Netherlands</i> (1985)  8 EHRR 235, 239, para 23.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99. The first question is whether these articles are engaged at all by Mrs Pretty's claim that she is entitled to her husband's assistance in committing suicide.  Can her claim be said to be based on her right to respect for her private and family life, her home and her correspondence in article 8?  Can it be said to be based on her right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion in article 9?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100. No authority has been cited in support of either proposition.  The wording of the articles does not help either.  Respect for a person's "private life", which is the only part of article 8(1) that is in play here, relates to the way a person lives.  The way she chooses to pass the closing moments of her life is part of the act of living, and she has a right to ask that this too must be respected.  In that respect Mrs Pretty has a right of self-determination.  In that sense, her private life is engaged even where in the face of a terminal illness she seeks to choose death rather than life.  But it is an entirely different thing to imply into these words a positive obligation to give effect to her wish to end her own life by means of an assisted suicide.  I think that to do so would be to stretch the meaning of the words too far.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101. A strained reading might have been appropriate if there was evidence of a consensus of international opinion in favour of assisted suicide.  But there is none.  As Sopinka J said in <i>Rodriguez v Attorney General of Canada</i> [1994]  2 LRC 136, 176A, no new consensus has emerged in society opposing the right of the state to regulate the involvement of others in exercising power over individuals ending their lives.  The right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion includes the right to manifest one's religion or beliefs without interference save as provided for in article 9(2).  But here again it strains the wording of the article too far to say it gives the person a right to do whatever her beliefs allow her to do.  Yet that precisely is her claim under this article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102. In any event, for the reasons already indicated, I would hold that the Director's refusal to give the undertaking was not disproportionate to the object of section 2(1), which is to avoid abuse and to protect the weak and the vulnerable.</p>
<i><p><i>(d) article 14</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103. This article prohibits discrimination in the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in the Convention.  These rights are to be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour and the various other grounds which are expressly mentioned in the article.  The European Court has held that the right not to be discriminated against in the enjoyment of the rights guaranteed under the Convention is violated when states without an objective and reasonable justification fail to treat differently persons whose situations are significantly different: <i>Thlimmenos v Greece</i> (2000)  31 EHRR 411, 424, para 44.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104. Two issues arise here.  The first is whether the article is engaged at all.  Does it extend to the ground of discrimination on which Mrs Pretty founds her claim?  The second is whether, if it does, she can point to any right or freedom which is engaged by the Convention to which article 14 can be attached.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105. As to the first point, it is clear that the list of grounds for discrimination set out in the article is not closed.  This is made clear by the words "such as" which precede the list.  I would hold that the article is capable of extending to discrimination in the enjoyment of the Convention rights on the grounds of physical or mental capacity.  Section 15(1) of the Canadian Charter recognises that discrimination on these grounds is contrary to fundamental rights.  I see no difficulty in recognising that article 14 of the European Convention has that effect too.  Mrs Pretty can reasonably claim that her physical situation is significantly different from that of others who wish to commit suicide, as she cannot take her own life without another person's assistance.  The difficulty which she faces is that, for the reasons already stated, her case does not engage any of the other articles on which she relies.  It was with reference to this second point that Mr Havers said that Mrs Pretty was entitled under article 14 not to be discriminated against in the exercise of what he described as her right under section 1 of the 1961 Act to commit suicide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106. The argument that article 14 prohibits discrimination in the enjoyment of a right to commit suicide would, if sound, have disturbing and far-reaching consequences.  It would make it impracticable for the state to intervene to prevent people from taking their own lives, whether by removing them from places or equipment which could be used for the purpose or by rendering medical assistance to prevent death.  But there is as yet no free-standing right under the Convention not to be discriminated against.  So I am far from being persuaded that section 1 provides a basis for invoking article 14.  In any event I would reject the argument on a more fundamental ground.  Section 1 of the Suicide Act 1961 did not create a right to commit suicide.  All it did was to abrogate the rule of law which had previously made it a crime to commit suicide.  The fact that it provided in section 2(1) that a person who aids or abets another to commit suicide points clearly to the conclusion that decriminalisation, not the creation of a right, was what was intended.  There were good reasons for wishing to decriminalise the act itself.  The removal of the fear of prosecution and of the stigma was likely to make it easier to deter those who were planning or attempting suicide.  Broadly speaking, it was a measure in favour of saving life, with which the provisions of section 2 are entirely in sympathy.  In my opinion the argument that article 14 is engaged by a right to commit suicide which is to be found in section 1 of the 1961 Act must be rejected.</p>
<i><p><i>Conclusion</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107. It has not been shown that any of the Convention rights on which Mrs Pretty relies have been infringed by the Director's act when he said that he had no power to give the undertaking which she requested.  So it cannot be said that his act was unlawful within the meaning of section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998 or that he was obliged by that Act to give the undertaking.  Nor can it be said that the blanket ban which section 2(1) imposes on assisted suicide is incompatible with any of Mrs Pretty's Convention rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108. For these reasons and for those given by Lord Bingham of Cornhill and Lord Steyn I agree with the Divisional Court that the conclusions which it reached in this sad case are inescapable.  I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p><b>LORD HOBHOUSE OF WOODBOROUGH</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109. This appeal concerns the sanctity of human life.  The sanctity of human life is probably the most fundamental of the human social values.  It is recognised in all civilised societies and their legal systems and by the internationally recognised statements of human rights.  In English law it is given effect to by the criminalisation of murder and manslaughter.  In the European Convention on Human Rights it is reflected by Article 2, the Right to Life:</p>
<p></p><ul>"1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone's right to life shall be protected by law.  No one shall be deprived of his life intentionally save in the execution of a sentence of a court following his conviction of a crime for which this penalty is provided by law."<p></p></ul>
<p>The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on 25 June 1999 adopted a text which addressed the need to protect the dignity and quality of life of the terminally ill and the dying and called upon states to respect and protect this dignity by providing palliative care, by protecting the terminally ill or dying person's right to self determination through the availability of truthful and comprehensive information and respect for his expressed wishes as to the forms of treatment he is willing to receive, provided that they do not violate human dignity, and</p>
<p></p><ul>"by upholding the prohibition against intentionally taking the life of terminally ill or dying persons, while:<p></p></ul>
(i) recognising that the right to life, especially with regard to a terminally ill or dying person, is guaranteed by the member states, in accordance with Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights which states that 'no one shall be deprived of his life intentionally';
(ii) recognising that a terminally ill or dying person's wish to die never constitutes any legal claim to die at the hand of another person;
<p></p><ul>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;recognising that a terminally ill or dying person's wish to die cannot of itself constitute a legal justification to carry out actions intended to bring about death."<p></p></ul>
<p>In the Court of Appeal in <i>Airedale NHS Trust v Bland </i>[1993]  AC at 831, Hoffmann LJ said -</p>
<p></p><ul>"the sanctity of life entails its inviolability by an outsider.  Subject to exceptions like self-defence, human life is inviolate even if the person in question has consented to its violation.  That is why, although suicide is not a crime, assisting someone to commit suicide is." <p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110. There are two salient features of these statements of principle.  One is that the consent of the deceased is no justification or defence to a charge of having acted with the intention of causing the deceased's death.  A similar principle has been recognised in certain other aspects of the criminal law where the protection of the public order and the health of the society are considered to require it as, for example, in relation to the criminal offence of inflicting of grievous bodily harm.  The consent of the injured person to an unlawful wounding is not a defence: <i>R v Brown</i> [1994]  1 AC 212, upheld by the ECHR in <i>Laskey  Jaggard and Brown v United Kingdom</i> (1997)  24 EHRR 39.  Assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia have the same criminality as murder notwithstanding the consent of the deceased.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111. The other feature is that the involvement of a second party in the relevant conduct puts the conduct into a different category from conduct which has involved the deceased alone.  Joining in bringing about the intentional death of another person is in principle the crime of murder.  That the deceased wished to die and was, so far as he was concerned, committing suicide did not prevent the other from being convicted as a principal or accessory to the crime of murder.  Thus, a party to a suicide pact, who was absent at the time the other party killed himself, could be convicted of murder as an accessory before the fact.  (<i>R v Croft</i> [1944]  QB 295)  In law, quite minor acts of encouragement can render a defendant liable to be convicted of murder as an accessory.  (See for example <i>R v Giannetto</i> [1997]  1 Cr App R 1.)  Where there was a suicide pact to which the defendant was a party and which was to include his death, this consequence was mitigated by s.4 of the Homicide Act 1957 which reduced the offence, whether as principal or accessory, from murder to manslaughter.  But, where there was no suicide pact, the crime of murder continued to apply.  Where there is a joint purpose that the deceased's life should be ended and the deceased and the other person cooperate in achieving that end, the principle of joint enterprise may apply so as to make the second person criminally liable for murder or manslaughter: <i>R v Howe</i> [1987]  AC 417, overruling <i>R v Richards</i> [1974]  QB 776.  Since the passing of the Suicide Act 1961, it has not been a criminal offence for a person to take his own life or attempt to do so (s.1).  But the same Act preserved the criminality of the conduct of the second person.  S.2(1) created the offence of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the suicide, or attempted suicide, of another with a maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment.  The result is that the relevance of suicide as opposed to voluntary euthanasia is not that it negatives the criminality of the conduct of the defendant (the second person) but that it affects the gravity of the criminal offence committed - the s.2(1) offence, manslaughter under s.4 of the 1957 Act, or murder.  Assisted suicide inevitably offends against the principle of the sanctity of human life.  The criminal law continues to reflect this.  Assisted suicide will involve the commission of a criminal offence contrary to s.2(1) of the Act of 1961.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112. Mr Havers QC, who appeared on behalf of the appellant and who presented her argument with admirable objectivity and clarity, acknowleged, as he had to, that unless he could show that the appellant's human rights had been infringed contrary to the Human Rights Act 1998 he could not escape from the consequences of s.2(1) of the 1961 Act.  For the reasons which they have given in their speeches, I agree with my noble and learned friends Lord Bingham of Cornhill, Lord Steyn and Lord Hope of Craighead that the appellant's human rights are not being infringed and wish to add nothing in that regard to what they have said.  This conclusion suffices to necessitate the dismissal of the appeal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113.  But, like the Divisional Court and my noble and learned friend Lord Steyn and in agreement with them, I do not consider it right to leave this case without saying something about the appellant's use of the remedy of judicial review to bring this matter before the court. The respondent to the application is the Director of Public Prosecutions and the subject matter of her application is his negative response to a letter dated 27 July 2001 from the appellant's solicitor requesting a "written undertaking" that he would not consent to a prosecution of Mr Pretty in the event that Mr Pretty should aid, abet, counsel or procure the suicide of the appellant in a manner consistent with her wishes.  She said that she wished to choose for herself the time when and the means by which she should die and, owing to her disabling illness, was unable to fulfil this wish unaided and wished that the necessary assistance be provided by her husband.  The making of this request for an undertaking was said to be justified by the Human Rights Act and the fact that any proceedings for an offence under s.2 or the Act of 1961 may only be instituted by or with the consent of the Director: s.2(4).  It thus raises again the considerations discussed in the speeches of Lord Steyn and myself in <i>R v DPP, ex parte Kebilene</i> [2000]  2 AC 326.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114. The office of Director is a statutory office with functions and powers governed by statute, currently the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 which introduced a radical restructuring of the management and conduct of criminal prosecutions in England and Wales, bringing into existence the Crown Prosecution Service and altering the role of the police.  The functions of the Director are set out in s.3 of the Act.  They do not include the grant of dispensations from the criminal law nor the grant of pardons; they primarily relate to the institution and conduct of criminal proceedings.  It is not part of his functions or duties to advise members of the public.  He has a duty to issue a Code for Crown Prosecutors giving them guidance on the general principles to be applied by them in deciding when proceedings should be instituted or discontinued and what charges should be preferred: s.10.  The undertaking which the appellant requested was not one which the Director as the holder of the statutory office had the authority or power to give and it would have been improper for him to give the undertaking whatever the merits of the appellant's solicitor's arguments.  Under s.2(4) of the 1961 Act his role is confined to giving his consent to the institution of proceedings for an offence under s.2.  This presupposes that an alleged offence has been committed and that he can exercise his discretion under s.2(4) in relation to all the circumstances disclosed by the evidence of what has occurred as the Code issued under s.10 of the 1985 Act makes clear.  The functions of the Director do not include giving undertakings in advance of the event as to how he would exercise that discretion on hypothetical facts.  Even after the event, the Director has no investigatory powers and is dependent upon evidence supplied to him by others, normally the police.</p>
