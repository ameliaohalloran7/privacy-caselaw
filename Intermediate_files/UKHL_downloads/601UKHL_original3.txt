<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Order provided, in article 2(1), that where the article applied the amount to be registered as the rent of a dwelling-house under Part IV of the 1977 Act should not exceed the maximum fair rent calculated in accordance with the formula set out in the article.  The amendment made by the Schedule to the Order modified Schedule 11 to the 1977 Act, which governed the process of registration under section 67 of the Act, not the calculation of recoverable rent, a matter governed by Part III.  This, it was submitted, was not permitted by section 31, which related only to the restriction of rent, and effected radical changes which went beyond "modifying" the 1977 Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot accept this argument.  The Order did not, as was suggested, revoke section 70 of the 1977 Act, which continued to apply where no fair rent had previously been registered and where an increased fair rent did not exceed the maximum laid down by the formula in the Order.  An order made under the power conferred by section 31(1) could properly contain supplementary or incidental provisions, even where these excluded, adapted or modified the 1977 Act.  The ministers could no doubt have permitted registration of the fair rent calculated on the modified open market rent basis prescribed by the 1977 Act, while stipulating that no rent in excess of the formula laid down in the Order should be payable or recoverable.  But this would have called for amendment of section 44(1) of the 1977 Act, and the ministers were in my view entitled to adhere to the rule that the rent recoverable should be the rent registered and no more.  I do not think they exceeded their powers in giving effect to this view.</p>
<i><p>Ground 3</p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ground was based on the terms of section 74 of the 1977 Act which gave power to the Secretary of State to make regulations prescribing forms, regulating the procedure to be followed by rent officers and rent assessment committees and "prescribing anything required or authorised to be prescribed" by Part IV of the Act.  It was provided by subsection (2) that regulations might contain provisions modifying certain provisions of the Act, including section 67 and both Parts of Schedule 11, but no such regulations were to have effect unless approved by resolution of each House.  Other regulations were subject only to annulment. In reliance on these provisions, Spath Holme argued that Schedule 11 could not be modified in any way save by the affirmative procedure prescribed in section 74. It was accordingly not open to the ministers to amend Schedule 11 under section 31, which provided for annulment by negative resolution and not approval by affirmative resolution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I cannot accept this argument.  The 1985 Act was passed after the 1977 Act.  In section 31(2) it gave ministers power to exclude, adapt or modify "any provision made by or under an enactment (whenever passed) relating to rent or the recovery of overpaid rent."  The language could scarcely be broader.  Plainly the 1977 Act and Schedule 11 related to rent. An Order under section 31 could only be made if circumstances arose which justified ministers in making an Order under the section.  But if they did, Parliament must have intended the ministers' powers to be exercisable subject only to the procedure laid down in section 31(4).  </p>
<i><p>Ground 5</p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spath Holme submitted that in making the Order the ministers had not taken account of all relevant considerations and had taken account of irrelevant considerations.  First, it was argued, ministers had failed to take account of the potent arguments advanced by landlords in opposition to the third option canvassed in the consultation paper of May 1998.  Secondly, reliance was placed on certain observations made by ministers, which were said to have betrayed a misconception that the sharp and unexpected increases to which some tenants were subjected had occurred "despite" the fair rent regime governed by the 1977 Act, whereas in truth they had occurred because that regime had not been correctly implemented in some areas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not persuaded by these arguments.  Landlords did indeed have strongly arguable grounds for resisting the government's proposal, but it cannot be said that their interests were ignored.  In the annex to the consultation paper the object of the proposed measure was said to be:</p>
<p></p><ul>"to slow down the rate at which fair rents are increasing for tenants but nevertheless to ensure that there is no disproportionate impact on landlords."<p></p></ul>
<p>Under the heading "Issues of equity or fairness", the question was posed:</p>
<p></p><ul>"is it fair to landlords to change the fair rent system which was left intact when the Housing Act 1988 was introduced and which they would not have expected to be changed subsequently."<p></p></ul>
<p>Having posed the question it cannot be thought that ministers ignored the landlords' answer, disappointed though landlords may be that it was not given greater weight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the ministerial statements on this subject could have been more felicitously expressed.  But the problem of sharp and unexpected rent increases had indeed arisen despite the fair rent regime, since that regime had been in force throughout and the increases would not have occurred had it been faithfully implemented in all areas from the beginning.  Ministers did not suggest that the Court of Appeal decisions which had brought the reluctant rent officers and rent assessment committees into line had not given true effect to the fair rent legislation, nor that the general law should be changed.  But it was the case that what ministers considered a serious social problem had arisen, even if it should not have arisen, and their observations are readily understandable in that context.  I see nothing to suggest that the ministers had misconceived the source of the problem.</p>
<i><p>Ground 6</p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spath Holme submitted that in making the Order the ministers had acted unreasonably, unfairly and disproportionately.  A number of complaints were made.  The restriction imposed by the Order applied across the board, thus giving a benefit to tenants who would have been caused no hardship by the full rental increases as well as those who would.  It ignored the relief afforded by housing benefit.  It meant that landlords who had already suffered loss through the registration of rents at too low a level were now obliged to give tenants a further subsidy, as a result of errors made by rent officers and rent assessment committees.  The interference with registration as well as the rent recoverable was disproportionate.  There were figures which showed that the stable door was being locked after the horse had bolted.  The Order only applied to  about half the regulated tenants who had registered rents and made no difference to the remainder.  The Order breached Article 1 of the First Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights, as well as Articles 13 and 14.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal considered this submission carefully, and in my opinion were right to reject it.  It is an enduring and intractable problem of social policy that those who need relief cannot always be helped without giving relief to those who do not need it.  Housing benefit is means-tested, and the allocation of public resources is a matter for ministers, not courts.  The hardship which the Order imposed on landlords was a very relevant consideration, but it was for ministers to judge where the balance between the competing interests of landlords and tenants should be struck.  It was not unreasonable to provide that the maximum recoverable rents should be the rents registered.  The timing and scope of the Order were matters on which the ministers had to form a judgment, and their judgment cannot be stigmatised as perverse.  There was no breach of the European Convention: the European Court of Human Rights has recognised the need for a wide measure of discretion in the implementation of policy in this field, as shown by <i>Mellacher v. Austria </i> (1989)  12 EHRR 391.  Any actions the ministers took, or any failure by the ministers to take action, were bound to be bitterly resented by those who were disadvantaged as a result.  That does not mean that the action which the ministers did take in making the Order was unreasonable, unfair or disproportionate, disadvantageous to landlords though it certainly was.</p>
<i><p>Order</p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would allow the ministers' appeal, quash the Order made by the Court of Appeal and dismiss Spath Holme's application for judicial review.  In accordance with the terms on which leave to appeal to the House was given, the Ministers must pay Spath Holme's costs before the House and the order for costs made in the Court of Appeal will stand.</p>
<p><b>LORD NICHOLLS OF BIRKENHEAD</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the advantage of reading in draft the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill.  In agreement with him, I would allow this appeal.  The one point on which I part company with him concerns the use of Hansard.  On this matter there is a measure of disagreement between your Lordships.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I go back to first principles.  The present appeal raises a point of statutory interpretation: what is the ambit of the power conferred on the minister by section 31(1) of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985?  No statutory power is of unlimited scope.  The discretion given by Parliament is never absolute or unfettered.  Powers are conferred by Parliament for a purpose, and they may be lawfully exercised only in furtherance of that purpose: 'the policy and objects of the Act', in the oft-quoted words of Lord Reid in <i>Padfield v. Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</i> [1968]  AC 997,1030.  The purpose for which a power is conferred, and hence its ambit, may be stated expressly in the statute.  Or it may be implicit.  Then the purpose has to be inferred from the language used, read in its statutory context and having regard to any aid to interpretation which assists in the particular case.  In either event, whether the purpose is stated expressly or has to be inferred, the exercise is one of statutory interpretation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statutory interpretation is an exercise which requires the court to identify the meaning borne by the words in question in the particular context.  The task of the court is often said to be to ascertain the intention of Parliament expressed in the language under consideration.  This is correct and may be helpful, so long as it is remembered that the 'intention of Parliament' is an objective concept, not subjective.  The phrase is a shorthand reference to the intention which the court reasonably imputes to Parliament in respect of the language used.  It is not the subjective intention of the minister or other persons who promoted the legislation.  Nor is it the subjective intention of the draftsman, or of individual members or even of a majority of individual members of either House.  These individuals will often have widely varying intentions.  Their understanding of the legislation and the words used may be impressively complete or woefully inadequate.  Thus, when courts say that such-and-such a meaning 'cannot be what Parliament intended', they are saying only that the words under consideration cannot reasonably be taken as used by Parliament with that meaning. As Lord Reid said in <i>Black-Clawson International Ltd v Papierwerke Waldhof-Aschaffenburg A G </i>[1975] AC 591, 613:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We often say that we are looking for the intention of Parliament, but that is not quite accurate.  We are seeking the meaning of the words which Parliament used.'</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In identifying the meaning of the words used, the courts employ accepted principles of interpretation as useful guides.  For instance, an appropriate starting point is that language is to be taken to bear its ordinary meaning in the general context of the statute.  Another, recently enacted, principle is that so far as possible legislation must be read in a way which is compatible with human rights and fundamental freedoms: see section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998.  The principles of interpretation include also certain presumptions.  To take a familiar instance, the courts presume that a mental ingredient is an essential element in every statutory offence unless Parliament has indicated a contrary intention expressly or by necessary implication. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the courts employ other recognised aids.  They may be internal aids.  Other provisions in the same statute may shed light on the meaning of the words under consideration.  Or the aids may be external to the statute, such as its background setting and its legislative history. This extraneous material includes reports of Royal Commissions and advisory committees, reports of the Law Commission (with or without a draft Bill attached), and a statute's legislative antecedents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use of non-statutory materials as an aid to interpretation is not a new development.  As long ago as 1584 the Barons of the Exchequer enunciated the so-called mischief rule.  In interpreting statutes courts should take into account, among other matters, 'the mischief and defect for which the common law did not provide': <i>Heydon's</i> Case (1584) 3 Co Rep 7a, 7b.  Nowadays the courts look at external aids for more than merely identifying the mischief the statute is intended to cure.  In adopting a purposive approach to the interpretation of statutory language, courts seek to identify and give effect to the purpose of the legislation.  To the extent that extraneous material assists in identifying the purpose of the legislation, it is a useful tool. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is subject to an important caveat.  External aids differ significantly from internal aids.  Unlike internal aids, external aids are not found within the statute in which Parliament has expressed its intention in the words in question.  This difference is of constitutional importance.  Citizens, with the assistance of their advisers, are intended to be able to understand parliamentary enactments, so that they can regulate their conduct accordingly.  They should be able to rely upon what they read in an Act of Parliament.  This gives rise to a tension between the need for legal certainty, which is one of the fundamental elements of the rule of law, and the need to give effect to the intention of Parliament, from whatever source that (objectively assessed) intention can be gleaned.  Lord Diplock drew attention to the importance of this aspect of the rule of law in <i>Fothergill v Monarch Airlines Ltd</i> [1981] AC 251, 279-280:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The source to which Parliament must have intended the citizen to refer is the language of the Act itself.  These are the words which Parliament has itself approved as accurately expressing its intentions.  If the meaning of those words is clear and unambiguous and does not lead to a result that is manifestly absurd or unreasonable, it would be a confidence trick by Parliament and destructive of all legal certainty if the private citizen could not rely upon that meaning but was required to search through all that had happened before and in the course of the legislative process in order to see whether there was anything to be found from which it could be inferred that Parliament's real intention had not been accurately expressed by the actual words that Parliament had adopted to communicate it to those affected by the legislation'.<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This constitutional consideration does not mean that when deciding whether statutory language is clear and unambiguous and not productive of absurdity, the courts are confined to looking solely at the language in question in its context within the statute.  That would impose on the courts much too restrictive an approach.  No legislation is enacted in a vacuum. Regard may also be had to extraneous material, such as the setting in which the legislation was enacted.  This is a matter of everyday occurrence. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, courts should nevertheless approach the use of external aids with circumspection.  Judges frequently turn to external aids for confirmation of views reached without their assistance.  That is unobjectionable.  But the constitutional implications point to a need for courts to be slow to permit external aids to displace meanings which are otherwise clear and unambiguous and not productive of absurdity.  Sometimes external aids may properly operate in this way.  In other cases, the requirements of legal certainty might be undermined to an unacceptable extent if the court were to adopt, as the intention to be imputed to Parliament in using the words in question, the meaning suggested by an external aid.  Thus, when interpreting statutory language courts have to strike a balance between conflicting considerations. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some years before 1993 a self-imposed judicial rule precluded use of parliamentary proceedings as an external aid.  This exclusionary rule was relaxed by this House in <i>Pepper v Hart</i>, so as to permit use of parliamentary materials as an aid to construction where certain conditions are satisfied.  One of these conditions is that the legislation must be ambiguous or obscure, or lead to an absurdity: see Lord Browne-Wilkinson [1993] AC, 593 at 640.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see nothing in this formulation or in principle to suggest that the ambiguity or obscurity or absurdity must be of any particular type.  The purpose for which a statutory power is conferred is just as much a question of interpretation of the statutory provision as is the meaning of a particular word or phrase.  It cannot be right for the courts to look at parliamentary proceedings, if they assist, on the interpretation of a particular word or phrase, but to decline to look at parliamentary proceedings, however much assistance they may give, when deciding, as a matter of interpretation, what was the purpose for which a power was conferred.  The point is underlined by noting that, if drawn, this distinction has the consequence that, in the latter type of case, the courts will look at <i>other</i> forms of extraneous material if they assist, such as statements in Government white papers, but not at what was said by Government ministers in Parliament.  This would not be a rational distinction. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experience has shown that the occasions on which reference to parliamentary proceedings is of assistance are rare.  To be of assistance as an external aid, the parliamentary statement relied upon must be clear and unequivocal.  Otherwise it is of no real use.   Parliamentary statements seldom satisfy this test on the points of interpretation which come before the courts.  Increasing awareness of the lack of help provided by parliamentary material will, it is to be hoped, result in counsel being more realistic and more sparing in their references to such material. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Lord Cooke points out in his speech, this does not mean that the courts will shut out, and not even look at, parliamentary material which one party reasonably contends supports his interpretation of ambiguous legislation.  Rather, the courts will consider the material to see whether counsel's contention is well-founded.  If the parliamentary statements relied upon are not clear, they are of little or no value and cannot qualify as an external aid in the particular case.  They will fail to satisfy the third of Lord Browne-Wilkinson's conditions: see <i>Pepper v Hart</i> [1993] AC 593, 640.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, however, the statements are clear, and were made by a minister or other promoter of the Bill, they qualify as an external aid.  In such a case the statements are a factor the court will take into account in construing legislation which is ambiguous or obscure or productive of absurdity.  They are then as much part of the background to the legislation as, say, Government white papers.  They are part of the legislative background, <i>but they are no more than this</i>.  This cannot be emphasised this too strongly.  Government statements, however they are made and however explicit they may be, cannot control the meaning of an Act of Parliament.  As with other extraneous material, it is for the court, when determining what was the intention of Parliament in using the words in question, to decide how much importance, or weight, if any, should be attached to a Government statement.  The weight will depend on all the circumstances.  For instance, the statement might conflict with the principle of interpretation that penal legislation is to be construed strictly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn to the present case.  Read by itself, section 31(1) and (2) of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985, coupled with its sidenote 'Reserve power to limit rents', suggests that the power thereby conferred is intended to be kept in reserve, available to be used by the minister in unforeseen circumstances when he reasonably considers this is necessary to promote fairness between landlords and tenants of dwellings.  But, as so interpreted, the ambit of the power is extremely wide.  Indeed, it is the very width of the power, as so interpreted, together with its derivation from the Counter-Inflation Act 1973, that raises questions.  One is left in doubt whether, as contended by Spath Holme, there is some narrower interpretation which is to be preferred; for instance, that the power was conferred for use only for counter-inflationary purposes.  The legislation is not clear.  Thus it satisfies the first pre-condition for the use of parliamentary materials as an external aid.  I have more difficulty over the third pre-condition (the statement relied upon must be clear).  In considering whether a ministerial statement is clear and unequivocal, regard must be had to the circumstances in which it was made.  Extempore answers given in the course of vigorous debate in the House or in committee cannot be expected to be as comprehensive and precise as more formal statements.  Suffice to say, looking at them overall, the parliamentary statements relied upon in the present case do not contain a clear and unequivocal statement in favour of the interpretation contended for by Spath Holme.  That being so, they are not useful as an external aid in support of that interpretation. </p>
<p><b>LORD COOKE OF THORNDON</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having had the advantage of reading in draft the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill, I agree with his conclusion and largely with his reasons; but I wish to add something, mainly about Hansard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some passages in the judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered by Stuart-Smith L.J. might seem to suggest that in construing section 31 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 the choice is between an unlimited power and a limited one.  As no statutory discretion is unlimited, that could not be right.  Very probably the Court of Appeal did not mean such a stark contrast, for they did also say that ordinary <i>Wednesbury </i>principles would apply.  Taken as a whole, their reasoning is consistent with what I believe to be the true view: namely that the choice is between a power limited to making rent restriction orders reasonably capable of being seen to reflect the equities between landlords and tenants of dwellings, on the one hand, and a power limited to making such orders for counter-inflationary purposes, on the other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even so, a power conditioned only by landlord and tenant equities is very wide.  I think that the Court of Appeal were correct in their view that it was not clear and unambiguous, but in doubt, that Parliament intended such a wide power.  "Ambiguous" is a word not itself free from the quality which it purports to ascribe.  The philosopher Sir William Empson famously identified seven types of ambiguity, none of which appears to correspond with ordinary legal usage.  In ordinary legal usage, I think that a provision is ambiguous if reasonably open on orthodox rules of construction to more than one meaning.  In this sense, I think that section 31(1) and (2) of the Act of 1985, and their forerunners section 11(1) and (2) of the Housing Rents and Subsidies Act 1975, are ambiguous.  While today the purposive principle of interpretation is the governing one if available, other established canons may come into play.  They include some referred to by the Court of Appeal and relied on for the landlords in argument there and in your Lordships' House: such as that Parliament does not lightly take the exceptional course of delegating to the executive the power to amend primary legislation; that, when it does so, a restrictive approach to interpretation is legitimate; and that, in the absence of clear language Parliament is presumed not to take away property rights without compensation.  As the Court of Appeal said, certain provisions in other legislation designed, by phasing, to alleviate hardship in large rent increases, may also be seen as supporting a restrictive approach to the reserve power.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Court of Appeal resolved the ambiguity in two ways.  First, they thought it clear from both the context of section 11 of the Act of 1975, particularly section 11(4) and (5), and its derivation from section 11 of the Counter-Inflation Act 1973, that the purpose of the reserve power was and is limited to counter-inflation.  Like Lord Bingham of Cornhill, I am respectfully unable to agree.  The fact that counter-inflationary powers have been abolished and counter-inflationary orders revoked goes no distance towards showing that a replacement power expressed in comprehensive terms in general landlord and tenant legislation is limited to counter-inflation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second and alternative way in which the Court of Appeal resolved the ambiguity was by reference to the statements of responsible Ministers when the Act of 1975 was going through Parliament.  They relied on <i>Pepper v. Hart</i> [1993]  A.C. 593.  My Lords, for the reasons to be given later herein, while not sharing their conclusions I think that the Court of Appeal were well entitled to refer to Hansard.  Moreover the Ministerial statements in the House of Commons and the House of Lords quoted by the Court of Appeal do provide considerable support for a restricted intention:  ". . . a reserve power of a general counter-inflationary nature."  "It is, of course, disproportionate in counter-inflation terms."  "This power is necessary on broad grounds of Government economic policy, and is similar to the power in the Counter-Inflation Act under which the current rent freeze was imposed."  See the quotations appearing more fully in [2000] 3 W.L.R. at 158.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when these statements are read together with others made by the Government spokesmen in Parliament, they cease to be unequivocal.  The Bill which was enacted in 1975 was originally confined to local authorities.  In opening the debate in the House of Commons on the second reading of the Bill, the Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Anthony Crosland) said "With this short Bill the Government aim to cut the throat of the Tory Housing Finance Act at a stroke."  Hansard (H.C. Debates) 18 November 1974, col. 904.  It is a statement suggesting a difference of social policy rather than a concern limited to inflation.  His subsequent speech did include reference to counter-inflationary policy, but a main theme is illustrated by the following passage:</p>
<p></p><ul>"So this Bill restores to local authorities their power to set rents, subject only to the condition that these be 'reasonable.'  The concept of 'reasonable' rents was in force for 50 years up to the 1972 Act, and is well understood.  It means that councils must strike a reasonable balance between the various interests in their communities.  At the lower end, they cannot set rents so low that an unreasonable burden is laid on ratepayers.  At the top end, they cannot set rents so high that they actually make a profit out of the provision of council housing.  Within those very broad limits, the decision is theirs.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"This provision illustrates in the sharpest form the difference in philosophy between the Opposition and ourselves.  The authors of the 1972 Act envisaged a situation where many councils would make an actual profit on their housing - a profit on housing which contains an important social service element.  That concept - the generation of profit out of socially necessary housing - is one which we on this side of the House reject, and which this Bill will make impossible."<p></p></ul>
<p>Ib. col. 905-906.  The Under-Secretary of State, Mr. Kaufman, after mentioning subsidies to local authorities gave similarly general explanations of the purpose of the power, such as:</p>
<p></p><ul>"However, we are concerned that there might be circumstances in which it appeared that rent increases were becoming disproportionate.  We want this power to  cover that circumstance.  We specifically do not wish to take power to deal with an individual authority.  We believe that, in view of the basis upon which we drafted the Bill, and bearing in mind, without being too vainglorious, what we might describe as the philosophy behind the Bill, it would be entirely wrong for the Government who have sought to restore to individual local authorities the power to fix rents then to descend upon one local authority and say, 'You are behaving badly.  Therefore, we are going to interfere with your rent-fixing.'  We shall not do that.  <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"If a pattern emerged that we regarded as dangerous, we should exercise our fall-back power in respect of that pattern.  But an individual authority - not even the authority responsible for Paddington - would certainly not trigger off the use of that power."<p></p></ul>
<p>Hansard (H.C. Debates) 3 December 1974, col. 133.  The Bill was amended to extend to private sector rents for dwellings, and on 14 January 1975 Mr. Kaufman said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"I should like to repeat and underline the assurances I gave in Committee about the way in which the power will be used.  I cannot anticipate the use of reserve powers since the use of a reserve power cannot be anticipated.  On the other hand, the fact that we are asking the House to agree to amendments extending that reserve power to the private sector means that we envisage the possibility that it will be used.  One cannot anticipate the circumstances."   <p></p></ul>
<p>Hansard (H.C. Debates) col. 342.  Self-evident though it might seem, this statement is the clearest evidence that the power was intended by the Government to cover unforeseeable circumstances generally.  In the Lords on 27 January 1975 Lord Melchett, who moved the second reading of the Bill, was also cautious:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The noble Baroness asked me about the reserve powers in Clause 2 of the Bill.  She wished to know why this power could not be left in the Counter-Inflation Act. The answer is that a power concerning rents is much better included in a housing Act.  Under the Counter-Inflation Act, the power would expire early in 1976 and, since it is not possible to say whether the need for this power will expire at that date or if it will need to be continued for longer, the Government feel that it is right to put the power into the present Bill.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"I think that I was also asked in what circumstances this power might be used.  The power must be flexibly worded in order to cope with all situations in which it might be needed.  In the private sector it could be used to deal with particular categories of dwelling, and in the public sector, where landlords are non-profit making bodies, the same problem does not arise.  Clause 11(5) limits the power to specifying a description of authorities or dwellings - in other words, the use of this power in the public sector could not be aimed at an individual local authority without going beyond the plain intention of Clause 11(5)." <p></p></ul>
<p>Hansard (H.L. Debates) col. 359-360.  In the light of such statements it is difficult to agree with the Court of Appeal that it could not be clearer that the power was intended to be limited to counter-inflationary purposes.  Neither in the legislative history nor in the parliamentary history can I find enough to justify reading down the power in the manner for which the landlords contend.  The true interpretation, in my view, is the wide but not unlimited first alternative previously mentioned.  The reserve power can legitimately be used to temper the effect of unexpected rent increases for tenants on fixed incomes, even though the rises result from a correct reinterpretation of the law rather than from general inflation.  It is highly unlikely that the responsible Ministers would have meant to exclude such circumstances from the ambit of the power.</p>
