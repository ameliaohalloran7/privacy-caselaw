<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76.&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection (2) then sets out the Commissioners' duty on receipt of the revocation application.  They must grant it if they believe -</p>
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;that as a result of an order under section 3(8), or a change in the prisoner's circumstances, an applicable condition is not satisfied, 
&nbsp;&nbsp;or
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;that evidence or information which was not available to them when they granted the declaration suggests that an applicable condition in section 3 is not satisfied.</p>
<p>Again, paragraph (a) appears straightforward.  If the Commissioners believe, in the light of the factual changes which have occurred, that one of the four conditions is no longer satisfied, they must revoke the declaration.  That is the same exercise as under section 3, the application of their judgment to the factual situation.  It is more difficult to see why the legislature has used the word "suggests" in paragraph (b).  It was quite appropriate for use in subsection (1)(b), where it defined the conditions in which the Secretary of State should apply for revocation.  At that stage he is not making a determination on the continued application of the conditions, merely that the evidence or information suggests that one of them is not satisfied.  The Commissioners have, however, to make a definitive determination, and one would have expected to find their task defined in terms of deciding whether in their judgment the condition was or was not satisfied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77.&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue arose in the course of argument before the House whether the effect of section 8(2)(b) was that the Commissioners should revoke the declaration once there is some evidence which suggests that the condition is not satisfied, without proceeding as far as a definitive decision to that effect.  They would then leave it to the prisoner to bring a fresh application under section 3, relying on rule 9(2), which permits the Commissioners to determine a further application if in their view -</p>
<p></p><ul>"(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;circumstances have changed since the most recent substantive determination was made in respect of the person concerned; or<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;reliance is placed in support of the further application on any material information, document or evidence which was not placed before the Commissioners when the most recent substantive determination was made in respect of the person concerned."<p></p></ul>
<p>Such an interpretation would in my view produce odd and undesirable results.  The prisoner would have to remain in custody, unless granted bail, until a fresh section 3 application could be heard, which might take some time.  It is not at all clear to me that the bringing of a section 8 application by the Secretary of State could be construed as a change of circumstances within rule 9(2)(a) or that the process of adducing and testing the evidence on which he relied in the section 8 application comes within the terms of rule 9(2)(b).  The latter provision refers more naturally to fresh evidence adduced on behalf of the prisoner to found his case for a review of the previous refusal of his section 3 application.  Moreover, section 8(2)(a) refers, as one might more readily expect, to a change in the prisoner's circumstances.  The language of section 8(2)(b) is undoubtedly strange in its use of the word "suggests".  I think nevertheless that it fits the overall scheme and intention of the legislation more aptly to regard every application governed by either section 8(2)(a) or section 8(2)(b) as a complete review <i>de novo </i>of the prisoner's case under section 3 for a release declaration.  In my view, accordingly, section 8 can and should be construed in this manner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78.&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows from the conclusions which I have reached that it was the duty of the Commissioners to conduct a full review of the case of a prisoner in respect of whom the Secretary of State has made an application under section 8 of the Act.  They should take into account any order made under section 3(8), any relevant change of circumstances and any fresh evidence or information which bears on the satisfaction of the conditions contained in section 3.  They should do so without imposing a burden of proof either on the prisoner or on the Secretary of State, their object being to determine whether in their opinion those conditions remain satisfied.  If they consider that the conditions do remain satisfied, the application should be refused; if not, then the application should be granted and the declaration revoked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79.&nbsp;&nbsp;As Dr Morrow stated in para 3 of his affidavit sworn on 14 August 2002, the Commissioners accepted that the burden of proof rested on the parties in the manner which he has described, and for the reasons which I have given I consider that they were in error in that.  It is necessary, however, to have regard to what they actually decided, as set out in the written reasons for their decision.  In para 2 of those reasons, which I have set out in para 67 of this opinion, they stated that they "must be persuaded" that a condition in section 3 was no longer satisfied.  They then posed the question whether they were "still able to say that if released immediately, the respondent would not be a danger to the public".  In para 4 they say that the matters which they considered left them "with <i>additional</i> doubt in their minds about the respondent's danger to the public," which was not dispelled by his evidence in the hearing.  They concluded in para 6 that "it is not possible for the Commissioners to say that if released immediately, the respondent would not be a danger to the public," a formula which they repeated in para 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is apparent accordingly that the Commissioners took into account the material originally placed before them when making the declaration under section 3 and added to that the further material received on the section 8 application.  They applied the statutory tests contained in section 3 to that amalgam of material and formed the conclusion that the conditions were no longer satisfied.  When it came to their actual decision they took the correct approach, and that was not invalidated by their previously being distracted by legally incorrect propositions about the burden of proof.  I would therefore hold that their decision on the section 8 application was validly reached and reverse the finding of the Court of Appeal on that issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81.&nbsp;&nbsp;The respondent's cross-appeal was based on a claim that the procedure adopted by the Commissioners constituted a breach of articles 5(4) and 6(1) of the Convention.  I respectfully agree with and adopt Lord Bingham's observations on this issue contained in paras 33 to 37 of his opinion, and in particular the reasons expressed by him in paras 35 and 36 for holding that the procedure adopted did not work unfairness to the respondent.  Like him, I do not find it necessary to express a concluded opinion on the applicability of articles 5(4) and 6(1).  I would, however, refer to paras 135 to 144 of my opinion in <i>R (Roberts) v Parole Board </i>[2005] UKHL 45 for an exposition of my views on the way in which article 5(4) should be applied in giving weight to opposing considerations in determining whether the deciding body has operated its procedures in a way which satisfies the essential requirements for a judicial body.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would dismiss the cross-appeal.</p>
<p><b>LORD BROWN OF EATON-UNDER-HEYWOOD</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83.&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been many terrible killings in the history of Northern Ireland.  But few have occasioned more revulsion than the cold-blooded murder on 3 March 1998 at the Railway Bar, Poyntzpass of two men, lifelong friends although of different religions, in what was intended, by the loyalist terrorist gunmen involved, to be a sectarian attack on Catholics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84.&nbsp;&nbsp;Stephen McClean, the respondent in your Lordships' House, was on 2 February 2000 convicted of these killings and sentenced to life imprisonment on two counts of murder and, arising out of the same incident, concurrent terms of twenty years imprisonment on two counts of attempted murder, and fifteen years imprisonment for possessing firearms and ammunition with intent to endanger life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85.&nbsp;&nbsp;Meantime, just a few weeks after these killings, the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement had been signed on 10 April 1998 and in furtherance of it the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998 (the 1998 Act) had been passed and, on 28 July 1998, brought into effect.  Put at its simplest, the 1998 Act provided upon certain conditions for the accelerated release of those convicted of serious terrorist offences committed before 10 April 1998, their accelerated release date ordinarily being the second anniversary of the coming into force of the 1998 Act, namely 28 July 2000.  That, indeed, would have been Mr McClean's release date—many years earlier than he could otherwise have hoped to be released—but for the appellant Commissioners' eventual conclusion that one of the conditions applicable to his case had not been satisfied.  The condition in question was that, if released immediately, "he would not be a danger to the public".  At issue on this appeal is whether, when that condition comes to be considered under section 8 of the 1998 Act—a provision allowing in certain circumstances for the Commissioners, upon the Secretary of State's application, to revoke an earlier declaration of the prisoner's eligibility for early release—the burden is upon the prisoner to show that he is not a danger to the public or upon the Secretary of State to show that he is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal by a majority held that the burden lies upon the Secretary of State.  By its order of 23 April 2004 it quashed the Commissioners' decision of 23 April 2002 and directed that, in their re-determination of the Secretary of State's application, "they shall require the Secretary of State to prove on the balance of probabilities that the appellant, if released immediately, would be a danger to the public."  Was that an appropriate direction?  That essentially is the question formulated by the parties for your Lordships' determination on the appeal.  A further question arises under Mr McClean's cross appeal with regard to the "damaging information" procedure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the advantage of reading in draft the speeches of my noble and learned friends Lord Bingham of Cornhill, Lord Scott of Foscote and Lord Carswell.  I agree with them all and on the cross appeal there is nothing I want to add.  There are aspects of the appeal, however, on which I wish to comment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88.&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of the 1998 Act on which I wish to focus are sections 3, 8 and 9.  Section 3, so far as relevant to the present appeal, provides that in the case of a life sentence prisoner convicted of terrorist offences, the Commissioners shall grant his application for a declaration that he is eligible for early release "if (and only if) . . . the following four conditions are satisfied."  This appeal concerns the fourth condition which is that "if the prisoner were released immediately, he would not be a danger to the public."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89.&nbsp;&nbsp;The material parts of section 8 are as follows:</p>
<p></p><ul>"8 <i>Revocation of declaration</i><p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary of State shall apply to Commissioners to revoke a declaration under section 3(1) if, at any time before the prisoner is released . . . the Secretary of State believes— <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;. . .<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;that evidence or information which was not available to the Commissioners when they granted the declaration suggests that an applicable condition in section 3 is not satisfied.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commissioners shall grant an application under this section if (and only if) the prisoner has not been released . . . and they believe—<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;. . .<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;that evidence or information which was not available to them when they granted the declaration suggests that an applicable condition in section 3 is not satisfied.<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 8, it will be noted, applies only before the prisoner's release on licence.  After release the position is dealt with under section 9.  This provides that amongst the conditions of a life prisoner's licence will be one "that he does not become a danger to the public".  If the Secretary of State believes that the prisoner "has broken or is likely to break" that condition, he may suspend the licence and re-detain the prisoner.  In that event the Commissioners are required to consider the case and, in doing so:</p>
<p></p><ul>"(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;if the Commissioners think he has not broken and is not likely to break [the] condition . . . they shall confirm his licence, and<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise, they shall revoke his licence."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91.&nbsp;&nbsp;It will readily be seen that under section 3 the Commissioners cannot grant a declaration of eligibility unless, were the prisoner to be released, he would not be a danger to the public.  Somewhat oddly this condition is set out for all the world as if its fulfilment were capable of being ascertained as an objective fact:  there is nothing in the section about the Commissioners having to be "satisfied" of its fulfilment or having to "believe" or "think" it fulfilled—compare the language in sections 8 and 9.  In my judgment, however, it is implicit in section 3 that it is for the Commissioners to form their own opinion as to whether, using shorthand, the prisoner can safely be released and, if satisfied that he can, they must declare his eligibility for early release but otherwise refuse it.  Certainly nothing is clearer under section 3 than that, were the Commissioners to be in any doubt as to whether the prisoner could be released without risk to the public, they would be bound to refuse his application:  the benefit of such doubt would go to the public, not to him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92.&nbsp;&nbsp;So too in my judgment it is plain from the statutory language that at the section 8 stage the Commissioners must revoke their previous declaration if they believe that the fresh evidence presented by the Secretary of State now suggests that, after all, the prisoner would present a risk on release, if in other words the Commissioners are no longer satisfied that he can be released without risk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93.&nbsp;&nbsp;And exactly the same approach applies even after the prisoner's release on conditional licence if the Secretary of State has thought it right to suspend the licence.  Once again the Commissioners, when they come to consider the case, are obliged to revoke the licence unless they think that the prisoner "has not broken and is not likely to break" the condition "that he does not become a danger to the public."  He will, of course, have broken it (or be likely to do so) if he has (or is likely to) become a danger and the Commissioners must therefore be satisfied, before he can be released afresh, that he presents no danger.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94.&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the Commissioners must ask themselves the same question at each stage: are we satisfied that the prisoner can be released without risk to the public.  If so, he must be released, otherwise not, and any doubt about the matter must be resolved against him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95.&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally speaking there will be no doubt as to whether a prisoner can be released without risk.  As Lord Bingham of Cornhill said in <i>R v Lichniak</i> [2003]  1 AC 903 at para 16: </p>
<p></p><ul>"I doubt whether there is in truth a burden on the prisoner to persuade the Parole Board that it is safe to recommend release, since this is an administrative process requiring the board to consider all the available material and form a judgment."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That thinking finds an echo in other judgments too—see, for example, Lord Hoffmann's speech in <i>Secretary of State for the Home Department v Rehman</i> [2003]  1 AC 153 at para 48: "The final decision is evaluative, looking at the evidence as a whole, and predictive, looking to future danger."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96.&nbsp;&nbsp;But whilst ordinarily the evaluative process will lead to a reasonably clear judgment on risk, sometimes (if only rarely) it will not.  This problem was usefully discussed by the Court of Appeal in <i>R (Sim) v Parole Board</i> [2004]  QB 1288, a decision concerning the onus of proof in the context of section 44A (4) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991: </p>
<p></p><ul>"the Board shall direct the prisoner's release if satisfied that it is no longer necessary for the protection of the public that he should be confined (but not otherwise)."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97.&nbsp;&nbsp;At para 43 of his judgment in <i>Sim</i>, Keene LJ adopted the following passage from Elias J's judgment in the court below (a passage I too find helpful):</p>
<p></p><ul>". . . there is in my view a distinction between on the one hand the board being required to order his release if satisfied that it is no longer necessary to detain the prisoner, which is how the legislation is framed; and on the other the board being required to release unless satisfied that it is necessary to detain the prisoner . . . the logic of [the Parole Board's] argument, as [counsel] was constrained to accept, is that either formulation would have precisely the same effect.  I do not accept that.  In my view there is a clear distinction between the two formulations, notwithstanding that in practice it is likely to be of little significance which is adopted.  As the provision stands the default position is that detention will continue unless the board is satisfied that this is not necessary.  If after hearing all the evidence the board remains genuinely unsure whether the prisoner needs to be detained or not, it must on the ordinary construction of section 44A continue his detention.  On the alternative formulation the prisoner in that situation would be at liberty (albeit on licence)."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98.&nbsp;&nbsp;The court in <i>Sim</i> was concerned with an extended sentence imposed under what became section 85 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000, described by Keene LJ as "a novel creature, differing in its characteristics both from the classic indeterminate sentence and from the 'normal' type of determinate sentence under consideration in <i>Giles's </i>case<i> </i>[R<i> (Giles) v Parole Board</i> [2004]  1 AC 1]."  Mr Sim had been recalled to prison during the extended licence period of his sentence and it was decided that, unlike the position in <i>Giles,</i> where this House held that article 5 (4) of the European Convention on Human Rights had no application in the case of a prisoner sentenced to an ordinary extended determinate term, Mr Sim's detention had to be subject to review by a judicial body.  Keene LJ observed, at para 36:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In short, when an offender is detained during the extension period of a section 85 sentence, such detention must be subject to review by a judicial body.  No court ha ordered his detention during that period: prima facie the sentencing court took the view that he could be dealt with in the community during that period.  This is the critical factor which distinguishes this situation from that considered in <i>Giles</i> and in <i>R (Smith) v Parole Board (No 2)</i> [2004] 1 WLR 421, [later reversed by this House at [2005] 1 WLR 350], in both of which the court was concerned with detention falling within the term of imprisonment imposed by a competent court.  In cases of extended sentences under section 85, it is the executive which decides upon an offender's recall during the extension period, and because that detention has not been ordered by a court it must be scrutinised by a judicial body.  Otherwise there is a danger of an arbitrary decision being made by the executive.  As it happens, it <i>is</i> so supervised, because section 44A of the 1991 Act so provides through the mechanism of the Parole Board.  Parliament was right to take the view that such judicial supervision of detention during that period was necessary."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The correctness of this view cannot be doubted, in particular following the House's decision in <i>R (West) v Parole Board</i> [2005]  1 WLR 350, reversing the Court of Appeal's decision in that case and in <i>Smith </i>and holding that a prisoner's recall from release on licence engages article 5 (4)<i>.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having decided that Mr Sim's recall from licence during the extended period of his sentence required his fresh detention to be subject to supervision under article 5(4), the Court of Appeal then held that section 44A(4) on its ordinary construction was incompatible with his article 5 rights.  As Keene LJ put it in para 49:</p>
<p></p><ul>"If the redetention of the offender is not something which is to be seen as prima facie necessary because of the original sentence passed on him by the court, then one is driven back to first principles.  It is detention which has to be shown to be necessary, not liberty.  In <i>Reid v United Kingdom</i> (2003)  37 EHRR 211, the European Court of Human Rights noted that there is no direct Convention case law governing what it called the onus of proof in article 5 (4) proceedings, but it went on to say, at p 232, para 70:<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>'That it is however for the authorities to prove that an individual satisfies the conditions for compulsory detention, rather than the converse, may be regarded as implicit in the case law.'"<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the result the Court of Appeal applied section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998 to read and give effect to section 44A(4) in a way which was compatible with article 5(4) by requiring the Board to direct the offender's release unless positively satisfied that it was necessary for the protection of the public that he be confined.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101.&nbsp;&nbsp;In so ruling the Court of Appeal distinguished <i>Lichniak</i> where this House had expressly rejected the prisoner's argument that the requirement upon him at the end of the tariff period to show that it was safe to release him was contrary to article 5.  As Lord Bingham said, at para 16:</p>
<p></p><ul>"There is, inevitably, a balance to be struck between the interest of the individual and the interest of society and I do not think it objectionable, in the case of someone who once has taken life with the intent necessary for murder, to prefer the latter in case of doubt."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102.&nbsp;&nbsp;The basis of that distinction, explained Keene LJ (at para 46), was that whereas the objectives of the sentencing court imposing an indeterminate prison sentence "may well be seen as wishing to ensure that a person who has committed such a serious crime is not to be released unless and until it can be shown that he no longer presents a danger for the public," in a section 85 case "the object of the sentence is not to subject the prisoner to detention for the extended licence period . .  [but rather] to manage the risk in the community rather than in prison, albeit that it is recognised that it may be necessary to resort to further detention if that aim fails.  The offender is not on licence as an alternative to prison; rather he is on licence as an alternative to liberty."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Sim</i> is the only decision that I am aware of which holds that where after hearing all the evidence the Board remains genuinely unsure whether the prisoner needs to be detained or not, the benefit of that doubt must be given to the prisoner.  Should this be another such case?  Should the Commissioners (who fulfil substantially the same role under the 1998 Act as the Parole Board under the criminal justice legislation) allow a life sentence prisoner's early release if in doubt whether he can be safely released?  In my judgment emphatically not.  Rather this case seems to me <i>a</i> <i>fortiori</i> to <i>Lichniak.</i>  If a mandatory life sentence prisoner having already served the tariff period of his sentence must positively satisfy the Board that he can be safely released, the benefit of any doubt about that being given to the public, so surely must a life sentence prisoner whose only claim to be entitled to early release within the tariff period depends upon his satisfying a series of statutory conditions.  One could of course argue that unless the Commissioners under the 1998 Act are sure that a life sentence prisoner, if immediately released, would not be a danger to the public then by definition they must have concluded that he would be: a risk must necessarily exist unless it can be positively discounted.  And the graver and more recent the prisoner's convictions, the stronger such argument would be.  But even accepting that just occasionally the Commissioners may be genuinely unsure if such a prisoner can safely be released—the only situation in which the burden of proof assumes relevance—I for my part would unhesitatingly conclude that he should remain in prison rather than benefit from the accelerated release scheme.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to imagine a case further removed than this one from the very particular situation arising in <i>Sim</i>.  Not only did that case, unlike this, involve a recall from release on licence; more importantly still the original sentence in <i>Sim</i> had expressly contemplated the extended licence period being spent at liberty whereas of course here the sentencing court must have intended custodial punishment far exceeding two years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105.&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to add just a few words with specific regard to the application and effect of article 5(4).  It is now authoritatively established that that article is engaged in any indeterminate sentence case after the expiry of the tariff period and in any case involving a recall from release on licence.  In both those situations the lawfulness of the detention (continuing detention in the one case, fresh detention in the other) must be challengeable before "a court" (a role fulfilled by the Parole Board).  It is, however, altogether less clear that article 5(4) requires the prisoner's continuing or fresh detention to be subject to judicial supervision in the circumstances arising under sections 3, 8 or 9 of the 1998 Act.  There is force in what Lord Scott has to say about that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even assuming, however, which may be the better view, that article 5(4) does apply in these circumstances and that the Commissioners are discharging the function of a court and determining the lawfulness of the prisoner's continuing detention (or fresh detention), I see no incompatibility whatever between the requirements of article 5(4) and the prisoner's need to satisfy the Commissioners (whether under section 3, section 8, or section 9) that he can safely be released.  <i>Reid v United Kingdom</i> (the case relied upon by Keene LJ at para 49 of his judgment in <i>Sim</i>—see para 99 above) concerned what was then the domestic law requirement for the compulsory detention of mental patients that their mental illness was amenable to treatment.  Section 64 of the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984, however, placed the burden of proof on the applicant to satisfy the sheriff that he was no longer suffering from a mental disorder of a nature or degree which made it appropriate to continue his detention.  The ECtHR held it incompatible with article 5 (4) to place the burden on the applicant "to establish that his continued detention did not satisfy the conditions of lawfulness" (para 73).</p>
