<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109. In considering this argument it is necessary to take account of the judgment of the European Court in <i>Tinnelly &amp; Sons Ltd v United Kingdom </i> (1998)  27 EHRR 249.  The principal point decided in that case was that a certificate issued pursuant to statute by the Secretary of State that an act was done for the purpose of safeguarding national security cannot exclude access to a court to determine a dispute as to a citizen's rights: the right guaranteed by article 6(1) "cannot be displaced by the ipse dixit of the executive" (see para 77).  But the court also recognised that the right of access to a court may be subject to limitations in the interests of national security provided that the very essence of the right is not impaired and that there is a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aims sought to be achieved (see para 72).  The court also noted that in other contexts it had been found possible to modify judicial procedures in such a way as to safeguard national security concerns about the nature and sources of intelligence information and yet accord the individual a substantial degree of procedural justice (see para 78).  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110. In <i>Jasper v United Kingdom</i> (2000)  30 EHRR 441  the European Court again recognised that national security may require certain information not to be disclosed and stated that the fact that the issue of whether there should be disclosure was monitored by a judge was an important safeguard which could lead to the conclusion that there had not been a violation of article 6(1).  The court stated, at paras 52 and 56:</p>
<p></p><ul>"However, as the applicant recognised, the entitlement to disclosure of relevant evidence is not an absolute right.  In any criminal proceedings there may be competing interests, such as national security or the need to protect witnesses at risk of reprisals or keep secret police methods of investigation of crime, which must be weighed against the rights of the accused.  In some cases it may be necessary to withhold certain evidence from the defence so as to preserve the fundamental rights of another individual or to safeguard an important public interest.  However, only such measures restricting the rights of the defence which are strictly necessary are permissible under article 6(1).  Moreover, in order to ensure that the accused receives a fair trial, any difficulties caused to the defence by a limitation on its rights must be sufficiently counterbalanced by the procedures followed by the judicial authorities. ….<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>The fact that the need for disclosure was at all times under assessment by the trial judge provided a further, important, safeguard in that it was his duty to monitor throughout the trial the fairness or otherwise of the evidence being withheld."<p></p></ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111. In the light of these principles stated by the European Court I consider that if the appellant were refused official authorisation to disclose information to the public and applied for judicial review of that decision, a judge of the High Court would be able to conduct an enquiry into the refusal in such a way that the hearing would ensure justice to the appellant and uphold his rights under article 6(1) whilst also guarding against the disclosure of information which would be harmful to national security.  The intensity of the review, involving as it would do Convention rights, would be greater than a review conducted under the Wednesbury principle:  see per Lord Steyn in <i>R (Daly) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</i> [2001]  AC 532, 547 D-G.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112. In a recent judgment of the Divisional Court in <i>The Queen on the application of Crown Prosecution Service v Acton Youth Court</i> (22 May 2001), after referring to <i>Jasper v United Kingdom </i>(2000) 30 EHRR 441<i>,</i> <i>Rowe and Davis v United Kingdom</i> (2000)  30 EHRR 1, and <i>Fitt v United Kingdom</i> (2000)  30 EHRR 480, Lord Woolf CJ said that "…. the European Court of Human Rights is prepared to accept the obvious need in limited circumstances for the courts to protect in the public interest immunity from production of documents. ….".  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113. It would not be appropriate or practicable in this speech to specify the steps which a judge, before whom an application for judicial review was brought, should take to achieve the objective of giving substantial protection to the Convention rights of a past member of the Security Service in a way which would not result in the disclosure of information which would be harmful to national security.  But just as it is possible to devise a procedure to be followed in the Crown Court for upholding a claim to public interest immunity whilst not impairing the essential rights of the accused under article 6(1), so I consider that the High Court could devise a procedure to achieve a similar objective in applications for judicial review of a refusal of official authorisation. A possible course might be for the judge to appoint a special counsel to represent the interests of the person seeking disclosure.  This procedure was referred to by Lord Woolf, MR, in his judgment in the Court of Appeal in <i>Secretary of State for the Home Department v Rehman </i> [2000]  3 WLR 1240, 1250, para 31, where an issue of national security arose:</p>
<p></p><ul>"As it was possible that part of the hearing would have to be in closed session, Mr Nicholas Blake appeared at the request of the court.  The Act of 1997 makes no provision for a special advocate on an appeal.  However, it seemed to us that, if it was necessary for the court in order to dispose justly of the appeal to hear submissions in the absence of Mr Rehman and his counsel, under the inherent jurisdiction of the court, counsel instructed by the Treasury Solicitor, with the agreement of the Attorney-General, would be able to perform a similar role to a special advocate without the advantage of statutory backing for this being done.  A court will only hear submissions on a substantive appeal in the absence of a party in the most extreme circumstances.  However, considerations of national security can create situations where this is necessary.  If this happens, the court should use its inherent power to reduce the risk of prejudice to the absent party so far as possible …."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114. Another possible course might be for the past member of the Security Service, as a preparatory step before instituting an application for judicial review, to seek official authorisation to disclose the information only to a specified solicitor and counsel, and in the course of his submissions on behalf of the Crown Mr Sweeney QC stated that he was instructed to say that if such an application for authorisation were made it would be looked at sympathetically.  If authorisation for such restricted disclosure were refused the past member could seek judicial review of that refusal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115. There would, of course, be no substance in the argument by the Crown that the appellant would have a remedy in judicial review to challenge an improper refusal of authorisation to make disclosure to the public, if the right to apply for judicial review was merely a formal right where the application would be bound to fail because the applicant could place no information before the court to support it.  But, notwithstanding the difficulties which could arise in relation to placing the necessary information before the High Court, I consider that those difficulties would not be insurmountable and that the High Court would be able to assist the appellant to overcome those difficulties and to ensure that justice was done to him.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116. It is to be observed that the appellant took no steps to apply for official authorisation to publish the information which he wished to disclose to the public and for the reasons which I have given I consider that he cannot argue that, if there had been a refusal of authorisation, an application for judicial review would have been fruitless and would not have provided an effective remedy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117. Therefore I consider that sections 1 and 4 of the 1989 Act are not incompatible with article 10.  I am in agreement with Lord Bingham that the defence of necessity or duress of circumstances did not arise for consideration in this case and, like him, I would not wish to be taken to agree with all that the Court of Appeal said on this issue.  I am also in agreement with him that no issue directly affecting the media arises in this case and therefore it would be undesirable to express an opinion on the interesting submissions advanced on their behalf to the House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118. I would dismiss this appeal.</p>
<p><b>LORD HOBHOUSE OF WOODBOROUGH</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119. For the reason given by my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill, I too would dismiss this appeal.</p>
<p><b>LORD SCOTT OF FOSCOTE</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120. I have had the advantage of reading in draft the opinions of my noble and learned friends Lord Bingham of Cornhill, Lord Hope of Craighead and Lord Hutton.  Save that on the matters referred to in paragraphs 99 and 100 of Lord Hutton's opinion I would wish to reserve my opinion as to how the balance between the requirements of national security on the one hand and freedom of expression and freedom of the press on the other hand should be struck, I am in full agreement with them and for the reasons they give I, too, would dismiss this appeal.</p>
