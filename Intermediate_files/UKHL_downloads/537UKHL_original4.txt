<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93.	In <i>R v Wirral District Magistrates' Court,Ex p Meikle</i> (1990)  154 JP 1035 a fresh charge of theft was preferred against the accused, who had originally been charged with murder and conspiracy to blackmail, which had the effect of activating a fresh custody time limit.  This was done by the Crown on the mistaken view that the existing custody time limit had expired.  An application for judicial review was made on the ground that the applicant had been a victim of an abuse of the court's process.  Watkins LJ said, at p 1040G-H, that it was accepted by counsel that there was no authority for the proposition that justices are entitled to reject a new charge merely because they regard that as a device to defeat their obligation to release an accused under the Regulations.  He then said, at p 1041B:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Each offence undoubtedly attracts its own custody time limit.  As to abuse of process, in the absence as here of <i>mala fides</i>, the effect of which it is unnecessary for present purposes to consider, there is no authority for the proposition that the doctrine can apply to decisions made on ancillary matters such as bail on the charge facing the accused." <p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94.	In <i>R v Great Yarmouth Magistrates' Court, Ex p Thomas, Davis and Darlington</i> [1992]  Crim LR 116, 29 July 1991 the applicants, who had been charged with being knowingly concerned in the illegal importation of cannabis, were released from custody on the expiry of the custody time limit which the justices had refused to extend.  They were then immediately re-arrested and charged with a fresh offence of possession of cannabis with intent to supply.  An application for judicial review was made on the ground of abuse of process.  When he was giving the court's reasons for remitting the case to the justices Watkins LJ said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Here the magistrates' court was confronted with an allegation of mala fides because the defence alleged that they had been victims of a rather unpleasant trick which deprived them of their liberty.  The basis for that is not in fact a matter for this court.  It is a matter which can be determined only in the magistrates' court upon whatever evidence is put before it, and the effect of that must then be put into perspective.  The justices will have to bear in mind that the burden of establishing dishonesty lies fairly and squarely on the defence, and it is a heavy burden.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>If the court is satisfied that it is truly a consequence of dishonesty which brought about the further charge and there is in substance no difference whatsoever between this and the first charge, plainly in my view there has been an abuse of the process.  If the court comes to that conclusion, then it seems to me that it has no alternative but to admit these people to bail."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95.	In <i>R v Waltham Forest Justices, Ex p Lee</i> (1992)  97 Cr App R 287 the applicants were charged with attempted murder and remanded in custody.  The charge of attempted murder was later withdrawn and charges of offences against section 18 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 were preferred in their place.  The applicants indicated that in relation to these new charges they required the attendance at the committal proceedings of witnesses.  A date was fixed for these proceedings which was outside the original custody time limit.  The justices refused to extend that time limit.  But they subsequently took the view that the section 18 offences attracted a new custody time limit and the applicants were remanded in custody.  The main question which was raised in an application for judicial review was whether the justices were right in concluding that a new custody time limit started to run when the applicants were charged with the section 18 offences.  Rose LJ said in regard to this matter, at p 292, that it seemed to him that, on the authorities and as a matter of principle, the regulations applied so as to permit the running of a new custody time limit from the date of preferment of charge of a new offence.  He then said this:</p>
<p></p><ul>"So far as the question of bad faith and abuse of process is concerned, there will no doubt be an abuse of process if the Crown Prosecution Service prefer new charges, whether more or less serious alternatives, in relation to the same facts, or charges based on different facts, solely for the purpose of defeating custody time limits.  Mala fides of that kind, if it occurs, is not to be tolerated.  But there is, in this case . . . not a scrap of evidence that there was some improper motive or improper conduct on the part of the prosecution."<p></p></ul>
<p>Pill J said, at p 293:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The burden of proving bad faith is upon the defendant.  The prosecution must, however, in my view, be expected to provide the justices, who have to make the relevant decision, with information and with the reasons for the withdrawal of one charge and the preferring of another, or the preferring of an additional charge.  This will enable the justices to make an informed decision."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96.	In <i>R v Wolverhampton Justices and Stafford Crown Court, Ex p Uppal</i> (1994)  159 JP 86 the applicant was charged with rape.  The prosecution decided that an additional charge of false imprisonment should be brought.  This charge was included in a draft indictment which was served on the applicant's solicitors.  The magistrate declined to extend the custody time limit on the rape charge.  But when the case returned to the court the next day the applicant was charged with false imprisonment and the magistrate accepted that this had the effect of creating a new custody time limit.  In the application for judicial review two arguments were advanced on behalf of the applicant.  The first was that the charge of false imprisonment was not a new offence so as to create a new statutory time limit.  The second was that the circumstances in which the charge of false imprisonment was preferred amounted to an abuse of process.  The Divisional Court held that the false imprisonment charge was clearly a charge of a new offence which attracted a new custody time limit.  Buxton J said, at p 92A, that, if there is a separate offence in law, then it attracts a separate custody time limit.  He said, at p 92E:</p>
<p></p><ul>"it is quite clear from the cases that this court has cited that these regulations are to be construed to say what they say, and they say that each offence shall be taken separately.  If the charge is properly justified, then properly a new custody time limit must run."<p></p></ul>
<p>However he went on to say, at p 92F-G:</p>
<p></p><ul>"This court, however, has not ignored the possibility that that construction of the regulation could produce unfairness to an applicant, because it has made clear that in circumstances where a new count is preferred simply for the purpose of avoiding a custody time limit, then this court will review the matter, from the point of view of abuse of process."<p></p></ul>
<p>The decision of the magistrate that there had been no abuse of process was however held to have been one which he was entitled to reach on the evidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97.	I do not think that it can be doubted that, where dishonesty or mala fides can be established, that will be sufficient to show that there has been an abuse of process.  But the concept of abuse of process is not to be confined to cases where there is proof of conscious dishonesty or of an improper motive of that kind.  To the extent that the authorities to which I have referred may be taken as indicating the contrary, I would be inclined not to follow them.  It seems to me that a broader and simpler test is, in this context, more appropriate.  That would be more in keeping with the purpose of article 5(1) of the Convention, which is to protect the individual from arbitrariness when he is deprived of his liberty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98.	The true question, as Buxton J indicated in <i>R v Wolverhampton Justices and Stafford Crown Court, Ex p Uppal</i> (1994)  159 JP 86, is whether the new charge has been brought solely for the purpose of avoiding a custody time limit.  The issue can best be tested by requiring the prosecutor to demonstrate why, on the facts of the case, the bringing of the new charge is necessary.  If the necessity of bringing the new charge can be demonstrated, the substitution of a new custody time limit will follow according to the rules which regulation 4(4) has laid down.  But if the prosecutor is unable to satisfy this test, it will be open to the court to infer that there is an abuse of process because the charge has been brought solely for the arbitrary and improper purpose of substituting a new custody time limit.</p>
<i><p><i></i></p>
<p><i>Answer to the Question</i></p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99.	I would therefore answer the question of law which I set out at the outset of this judgment in these terms.  The principle upon which regulation 4 proceeds is that each offence attracts its own custody time limit.  But this principle is subject to two qualifications.  First, the bringing of a new charge will not result in the replacement of the existing custody time limit by a fresh custody time limit if the offence in the new charge is simply a restatement of the old offence with different particulars.  The offence charged must be a different offence in law if it is to attract a fresh custody time limit.  Second, the bringing of a new charge will be an abuse of process if the bringing of that charge in the magistrates' court cannot be justified on the facts of the case by the prosecutor and the court is satisfied that it has been brought solely with a view to obtaining the substitution of a fresh custody time limit.</p>
<i><p><i></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i>Conclusion</i></p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100.	I agree with Divisional Court that on a proper construction of regulation 4(4) of the 1987 Regulations the preferring of the manslaughter charge in this case, where abuse of process is not alleged, resulted in the creation of a new custody time limit.  While I recognise the concerns which Mitchell J expressed in his judgment about the measure of latitude which has been extended to prosecutors to charge new offences which may have the effect of prolonging the period of detention in custody, I do not consider that regulation in its present form is incompatible with article 5 of the Convention.  Any revision of the system to meet these concerns must be a matter for Parliament.  I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p><b>LORD CLYDE</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101.	This appeal concerns the construction of the terms of regulation 4(4) of the Prosecution of Offences (Custody Time Limits) Regulations 1987 (SI 1987/299).  Those Regulations have been subject to successive amendments and the version with which we are concerned includes the amendments made up to the Prosecution of Offences (Custody Time Limits)(Modification) Regulations 1998 (SI 1998/3037).  Regulation 4(1) explains the scope of regulation 4 in these terms:</p>
<p></p><ul>"the maximum period during which a person accused of an indictable offence other than treason may be in the custody of a magistrates' court in relation to that offence while awaiting completion of any preliminary stage of the proceedings specified in the following provisions of this Regulation shall be as stated in those provisions".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulation 4(4) provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"(4) In the case of an offence triable on indictment exclusively the maximum period of custody between the accused's first appearance and the time when the court decides whether or not to commit the accused to the Crown Court for trial, shall be . . . . 70 days…"<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102.	The meaning to be given to the expression "the accused's first appearance" is prescribed in regulation 2(2).  For present purposes it is sufficient to note that it states: </p>
<p></p><ul>"2(2) In these Regulations, a reference to a person's first appearance in relation to proceedings in a magistrates' court for an offence is -….<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"( c ) in any other case, a reference to the time when first he appears or is brought before the court on an information charging him with that offence".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103.	It is useful also to note the terms of the provision which empowered the making of the Regulations.  This was section 22 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985. Section 22(1) provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The Secretary of State may by regulations make provision, with respect to any specified preliminary stage of proceedings for an offence, as to the maximum period -<p></p></ul>
(a) to be allowed to the prosecution to complete that stage;
(b) during which the accused may, while awaiting completion of that stage, be - 
(i) in the custody of a magistrates' court; or
(ii) in the custody of the Crown Court;
in relation to that offence."
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104.	The scheme of these time limits is plainly based upon the identification of an offence.  Moreover the scheme is looking to a particular offence.  One can see that in the words in regulation 4(1) "to that offence", which refer to the earlier words "a person accused of an indictable offence".  One can see it also in regulation 2(2) where again the reference to a person's first appearance  "for an offence" is to be understood as referring to his first appearance "on an information charging him with that offence".  So the scheme is one which proceeds upon an identification of the particular offence with which he was charged on the information whereby he first appeared or was brought before the court. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105.	In the present case the appellant was brought before the court on 8 January 1999 on an information charging him with murder.  On 19 March 1999 when the 70 day period in respect of his custody on the murder charge was about to expire, he appeared before the court for the first time on an information charging him with manslaughter.  It is common ground that murder and manslaughter each constitute a distinct offence in the context of the Regulations.  It follows from the wording of the Regulations that a new custody time limit then began to run in respect of the offence then charged.  Bail was refused and the appellant remained in custody. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106.	It seems to me that there is no evident ambiguity or lack of clarity in the wording of the regulation.  The construction which I have given to it accords with the construction adopted in a succession of past cases, which have established a recognised and acceptable understanding of the provisions and one with which I would not lightly interfere. Moreover the contrast with the terms of regulation 5 seems to me significant. No doubt for sound reasons of practice and practicability the Regulations have made a clear distinction between the position in the magistrates' court and the Crown Court.  In the latter express provision is made in the calculation of the time limit not only in relation to "that offence" but also in relation to any other offence included in the indictment.  If it had been intended to build into the time limits the addition or substitution of other offences, that could have been done in terms corresponding with those used in regulation 5.  But it is said that the result is unfair to the accused and indeed that it constitutes a breach of his rights under article 5 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107.	I am not persuaded that the regulation as I have construed it is incompatible with article 5 of the Convention.  The regulation is clear, precise and accessible.  There are safeguards for the accused in the recognition by both parties that the court can intervene in the event of the prosecution acting in a way which would constitute an abuse of process.  The regulation prescribes relatively short periods for the completion of the relevant stage of the proceedings and the court has a discretion whether or not an extension to the period is or is not to be allowed.  Moreover the accused has remedies in law, including that of judicial review.  Finally the whole scheme of the regulation has to be seen in the context of the Bail Act 1976 which gives, subject to certain exceptions, a general right to bail. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108.	The appellant has sought to found upon the purpose of the Regulations and has argued for a purposive construction.  The idea of a purposive construction is in a sense nothing new.  It has long been recognised that in construing legislation one should endeavour to give effect to the intention of the legislator.  But, as was noted a considerable time ago by Lord Diplock in <i>Carter v Bradbeer</i> [1975] 1 WLR 1204, 1207, there has been a trend away from a purely literal towards a purposive construction of statutory provisions.  Essentially this trend marks a change from an insistence on a literalism which fails to give effect to the intention of the legislation.  More particularly, through the influence of European community law greater attention has been paid to the idea of the purpose of the legislation in the domestic context. National courts are bound to comply with the objects and purposes of provisions of community law and where the matter is governed by community law domestic courts must where it is possible interpret national law in light of the purposes as well as the words of the community legislation [<i>Marleasing SA v La Comercial Internacional de Alimentacion SA</i> (Case C-106/89) [1990] ECR 1-4135]  An example of the practice of such an approach can be found in <i>Litster v Forth Dry Dock &amp; Engineering Co Ltd</i> [1990] 1 AC 546.  In the context of community law a strained interpretation is acceptable in order to secure a compliance with the law of Europe.  The desire to avoid any conflict between a national measure and a Directive leads easily to a situation where the purpose may be preferred to a precise reading of the words.  But in the present case we are not concerned with the application of European legislation and a strained interpretation cannot be justified on that ground.  The resort to a strained approach, which may be seen as readily acceptable in the context of community law, is not so readily available in the purely domestic context, particularly if there is no ambiguity in the provision in question.  While it may well be available as an approach to construction where there is no ambiguity, it is more difficult to apply it in domestic legislation where the words are clear.  In such a case a clear understanding of the precise purpose of the legislation would be required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109.	In order to adopt a purposive construction it is, of course, essential to ascertain the purpose of the legislation.  If the purpose cannot be ascertained, or there is doubt about the precise purpose, then the court can only look for some reasonable and sensible meaning from the words themselves.  The purpose may be discovered from the legislation itself.  It may on occasion be expressly set out in the legislation.  Or it may be ascertained by the court from the substance of the legislation.  But the interpretation cannot itself provide the purpose. The purpose must be identified first and then be applied in the process of interpretation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110.	In the present case the long title of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 includes the words "to provide for the imposition of time limits in relation to preliminary stages of criminal proceedings".  That broad statement does not point to any precise purpose such as might have thrown light on the present problem.  Behind the broad statement is obviously the purpose of putting limits upon the period of time which the prosecution may take in the course of the preliminary stages, and the period of time in which an accused has to wait, including a waiting in custody, for his trial.  The more particular purpose of restricting the periods of custody lies behind the express empowering provisions in section 22 of the Act. Plainly the Regulations seek to achieve this purpose.  But once the purpose has been identified, the way in which Parliament has chosen to achieve the purpose, by a scheme related to an offence, and the way in which accordingly the Regulations have been framed, is matter for Parliament and the executive.  It is not for the court to ignore the method selected. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111.	I certainly accept that the purpose includes the desirability of putting limits upon the permissible period of incarceration of an accused person in the course of the proceedings prior to committal and thereafter prior to trial and the corresponding desirability of requiring the prosecution to act with all due diligence and expedition.  But I have not been persuaded that it is necessary in order to satisfy these purposes that any other construction of the Regulations has to be adopted than that which naturally follows from the clear wording.  This seems to me to be a case where the purposive and the literal approaches arrive at the same result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112.	This is not a case where the solution is to be found by expanding the meaning given to a particular word, as was the position, for example,  in <i>Cutter v Eagle Star Insurance Co Ltd, Clarke v Kato</i> [1998] 1 WLR 1647, or in <i>Ex p Guardian Newspapers Ltd</i> [1999] 1 WLR 2130.  It is common ground that murder and manslaughter each constitute an "offence", and the problem raised in the present case cannot then be resolved by the suggestion that the "offence" is homicide.  The argument starts from the recognition that the offence charged is the offence of murder.  What the appellant has suggested is that in addition to the word "offence" one should add some phrase which would cover other offences which could be charged on the same information as that on which the earlier offence proceeded.  That seems to me to be going beyond the legitimate scope of construction.  It requires one to ignore the express word "that" which limits the identification of the offence and excludes other offences.  It does not simply expand the meaning of the word "offence" itself, but makes a significant extension to the scope of the regulation by adding new words to it.  This seems to me to be a matter of legislation, not of construction.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113.	Furthermore it is not altogether certain what the substance of the suggested addition should be.  It may be that it should encompass any offence which can be based upon the material in the information.  It may be that it should comprise any offence of which the accused could be convicted on the charge in question.  It may be that it should comprise any offence included in or amounting to the original offence. Various formulations of the proposed addition were proposed during the course of the argument and that very difference to my mind points to the absence of any clear need to adopt the kind of construction sought by the appellant.  The court can correct obvious drafting errors by adding, or omitting or substituting words, as was done recently by this House in the case of <i>Inco Europe Ltd v First Choice Distribution (a firm)</i> [2000], I WLR 586, see Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, at p 592, but this is not a case of an obvious drafting error.  But even in that kind of case it is necessary to know the substance of the provisions which the legislator must have intended to express.  In the present case even if the exact words are not essential the precise substance of the proposed extended meaning should be clear.  There seems to me also to be force in the contention that at least some of the formulations proposed might well create difficulties in the application of the regulation in the magistrates' court.  If a criterion was to be adopted by reference to the law relating to the alternative verdicts which may be permitted by statute or by the common law there might be room at least for debate before the magistrate particularly in relation to more complex cases than the reduction of murder to manslaughter.  Even trial judges have erred in deciding whether a jury could or could not convict of a lesser charge (Archbold 2000 para 7-97).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114.	The construction which I prefer does not require to be applied with a complete rigidity. As Lord Bingham of Cornhill CJ pointed out in <i>R v Burton on Trent Justices, Ex p Ashleigh-Nicholson</i> [1998] COD 262; 17 December 1997, the test to be applied is one of the substance of the charge rather than its form.  An amendment to a charge of armed robbery which simply added one further item to the things which had been taken would not constitute a new offence.  But a radical rewriting might in its substance constitute a new offence.  Where there is a new offence in law it does not seem to me to be possible by a process of interpretation to treat it as the same as the offence earlier charged for the purpose of Regulation 4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115.	It was suggested that the proposed addition of the words is to be justified by section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998.  But if the Regulations are already compatible with the Convention, as I believe they are, then there is no need to adopt the ambitious construction which has been suggested.  I should also record one area for dispute which may have to be resolved in the future, namely whether section 3 requires reading in or only reading down.  The point is one on which different views have been expressed, for example by Richard A. Edwards on the one hand ("Reading down legislation under the Human Rights Act" Legal Studies Vol 20 No 3, September 2000) and Richard Clayton and Hugh Tomlinson (The Law of Human Rights, para 4.20) on the other.  But there is no need to explore that issue in the present case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116.	Since preparing the foregoing I have had the opportunity of reading in draft the speech which has been prepared by my noble and learned friend Lord Hope of Craighead.  I am in agreement with all that he has said and I do not believe that there is any difference between us in the views which have been expressed.  I agree with him that the appeal should be dismissed.</p>
<i>
</i><p><b>LORD SCOTT OF FOSCOTE</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117.	On 20 July 1998 the appellant, Wardle, and two associates embarked on a violent burglary that went wrong.  The victims of the burglary were Mr John Nutter and his sister-in-law who lived together at the address in Leeds where the burglary took place.  In the course of the burglary they were roughly manhandled.  Mr Nutter died.  His sister-in-law suffered wounds.  The medical evidence, stated in layman's terms, was that Mr Nutter died from a heart attack brought about by the manhandling he had been subjected to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118.	On 17 August 1998 the appellant was arrested on suspicion of having been involved in the incident but was released after interview without being formally charged.  He was re-arrested on 5 January 1999 and charged with murder on 7 January.  In the period between August 1998 and January 1999 the police had kept him under surveillance and had thereby obtained evidence, including video recordings, which they believed showed that he had participated in the burglary.  The appellant made his first appearance in the magistrates' court on 8 January 1999, and was remanded in custody.  The statutory 70 day custody time limit began to run from that date (see regulation 4(4) of the Prosecution of Offences (Custody Time Limits) Regulations 1987, as amended).  The custody time limit was due to expire on 19 March 1999.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119.	By 19 March the case was not in a state of readiness for the committal proceedings to commence.  It appears that important evidence, including the evidence that the prosecution relied on as demonstrating that the appellant had been a participant in the burglary, had been supplied to the defence only shortly before 19 March.  The defence needed more time to consider the evidence than a commencement of the committal hearing on 19 March would have allowed.  It appears, also, that the evidence in question had been in the possession of the prosecution for some considerable time and ought to have been supplied to the defence much earlier.  </p>
