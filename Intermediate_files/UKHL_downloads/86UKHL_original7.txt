<p class="para">138.&nbsp;&nbsp;Simon Brown LJ referred in general terms to the travaux préparatoires and the writings of Grahl-Madsen, Goodwin-Gill, Hathaway and Weis as well as the UNHCR publications for the proposition that some element of choice is open to refugees as to where they can properly claim asylum; he concluded that any merely short term stopover en route cannot exclude the protection of article 31 and that the main touchstones by which exclusion from protection should be judged were “the length of stay in the intermediate country, the reasons for delaying there (even a substantial delay in an unsafe third country would be reasonable were the time spent trying to acquire the means of travelling on), and whether or not the refugee sought or found there protection de jure or de facto from the persecution from which they were fleeing".</p>
<p class="para">139.&nbsp;&nbsp;The reference in this passage to an <i>unsafe</i> intermediate third country seems inappropriate, since article 31 was drafted to cater for such a country as the very country from which refugee would be treated as “coming directly". The other suggested criteria find equally little resonance in the drafting history, although some, though not all, state practice would support the first. What is absent from the discussion in <i>Adimi </i>is reference to any responsibility on the part of the refugee to regularise his or her position in the intermediate state and to seek travel papers there, if he or she wishes to move on to another destination. Mr Sorani had arrived from abroad at Heathrow, entered the United Kingdom on a false Greek passport and then sought to leave for Canada on a false Dutch passport (pp 674F-675C). Mr Kaziu had arrived from abroad at Gatwick, and the next day sought to leave for Canada with false documents (p 675C-G). With respect to their cases, Simon Brown LJ’s reasoning was again on the basis that “refugees are ordinarily entitled to choose where to claim asylum” (p 687F). Assuming that their “short term stopover en route” would not break the requisite directness of flight, he said (p 687F-G) that</p>
<p class="qt">“it must follow that these applicants would have been entitled to the benefit of article 31 had they reached Canada and made their asylum claims there. If article 31 would have availed them in Canada, then logically its protection cannot be denied to them here merely because they have been apprehended en route".</p>
<p class="para">In my view, the suggested logic does not exist and is not supported by either the drafting history or the final text of the Convention.</p>
<p class="para">140.&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing back from the detail, I agree with Lord Rodger (para 82) that article 31(1) of the Geneva Convention is not on its face concerned with offences committed in order to leave a safe intermediate country for a preferred final destination. Under article 31 of the Vienna Convention and as a matter of general principle, article 31(1) of the Geneva Convention falls to be read in its context and in the light of the Convention’s object and purpose. The Convention’s “social and humanitarian” aims reflected the United Nations’ endeavours “to assure refugees the widest possible exercise of [the] fundamental rights and freedoms” that human beings should enjoy (see the Preamble to the Convention). The drafters were well aware that refugees might have family or other connections (e g cultural or linguistic) with countries other than those where they initially arrived from their country of persecution. Hence, as Lord Rodger has explained in greater detail, the detailed provisions for providing refugees with freedom of movement, identity papers and/or travel documents. At the same time, both the travaux préparatoires and the text of the final Convention demonstrate great concern carefully to limit the immunity granted under article 31(1). </p>
<p class="para">141.&nbsp;&nbsp;On one view, the only situation in which the drafters accepted that a refugee might transit an intermediate country is where that country itself gives rise to a risk of persecution for the refugee (furthermore, prior to 1967 Protocol, only a risk of such persecution arising as a result of events occurring before 1 January 1951). But that, for reasons which I have already discussed, is likely to be too limited an interpretation of article 31(1) - above all in the light of the previous general acceptance at the 14th meeting of Plenipotentiaries that the text should also cater for the High Commissioner’s second category of refugee, that is those proceeding to a final destination after being refused asylum in an intermediate country. In its domestic legislation, the United Kingdom has in fact been prepared to accept that a still more generous, though still limited, interpretation and scope should be given to article 31(1). Section 31(2) of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 provides that:</p>
<p class="qt">“If, in coming from the country where his life or freedom was threatened, the refugee stopped in another country outside the United Kingdom, subsection (1) applies only if he shows that he could not reasonably have expected to be given protection under the Refugee Convention in that other country.”</p>
<p class="para">My noble and learned friend Lord Hope quotes Lord Williams of Mostyn in the House of Lords during the committee stage of the Bill leading to this Act, as describing the Bill’s definition of “coming directly” as a “generous one". But Lord Williams said that in the context of debate on what became section 31(2) of the Act, and the restricted scope of the generosity involved is indicated by Lord Williams’ immediately following words: </p>
<p class="qt">“There must come a time when an individual has stopped running away - that is the article 31 situation - and has started travelling towards a preferred destination. We have tried to define this in subsection (2)".</p>
<p class="para">142.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can accept that under article 31(1) of the Convention, and perhaps particularly under modern conditions, not every transitory stopover should exclude a refugee from the right to asylum in his or her final destination. It may well be possible, without linguistic distortion, to regard a refugee on an aeroplane stopping at an international airport from which passengers do not have to disembark as coming directly to the country of final destination (see para 129 above). The same is true of a refugee who is required to disembark and remain in the international side of an airport as a transit passenger. The position is less obvious in the case of a refugee who disembarks and enters the intermediate country, before seeking to board the same (or more probably another) aircraft for an onward flight to the country of final destination.  At least in the case where that final destination is the United Kingdom, section 31(2) of the 1999 Act demonstrates a view of article 31(1) narrower than that taken by the Divisional Court in <i>Adimi</i>. </p>
<p class="para">143.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, whatever view is taken of the width of the phrase “coming directly” when considering the position of a refugee who has reached his or her final destination (country C), and even if one goes as far in this respect as the Divisional Court did in <i>Adimi</i>, it does not follow that article 31(1) provides immunity if such a refugee is apprehended seeking to leave the intermediate country by using false documents to deceive the relevant authorities or airline.  Article 2 of the Geneva Convention provides that </p>
<p class="qt">“Every refugee has duties to the country in which he finds himself, which require in particular that he conform to its laws and regulations as well as to the measures taken for the maintenance of public order.”</p>
<p class="para">Article 28 (in the case of refugees lawfully within a country) or article 31(2) (in the case of refugees unlawfully entering or present in a country) entitles such refugees to travel documents or facilities. Article 31(1) gives freedom from penalties on account of illegal entry or presence. That connotes freedom from penalties for use of false documents to enter or stay in a country where asylum could be and was claimed. But nothing in its history or language suggests that its drafters contemplated, or that article 31(1) covers or affords immunity in respect of, the use by refugees of illegal means in an unsuccessful attempt to leave an intermediate country, let alone one where such refugees were free both to claim and obtain asylum.</p>
<p class="para">144.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the contrary, the Plenipotentiaries’ discussions were focused on two situations: one, where a refugee was fleeing from an intermediate country in which his safety was threatened, the other where the intermediate country was refusing to grant him asylum - and so no doubt only too keen to speed his departure. In neither situation would provision for immunity in the intermediate country have seemed or been very realistic, and in any event the Plenipotentiaries were addressing contexts where the refugee had successfully moved to a final destination and were dealing with immunity in respect of illegal entry or presence there. It might be suggested that a refugee who had no option but to use false documents to leave an intermediate country where his or her safety was threatened should, if apprehended while attempting to leave, enjoy immunity there on the ground that he or she had acted under necessity (however unrealistic it might be to think that such a country would in fact recognise such an immunity). But there can be no necessity for implying any such immunity in the present case, and moreover it would seem inconsistent with article 2 of the Geneva Convention to do so.</p>
<p class="para">145.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike article 31(1), section 31(1) of the 1999 Act is not expressly limited to offences committed “on account of …. illegal entry or presence". But, construed as a whole and in the light of its clear intention to give effect to article 31(1), it should be so understood. I therefore agree with Lord Rodger (para 115) there was no reason why section 31(3) should have included section 1(1) of the Criminal Attempts Act 1981 in the list of offences which it contains. On the other hand, as he also points out, it is hard to understand why the basic offence of entering the United Kingdom without leave, under section 24(1)(a) of the Immigration Act 1971 is not listed in section 31(3) and (4). </p>
<p class="para">146.&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows from the above, first, that I would dismiss this appeal and associate myself with Lord Rodger’s further remarks in para 116 of his judgment, and, second, that it is also unnecessary for me to deal with the other points argued by counsel which would only arise if article 31 applied.</p>
<p class="para">
APPENDIX</p>
<p class="para">147.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the start of the 13th meeting on 10 July 1951, the draft of article 26, as what became article 31 was then numbered, omitted any requirement that the refugee should come direct from anywhere, and included only provisos that “he presents himself without delay to the authorities and shows good cause for his illegal entry or presence". France proposed an amendment to insert the words “coming direct from his country of origin"; M Colemar, the French representative, pointed to the example of a refugee who had found asylum in France, and then tried to make his way unlawfully into Belgium, saying that “It was obviously impossible for the Belgium Government to acquiesce in that illegal entry, since the life and liberty of the refugee would be in no way in danger at the time". The President, Mr Hoeg, speaking as representative of Denmark, countered with the example of a Hungarian refugee living in Germany who “might, without actually being persecuted, feel obliged to seek refuge in another country", and suggesting that it was “reasonable to expect that the Danish authorities would not inflict penalties on him for ….. illegal entry” into Denmark in such a case, provided he could show good cause for it. Mr Hoeg was not explicit about what he meant by “obliged to seek refuge” or “good cause” in such a case, but it is significant that he concluded by saying that, if the French amendment was accepted, it would be necessary to replace the additional phrase suggested by the French delegation by the phrase “coming direct from a territory where his life or freedom was threatened". The French were amenable to this suggestion.</p>
<p class="para">148.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, at the next (14th) meeting, the discussion resumed on the French draft amendment “coming direct from his country of origin", which the United Nations Commissioner for Refugees, himself a former refugee, criticised as too narrow. It would not, he pointed out, cover his own case, as a refugee who “in 1944 …. had himself left the Netherlands on account of persecution and had hidden in Belgium for five days", and, “as he had run the risk of further persecution in that country, …. had been helped by the resistance movement to cross into France", from which “he had gone on into Spain, and thence to Gibraltar". He concluded that “Thus, before reaching Gibraltar, he had traversed several countries in each of which a threat of persecution had existed. He considered it very unfortunate if a refugee in similar circumstances was penalized for not having proceeded direct to the country of asylum", and it seems reasonably clear (though the transcript omits some words) that he went on to prefer replacement of the words “coming direct from his country of origin” by words such as Mr Hoeg had suggested. He then raised a second problem, that of refugees who fled from a country of persecution direct to a country of asylum, where however they were refused the right to settle, although that country was a Contracting State, and to suggest that “Such refugees might possibly be covered if the words ‘and shows good cause’ were amended to read ‘or shows other good cause'".  </p>
<p class="para">149.&nbsp;&nbsp;M Colemar responded to these points by saying that “France was not absolutely opposed to the illegal entry and residence of certain refugees” and was willing to consider inserting, instead of the phrase it had suggested, words such as “having been unable to find even temporary asylum in a country other than the one in which his life or freedom would be threatened". He said that “Such a change would meet the points which were causing the High Commissioner concern". The United Kingdom representative, Mr Hoare, wondered whether the original text “did not allow countries like France, which received refugees in great numbers, sufficient latitude", while also covering the fact that “as the High Commissioner had pointed out, there might be cases where a refugee could show good cause even though he had not fled direct from a country where his life was endangered". The French representative insisted that he must press his amendment, referring to the difficulty of defining the reasons which could be regarded as constituting good cause, and saying that it was “precisely on account of that difficulty that it was necessary to make the wording of paragraph 1 more explicit", and that “To admit without any reservation that a refugee who had settled temporarily in a receiving country was free to enter another, would be to grant him a right of immigration which might be exercised for reasons of mere personal convenience. It was normal in such cases that he should apply for a visa to the authorities of the country in question". </p>
<p class="para">150.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Belgian representative wondered whether inability to find asylum in an intermediate state would be considered as sufficient alone to constitute “good cause". The High Commissioner expressed the contrary opinion that the French representative’s latest suggestion would protect both the categories of refugee to whom he had referred. The United Kingdom expressed reservations about the onus of proof imposed on a refugee by the French proposal. The Belgian representative asked what was meant by “temporary asylum” and whether a Contracting State would be “able to impose penalties on a refugee who had stayed in another country for a week or a fortnight, and had then been obliged to seek asylum in the territory of the Contracting State in question", and he later proposed that the French draft be altered by replacing the phrase “having been unable to find” with “being unable to find", so as not to exclude “any refugee who had managed to find a few days’ asylum in any country through which he had passed". The discussion concluded by voting on and accepting this (with very minor modification) in the form “being unable to find asylum even temporarily in a country other than the one in which his life or freedom would be threatened".</p>
<p class="para">151.&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time of the final meeting on this topic on 25 July 1951, the High Commissioner had had second thoughts about this insertion. He observed that</p>
<p class="qt">“Although aware that that provision had been inserted  in order to limit exemption from penalties to refugees who came to the receiving country from the country of persecution direct, or through another in which, for one reason, or another, they were unable to stay, he did not feel that the words he had quoted met that requirement. They would place on the refugee the very unfair onus of proving that he was unable to find even temporary asylum anywhere outside the country or countries in which his life or freedom would be threatened. As there some eighty States in the world, the difficulty of such a task required no emphasis. His personal view was that the words ‘show good cause for his illegal entry or presence’ covered the point, but since the general feeling of the Conference seemed to be that some specific provision was necessary, he suggested that paragraph 1 [of the original draft] be amended …..” [ie so as to conclude “and shows good cause for believing that his illegal entry or presence is due to the fact that his life or freedom would otherwise be threatened"].</p>
<p class="para">152.&nbsp;&nbsp;M Rochefort, now representing France, said that France “wished to avoid having to accept any refugee from a neighbouring country who voluntarily decided to move to France, perhaps on the pretext that the neighbouring country concerned would no longer give him permission to reside there". The United Kingdom and the President supported the High Commissioner’s amendment, the latter saying that, as regards “the imposition of punishment on refugees for clandestinely crossing the frontier, …. there he thought there had been no objection to the High Commissioner’s interpretation, namely, that the refugee’s illegal entry or presence must be proved to be due to the fact that his life [or] freedom would otherwise have been threatened", an interpretation which the High Commissioner immediately confirmed. At this point, M Rochefort identified a different concern arising from the fact that the Geneva Convention as originally negotiated and agreed was limited to persecution occurring before 1 January 1951. The revised wording would, he observed, bind France to accept a refugee who had left his country of origin for a neighbouring country due to such an event occurring prior to 1 January 1951, and whose life had then been threatened in that neighbouring country by events occurring after 1 January 1951. The Swedish delegate noted that a threat to freedom in the neighbouring country might not involve persecution at all; it might for example be a threat of imprisonment for theft. </p>
<p class="para">153.&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet the French point, Mr Hoare suggested the insertion of the phrase “coming directly from the country of his nationality or of former habitual residence", those being he noted the words used in paragraph A of article 1. M Rochefort, not surprisingly, observed that this insertion would be almost word for word that which the French amendment had proposed at the 14th meeting, but that “An intermediate formula had been suggested, namely “arriving directly from a territory where their life or liberty was threatened"; this he suggested would also be in accordance with article 1 and might be acceptable. The High Commissioner enquired whether the United Kingdom suggestion meant that only a refugee who came direct from his country of nationality or habitual residence would be covered, and that a “refugee who, coming from a country of persecution, entered a country after transit through a second country in which he had succeeded in hiding or which had refused him refuge, would be excluded". In other words, he raised, once again, the two points he had raised at the outset of the 14th meeting. Mr Hoare replied that he had intentionally made his suggestion restrictive. He would have liked to propose one of wider application, but said that</p>
<p class="qt">“since the French representative was unwilling to agree that refugees entering from intermediate countries should be included, he had limited the scope of his text accordingly. He would however be willing to broaden it if that was possible.” </p>
<p class="para">The High Commissioner responded by pointing out that his suggestion had not been to broaden or narrow the article, but to relieve the refugee from the burden of proof that no country in the world was prepared to accept him, and that neither his own text nor the one now before the meeting (ie presumably the United Kingdom’s) met the French representative’s point (ie regarding events occurring after 1 January 1951). M  Rochefort said that the High Commissioner’s explanation put the whole problem squarely before the meeting: </p>
<p class="qt">“Did the simple fact that a refugee, having left a country in which he had been persecuted, failed to obtain asylum in another, impose upon a third country the obligation of receiving him without having the right to impose penalties? Each country had to accept its frontier responsibilities, but the fact that an intermediate country refused to face its own could not deprive a third country of the right to take precautions against illegal entry". </p>
<p class="para">He then suggested an insertion reading “coming directly from a territory in which his life or freedom would be threatened within the meaning of article 1, paragraph A, of this Convention". This, as matters transpired, mirrored in effect, and very closely in wording, the final text of article 31.</p>
