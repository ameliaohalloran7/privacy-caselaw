<p class="para">147.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal thought that s.6(2)(b) did not apply because the decision by the defendant (the Secretary of State) not to make <i>ex gratia </i>widowers’ payments could not be said to be “necessary” in order to give effect to the statutory provisions. The House allowed an appeal, pointing out that the Court of Appeal’s approach was relevant only under s.6(2)(a): see per Lord Hoffmann, paragraph 48.</p>
<p class="para">148.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this House in <i>Hooper</i>, Lord Hoffmann considered that s.6(2)(b) applied, first, because the discrimination which it was alleged that the Secretary of State should have avoided by making <i>ex gratia </i>payments to widowers only arose from giving effect to the statute by making statutory payments to widows (para. 50). (Lord Brown at para 125 had difficulty in accepting this part of Lord Hoffmann’s reasoning.) Lord Hoffmann went on, secondly, expressly to endorse Moses J’s reasoning in paragraph 185, quoted above, and to say:</p>
<p class="paraleft">“If legislation cannot be read compatibly with Convention rights, a public authority is not obliged to subvert the intention of Parliament by treating itself as under a duty to neutralise the effect of the legislation".</p>
<p class="para">149.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Nicholls agreed at paragraph 1 with Lord Hoffmann’s reasoning, but also put the matter in his own words at paragraph 6:</p>
<p class="paraleft">“Ss.36 and 27 make provision for payments to widows alone. If the Secretary of State were asked “Why are you not making similar payments to widowers?” he would have answered: “Because the statute provides these payments should be made to widows and makes no provision for payments to widowers". The fact that the Secretary of State could lawfully have made corresponding payments to widowers does not detract from the crucial fact that in declining to pay widowers he was ‘giving effect’ to the statute". </p>
<p class="para">150.&nbsp;&nbsp;In paragraph 73 in <i>Hooper</i> (quoted by my noble and learned friend, Lord Walker in paragraph 113 of his speech), my noble and learned friend, Lord Hope, was, as I see it, focusing on whether the source of the discretion mattered for the purposes of s.6(2)(b), rather than on what was meant by “giving effect” to or “enforcing” statutory provisions. He addressed the latter question in the next paragraph, and did so again by endorsing Moses J’s approach. Lord Hope said:</p>
<p class="paraleft">“74 ……The effect of the argument that the commissioners were not entitled to rely on s.6(2)(b) was to convert the power to give an extra-statutory allowance into a duty to do so. That would destroy the power altogether. It would replace it with an obligation to make widowers the same allowance as  widows, as this would be the only way that the commissioners could act, as s.6(1) requires, in a way which was compatible with the widowers’ Convention right". </p>
<p class="para">151.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both of my noble and learned friends, Lord Scott (paras. 94-95) and Lord Brown (paras. 122-125), preferred to rely on s.6(2)(a) rather than s.6(2)(b), on the basis, as Lord Brown put it (para. 124), that “'as a result of [ss.36 and 37], the [Secretary of State] could not have acted differently': he had to pay the widows and could not lawfully have made matching payments to widowers".</p>
<p class="para">152.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Hooper </i>is not, therefore, any authority against the approach taken by Moses J, rather the contrary. Further, it is in a different category to the present case. The commissioner, if he had matched widows’ benefits with <i>ex gratia </i>widowers’ payments, would have been doing the opposite of what the statute contemplated, subverting the statutory scheme. The power to make <i>ex gratia </i>payments would have had to have been exercised in every case, as if it were a duty, if discrimination between widows and widowers was to be avoided. Here, the position is different. The Council had to decide whether to exercise a contractual right which was, as a result of the exceptions in a statutory scheme, preserved to it in its full common law width. But the Council was at the same time taking this decision as a public authority within s.6 of the Human Rights Act, and more specifically in the exercise of its power of management of caravan sites under s.24 of the 1960 Act. It is not suggested that anything in this scheme precluded the Council from taking into account the Human Rights Convention rights, so s.6(2)(a) has no application.</p>
<p class="para">153.&nbsp;&nbsp;As to s.6(2)(b), it is the court’s duty under s.3(1) of the Human Rights Act to read and give effect to the statutory scheme so far as possible in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights. This duty applies to primary legislation “whenever enacted” (s.3(2)). It applies to the Caravan Sites Act 1968 and the Mobile Homes Act 1983. These Acts are directed to caravan sites generally. By far the greater number of such sites must be owned and run privately rather than by local authorities, and this appears to be the case, at least in England and Wales, even if one focuses solely on sites occupied by gypsies. The Acts were necessary to regulate private relations between site owners and occupiers. The exclusions relating to local authorities say nothing about such authorities’ performance of their general public law duties, and in particular nothing to contradict or undermine their duty to act compatibly with their Human Rights Convention obligations, once the 1998 Act came into force. It is possible to read and give effect to the statutory scheme of both the Caravan Sites Act 1968 and the Mobile Homes Act 1983 in a way which entitles (and under s.6(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998 requires) a local authority, when deciding whether or not to give any (and if so what length of) notice to a caravan site occupied by travellers terminating their right to occupy, to take into account the Convention rights, including the length of time for which the site has been the occupiers’ home. Whether and to what extent this will be relevant will depend on the circumstances. Accordingly, a local authority which fails to take into account Convention values when deciding whether or not to give any and if so what length of notice to quit cannot, in my opinion, be said to be “acting so as to give effect to or enforce” statutory provisions which are incompatible with the Convention rights. </p>
<p class="para">154.&nbsp;&nbsp;In reaching these conclusions, I do not exclude the possibility that the statutory scheme of the 1968 and 1983 Acts, as it existed at the relevant times, would still be regarded as incompatible with the Convention rights in certain respects. A scheme according to which some occupiers have specific statutory rights (as under the 1983 Act) but gypsy occupiers of local authority caravan sites have the general statutory protection of s.6(1) of the Human Rights Act might perhaps still be regarded as unjustifiably discriminatory in some circumstances under the combination of articles 8 and 14 of the Human Rights Convention. A scheme under which only occupiers of private caravan sites have a statutory right to seek a suspension of enforcement of a possession order for up to 12 months (as under the 1968 Act) could in some circumstances likewise be regarded as unjustifiably discriminatory. However, if the legislation is potentially incompatible with the Convention in any such respects, that is irrelevant.  No such incompatibility has been relied upon before your Lordships.  Mr Doherty’s case has been simply that, if it is not open to him in one way or another to rely on article 8 of the Convention, that is a result incompatible with his Convention rights. It is the scheme of the 1983 Act which is relevant on the present appeal. The potential incompatibility identified in the present paragraph arises from a comparison of the position under the 1983 Act with the position under s.6(1) of the Human Rights Act, and therefore assumes that it would in the present circumstances be open to the local authority to exercise its discretion consistently with the Convention.  It is thus for present purposes beside the point.</p>
<p class="para">155.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of my conclusions in paragraphs 152 and 153, there is no question of removing or displacing the general right to give notice to quit or requiring it always to be exercised in one way or of subverting the statutory intention. Compliance with the Convention principles in the exercise of a discretion is not to be regarded in such circumstances as any more of an inadmissible fetter on the exercise of the discretion than is compliance with the general common law principles governing the exercise of administrative discretion (as to which see the powerful quotation from Professor Sir William Wade QC by Lord Bridge of Harwich in <i>R v. Tower Hamlets LBC, Ex p. Chetnik Developments Ltd. </i>[1988] 1 AC 858, 872B-G). The Council when exercising any of its multitudinous statutory discretions is bound to exercise the same proportionately taking into account the Convention values. It is, I understand, common ground that discretions granted by statute or common law fall to be exercised in accordance with the Convention values. Thus, for example, it was never suggested in the recent case of <i>R v. G </i>[2008] UKHL 37; [2008] 1 WLR 1379 that, because Parliament had created an offence of statutory rape, a prosecuting authority’s decision to prosecute in circumstances falling within the scope of that offence could not be reviewed if incompatible with a Convention right. It would, I think, be curious if common law discretions preserved by statute were not also to be exercised in accordance with Convention values. </p>
<p class="para">156.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, if the Caravan Sites Act 1968 and Mobile Homes Act 1983 had never existed to protect private occupiers, there could have been no question but that, on the coming into force of the Human Rights Act, a local authority would have come under the duty in s.6(1) to act compatibly with the Convention rights when deciding whether or not to give notice to quit to a caravan site occupier. The existence in the 1968 and 1983 Acts of protection for private occupiers presents to my mind no basis for refusing that protection. A main aim of the 1998 Act would otherwise be diluted. If one were to pose a similar question to that put by Lord Nicholls in <i>Hooper</i>, by asking a local authority whether it would have any basis in March 2004 for not taking into account the principles and values of the Human Rights Convention when deciding whether or not to give a notice to quit to a gypsy occupying a caravan, I venture to suggest, with all due respect to Mr Underwood’s submissions in this case, that it would not refer in answer to the Caravan Sites Act 1968 or Mobile Homes Act 1983. I note Lord Walker’s encouragement to local authorities to exercise their discretion taking into account the Convention principles, and his view that “to adopt a Convention-compliant policy could not possibly be described as subverting the will of Parliament” (paragraph 121). That is encouragement and a view with which I fully concur. </p>
<p class="para">157.&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts of the present case are (as my noble and learned friend Lord Hope also notes in paragraph 36) very different from those of <i>Qazi </i>and <i>Kay</i>. Here (see paragraph 137 above) the challenge is to the validity of a local authority’s decision to give a notice to quit, the validity of which was a pre-condition to any right to possession on the part of the local authority. In <i>Qazi </i>and<i> Kay</i> the local authority had an undoubted right to possession, and the only possible challenge was to its decision to enforce that right. In <i>Qazi</i> possession was sought after a tenancy had been validly determined by one of the co-tenants’ own notice (see paragraph 130 above). The recent Strasbourg decision in <i>McCann </i>involved similar facts, with the occupier complaining there about, inter alia, the fact that the local authority had procured his estranged wife, the co-tenant, to give the notice to quit. <i>Kay </i>concerned two appeals. In one, <i>Leeds CC v. Price</i>, there had never been any agreement. The occupiers who claimed the site as their “home” were trespassers who had entered it without authority and within two days the council had issued the possession proceedings. In the other, <i>Kay v. Lambeth LBC</i>, the local authority had validly terminated the head lease which it had granted to a housing trust, and the occupiers who occupied under an arrangement with the housing trust (held in other proceedings to constitute a secure tenancy) thus became trespassers in relation to the local authority. Once again, the appeal proceeded in this House on the basis that the local authority had an undoubted domestic law right to possession (private law arguments to the contrary being rejected). The issue in both cases was therefore whether the local authority’s action in pursuing proceedings to enforce its unqualified domestic law right to possession could be challenged. In that context, the majority of the House established the common position contained in paragraph 110 in <i>Kay</i>. </p>
<p class="para">158.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in cases such as <i>Qazi </i>and <i>Kay</i> a local authority has a discretion. It is not bound to take steps, immediate or otherwise, to resume possession. Where (as would appear to have been the position in <i>Leeds CC v. Price</i>) the steps open to the local authority are not, at least theoretically, confined to taking court proceedings, it has a discretion whether to take any steps at all. Where (as in <i>Qazi</i>, <i>Connors</i>,<i> Kay v. Lambeth LBC</i>, and <i>McCann</i>) the Prevention from Eviction Act 1977 applies so that any such right to possession could only be enforced by proceedings in court, the local authority has a discretion whether or not to bring such proceedings. Even in these situations it does not seem to me that the decision to pursue court proceedings to enforce a right to possession preserved by a statutory scheme can properly be described as action “to give effect to” or “enforce” any statutory provisions which may be regarded as incompatible with the Convention rights.  The statutory scheme permits a decision, but says nothing about what sort of decision or when.  In deciding when and how to act, the Council is giving effect to its own evaluation of what was appropriate, as it is entitled and bound to do. Under the imperative of s.3(1) read with s.6(1) of the Human Rights Act, it should be regarded as obliged in so acting to respect Convention values.  If it fails properly to respect Convention values it is not, in my opinion, “acting so as to give effect to or enforce” statutory provisions which are incompatible with the Convention rights. That the court, if the local authority pursued possession proceedings, would have no option under the statutory scheme but to give effect to the local authority’s right to possession (see paragraph 132 above) unless the local authority’s decision to claim possession could be challenged under gateway (b), does not impact on this conclusion and is circular because of the existence of gateway (b).  If anything, it underlines the importance which attaches to Convention-compliant decisions being reached by local authorities and to non-compliant decisions being challengeable under the principle in <i>Wandsworth LBC  v. Winder</i>. Accordingly, construing the statutory scheme so far as possible in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights as required by s.3(1) of the Human Rights Act, I would not see s.6(2)(b) as a bar to reliance on article 8 of the Convention in a challenge to a local authority’s decision to pursue proceedings for possession in such cases.  </p>
<p class="para">159.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, whatever may be the position in that respect, the present case falls into a different category. Here, as I have pointed out, the challenge is to the decision to give the notice to quit, the validity of which was a pre-condition to any right to possession at all. It is one thing to treat a local authority as “giving effect” to primary legislation which cannot be read compatibly with the Convention in deciding to take possession proceedings to enforce an undoubted right to possession, It is another to hold that a local authority, when deciding whether to serve any and if so what notice to quit under the contractual freedom preserved to it under the statutory scheme, is “giving effect to” or “enforcing” provisions of primary legislation which cannot be read compatibly with the Convention. It follows, in my view, that nothing in s.6(2)(b) requires the House to conclude that it was not open to HHJ McKenna to consider a challenge on article 8 grounds to the validity of the notice to quit of 4 March 2004, and to consider a defence to the Council’s claim to possession on that ground.</p>
<p class="para">160.&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question is whether paragraph 110 in <i>Kay </i>itself prevents a challenge on article 8 grounds to the validity of the notice to quit. In my opinion, it does not. Both <i>Qazi </i>and <i>Kay</i> were, as I have shown, concerned with circumstances where it was clear or was held that there existed an unqualified domestic law right to possession. It was in that context that gateway (b) in paragraph 110 addressed the possibility of a challenge to the local authority’s “decision….. to recover possession as an improper exercise of its powers at common law", and defined the possibility of such a challenge by reference to conventional common law grounds of judicial review. Gateway (b) was not conceived with reference to a challenge on Human Rights Convention grounds to the validity of a public authority’s exercise of a contractual right which if good would mean that no right to possession arose at all. My noble and learned friend, Lord Hope, underlined this distinction in <i>Qazi </i>itself. In paragraph 79 he identified as a “wholly exceptional case” - in relation to which he reserved his opinion as to whether article 8 issues might be raised in the county court - a case “where proceedings for possession were being taken following the service of a notice to quit by the housing authority, bearing in mind as Lord Millett points out that its decision to serve the notice to quit would be judicially reviewable in the High Court so long as the application was made within the relevant time limit". He went on to distinguish <i>Qazi </i>on the basis that “The situation in the present case is different, as it was a notice to quit served by one of the joint tenants that terminated the tenancy".  Since <i>Kay </i>the principle in <i>Wandsworth LBC v. Winder </i>allows judicial review points to be raised by way of defence and without time limit in the county court, but the distinction remains between cases (like <i>Qazi </i>and <i>Kay</i>) where the challenge is to a decision to enforce an undoubted right to possession by court proceedings and cases (like the present) where the challenge is to the decision to serve a notice to quit which is a contractual pre-condition to any right to possession.</p>
<p class="para">161.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, I consider that <i>Qazi </i>and <i>Kay </i>are distinguishable from the present case. Especially after the Strasbourg Court’s decision in <i>McCann</i> and in the light of the court’s duty under s.2 of the Human Rights Act to take account of Strasbourg case-law, the scope of <i>Qazi </i>and <i>Kay </i>should not be extended. On the basis of this distinction alone, I would hold that the case should be remitted to the High Court for the Council’s decision to issue a notice to quit to be reviewed on Convention as well as conventional or domestic judicial review principles. The High Court would then be able to consider whether the decision to serve notice to quit complied with the respect for Mr Doherty’s home due under article 8. On the facts of this case, this would, as I see it, make irrelevant any such incompatibility as may exist between the Convention and the general statutory scheme, and so mean that (quite apart from the fact that the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 will remove any incompatibility from a future date to be determined) a declaration of incompatibility was not in any event required.</p>
<p class="para">162.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I for my part regret that it has not been possible on this appeal to agree to modify gateway (b) in paragraph 110 more generally, so as to allow express regard to be had to Human Rights Convention principles in relation to any defence raised against a public authority under the rule in <i>Wandsworth LBC v. Winder</i>, whether in circumstances such as those in <i>Qazi</i>,<i> Connors</i>, <i>Kay </i>and<i> McCann</i> or in circumstances such as the present. In paragraphs 19, 36 and 55 of his speech my noble and learned friend Lord Hope mentions the need to take account of any judgment of the Strasbourg Court and to give practical recognition to the principles that it lays down, and states that this can be done in the present circumstances by to some extent modifying the reasoning of the majority in <i>Kay</i>. At the same time, he rejects the suggestion that the House should depart from the majority view in <i>Kay </i>in favour of the minority, believing that this would create very real practical problems: paragraphs 19 to 20. </p>
<p class="para">163.&nbsp;&nbsp;For my part, I am not persuaded that any significant problems would or need arise, as Convention-compliant statutory schemes are developed and public authorities become accustomed to tailoring their performance of their duties to Convention values. In a large number of cases, County Courts already tackle sensitive issues of reasonableness, as well as issues regarding breach of conditions of occupancy, when deciding whether to make or suspend possession orders; The limited modification that my noble and learned friend Lord Hope would make to gateway (b) of paragraph 110 (see paragraph 55) would add to such cases a further category in which review on traditional <i>Wednesbury</i> grounds was relaxed to become a more straightforward examination of reasonableness. If County Courts can handle such issues in possession claims, there is no reason to doubt their ability to tackle, robustly and with due despatch, the largely parallel issues which would arise from any direct application of the Convention principles in cases of challenges to public authority decisions to seek possession. </p>
<i><p class="para">Conclusion</p></i>
<p class="para">164.&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) In view of paragraphs 154 and 161 to 163 above, I would not (quite apart from the fact that the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 will remove any incompatibility from a future date to be determined) have considered a declaration of incompatibility to be required in the present circumstances.  (ii) I understand that, had it not been for the passing of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008, the majority of your Lordships would have considered that a declaration of incompatibility should be made. This is because I understand the majority of your Lordships to conclude that the statutory scheme precludes the court from doing anything other than making a possession order, unless the decision to issue a notice to quit can be challenged on the conventional or domestic common law (rather than Human Rights Convention) grounds of judicial review open under gateway (b) as expressed in <i>Kay</i> and explained by my noble and learned friends Lord Hope and Lord Walker in their speeches on this appeal. (iii) In common with all of your Lordships, I agree that the case should be remitted to the High Court for determination of the domestic judicial review issues arising on that basis under gateway (b). (iv) For both the reasons given in paragraph 161 and in paragraphs 162 to 163, I would myself have concluded that the remission could and should go further and cover avowedly the issue whether the Council’s notice to quit was invalid as contrary to article 8 of the Convention. (v) I understand the view of the majority of your Lordships to be that this is not open to the House in the light of <i>Kay</i>, but that this may not ultimately matter because the common law, developed or modified to the extent indicated by my noble and learned friends Lord Hope and Lord Walker (see paragraphs 135 to 136 and 162 to 163 above of this speech), should itself be capable of achieving fair and reasonable results.</p>
