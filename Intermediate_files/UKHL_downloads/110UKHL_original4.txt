<p align="right"><a href="savage-3.htm">(back to preceding text)</a></p>

<p class="para">79.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having identified the trigger, the European Court went on to express the protective obligation like this, also in para 116:</p>
<p class="qt">“. . . that they failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk.”</p>
<p class="para">After rejecting as too rigid the Government’s argument that the failure “must be tantamount to gross negligence or wilful disregard of the duty to protect life” the Court summed up the situation thus, still in para 116:</p>
<p class="qt">“. . . it is sufficient for an applicant to show that the authorities did not do all that could reasonably be expected of them to avoid a real and immediate risk to life of which they have or ought to have knowledge.”</p>
<p class="para">For reasons which will appear, if there is any difference between the Court’s two formulations of the duty, in my view this latter statement is more apposite to the sort of tragedy we have in this case.</p>
<p class="para">80.&nbsp;&nbsp;In both the <i>Osman </i>and <i>Van Colle</i> cases, the complaint was that the police had not protected the deceased from a murderous attack. After a close examination of the events leading up to the fatal shooting of Mr Ali Osman and the wounding of his son Ahmet by Mr Paget-Lewis, a teacher who had become obsessed with Ahmet, the European Court concluded that “the applicants have failed to point to any decisive stage. . . when it could be said that the police knew or ought to have known that the lives of the Osman family were at real and immediate risk from Paget-Lewis” (para 121). Nor could it be said that the missed opportunities to neutralise that threat would in fact have succeeded in doing so. In <i>Van Colle</i>, this House also decided that it could not reasonably have been concluded from the information available to the police that there was a real and immediate risk to the life of the deceased. In other words, in both cases, the threshold was not crossed.</p>
<p class="para">81.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>Osman </i>principle covers more than the protection of individuals from attack by third parties. In certain circumstances it extends to the protection of individuals from harming themselves. In <i>Keenan v United Kingdom</i> (2001) 33 EHRR 913, a mentally ill young man hanged himself while serving a sentence of imprisonment. The European Court had to consider to what extent the <i>Osman </i>principle applied where the risk to a person derived from self harm (para 89) and concluded, at para 90:</p>
<p class="qt">“In the context of prisoners, the Court has had previous occasion to emphasise that persons in custody are in a vulnerable position and that the authorities are under a duty to protect them. It is incumbent on the State to account for any injuries suffered in custody, which obligation is particularly stringent where that individual dies” (the footnote refers to <i>Salman v Turkey</i>, Comm. Rep. 1.3.99, para 99).</p>
<p class="para">The investigative obligation clearly applies. But the Court went further, at para 91:</p>
<p class="qt">“The Government has argued that special considerations arise where a person takes his own life, due to the principles of dignity and autonomy which should prohibit any oppressive removal of a person’s freedom of choice and action. The Court has recognised that restraints will inevitably be placed on the preventive measures by the authorities by, for example in the context of police action, the guarantees of article 5 and 8 of the Convention. The prison authorities, similarly, must discharge their duties in a manner compatible with the rights and freedoms of the individual concerned. There are general measures and precautions which will be available to diminish the opportunities for self harm, without infringing personal autonomy. Whether any more stringent measures are necessary in respect of a prisoner and whether it is reasonable to apply them will depend upon the circumstances of the case.”</p>
<p class="para">So the Court went on to pose the following test for itself at para 92:</p>
<p class="qt">“whether the authorities knew or ought to have known that Mark Keenan posed a real and immediate risk of suicide and, if so, whether they did all that reasonably could have been expected of them to prevent that risk.” </p>
<p class="para">Having examined the facts in some detail, the Court concluded that the risk was real but that it was not immediate throughout his detention. Careful monitoring to detect deterioration was required (para 95). On the whole, however, the authorities’ response to his conduct was reasonable. There was nothing to alert them on the day that he was in a disturbed state of mind rendering an attempt at suicide likely (para 98). So the Court found no breach of article 2, although it later went on to find that there had been a breach of article 3. In the course of doing so, it pointed out that “the authorities are under an obligation to protect the health of persons deprived of liberty” (para 110).</p>
<p class="para">82.&nbsp;&nbsp;The extension of the <i>Osman </i>principle to self harm by people for whose welfare the state is responsible has since been applied to military conscripts who kill themselves. In <i>Kilinç v Turkey</i>, unreported, app no 40145/98, judgment of 7 June 2005, a mentally disordered young man who was doing his compulsory military service was placed on guard duty with a loaded gun and killed himself with it. The Court repeated the <i>Osman </i>principle, at para 43:</p>
<p class="qt">“In the present case, faced with the allegation whereby the military authorities failed in their positive obligation to protect the right to life of Mr Kilinç, the Court must examine, according to its constant jurisprudence, whether the military authorities knew or ought to have known that there was a real and immediate risk that he would commit suicide and, if so, whether they had done everything that could reasonably be expected of them to prevent that risk.” (<i>Unofficial translation</i>)</p>
<p class="para">Although the references are to <i>Tanribilir v Turkey</i>, app no 21422/93, judgment of 16 November 2000, para 72, and to <i>Keenan</i>, para 92, rather than to <i>Osman </i>itself, the court was clearly applying the <i>Osman </i>principle in the context of self harm.</p>
<p class="para">83.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court then concluded that the authorities should have known that Mr Kilinç might commit suicide (para 49). They had not done all that could reasonably be expected of them to prevent the risk. The existing regulatory framework had failed in the case of the military medical authorities who had not properly assessed and followed up his mental state, thus creating uncertainty as to what sort of tasks he could be given (para 56). There was no regulatory framework governing the supervision of conscripts who suffered from mental illness, thus leading the commander to put him on guard duty and give him a gun, even though it was not clear that he was fit to do it (para 54).</p>
<p class="para">84.&nbsp;&nbsp;To same effect was the Court’s decision in <i>Ataman v Turkey</i>, unreported, app no 46252/99, judgment of 27 April 2006<i>. </i>Particular diligence was expected when dealing with mentally ill conscripts and the state had not taken the obvious step of preventing the deceased having access to deadly firearms (para 61).</p>
<p class="para">85.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>Osman </i>principle has also been extended to the health care given to prisoners and other detainees. In <i>Slimani v France </i>(2004) 43 EHRR 1068<i>, </i>it was held that the duty to protect the health and well-being of people deprived of their liberty and to account for deaths and injuries in custody applies to administrative detainees as well as to ordinary prisoners. The deceased had been detained pending deportation but had died as a result of a serious breakdown in the medical services available at the detention centre. The complaint that the authorities had failed in their positive obligation to protect the life of the deceased was rejected because the applicant had not exhausted all her domestic remedies. So we do not know what, if anything, the Court would have made of it. But the complaint that she had been excluded from the inquest succeeded. The Court concluded its account of the general principles as follows, at p 1080: </p>
<p class="qt">“As a general rule, the mere fact that an individual dies in suspicious circumstances while in custody should raise an issue as to whether the State has complied with its obligation to protect that person’s right to life".</p>
<p class="para">This does suggest that the Court would have been willing to look at individual as well as systemic failures.</p>
<p class="para">86.&nbsp;&nbsp;The complaint that the authorities had failed in their duty to protect a prisoner’s life succeeded in <i>Tarariyeva v Russia</i>, unreported, app no 4353/03, judgment of 14 December 2006. The authorities had him in their custody for two years and knew all about his health problems. But he was not properly examined and treated in the penal colony to which he was sent. When he presented with acute pain, he was diagnosed with a perforated ulcer and peritonitis and promptly transferred to a civilian hospital. The surgery performed there was defective. The civilian hospital authorised his discharge to the prison hospital knowing of post-operative complications requiring further surgery. They withheld crucial details of this from the prison. So the prison hospital treated him as an ordinary post-operative patient rather than an emergency case. The further surgery was performed too late and the patient died. This is an example of the Court examining the individual operational failings of the health care given to prisoners, and not simply whether there were proper systems in place. There has been an even more recent example in <i>Renolde v France</i>, unreported, (Application No 5608/05), judgment of 16 October 2008.</p>
<p class="para">87.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of all this, Mr Philip Havers QC, who appears for Miss Savage, argues that it is but a small step to extend the <i>Osman </i>principle to a mentally ill person who commits suicide while compulsorily detained in hospital under the Mental Health Act 1983.  Ms Dinah Rose QC, who appears for the interveners, Inquest, Justice, Liberty and Mind, argues that this is not an extension at all. The principle which applies to mentally ill people in prison must apply <i>a fortiori</i> to mentally ill people detained in hospital. They are in an even more vulnerable position than prisoners, because they have not only been deprived of their liberty but are more completely under the control of the hospital authorities, not least because they can be given most forms of medical treatment for their disorder against their will. She cites the well-known case of <i>Herczegfalvy v Austria</i> (1992) 15 EHRR 437, where the Court noted “that the position of inferiority and powerlessness which is typical of patients confined in psychiatric hospitals calls for increased vigilance in reviewing whether the Convention has been complied with” (para 82).</p>
<p class="para">88.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Edward Faulks QC, for the NHS Trust which runs the hospital, accepts that if the <i>Osman</i> principle applies to this case, then it must go to trial. But he, together with Mr Nigel Giffin QC who appears for the Secretary of State for Health, argues that the <i>Osman</i> principle has no application in the field of health care and so there should be summary judgment in the Trust’s favour. The Trust succeeded before Mrs Justice Swift, who held that the test was “at the least gross negligence of a kind sufficient to sustain a charge of manslaughter", which was not alleged in this case: [2006] EWHC 3562 (QB), para 48. The Trust failed in the Court of Appeal, which held that the <i>Osman </i>test applied: [2006] EWCA Civ 1375. The Trust now appeals to this House.</p>
<p class="para">89.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Faulks relies principally on the admissibility decision in <i>Powell v United Kingdom</i> (2000) 30 EHRR CD 362. The applicants’ son had died of Addison’s disease. The parents believed that the doctors could have saved his life and brought a civil action in negligence against the health authority which they settled. Their main complaints in Strasbourg were that the doctors had falsified the records. But it appears, see p 363, that they also complained that “since their son’s death was caused by the negligence of State agents, it must be concluded that there was a breach of the State’s obligation to protect life".</p>
<p class="para">90.&nbsp;&nbsp;The applicants relied upon the <i>Osman</i> principle but the Court pointed out that this was in the context of protecting life from the criminal act of a third party. (It will be recalled that <i>Keenan </i>and the later cases had yet to be decided.) It continued, at p 364:</p>
<p class="qt">“The Court accepts that it cannot be excluded that the acts and omissions of the authorities in the field of health care policy may in certain circumstances engage their responsibility under the positive limb of Article 2. However, where a Contracting State had made adequate provision for securing high professional standards among health care professionals and the protection of the lives of patients, it cannot accept that matters such as error of judgment on the part of a health professional or negligent co-ordination among health professionals in the treatment of a particular patient are sufficient of themselves to call a Contracting State to account from the standpoint of the positive obligations under Article 2 of the Convention to protect life.”</p>
<p class="para">Thus the Court rejected the positive protective obligation in that context, although it went on to consider the case from the point of view of the investigative obligation, which it considered did apply in that case. But because the parents had not pursued their NHS complaints against the doctors or their negligence claim against the health authority, they could not claim to be victims. Hence their complaint was inadmissible on this (and indeed any other) ground.</p>
<p class="para">91.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus ordinary medical negligence, which results in the death of the patient, is not in itself a breach of the state’s obligations under article 2. The state’s obligations are discharged by having appropriate systems in place and effective investigatory machinery. In <i>Tarariyeva </i>(above, para 86), the Court stated the obligations in the health care sphere thus, at para 74:</p>
<p class="qt">“The positive obligations require States to make regulations compelling hospitals, whether private or public, to adopt appropriate measures for the protection of patients’ lives. They also require an effective independent judicial system to be set up so that the cause of death of patients in the care of the medical profession, whether in the public or the private sector, can be determined and those responsible made accountable (see <i>Vo v France</i> (2005) 40 EHRR 259, para 89, <i>Cavelli and Ciglio v Italy</i>, app no 32967/96, judgment of 17 January 2002, para 49, and <i>Powell v United Kingdom</i>). Furthermore, where a hospital is a public institution, the acts and omissions of its medical staff are capable of engaging the responsibility of the respondent State under the Convention (see <i>Glass v United Kingdom </i>(2004) 39 EHRR 341, para 71).”</p>
<p class="para">92.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court went on to discuss what was meant by an “effective independent judicial system". Sometimes this had to include recourse to the criminal law. But if death was not caused intentionally, this did not require a criminal law remedy in every case. “In the specific sphere of medical negligence, the obligation may for instance also be satisfied if the legal system affords victims a remedy in the civil courts . . .  Disciplinary measures may also be envisaged.”  (para 75)</p>
<p class="para">93.&nbsp;&nbsp;The principles stated in <i>Tarariyeva</i>, para 74, were repeated in the recent case of <i>Dodov v Bulgaria</i>, app no 59548/00, judgment of 17 January 2008, at para 80. The passage cited at para 90 above from <i>Powell</i> was repeated at para 82. The applicant’s mother, Mrs Stoyanova, a sixty-three year old woman with Alzheimer’s disease, was placed in the medical unit of a nursing home. She needed constant supervision and the staff were told not to leave her unattended. After being taken to see a medical specialist outside the home, she was left alone in the yard of the nursing home by a medical orderly. She disappeared and was never heard of again. Twelve years later, the Court was prepared to assume that she was dead. Her son complained that her life had been put at risk through the negligence of the nursing home staff, that the ensuing investigation had not resulted in any criminal or disciplinary sanctions, that he had not yet been able to obtain compensation in civil proceedings, and also that the police had not done as much as they should have done to search for his mother immediately after she disappeared.  </p>
<p class="para">94.&nbsp;&nbsp;The court examined “whether or not an issue of State responsibility under article 2 of the Convention may arise in respect of the alleged inability of the legal system to secure accountability for negligent acts that had led to Mrs Stoyanova’s disappearance” (para 83). It found that despite the availability of criminal, disciplinary and civil redress, nothing effective had yet been achieved. The legal system, “faced with an arguable case of negligent acts endangering human life, failed to provide an adequate and timely response, consonant with the State’s procedural obligations under article 2.” (para 98).</p>
<p class="para">95.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court went on to examine the complaint against the police under the <i>Osman </i>principle. It was unnecessary to consider how the risk principle might apply when a person in ill health went missing. Although more could have been done in the present case, the question was whether their reaction was adequate in the circumstances, “having regard to the concrete facts and practical realities of daily police work” (para 102). Given that the nursing home staff, who knew what she looked like, had searched the area in vain, the Court was not convinced that the police reaction was inadequate.</p>
<p class="para">96.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Dodov</i>, therefore, the Court appears to have applied the <i>Powell</i> approach to the actions of the nursing home staff and looked for failings in the subsequent investigative machinery. And it applied the <i>Osman </i>approach to the actions of the police, and looked for failings in what they actually did. Understandably, Mr Faulks and Mr Giffin argue that the <i>Powell </i>approach should be applied to all cases of alleged negligence by health care professionals, even where this has resulted in the death of a detained patient. Mr Giffin argued that the <i>Powell </i>approach always applies in health care cases, even where prisoners were involved. If the <i>Powell</i> approach applies, the case should not proceed. There has been an adequate investigation and the ordinary law of negligence was perfectly capable of determining responsibility for Mrs Savage’s untimely death and providing redress if anyone was at fault. The person entitled to invoke the ordinary law has decided not to do so but there is no systemic failure here such as to contravene article 2.</p>
<p class="para">97.&nbsp;&nbsp; My Lords, it has at times been difficult to understand what we have been arguing about. As my noble and learned friend Lord Rodger of Earlsferry has also demonstrated, the positive protective obligation under article 2 is generally an obligation to have proper systems in place. But in some circumstances an operational duty to protect a particular individual is triggered. The latter duty is not engaged by ordinary medical negligence alone. Mr Havers is not arguing for any less demanding test than the test derived from <i>Osman </i>and <i>Keenan</i>. He accepts that this is a different and more stringent test than ordinary medical negligence. For my part,<i> </i>I have little doubt that it is right in principle to apply the approach adopted in the <i>Osman</i> and <i>Keenan</i> to patients detained in hospital under the Mental Health Act as it applies to persons detained under other powers in other institutions. <i> </i>The Mental Health Act provides for the detention of people suffering from mental disorder of a nature or degree which makes it appropriate for them to be assessed and/or treated in hospital. In the case of patients admitted under the civil powers in Part II of the Act, this may be for the sake of their own health or safety or for the protection of other persons. Other patients are admitted on the orders of a criminal court or transferred from prison by the Secretary of State for Justice. All of these patients have been deprived of their liberty within the meaning of article 5 of the Convention. All are under the control of the hospital (or in the case of restricted patients, the Secretary of State). They may not leave when they wish to leave. Their visits and correspondence with the outside world may be controlled. They may be given most forms of treatment for their mental disorder without their consent (although special safeguards apply to some treatments). They may be detained in a wide variety of settings, ranging from high security institutions such as Broadmoor to open wards from which it is relatively easy to escape. But they cannot choose where they are placed. They cannot choose their doctors. They cannot choose their medical treatment. In short, although their circumstances may be a great deal pleasanter than those of other detainees, they are deprived of more of their ordinary civil rights than are other detainees. The Government, in its Response to the Joint Committee on Human Rights Third Report of Session 2004-05 on Deaths in Custody (HL Paper 15-I/HC 137-I), commented that “human rights come sharply into focus in the institutional setting where those detained are entirely dependent on their custodians not only to keep them safe but also to provide them with a humane, decent and caring environment": see Appendix to the Joint Committee’s Eleventh Report of Session 2004-05 (HL Paper 69/HC Paper 416).</p>
<p class="para">98.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Keenan </i>33 EHRR 913, para 110, and in many other cases, the Strasbourg Court has recalled that “the authorities are under an obligation to protect the health of persons deprived of liberty (<i>Hurtado v Switzerland</i>, Comm Rep 8 July 1993, para 79)". By this the Court does not mean simply an obligation to have systems in place to provide access to necessary health care, but an obligation actually to provide it, although of course the Court is alive to the practical demands of imprisonment. If that applies to protecting their health under article 3, it would be strange if it did not also apply to protecting their lives under article 2. <i>Tarariyeva </i>confirms that it does.</p>
<p class="para">99.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Faulks argued that applying the <i>Osman/Keenan </i>approach to tragedies such as this would work to the detriment of patients. It would encourage hospitals to be too restrictive of their patients’ liberty for fear that they might commit suicide or otherwise come to harm. Remarkably little is known about the effect of potential legal liability upon the actions of public authorities generally (see Law Commission Consultation Paper No 187, <i>Administrative Redress: Public Bodies and the Citizen</i>, Appendix B). But it is hard to understand how applying the <i>Osman/Keenan</i> approach in these cases can add to the hospitals’ difficulties. They already face potential liability in negligence if they fail to take reasonable care of their patients. The <i>Osman/Keenan </i>test is different from and in practice more difficult to establish than negligence.</p>
<p class="para">100.&nbsp;&nbsp;The trigger is a “real and immediate risk to life” about which the authorities knew or ought to have known at the time. That has rarely been shown. (See, for example, <i>Younger v United Kingdom </i>(2003) 33 EHRR CD 252, where it was not shown that the police should have known that their prisoner was a suicide risk.)<i> </i>If the duty is triggered, it is, as it was put in <i>Keenan</i> 33 EHRR 913, para 92, to do “all that reasonably could have been expected of them to prevent that risk". In judging what can reasonably be expected, the Court has shown itself aware of the need to take account of competing values in the Convention, in particular the liberty and autonomy rights protected by articles 5 and 8. The steps taken must be proportionate. If this is so in prison, it must be even more so in hospital, where the objectives of detention are therapeutic and protective rather than penal. Developing a patient’s capacity to make sensible choices for herself, and providing her with as good a quality of life as possible, are important components in protecting her mental health. Keeping her absolutely safe from physical harm, by secluding or restraining her, or even by keeping her on a locked ward, may do more harm to her mental health. In judging what can reasonably be expected, the Court has also taken into account the problem of resources. The facilities available for looking after people with serious mental illnesses are not unlimited and the health care professionals have to make the best use they can of what they have. For all of these reasons, applying the <i>Osman/Keenan</i> approach in this context should not persuade the professionals to behave any more cautiously or defensively than they are already persuaded to do by the ordinary law of negligence. </p>
<p class="para">101.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one further point. For the reasons given earlier, it is difficult to distinguish between different classes of people deprived of their liberty by the state. Mental patients may or may not also be prisoners. But it could be said that it is also difficult to distinguish between different classes of mental patients. Some patients, like Mrs Savage, are deprived of their liberty by the law. Some patients, like Mr L (see <i>R v Bournewood Community and Mental Health NHS Trust, ex p L</i> [1999] AC 458) are deprived of their liberty by their own condition. They may lack the capacity voluntarily to decide to be in hospital and may well be prevented from leaving should they wish to do so. These so-called “Bournewood” patients will shortly be protected by new procedures inserted in the Mental Capacity Act 2005 by the Mental Health Act 2007. Some patients, although they have entered hospital quite willingly, are well aware that they might be made the subject of compulsory powers at any time. This is in fact what happened with Mrs Savage, who entered hospital as an informal patient on 16 March 2004. The following day she was first detained under section 5(4), which allows a nurse to authorise the detention of an in-patient for up to six hours until a doctor can arrive, and then under section 3, which provides for detention on the application of two doctors for up to six months (and renewable thereafter). Is it possible, then, to draw any distinction between the state’s protective duties towards all mental patients, whether <i>de iure</i>, <i>de facto</i> or potentially deprived of their liberty? And what about patients who are <i>de iure</i> deprived of their liberty but in fact given leave of absence to go home, as was Mrs Savage on several occasions during her time in hospital? Indeed, what is the extent of the state’s duty to protect all people against an immediate risk of self-harm?</p>
