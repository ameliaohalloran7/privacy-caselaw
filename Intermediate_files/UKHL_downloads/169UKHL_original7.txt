<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The HRA s.7</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;172.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is convenient to take this new point first. In Mr O'Neill's submission, the only proceedings falling within s.7(1)(a) are proceedings for breach of Convention rights alone. Any other proceedings fall, in his submission, within s.7(1)(b), even though they include a claim which, pursued by itself, would fall within s.7(1)(a). Here, the claims were brought by way of judicial review, and included claims for declarators as well as damages and expenses. Hence, he submits they fell within s.7(1)(b). If that were right, it would often make it a matter of chance, or choice for a claimant, whether the time limit applied. By formulating his claim to include a claim for judicial review or declarator or a common law claim, a claimant could ensure that it would fall outside s.7(1)(a) and s.7(5). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;173.&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot accept Mr O'Neill's argument. Proceedings against a public authority under the Human Rights Act may be brought by simple claim without more, but not infrequently they involve an application for judicial review of some decision, with damages being claimed as consequential relief in respect of any breach of Convention rights: see e.g. Lester &amp; Pannick, <i>Human Rights Law and Practice</i>, para. 2.7.3, Clayton &amp; Tomlinson, <i>The Law of Human Rights</i>, para. 21.101 (referring in the English context to what is now CPR 54) and Feldman, <i>English Public Law</i>, para.19.09.  The provisions of s.7(3), (4) and (5) and of s.9 confirm that judicial review was envisaged as the procedure by which claims could be brought under s.7(1)(a). The references in s.7(3) and (4) to "proceedings …. brought" and "proceedings … made" echo the phrase "bring proceedings" in s.7(1)(a). S.9(1) expressly refers to proceedings being brought under s.7(1)(a) in respect of a judicial act by way of an application (in Scotland a petition) for judicial review. The concluding words of s.7(5) contemplate that proceedings under s.7(1)(a) may involve a procedure imposing a stricter time limit than the one year limit which that subsection introduces. The most obvious example of a procedure with a stricter time limit is English judicial review.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;174.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr O'Neill referred to <i>Pepper v. Hart</i> [1993] AC 593 and to ministerial statements in Parliament by Lord Irvine of Lairg LC (HL Hansard 3 November 1997, vol. 582, col. 1232) and Mr O'Brien, Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (HC Hansard 24 June 1998, vol. 314, cols. 1055-58 and 1094-95). Neither the circumstances nor the citations appear to me to satisfy the tests for use of <i>Pepper v. Hart</i>. The statute is not open to real doubt, and the statements are not clear, consistent or of any real assistance to Mr O'Neill's argument. A distinction between reliance on an existing cause of action and proceedings on Convention grounds alone does not take proceedings for judicial review of an act, as being incompatible with Convention rights, outside s.7(1)(a). Proceedings based on Convention grounds alone are quite capable of including claims advanced by way of judicial review. That a claim for judicial review will, under the concluding words of s.7(5), be subject in England to the shorter, three month time limit prescribed by CPR 54(5) was in fact mentioned by Mr O'Brien on 24 June 1998 at col. 1095 in a passage not quoted in Mr O'Neill's submissions. Mr O'Brien stated specifically that "the most obvious …. case" of proceedings under s.7(1)(a) attracting the shorter time limit under s.7(5) was judicial review. This (although not easy to reconcile with an earlier statement by Mr O'Brien on the same day at col. 1056) is inconsistent with Mr O'Neill's argument.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;175.&nbsp;&nbsp;The position under the Human Rights Act is thus, I consider, as follows. S.7(1)(a) and consequently s.7(5) apply to claims brought for breach of Convention rights, by whatever procedure they are pursued and whether or not they are pursued alone or in conjunction with other claims. In so far as any common law claim existing independently of the Human Rights Act is conjoined with a claim within s.7(1)(a), it will have its own separate limitation period, which will continue to apply. S.7(1)(b) enables reliance on Convention rights in situations not within s.7(1)(a), as where a Convention right is relied upon in defence in civil or criminal proceedings brought by a public authority or in the development or application of common law principles. It is understandable that the Human Rights Act should not contain any time limit for reliance under s.7(1)(b). Civil proceedings against the person relying on Convention rights will be subject to ordinary time limits, such as those prescribed by the Limitation Act 1980 or equity. Some criminal proceedings are subject to statutory time limits. Assuming such proceedings to be in time, it would be inappropriate for there to be a time limit preventing reliance on Convention rights to defend them. As to reliance by a claimant on Convention rights in the development or application of common law principles in civil proceedings brought for a cause of action not arising under the Human Rights Act, again that cause of action will have its own limitation period.</p>
<i>
(c) The HRA s.8
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;176.&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue arising under the Human Rights Act and of potential relevance to the present appeal concerns s.8. That section provides in subsection (1) that "In relation to any act (or proposed act) of a public authority which the court finds is (or would be) unlawful, it may grant such relief or remedy, or make such order, within its powers as it considers just and appropriate".  In relation to claims founded directly on a Convention right, the section shows that the Human Rights Act does <i>not</i> give rise to a tortious action for breach of statutory duty. Rather, it gives the court a special statutory discretion, modelled in relation to damages on the approach of the European Court of Human Rights. But what is the position when a claimant invokes a Convention right in reply to a defence which would at common law bar the claim? S.8 is on its face applicable generally to situations within s.7(1)(a) and (b), and in <i>Attorney-General's Reference (No. 2 of 2001) </i>[2003] UKHL 68; [2004] 2 AC 72 at para.8 my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill referred in general terms to s.8 in relation to the right of a victim to rely on his Convention right in any legal proceedings; further, at para. 33 my noble and learned friend Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead said that the width of the discretion granted to the court by s.8 "is to be expected", since "the circumstances in which s.6(1) is in point will vary greatly". The majority of the House in that case, although emphasising the width of the discretion provided by s.8, did not consider that it could allow a court to hold a criminal trial if the trial itself would be unfair. In contrast, the minority consisting of my noble and learned friends, Lord Hope of Craighead and Lord Rodger of Earlsferry forcefully expressed their view that even this would fall within the wide discretion provided by s.8: see e.g. paras. 76 and 175-6.  <i>Attorney-General's Reference (No. 2 of 2001)</i> underlines both the width and the room for differing views about the width of the discretion conferred by s.8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;177.&nbsp;&nbsp;The House was not referred on the present appeal to any case considering the position if unlawfulness under s.6(1) were invoked in civil proceedings in reply to a defence which would otherwise exist to a claim. But two hypothetical examples may be taken. First, the case of a claim for trespass involving wrongful demolition of a property by a public authority. What if the public authority relies on a statutory power, but the house-owner establishes that its exercise in his case was disproportionate and so contrary to the First Protocol? The claim will succeed, but does the case fall within s.8(1) (so that the court will award the "just and appropriate" relief or "just satisfaction" provided by s.8(3) and (4))? Or is it to be regarded as a simple case of a successful tort claim, a defence to which has been defeated by unlawfulness, so that the damages to be awarded will be tort damages? The practical distinction in terms of the sums awarded may not on these facts be significant. But the principle may be important in the context of s.100(3) of the Scotland Act (cf paragraph 189 below). A second example is provided by the facts of <i>R (Greenfield) v. Secretary of State of the Home Department </i>[2005] UKHL 14; [2005] 1 WLR 673, where the House considered and applied the European Court of Human Right's approach of awarding just satisfaction. The claimant, a prisoner, was ordered to serve an additional 21 days in disciplinary proceedings which were held to involve a criminal charge within article 6 of the Convention. That article was broken since the proceedings were not before an independent tribunal and he was wrongly denied legal representation. Suppose the prisoner, instead of proceeding directly for breach of article 6, had sued for false imprisonment - a tort of strict liability: cf <i>R v. Governor of Brockhill Prison, ex p. Evans </i>[2001] 2 AC 19 - and had met the Governor's defence of lawful statutory detention by relying on article 6. Again, would the case fall within s.8 or would it be a simple case of a successful common law claim?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;178.&nbsp;&nbsp;In Mr O'Neill's submission, both these examples are to be regarded as simple cases of successful common law claims, where a potential defence has been defeated by unlawfulness and damages are to be awarded at common law, rather than under s.8. Any other analysis would, he submits, treat the Human Rights Act as restricting common law rights, whereas s.8 was intended only to "top up" recovery. But there is no restriction of common law rights in either case, since apart from the Human Rights Act there would be no claim. It is only by reliance on the Human Rights Act that either claim could succeed at all. It seems to me very arguable that the remedy where a claimant meets a defence by reliance on Convention rights is a discretionary remedy falling within the court's power under s.8 to do what is "just and appropriate". The Human Rights Act was meant to domesticate the Convention rights, not to enlarge their scope. As Lord Bingham of Cornhill stated with reference to previous authority in <i>R (SB) v. Governors of Denbigh High School</i> [2006] UKHL 15; [2007] 1 AC 100, para. 29:</p>
<p></p><ul>"First, the purpose of the Human Rights Act 1998 was not to enlarge the rights or remedies of those in the United Kingdom whose Convention rights have been violated but to enable those rights and remedies to be asserted and enforced by the domestic courts of this country and not only by recourse to Strasbourg."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also seems unlikely that Parliament should have taken care to ensure that claims brought in direct reliance on a Convention right should be subject to the principles applied by the European Court of Human Rights (cf s.8(3) and (4)), but at the same time have intended that the incorporation into domestic law of Convention rights should enable a claimant, by formulating his claim on a common law basis and relying on the Convention in reply to an otherwise available defence, to escape the carefully crafted discretion provided to the court under s.8. Accordingly, it seems to me quite likely and on any view very arguable that s.8 was meant to cover the situation of unlawfulness under s.6(1) invoked in reply to a defence otherwise available to the claim.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Analysis</p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;179.&nbsp;&nbsp;Issue 1 involves, as my noble and learned friend Lord Hope notes, an issue of statutory interpretation, though one in relation to which it is legitimate to have regard to the plausibility or otherwise of Parliament having intended by implication to create or recognise duplicate remedies enabling just satisfaction to be claimed under two connected statutes under different conditions. The Human Rights Act is concerned with acts or omissions to act which are "unlawful". S.8 provides for circumstances in which an award of damages may be made in respect of such acts or omissions.  The time limit introduced by s.7(5) for a claim by a victim against a public authority is understandable. In contrast, the Scotland Act is concerned with the limits of the devolved competence, or vires, of the Scottish Parliament (s.29(1) and (2)), the Scottish Ministers (ss.53(1) and 54(2) and (3)) or members of the Scottish Executive (s.57(2)). (Under s.44(2) the members of the Scottish Executive are referred to collectively as the Scottish Ministers.) Competence or vires determines the validity of the legislation, acts or omissions of such bodies as regards the world generally. S.100(2) read with the provisions of Schedule 6 enables the Lord Advocate, the Advocate General or the Attorney General to challenge the vires of an Act of the Scottish Parliament or of a function or its purported or proposed exercise by the Scottish Ministers or Executive without restriction. S.100(1) introduces the victim test as a limitation on the ability of others to mount any such challenge. The omission of any time limit for a challenge to the validity of legislation or an act or omission is understandable. But claims for damages raise different considerations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;180.&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue on this appeal is <i>not</i> whether the Human Rights Act provides the only mechanism for a challenge to an act or omission of the Scottish Ministers as incompatible with a Convention right. Such a challenge can be mounted under the Scotland Act, as stated in the previous paragraph. This does <i>not</i> mean that all the consequences of a successful challenge are to be found in the Scotland Act, still less that the Scotland Act provides for damages as one of such consequences. As my noble and learned friend Lord Hope indicates in paragraph 17 the Scotland Act must be taken to have been drafted against the background of domestic law remedies and European Community law, and did not need to make provision for these. So, if an act or omission is ultra vires, any monies paid will ordinarily be recoverable at common law as having been wrongly extracted or as paid under a mistake of law: see e.g. <i>Woolwich Equitable Building Society v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue </i>[1993] AC 70;<i> Kleinwort Benson Ltd. v. Lincoln C.C. </i>[1999] 2 AC 349; <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Group Plc v. H. M. Commissioners of Inland Revenue</i> [2006] UKHL 49; [2007] 1 AC 558 and <i>Sempra Metals Ltd v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue </i>[2007] UKHL 34; [2007] 3 WLR 354. Likewise, European Community law, which has primacy in the United Kingdom under the European Communities Act 1972, provides - quite independently of the Scotland Act - for remedies including damages in respect of acts or omissions contrary to the European Treaties: <i>Francovich and Others </i>(Joined Cases C-6/90 and 9/90); [1995] ICR 722; ]1991] ECR I-5357 and <i>Brasserie du Pêcheur SA v Federal Republic of Germany; R v Secretary of State for Transport, Ex p Factortame Ltd (No 4) </i>(Joined Cases C-46/93 and C-48/93); [1996] QB 404.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;181.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only issue on this appeal is whether the Scotland Act, in addition to dealing with matters of competence or vires, provides for or enables claims for damages for the passing of legislation or for acts or omissions which lie outside the devolved competence of the relevant Scottish body because incompatible with a Convention right. The respondents' short submission is that it does not: the Scotland Act enables proceedings to establish the validity or otherwise of legislation or of an act or omission. But the only basis for a claim for damages is the Human Rights Act. A victim who seeks damages alone or in addition to a declaration of invalidity must rely on both Acts. The damages claim will face a time limit which the other claims do not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;182.&nbsp;&nbsp;In support of this analysis, the respondents deploy some powerful, considerations. First, a breach of a public law right by itself gives rise to no claim for damages. A claim for damages must be based on a private law cause of action: see <i>X (Minors) v. Bedfordshire County Council </i>[1995] 2 AC 633, 730F-731B, per Lord Browne-Wilkinson. The only available candidate, among four possibilities mentioned by Lord Browne-Wilkinson, would be breach of statutory duty simpliciter, of which he went on to say that "a private law cause of action will arise if it can be shown, as a matter of construction of the statute, that the statutory duty was imposed for the protection of a limited class of the public and that Parliament intended to confer on members of that class a private right of action for breach of the duty. There is no general rule …. If the statute provides no other remedy for its breach and the Parliamentary intention to protect a limited class is shown, that indicates that there may be a private right of action since otherwise there is no method of securing the protection the statute was intended to confer. If the statute does provide some other means of enforcing the duty that will normally indicate that the statutory right was intended to be enforceable by those means and not by private right of action."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;183.&nbsp;&nbsp;In<i> HM Advocate v R</i> [2002] UKPC D3; [2004] 1 AC 462,<i> </i>para 60 my noble and learned friend Lord Hope of Craighead treated the Scotland Act as falling within "the familiar principle which provides a civil cause of action where there has been a breach of a statutory duty which results in injury to a person of a class which the statute was designed to protect". I respectfully disagree. The Scotland Act is not framed in terms of duty, but competence. The limitations of devolved competence are a matter of public interest. But they exist as part of the constitutional arrangements of the United Kingdom, and neither directly nor obviously for the protection of individuals. Further, as Lord Browne-Wilkinson's formulation suggests, it is necessary to consider whether other means of recourse exist, since it is only in their absence that it may be appropriate to treat a statute as providing or enabling a private right of action. Here, even confining attention for the moment to cases of legislation or acts or omissions incompatible with a Convention right, it is both unnecessary, and in my view inappropriate, to treat the Scotland Act as providing or giving rise to any right to claim damages when the Human Rights Act, with which it is closely associated, was clearly designed for that purpose. S.100, on which Lord Hope relied in <i>HM Lord Advocate v R</i>, was not in my opinion designed and is not apt to lead to any different conclusion (cf paragraphs 187 to 189 below). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;184.&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, this conclusion is reinforced by the fact that ss.6-8 of the Human Rights Act were deliberately formulated so as <i>not</i> to give rise to a common law claim for damages for breach of statutory duty, in the event of an act unlawful under s.6 because it was incompatible with a Convention right. On the contrary, these sections give rise to the carefully crafted discretionary power provided by s.8. This makes it even less likely that Parliament intended that an act rendered ultra vires under the Scotland Act, because incompatible with a Convention right, should give rise to a common law claim for damages for breach of statutory duty. To meet this point, my noble and learned friend Lord Hope, in paragraph 19 of his present opinion suggests that s. 100(3) "makes it clear that that a common law claim of damages for breach of statutory duty is excluded", but "assumes that damages for just satisfaction may be claimed in respect of an act which is outside devolved competence because it is incompatible with a Convention right".  But this involves in effect implying into the Scotland Act all, or at any rate the parts dealing with damages, of the positive provisions of s.8(1) and (2) of the Human Rights Act. These provisions were however not replicated in the Scotland Act - and this can only have been deliberate. Again, I shall return to consider s.100(3) in paragraphs 187 to 189.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;185.&nbsp;&nbsp;A third, connected consideration is that the courts should be reluctant to develop alternative remedies supplementing those provided by the Human Rights Act. As regards claim for damages, it can, as Lord Bingham of Cornhill said in <i>Watkins v. Secretary of State for the Home Department </i>[2006] 2 AC 395, paragraph 26, "reasonably be inferred that Parliament intended infringements of the core human (and constitutional) rights protected by the Act to be remedied under it and not by development of parallel remedies". A similar theme appears in <i>Wainwright v. Home Office </i>[2003] UKHL 53; [2004] 2 AC 406, paras. 33-34 and 51-52 in the speech of my noble and learned friend, Lord Hoffmann. While the Scotland Act allows matters of competence to be tested, damages claims are regulated by the Human Rights Act with a carefully balanced time limit provision. There is no obvious reason why Parliament would have given Scottish claimants an easy escape route around that provision. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;186.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, if the Scotland Act were held to imply or indicate the existence of a right to claim damages for an ultra vires act or omission incompatible with the Convention rights, the question arises whether, and if so how and why, this would be limited to breach of Convention rights. Would the right to damages exist in respect of any legislation of the Scottish Parliament or any act or omission of the Scottish Executive outside devolved competence for <i>any</i> of the reasons stated in s.29 and applied under ss.53-54? If the Scotland Act is treated as creating a privately enforceable duty in respect of compliance with the limits of devolved competence regarding Convention rights, why should the line be drawn there? In particular, would a statutory right to damages exist in respect of any such legislation, act or omission inconsistent with European Community law?  If so, the Scotland Act would have the surprising effect of giving a new, alternative, domestic remedy in damages apparently unqualified by the European law conditions identified in <i>Francovich and Others </i>(Joined Cases C-6/90 and 9/90; [1995] ICR 722 [1991] ECR I-5357) and <i>Brasserie du Pêcheur SA v Federal Republic of Germany; R v Secretary of State for Transport, Ex p Factortame Ltd (No 4) </i>(Joined Cases C-46/93 and C-48/93) [1996] QB 404. These conditions (in addition to requiring that the rule infringed be intended to confer rights on individuals) require that any infringement be "sufficiently serious" in the sense that "the Member State … concerned manifestly and gravely disregarded the limits on its discretion" and that there be a direct (and strict) causal link between the breach and the damage: see the <i>Brasserie du Pêcheur </i>and<i> Factortame </i>cases, paragraphs 55 and 65 and more generally Arnott, <i>The European Union and its Court of Justice</i> (2nd ed.) pages 309-310 and 329. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;187.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, the appellants rely on the provisions of s.100 as implying or indicating the existence on the part of a victim to claim damages for any ultra vires act or omission incompatible with Convention rights. That negatively framed section was not in the original bill introduced in January 1998; it was introduced only late in the passage of the bill on 6th October 1998. It would seem a surprising place to find so important a provision as the appellants suggest this to be. Further, if it was the section's role or effect to recognise a right to claim damages in relation to Convention rights, one would have expected Parliament also to address the question mentioned in the previous paragraph, viz whether a claim to damages is available in the event of other instances of excess of devolved competence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;188.&nbsp;&nbsp;The general impression given by s.100 is that, far from providing or confirming the existence of an alternative remedy free from the time limit restriction in the Human Rights Act, it was intended to ensure consistency with that Act. S.100(1) does just that by introducing the victim requirement, while s.100(2) qualifies that restriction in relation to the Lord Advocate, the Advocate General and the Attorney General. So it is that Mr O'Neill falls back on s.100(3) as indicating that a right to claim damages must exist for any legislation, act or omission outside devolved competence under the Scotland Act because incompatible with a Convention right. S.100(3) provides that "This Act does not enable a court …. to award any damages in respect of an act which is incompatible with any of the Convention rights which it could not award if section 8(3) and (4) of the Human Rights Act applied". The unlikelihood that this negatively framed subsection was intended to imply or recognise a positive right to claim damages is not to my mind reduced by the comparison which Mr O'Neill drew between it and s.8(3) of the Human Rights Act. S.8(3) follows s.8(1) and (2) as well as the provisions of s.7(1), all of which make clear in positive terms that unlawfulness under the Human Rights Act gives rise to a privately enforceable complaint in respect of which the court may as a matter of discretion award damages. No equivalent of these subsections, or other provisions, exists in the Scotland Act. This is a powerful pointer in my view against any conclusion that s.100(3) of the Scotland Act creates, or assumes the existence under the Scotland Act of, duplicate claims to just satisfaction in respect of acts incompatible with Convention rights and outside devolved competence. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;189.&nbsp;&nbsp;As to what s.100(3) in fact achieves, taken in context, one clear possibility identified by the Inner House (paragraph 80) is that it was inserted as a matter of major caution. After preparing the main part of this opinion I had the benefit of reading in draft the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Scott of Foscote. He gives to my mind convincing reasons for preferring this conclusion even if the subsection is not actually necessary. But a particular situation to which I consider it may well also have been directed is that considered in paragraphs 176 to 179 above. Take a common law claim which succeeds solely because an act is unlawful as being incompatible with the Human Rights Act (as where the unlawfulness is relied upon by a claimant in reply to a defence). If s.8 would govern this situation under the Human Rights Act, then s.100(3) of the Scotland Act ensures that the same discretionary measure of recovery applies if a claimant chooses to defeat the defence on the basis that the act is outside devolved competence under the Scotland Act. Even if s.8 were held not to cover such a situation (and there is as yet no identifiable authority on the point), the considerable possibility that the drafters of both Acts or of the Scotland Act contemplated that it would or might do so is itself sufficient to explain the inclusion of s.100(3).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;190.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixth, I do not find it surprising that Parliament should in the Scotland Act have regulated matters of competence and vires, leaving claims for damages to be dealt with under the Human Rights Act. Where claims in both categories are pursued, no difficulty exists in combining them in one set of proceedings. Nor do the different dates on which the main provisions of the two Acts came into force militate against this conclusion. Incompatibility with Convention rights could be raised or relied upon as rendering invalid any Scottish legislation, act or omission taking place during the period of about 17 months between the coming into force of the Scotland Act in May 1999 and the coming into force on 2nd October 2000 of the Human Rights Act. But claims for damages could only arise in respect of Convention incompatible legislation, acts or omissions occurring after the Human Rights Act came into force. That represents a coherent scheme - the alternative to my mind does not. Invalidity is one thing, exposure to damages another. It is understandable that Parliament should not to wish to expose the Scottish Parliament, Ministers or Executive to claims for damages for Convention-incompatible conduct long before there was any exposure to such claims in any other United Kingdom context. </p>
