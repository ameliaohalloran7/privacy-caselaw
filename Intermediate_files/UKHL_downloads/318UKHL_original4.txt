<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101.&nbsp;&nbsp;These errors have an important bearing on the question whether the Court of Appeal were right to differ from the decision of the trial judge on the question where the balance lay between the private interest of Miss Campbell and the public interest in the publication of these details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102.&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the conclusion that I have reached on this issue it is not necessary for me to say anything about the weight that the Court of Appeal attached to the inaccuracies, except to observe that there is a vital difference between inaccuracies that deprive the information of its intrusive quality and inaccuracies that do not.  The inaccuracies that were relied on here fall into the later category.  The length of time that Miss Campbell had been attending meetings was understated, while the frequency of her attendance at meetings was exaggerated.  And the caption to the photograph in the first article stated that she was arriving at the meeting, when the fact was that she was leaving it.  These were errors of a minor nature only, which did not affect the overall significance of the details that were published.  I would hold that they did not detract from the private nature of what was being published.</p>
<i><p><i>The competing rights of free speech and privacy</i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103.&nbsp;&nbsp;Morland J did not give any detailed reasons in para 70 of his judgment for his conclusion that, striking the balance between articles 8 and 10 and having full regard to section 12(4) of the Human Rights Act 1998, Miss Campbell was entitled to the remedy of damages.  But he did recognise in para 98 that neither article 10 nor article 8 had pre-eminence, the one over the other.  Court of Appeal's approach to the respondents' entitlement to publish what they described as the peripheral details was based on their view that the provision of these details as background to support the story that Miss Campbell was a drug addict was a legitimate part of the journalistic package which was designed to demonstrate that she had been deceiving the public when she said that she did not take drugs: [2003] QB 633, 662, para 62.  In para 64 they said that its publication was justified in order to give a factual account that had the detail necessary to carry credibility.  But they do not appear to have attempted to balance the competing Convention rights against each other.  No doubt this was because they had already concluded that these details were peripheral and that their publication was not, in its context, sufficiently significant to amount to a breach of duty of confidence: para 58.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion the Court of Appeal's approach is open to the criticism that, because they wrongly held that these details were not entitled to protection under the law of confidence, they failed to carry out the required balancing exercise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105.&nbsp;&nbsp;The context for this exercise is provided by articles 8 and 10 of the Convention.  The rights guaranteed by these articles are qualified rights.  Article 8(1) protects the right to respect for private life, but recognition is given in article 8(2) to the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.  Article 10(1) protects the right to freedom of expression, but article 10(2) recognises the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others.  The effect of these provisions is that the right to privacy which lies at the heart of an action for breach of confidence has to be balanced against the right of the media to impart information to the public.  And the right of the media to impart information to the public has to be balanced in its turn against the respect that must be given to private life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing new about this, as the need for this kind of balancing exercise was already part of English law:  <i>Attorney General v Guardian Newspapers (No 2)</i> [1990]  1 AC 109,  per Lord Goff of Chieveley.  But account must now be taken of the guidance which has been given by the European Court on the application of these articles.  As Sedley LJ pointed out in <i>Douglas v Hello! Ltd</i> [2001]  1 QB 967, 1004, para 135:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The European Court of Human Rights has always recognised the high importance of free media of communication in a democracy, but its jurisprudence does not - and could not consistently with the Convention itself - give article 10(1) the presumptive priority which is given, for example, to the First Amendment in the jurisprudence of the United States' courts.  Everything will ultimately depend on the proper balance between privacy and publicity in the situation facing the court."  <p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107.&nbsp;&nbsp;I accept, of course, that the importance which the Court of Appeal attached to the journalistic package finds support in the authorities.  In <i>Jersild v Denmark</i> (1994)  19 EHRR 1, para 31 the European Court, repeating what was said in <i>Observer and Guardian v United Kingdom</i> (1992)  14 EHRR 153, para 59, declared that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and that the safeguards to be afforded to the press are of particular importance.  It then added these comments in para 31:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Whilst the press must not overstep the bounds set, <i>inter alia</i>, in the interest of 'the protection of the reputation and rights of others', it is nevertheless incumbent on it to impart information and ideas of public interest.  Not only does the press have the task of imparting such information and ideas: the public also has a right to receive them.  Were it otherwise, the press would be unable to play its vital role of 'public watchdog'." <p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108.&nbsp;&nbsp;The freedom of the press to exercise its own judgment in the presentation of journalistic material was emphasised in a further passage in <i>Jersild's </i>case where the court said, at p 26, para 31:</p>
<p></p><ul>"At the same time, the methods of objective and balanced reporting may vary considerably, depending among other things on the media in question.  It is not for this court, nor for the national courts for that matter, to substitute their own views for those of the press as to what technique of reporting should be adopted by journalists.  In this context the court recalls that article 10 protects not only the substance of the ideas and information expressed, but also the form in which they are conveyed."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Fressoz v France</i> (2001)  31 EHRR 28, 60, para 54 the court said that in essence article 10 leaves it for journalists to decide whether or not it is necessary to reproduce material to ensure credibility, adding:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It protects journalists' rights to divulge information on issues of general interest provided that they are acting in good faith and on an accurate factual basis and provide 'reliable and precise' information in accordance with the ethics of journalism." <p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no need for the court in <i>Jersild's</i> case to examine the question how the article 10 right which was relied on was to be balanced against a competing right under article 8 of the Convention.  The applicants maintained that their right to freedom of expression under article 10 was infringed when they were charged and convicted of committing offences which resulted from their choice of the material that had been published.  The objectionable remarks which were contained in the television broadcast of a news programme were of a racist nature.  The focus of the case was on the right to impart information and ideas of public interest and the right of the public to receive such ideas.  The <i>Fressoz </i>case on the other hand was about the disclosure of information which was confidential as it was contained in the taxpayer's tax file. It was lawful to disclose information about the taxpayer's income.  The question was whether publication of the documents in which that information was contained could be justified under article 10.  So the court addressed itself to the question whether the objective of preserving fiscal confidentiality, which in itself was legitimate, constituted a relevant and sufficient justification for the interference with the article 10 right.  There was a balance to be struck by weighing the interference with freedom to disclose against the need for confidentiality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110.&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for a balancing exercise to be carried out is also inherent in the provisions of article 10 itself, as the court explained in <i>Bladet Troms? and Stensaas v Norway</i> (2000)  29 EHRR 125.  In that case a newspaper and its editor complained that their right to freedom of expression had been breached when they were found liable in defamation proceedings for statements in articles which they had published about the methods used by seal hunters in the hunting of harp seals.  At p 167, para 59 the court said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Although the press must not overstep certain bounds, in particular in respect of the reputation and rights of others and the need to prevent the disclosure of confidential information, its duty is nevertheless to impart - in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities - information and ideas on all matters of public interest."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court dealt with the question of balance at p169, para 65:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Article 10 of the Convention does not, however, guarantee a wholly freedom of expression even with respect to press coverage of matters of serious public concern.  Under the terms of paragraph 2 of the Article the exercise of this freedom carries with it 'duties and responsibilities' which also apply to the press.  These 'duties and responsibilities' are liable to assume significance when, as in the present case, there is question of attacking the reputation of private individuals and examining the 'rights of others'.  As pointed out by the government, the seal hunters' right to protection of their honour and reputation is itself internationally recognised under Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  Also of relevance for the balancing of competing interests which the Court must carry out is the fact that under article 6(2) of the Convention the seal hunters had a right to be presumed innocent of any criminal offence until proved guilty.  By reason of the duties and responsibilities' inherent in the exercise of the freedom of expression, the safeguard afforded by article 10 to journalists in relation to reporting on issues of general interest is subject to the proviso that they are acting in good faith to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethics of journalism."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 12(4) of the Human Rights Act 1998 provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The court must have particular regard to the importance of the Convention right to freedom of expression and, where the proceedings relate to material which the respondent claims, or which appears to the court, to be journalistic, literary or artistic material (or to conduct connected with such material), to -<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;the extent to which - <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;the material has, or is about to, become available to the public; or<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;it is, or would be, in the pubic interest for the material to be published;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;any relevant privacy code."  <p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as Sedley LJ said in <i>Douglas v Hello! Ltd </i> [2001]  QB 967, 1003, para 133, you cannot have particular regard to article 10 without having equally particular regard at the very least to article 8: see also <i>In re S (A Child) (Identifications: Restrictions on Publication)</i> [2003]  3 WLR 1425, 1450, para 52 where Hale LJ said that section 12(4) does not give either article pre-eminence over the other.  These observations seem to me to be entirely consistent with the jurisprudence of the European Court, as is the following passage in Sedley LJ's opinion in <i>Douglas </i>at p 1005, para 137:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The case being one which affects the Convention right of freedom of expression, section 12 of the Human Rights Act 1998 requires the court to have regard to article 10 (as, in its absence, would section 6).  This, however, cannot, consistently with section 3 and article 17, give the article 10(1) right of free expression a presumptive priority over other rights.  What it does is require the court to consider article 10(2) along with article 10(1), and by doing so to bring into the frame the conflicting right to respect for privacy.  This right, contained in article 8 and reflected in English law, is in turn qualified in both contexts by the right of others to free expression.  The outcome, which self-evidently has to be the same under both articles, is determined principally by considerations of proportionality." <p></p></ul>
<p>It is to be noted too that clause 3(i) of the Code of Practice of the Press Complaints Committee acknowledges this limitation.  It states that a person may have a reasonable expectation of privacy in a public place. </p>
<i><p><i>Striking the balance</i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the presentation of the material that it was legitimate to convey to the public in this case without breaching the duty of confidence was a matter for the journalists.  The choice of language used to convey information and ideas, and decisions as to whether or not to accompany the printed word by the use of photographs, are pre-eminently editorial matters with which the court will not interfere.  The respondents are also entitled to claim that they should be accorded a reasonable margin of appreciation in taking decisions as to what details needed to be included in the article to give it credibility.  This is an essential part of the journalistic exercise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113.&nbsp;&nbsp;But decisions about the publication of material that is private to the individual raise issues that are not simply about presentation and editing.  Any interference with the public interest in disclosure has to be balanced against the interference with the right of the individual to respect for their private life.  The decisions that are then taken are open to review by the court.  The tests which the court must apply are the familiar ones.  They are whether publication of the material pursues a legitimate aim and whether the benefits that will be achieved by its publication are proportionate to the harm that may be done by the interference with the right to privacy.  The jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights explains how these principles are to be understood and applied in the context of the facts of each case.  Any restriction of the right to freedom of expression must be subjected to very close scrutiny.  But so too must any restriction of the right to respect for private life.  Neither article 8 nor article 10 has any pre-eminence over the other in the conduct of this exercise.  As Resolution 1165 of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (1998), para 11, pointed out, they are neither absolute not in any hierarchical order, since they are of equal value in a democratic society.</p>
<i><p><i></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i>The article 10 right</i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case it is convenient to begin by looking at the matter from the standpoint of the respondents' assertion of the article 10 right and the court's duty as a public authority under section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998, which section 12(4) reinforces, not to act in a way which is incompatible with that Convention right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first question is whether the objective of the restriction on the article 10 right - the protection of Miss Campbell's right under article 8 to respect for her private life - is sufficiently important to justify limiting the fundamental right to freedom of expression which the press assert on behalf of the public.  It follows from my conclusion that the details of Miss Campbell's treatment were private that I would answer this question in the affirmative.  The second question is whether the means chosen to limit the article 10 right are rational, fair and not arbitrary and impair the right as minimally as is reasonably possible.  It is not enough to assert that it would be reasonable to exclude these details from the article.  A close examination of the factual justification for the restriction on the freedom of expression is needed if the fundamental right enshrined in article 10 is to remain practical and effective.  The restrictions which the court imposes on the article 10 right must be rational, fair and not arbitrary, and they must impair the right no more than is necessary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion the factors that need to be weighed are, on the one hand, the duty that was recognised in <i>Jersild v Denmark</i> (1994)  19 EHRR 1, para 31  to impart information and ideas of public interest which the public has a right to receive, and the need that was recognised in <i>Fressoz v France</i> (2001)  31 EHRR 28, para 54 for the court to leave it to journalists to decide what material needs to be reproduced to ensure credibility; and, on the other hand, the degree of privacy to which Miss Campbell was entitled under the law of confidence as to the details of her therapy.  Account should therefore be taken of the respondents' wish to put forward a story that was credible and to present Miss Campbell in a way that commended her for her efforts to overcome her addiction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it should also be recognised that the right of the public to receive information about the details of her treatment was of a much lower order than the undoubted right to know that she was misleading the public when she said that she did not take drugs.  In <i>Dudgeon v United Kingdom</i> (1981)  4 EHRR 149, para 52 the European Court said that the more intimate the aspects of private life which are being interfered with, the more serious must be the reasons for doing so before the interference can be legitimate.  <i>Clayton and Tomlinson</i>, <i>The Law of Human Rights</i> (2000), para 15.162, point out that the court has distinguished three kinds of expression: political expression, artistic expression and commercial expression, and that it consistently attaches great importance to political expression and applies rather less rigorous principles to expression which is artistic and commercial.  According to the court's well-established case law, freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and the self-fulfilment of each individual: <i>Tammer v Estonia</i> (2001) 37 EHRR 857, para 59.  But there were no political or democratic values at stake here, nor has any pressing social need been identified: contrast <i>Goodwin v United Kingdom</i> (1996)  22 EHRR 123, para 40.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118.&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the other side of the balance, Keene LJ said in <i>Douglas v Hello! Ltd</i> [2001]  QB 967, para 168, that any consideration of article 8 rights must reflect the fact that there are different degrees of privacy.  In the present context the potential for disclosure of the information to cause harm is an important factor to be taken into account in the assessment of the extent of the restriction that was needed to protect Miss Campbell's right to privacy.</p>
<i><p><i></i></p>
The article 8 right
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119.&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the matter from Miss Campbell's point of view and the protection of her article 8 Convention right, publication of details of the treatment which she was undertaking to cure her addiction - that she was attending Narcotics Anonymous, for how long, how frequently and at what times of day she had been attending this therapy, the nature of it and extent of her commitment to the process and the publication of the covertly taken photographs (the third, fourth and fifth of the five elements contained in the article) - had the potential to cause harm to her, for the reasons which I have already given.  So I would attach a good deal of weight to this factor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120.&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the other side of the balance, a person's right to privacy may be limited by the public's interest in knowing about certain traits of her personality and certain aspects of her private life, as L'Heureux-Dubé and Bastarache JJ in the Supreme Court of Canada recognised in <i>Aubry v Les ?ditions Vice-Versa Inc </i>[1998]  1 SCR 591, paras 57-58.   But it is not enough to deprive Miss Campbell of her right to privacy that she is a celebrity and that her private life is newsworthy.  A margin of appreciation must, of course, be given to the journalist.  Weight must be given to this.  But to treat these details merely as background was to undervalue the importance that was to be attached to the need, if Miss Campbell was to be protected, to keep these details private.  And it is hard to see that there was any compelling need for the public to know the name of the organisation that she was attending for the therapy, or for the other details of it to be set out.  The presentation of the article indicates that this was not fully appreciated when the decision was taken to publish these details.  The decision to publish the photographs suggests that greater weight was being given to the wish to publish a story that would attract interest rather than to the wish to maintain its credibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121.&nbsp;&nbsp;Had it not been for the publication of the photographs, and looking to the text only, I would have been inclined to regard the balance between these rights as about even.  Such is the effect of the margin of appreciation that must, in a doubtful case, be given to the journalist.  In that situation the proper conclusion to draw would have been that it had not been shown that the restriction on the article 10 right for which Miss Campbell argues was justified on grounds of proportionality.  But the text cannot be separated from the photographs.  The words "Therapy: Naomi outside meeting" underneath the photograph on the front page and the words "Hugs: Naomi, dressed in jeans and baseball hat, arrives for a lunchtime group meeting this week" underneath the photograph on page 13 were designed to link that what might otherwise have been anonymous and uninformative pictures with the main text.  The reader would undoubtedly make that link, and so too would the reasonable person of ordinary sensibilities.  The reasonable person of ordinary sensibilities would also regard publication of the covertly taken photographs, and the fact that they were linked with the text in this way, as adding greatly overall to the intrusion which the article as a whole made into her private life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122.&nbsp;&nbsp;The photographs were taken of Miss Campbell while she was in a public place, as she was in the street outside the premises where she had been receiving therapy.  The taking of photographs in a public street must, as Randerson J said in <i>Hosking v Runting</i> [2003]  3 NZLR 385, 415, para 138, be taken to be one of the ordinary incidents of living in a free community.  The real issue is whether publicising the content of the photographs would be offensive: Gault and Blanchard JJ in the Court of Appeal (25 March 2004), para 165.  A person who just happens to be in the street when the photograph was taken and appears in it only incidentally cannot as a general rule object to the publication of the photograph, for the reasons given by L'Heureux-Dubé and Bastarache JJ in <i>Aubry v ?ditions Vice-Versa Inc</i> [1998]  1 SCR 591, para 59.  But the situation is different if the public nature of the place where a photograph is taken was simply used as background for one or more persons who constitute the true subject of the photograph.  The question then arises, balancing the rights at issue, where the public's right to information can justify dissemination of a photograph taken without authorisation: <i>Aubry,</i> para 61.  The European Court has recognised that a person who walks down a public street will inevitably be visible to any member of the public who is also present and, in the same way, to a security guard viewing the scene through closed circuit television: <i>PG v JH v United Kingdom</i>, App No. 44787/98, para 57.  But, as the court pointed out in the same paragraph, private life considerations may arise once any systematic or permanent record comes into existence of such material from the public domain.  In <i>Peck v United Kingdom</i> [2003]  36 EHRR 719, para 62  the court held that the release and publication of CCTV forage which showed the applicant in the process of attempting to commit suicide resulted in the moment being viewed to an extent that far exceeded any exposure to a passer-by or to security observation that he could have foreseen when he was in that street.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123.&nbsp;&nbsp;The same process of reasoning that led to the findings in <i>Peck</i> that the article 8 right had been violated and by the majority in <i>Aubry</i> that there had been an infringement of the claimant's right to respect for her private life can be applied here.  Miss Campbell could not have complained if the photographs had been taken to show the scene in the street by a passer-by and later published simply as street scenes.  But these were not just pictures of a street scene where she happened to be when the photographs were taken.  They were taken deliberately, in secret and with a view to their publication in conjunction with the article.  The zoom lens was directed at the doorway of the place where the meeting had been taking place.  The faces of others in the doorway were pixilated so as not to reveal their identity.  Hers was not, the photographs were published and her privacy was invaded.  The argument that the publication of the photograph added credibility to the story has little weight.  The photograph was not self-explanatory.  Neither the place nor the person were instantly recognisable.  The reader only had the editor's word as to the truth of these details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;124.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any person in Miss Campbell's position, assuming her to be of ordinary sensibilities but assuming also that she had been photographed surreptitiously outside the place where she been receiving therapy for drug addiction, would have known what they were and would have been distressed on seeing the photographs.  She would have seen their publication, in conjunction with the article which revealed what she had been doing when she was photographed and other details about her engagement in the therapy, as a gross interference with her right to respect for her private life.  In my opinion this additional element in the publication is more than enough to outweigh the right to freedom of expression which the defendants are asserting in this case.</p>

</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125.&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the weight that must be given to the right to freedom of expression that the press needs if it is to play its role effectively, I would hold that there was here an infringement of Miss Campbell's right to privacy that cannot be justified.  In my opinion publication of the third, fourth and fifth elements in the article (see para 88) was an invasion of that right for which she is entitled to damages.  I would allow the appeal and restore the orders that were made by the trial judge.</p>
THE BARONESS HALE OF RICHMOND
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;126.&nbsp;&nbsp;This case raises some big questions. How is the balance to be struck between everyone's right to respect for their private and family life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and everyone's right to freedom of expression, including the freedom to receive and impart information and ideas under Article 10? How do those rights come into play in a dispute between two private persons? But the parties are largely agreed about the answers to these. They disagree about where that balance is to be struck in the individual case. In particular, how far is a newspaper able to go in publishing what would otherwise be confidential information about a celebrity in order to set the record straight? And does it matter that the article was illustrated by a covertly taken photograph? </p>
