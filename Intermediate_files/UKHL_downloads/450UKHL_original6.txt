<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;163. That having been said, I think that a clear distinction can be drawn between questions of fact, such as the state of mind of IAC, and questions of law, such as whether IAC had a good title to the aircraft.  It would be wholly unrealistic to ignore Resolution 369 and its contextual importance as a matter of history.  But its effect in law raises a different issue, and it is to that issue only that the public policy objection relates.  Moreover the flexible approach to the double actionability rule which permits the lex loci delicti to be disapplied does not insist on its disapplication across the board.  It permits an approach which allows all the issues to be determined according to the lex loci delicti other than the one which gives rise to the objection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;164. The second problem raises a more fundamental point.  It goes to the heart of the much discussed question as to scope of the exception which permits flexibility.  As Lord Wilberforce said in <i>Boys v Chaplin</i> [1971]  AC 356, 391H, the general rule must apply unless clear and satisfying grounds are shown why it should be departed from.  Unless a rigorous approach to this question is adopted, the application of the exception is at risk of giving rise to much uncertainty and to the criticism alluded to in the Australian cases that it has become instinctive and arbitrary.  This requirement is preserved by section 12 of the 1995 Act.  It provides that the general rule in section 11 that the applicable law is the law of the country in which the events constituting the tort or delict in question occur may be displaced in favour of the law of another country, but it permit this only if "it is substantially more appropriate" for the law of the other country to be applied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;165. An objection to the law of a country other than the forum may be founded on grounds of public policy.  This fact is recognised by section 14(3)(a)(i) of the 1995 Act, which provides that nothing in Part III of the Act authorises the application of the law of a country outside the forum as the applicable law for determining issues arising in any claim in so far as to do so would conflict with principles of public policy.  But I do not think that it is enough, in the circumstances of this case, simply to assert that the law of the country where the events occurred conflicts with public policy in this country.  It all depends on the context and the nature of the objection on grounds of public policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;166. There is nothing in this case which connects the laws of this country with the events constituting the alleged tort, other than the fact that this is the country where the proceedings were brought.  As my noble and learned friend Lord Scott of Foscote has observed, this is an action in tort that has nothing whatever to do with England.  So I would have no difficulty in holding that, in a case of this kind, a principle of English public policy which was purely domestic or parochial in character would not provide clear and satisfying grounds for disapplying the primary rule which favours the lex loci delicti.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;167. But the public policy objection which is raised in this case is plainly not of that character.  It is based on the Charter of the United Nations and the resolutions which were made under it.  It is founded on a principle of public policy which places Resolution 369 firmly into its international context.  There is a clear point of contact between this part of the lex loci delicti and the breaches of international law to which our courts are entitled to decline to give effect on grounds of public policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;168. It is not just that recognition by our courts of this part of the lex loci delicti might be interpreted as an indirect recognition of the annexation, contrary to UN Resolution 662.  The whole basis upon which RCC Resolution 369 proceeded was the subject of universal international condemnation.  It was one of a series of acts which were performed in clear breach of international law.  I would hold therefore that, as the public policy objection is truly international in character, there is a sound basis in principle for severing this part of the lex loci delicti and disregarding entirely any legal effects which would be given under Iraqi law to the resolution which purported to vest the title to KAC's aircraft in IAC.</p>
<i><p><i>Other issues</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;169. I respectfully agree with what my noble and learned friend Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead has said on all the remaining issues raised in the appeal by IAC.  I agree, for the reasons which he has given, that the conduct of which KAC complains meets the requirements of the double actionability rule.  I also agree with what he has said about the issues raised in the appeal by KAC regarding the Mosul four and the Iran six.  I wish in particular to associate myself with what he has said about the tests for liability for consequential loss beyond that represented by the value of the goods in cases of conversion, and the distinction which he has drawn in that regard between those who have acted in good faith and those who have acted dishonestly.</p>
<i><p><i></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i>Conclusion</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;170. For the reasons given by my noble and learned friends Lord Nicholls and Lord Steyn, and for these further reasons, I would dismiss these appeals.</p>
<p><b>LORD SCOTT OF FOSCOTE</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;171. The facts relevant to this appeal and cross-appeal have been set out comprehensively in the judgments of Mance J and Aikens J in the High Court and in the judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered by Brooke LJ.  Facts of particular importance have been highlighted in the opinions of my noble and learned friends Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead Lord Steyn and Lord Hope of Craighead which I have had the opportunity of reading in draft.  These opinions identify the issues before the House and, if I may respectfully say so, express with clarity their conclusions, broadly concurring, on these issues.  To my regret there is one point, which I believe to be important, and another, less important, on which I have the misfortune to disagree.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;172. The main point, in summary, is this.  I am unable to accept that the double actionability rule is satisfied.  It is common ground that the conduct of IAC for which KAC are seeking a tortious remedy would not in fact have been actionable under Iraqi law.  Under RCC Resolution 369, a part of Iraqi law at the relevant time, IAC's conduct was lawful.  The disapprobation of Resolution 369, strongly expressed in the opinions of my noble and learned friends and from which I do not in the least dissent, does not in my opinion, for reasons that I will try to explain, justify treating as tortious under Iraqi law conduct that was in fact lawful under Iraqi law.</p>
<i><p>The factual background</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;173. There are two aspects of the factual background which are, in my opinion, of critical importance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;174. KAC's action for conversion of its aircraft is an action in tort.  But it is an action in tort which has nothing whatever to do with England save that England has made itself available as the forum for the litigation.  The conduct that constituted the conversion complained of was conduct that took place wholly in Iraq.  Other acts relevant to KAC's cause of action, eg the initial removal of the aircraft from Kuwait to Iraq, their detention in Iran, the payment by KAC to Iran of the $20 million, took place in Kuwait or in Iran.  None took place in England.  The defendant, IAC, is an Iraqi corporation.  It is a state owned corporation.  Its directors are Iraqi.  The claimant, KAC, is a Kuwaiti state owned corporation with Kuwaiti directors.  Each of the aircraft was registered in Kuwait.  England was, I repeat, no more than the forum for the litigation.  The cause of action sued on was, therefore, in no sense an English tort.  It was, as a matter of description, an Iraqi tort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;175. Second, over the whole of the period relevant to this litigation, Iraq was, and for that matter still is, under the control of a dictatorial regime.  IAC, although a state-owned corporation, possessed under Iraqi law independent corporate personality but had no alternative in relation to the KAC aircraft than to comply with Resolution 369.  At no stage, whether before or after 17 September 1990, when Resolution 369 came into effect, would it have been possible for IAC to have returned the aircraft to KAC.  The removal of the Iran six aircraft to Iran could not have been carried out otherwise than in accordance with directions from some arm of the Iraqi Government, probably the military, and pursuant to arrangements made at governmental level between Iraq and Iran.  This is the factual background against which IAC's liability in conversion must be assessed.</p>
<i><p>Double actionability</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;176. English case law has for a long time skirted around the question whether the concept of the proper law of a tort should play a part, and if so what part, in English private international law.  The legislature, by enacting Part III of the Private International Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1995, and in particular sections 11 and 12, has accepted and adopted that concept.  But Part III came into effect on 1 May 1996 (see SI 1996/995) and does not have retrospective effect.  It is English common law rules of private international law that must be applied to the question that arises in the present case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;177. A foreign action in personam, by which I mean an action in personam that derives its existence from some foreign system of law, can be sued on in England provided that the writ or other originating process can be served on the defendant (see <i>Dicey and Morris, Conflicts of Laws</i> 12th ed (1993), Rule 22).  So, an action on a foreign contract governed by some foreign law can be sued on in England.  Actions of this sort are commonplace in the Commercial Court.  Less common but quite possible is an action by a beneficiary under a foreign trust seeking some form of in personam relief against the foreign trustees (<i>Ewing v Orr Ewing</i> (1883) 9 App Cas 34 and <i>Chellaram v Chellaram</i> [1985] Ch 409).  These trust actions, too, can be brought in England provided the trustees can be served, and subject always to forum non conveniens arguments.  In none of these examples of in personam actions sued on in England does English law require that the matter complained of, breach of contract or breach of trust as the case may be, be actionable under English law as well as actionable under the applicable foreign law.  But, of course, unless the matter complained of were actionable under the applicable foreign law there would be no action to sue on in England.  A cause of action would not have come into existence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;178. This simple approach has not been adopted in tort cases.  Where the cause of action has resulted from allegedly tortious conduct in a foreign country, it is not clear from the English case law whether the cause of action is to be regarded as an English tort a condition of actionability of which is that it be actionable also under the law of the foreign country, or as a foreign tort for which a remedy will not be given in England unless the conduct, if done in England, would have been actionable under English law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;179. In many of the decided cases, there is to be found a substantial factual connection with England.  Language that appears to treat the case as falling within the former category is, therefore, not surprising.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;180. In <i>The Halley</i> (1868)  LR 2 PC 193 a British ship had been involved in a collision in Belgian waters.  The collision was due to the negligence of the pilot whom the shipowners had been compelled by Belgian law to employ.  Under English law they would not have been vicariously liable for his negligence.  Under Belgian law they were liable.  Selwyn LJ, giving the judgment of the Board appears to have treated the cause of action sued on as a Belgian cause of action.  He said, at p 202:</p>
<p></p><ul>"the liability of the appellants, and the right of the respondents to recover damages from them, as the owners of the <i>Halley</i>, if such liability or right exists in the present case, must be the creature of the Belgian law . . . ."<p></p></ul>
<p>He then posed the question</p>
<p></p><ul>"whether an English court of justice is bound to apply and enforce that law in a case, when, according to its own principles, no wrong has been committed by the defendants, and no right of action against them exists."<p></p></ul>
<p>He answered his question in the negative, at pp 203-204:</p>
<p></p><ul>"the English court admits the proof of the foreign law . . . as one of the facts upon which the existence of the tort, or the right to damages, may depend, and it then applies and enforces its own law so far as it is applicable to the case thus established; but it is . . . alike contrary to principle and authority to hold that an English court of justice will enforce a foreign municipal law, and will give a remedy in the shape of damages in respect of an act which, according to its own principles, imposes no liability on the person from whom the damages are claimed." <p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;181. The language of the passage first cited seems to place the case firmly in the second of the two categories to which I have referred.  The cause of action was a Belgian cause of action but it could not be sued on in England if, under English law, no liability on the defendant would result from the conduct complained of.  But the third of the cited passages seems to treat the cause of action as an English tort and as falling in the first of the two categories</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;182. In <i>Phillips v Eyre</i> (1869) LR 4 QB 225 and (1870) LR 6 QB 1 the plaintiff's cause of action was treated as a Jamaican tort.  There was a defence available to the defendant under Jamaican law, so the plaintiff could not succeed in his action in England.  The facts of the case are too well known to need lengthy repetition.  The defendant, while Governor of Jamaica, had imprisoned the plaintiff and subjected him to a number of serious assaults.  The plaintiff brought an action in England for false imprisonment and assault.  The defendant pleaded that an after-the-event Act of Indemnity, relieving him of liability for the tort, had been passed by the Jamaican legislature.  The issue was whether this plea was good.  Both the Court of Queen's Bench and, on a writ of error, the Exchequer Chamber held that it was.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;183. The judgment of Queen's Bench was delivered by Cockburn CJ.  He tested his conclusion by supposing that the Act of Indemnity had preceded the acts which had given rise to the action.  He said, at p 239:</p>
<p></p><ul>"We cannot doubt that in such a case no right of action would arise here.  It appears to us clear that where by the law of another country an act complained of is lawful, such act, though it would have been wrongful by our law if committed here, cannot be made the ground of an action in an English court."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judgment in Exchequer Chamber given by Willes J was to the same effect, at p 28:</p>
<p></p><ul>"A right of action, whether it arise from contract governed by the law of the place or wrong, is equally the creature of the law of the place and subordinate thereto . . . . [T]he civil liability arising out of a wrong derives its birth from the law of the place, and its character is determined by that law."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These passages treat the plaintiff's cause of action as a Jamaican cause of action.  The Act of Indemnity, a part of Jamaican law, barred the action; so there was no cause of action on which the plaintiff could sue in England.  The Act of Indemnity had been enacted after the events of which the plaintiff complained had taken place.  So the Act had divested the plaintiff of a pre-existing cause of action.  But Willes J's analysis of what the situation would have been if the Act of Indemnity had preceded the false imprisonment and the assaults is instructive.  In that event no cause of action could have come into existence.  He refers to tortious civil liability as deriving its "birth" from the law of the place where the tort was committed.  This analysis is important.  Every tortious cause of action must derive its existence, its birth, from some system of law.  In <i>Phillips v Eyre </i>that system of law was Jamaican law.  To much the same effect are dicta in some of the older cases that were cited in <i>Phillips v Eyre</i> (see <i>R v Lesley </i>(1869) Bell CC 220 and <i>Dobree v Napier</i> (1836) 2 Bing NC 781cited at 1 LR 4 QB 225, 240-241).</p>
184. <i></i><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carr v Fracis Times &amp; Co </i> [1902]  AC 176 was, like the present, a conversion case.  British goods on board a British ship had been seized in Muscat waters by a British subject acting under the authority of a proclamation issued by the Sultan of Muscat.  An action for conversion of the goods was brought in England against the British subject who had seized them.  The trial judge entered judgment for the defendant but the Court of Appeal reversed the decision.  This House, approving and following <i>Phillips v Eyre</i>, allowed the appeal.  Lord Halsbury LC, in the course of argument, put to the counsel for the respondent "the case of a black before the Emancipation Act bringing an action in this country because his liberty had been restrained in Jamaica" (see p 178).  Counsel accepted that no such action would lie.  Lord Halsbury posed the question "Why" and answered it, at p 179:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Because the thing done, though contrary to our English law, was, according to the law of Jamaica at that time, a lawful act, and therefore no complaint in respect of the supposed tort committed in Jamaica could have been made a subject of action in this country."<p></p></ul>
<p>Lord Halsbury made it clear, at p 189, that the declaration of the Sultan of Muscat that had authorised the seizure of the goods was determinative of the legality of the seizure under Muscat law:</p>
<p></p><ul>"[The Sultan] has authorised it and declared authoritatively that it was a perfectly lawful act according to the law of Muscat, and I am of  opinion that no English tribunal is capable of going behind that declaration and saying that the Sultan of Muscat was wrong in his exposition of his own law . . . . [I]t appears to me that any other decision would be open to very serious questions of policy if, in every case where the lord of a country has declared what the law of his own country is, it were open to an English tribunal to enter into the question and to determine, as against him, what was the law of his country."<p></p></ul>
185. <i></i><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carr v Fracis Times &amp; Co, </i>like <i>Phillips v Eyre,</i> treated the cause of action sued on in England as a foreign cause of action.  Where a foreign cause of action is concerned the double actionability rule never comes into play unless the cause of action is actionable under the foreign law.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;186. In <i>Machado v Fontes</i> [1897]  2 QB 231 an action for libel was brought in England in respect of a pamphlet published in Brazil.  The defendant filed a defence denying the libel but later applied for leave to amend his defence by adding a plea that publication of the pamphlet did not give rise to any civil liability for damages under Brazilian law.  The Court of Appeal held that the plea was bad.  The publication of the libellous pamphlet was a criminal offence in Brazil and, accordingly, unjustifiable under Brazilian law.  That was enough to sustain the civil action for damages in England.  The libel did not need to be actionable in a civil suit in Brazil.  In so finding the Court of Appeal was treating the case as falling within the first of the two categories to which I referred, that is to say, as an English tort with a condition of actionability in England dependant on the foreign law.  The decision of the Court of Appeal was, however, overruled by a majority in this House in <i>Boys v Chaplin</i> [1971]  AC 357. </p>
<i>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;187. In <i>Boys v Chaplin</i> the cause of action sued on was, save that the car accident which gave rise to the action took place in Malta, in all respects an English tort.  Both plaintiff and defendant were British subjects serving in the British armed forces and, although normally resident in England, were stationed temporarily in Malta.  The car accident in Malta had been caused by the defendant's negligence.  The plaintiff sued in England for damages.  The issue was whether general damages, for pain and suffering, loss of amenities etc, which were available under the law of England but not under the law of Malta, could be awarded.  The trial judge applied English law to the issue, the Court of Appeal affirmed his decision and this House dismissed the appeal.  In doing so the members of the Appellate Committee expressed, in somewhat differing terms, views about the double actionability rule.  A majority of their Lordships concluded that <i>Machado v Fontes</i> [1897] 2 QB 231 had been wrongly decided.  The double actionability rule required, they held, that the allegedly tortious act be actionable in civil proceedings under the law of the foreign country where the act had been done.  But the rule, they thought, was not an inflexible one.  Both Lord Hodson and Lord Wilberforce advocated the use of flexibility in applying the rule: see pp 377 and 391-392.  The flexibility they had in mind, however, was a flexibility that would enable the court to apply English law, the lex fori, rather than the lex loci delicti to a discrete issue in a case where the only significant connection between the action and the foreign country was that the allegedly tortious act on which the action was based had taken place in the foreign country.   It may be that they would, if the "only significant connection" criterion were satisfied, have allowed the lex fori rather than the lex loci delicti to be applied to the case as a whole:  nb Lord Hodson's approving reference, at p 377, to the dictum of Wightman J in <i>Scott v Seymour</i> (1862)  1 H&amp;C 219, 235 and Lord Wilberforce's remarks, at pp 391E - 392E.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;188. There was nothing, however, in either Lord Hodson's speech or Lord Wilberforce's speech, or in the other <i>Boys v Chaplin</i> speeches, which suggested that, in a case where the only connection with England was that the action had been brought in England, the advocated flexibility could enable the court to waive the requirement that the allegedly tortious act be such as to give rise to civil actionability under the law of the country where the act was done, still less where that country was in every significant respect the country of the tort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;189. In <i>Red Sea Insurance Co Ltd v Bouygues SA</i> [1995]  1 AC 190 my noble and learned friend Lord Slynn of Hadley, giving the judgment of the Privy Council, held that, conceptually at least, the flexibility advocated in <i>Boys v Chaplin</i> [1973] AC 357 might justify the exclusive application of the lex loci delicti, so that a tortious remedy might be allowed notwithstanding that the lex fori would not have allowed any remedy.  Lord Slynn accepted that the doctrine of the proper law of the tort had not become part of English law but he did not regard the introduction of flexibility into the double-actionability rule as inconsistent with the rejection of that doctrine.  He said, at p 206, that:</p>
<p></p><ul>"[Their Lordships] accept that the law of England recognises that a particular issue between the parties to litigation may be governed by the law of the country which, with respect to that issue, has the most significant relationship with the occurrence and with the parties."<p></p></ul>
<i></i><p><i>Boys v Chaplin</i> had concerned merely a discrete issue to which, it was held, the lex fori could be applied to the exclusion of the lex loci delicti.  In the <i>Red Sea Insurance</i> case it was the whole case to which, conceptually, Lord Slynn held the lex loci delicti could be applied to the exclusion of the lex fori.  The same criterion, however, "the most significant relationship with the occurrence and with the parties" would be applicable.  For my part I can discern no difference between this approach and a "proper law of the tort" approach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;190. However, the flexibility advocated in <i>Boys v Chaplin</i> [1971] AC 357 and accepted and extended by Lord Slynn in the <i>Red Sea Insurance</i> case [1995] 1 AC 190 cannot, in my opinion, assist KAC in the present case.  What is proposed here is not that the law of the country with the most significant relationship etc should be applied but that the law of that country should be disapplied.  It is Iraq with which KAC'S case against IAC has the most significant relationship.  It is an Iraqi tort that KAC is prosecuting, not an English tort.  The flexibility advocated in <i>Boys v Chaplin</i> and the <i>Red Sea Insurance</i> case cannot, in my opinion, possibly justify treating this action for conversion of the KAC aircraft as if it were a tort governed by English law, or justify the waiving of the requirement of civil actionability under Iraqi law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;191. The justification for waiving the requirement of civil actionability under Iraqi law has been based on what are said to be the requirements of international law and of English public policy.  The international law imperatives produced by the United Nations Security Council response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, described in the opinions of my noble and learned friends, require that the courts of this country give no recognition to Resolution 369.  It is argued that since, absent Resolution 369, title to the aircraft would have remained vested in KAC, the question of IAC's liability for conversion under Iraqi law should be examined and answered on the footing that KAC remained owners of the aircraft and that Resolution 369 did not form part of the corpus of Iraqi law.  It is argued that obedience to the various United Nations Resolutions and, in particular, Resolution 662 requires no less.  As to public policy, it is argued that, having regard to the flagrant breach of international law that Iraq's invasion of Kuwait undoubtedly constituted, it would be contrary to public policy if any recognition were to be given to Iraq's confiscation of the KAC aircraft or to Resolution 369.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;192. I am in respectful agreement with much of the premise on which these international law and public policy arguments are based.  I agree that English courts ought not to recognise Iraq's confiscation of the aircraft nor the dissolution of KAC nor the purported vesting of the aircraft in IAC.  If any of the aircraft had found their way to England, or to any other United Nations member state prepared to comply with United Nations Resolution 662, KAC could have successfully asserted title to the aircraft.  I agree that in the eyes of the courts of this country, KAC remained the owners of the aircraft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;193. The present action, however, is not an action in rem to recover property, whether the aircraft or the proceeds of sale of the aircraft, which belongs to KAC.  The action is an action in personam for tort.  Willes J in <i>Phillips v Eyre</i> referred to the law of the place from which the "wrong derives its birth" (see LR 6 QB 1, 28).  From what system of law does KAC's action for conversion derive its birth?  Certainly not from English law.  It can only be the law of Iraq.  The law of Iraq at the relevant time included Resolution 369.  It is an unquestionable fact that under the law of Iraq at the relevant time IAC's conduct in relation to the aircraft was lawful and did not give rise to any civil liability.  A cause of action in personam under Iraqi law did not come into existence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;194. This conclusion does not depend on the vesting of the aircraft in IAC under Resolution 369.  If Resolution 369 had never been passed but, instead, there had been an enactment in Iraq excluding any civil or criminal liability arising out of any dealings in Iraq with Kuwait's assets, the conclusion would be the same.  In that event, too, a cause of action against IAC for conversion of the KAC aircraft could not have come into existence under the law of Iraq.</p>
