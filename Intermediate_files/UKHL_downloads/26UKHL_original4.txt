<p class="para">69.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr E was an untreatable psychopath, sentenced to imprisonment for offences of violence and in addition made subject to an order under the Norwegian Penal Code allowing the Ministry of Justice to impose a form of preventive detention for a specified maximum period.  At para 51 of its judgment (p 51) the court noted that such measures were “to be terminated when they are no longer regarded as necessary, but may be resumed if there is reason to do so", and at para 52 continued:</p>
<p class="qt">“[T]he Ministry of Justice has a wide discretion in deciding which security measure is to be imposed and for how long.  In fact, this system shares a number of features with the Belgian system in regard to recidivists and habitual offenders which was at issue in the <i>Van Droogenbroeck </i>case.  Under such systems the courts cannot at the time of their decisions do more than assess how the person concerned will develop in the future.  The authorities, on the other hand, through and with the assistance of their officers, can monitor that development more closely and at frequent intervals.”</p>
<p class="para">It was held, at para 53, that article 5(4) required a court periodically to determine “whether the Ministry of Justice was entitled to hold that detention remained consistent with the object and purpose . . . of the Penal Code".</p>
<p class="para">70.&nbsp;&nbsp;A further Strasbourg decision relied on by Mr Owen, <i>Gebura v Poland</i> (Application No 63131/00) (unreported) 6 March 2007, I find unhelpful.  It decides no more than that, once a final right to conditional release has been established, the prisoner can no longer be lawfully detained.  The position there was as if, under UK law, the Secretary of State had actually granted parole, or the prisoner had reached the two-thirds point in his sentence when he became automatically entitled to parole.  Manifestly <i>habeas corpus</i> would go to free any prisoner detained beyond such time.  Small wonder that the ECtHR said, at para 32,  that Mr Gebura’s “continued detention following the final decision on his conditional release cannot be considered ‘lawful’ under article 5(1)(a).”  Article 5(4) simply never came into it. </p>
<p class="hditl">The English case law</p>
<p class="para">71.&nbsp;&nbsp;Three cases in your Lordships’ House call for particular mention although, as I shall explain, none of them to my mind is to be regarded as decisive of the issue now before the House.  <i>R (Giles) v Parole Board</i> [2004]  1 AC 1 (just as the application to the Commission in <i>Mansell</i>—see para 67 above) concerned a longer than commensurate sentence of seven years imprisonment imposed under section 2(2)(b) of the 1991 Act in respect of which it was unsuccessfully argued that the prisoner was entitled to an article 5(4) compliant decision upon his case as soon as he had served the part of his sentence imposed as punishment (ie the commensurate part).  Following that, his argument ran, he was entitled to the substantive and procedural rights enjoyed by a post-tariff discretionary life prisoner.  In rejecting the argument, Lord Bingham of Cornhill said (para 10) that the “primary target” of article 5(4) “is deprivation of liberty which is arbitrary, or directed or controlled by the executive” but that a section 2(2)(b) sentence “left nothing to the executive, since the Parole Board, whose duty it is to consider release at the halfway stage of the sentence, is accepted to be a judicial body.”  Arguably implicit in that, submits Mr Owen, is that once the halfway stage <i>is</i> arrived at, article 5(4) is engaged (why otherwise would the Board’s status as a judicial body have been relevant?) and that the case decides only that it is engaged no earlier in a section 2(2)(b) case.  As against that, Mr Pannick points to a number of dicta in the speeches which appear to accept the correctness of the Commission’s decision approach in <i>Mansell</i> and to suggest, consistently with the repeated statements of the Strasbourg Court, that article 5(4) can have no part to play in a determinate sentence case once sentence is passed.  As Lord Hope of Craighead put it at para 26 (p 25):</p>
<p class="qt">“The general rule, as I have said, is that detention in accordance with a determinate sentence imposed by a court is regarded as justified under article 5(1)(a) without the need for any further reviews of the detention to be carried out under article 5(4).  The question which [counsel] has raised is whether that rule, which undoubtedly applies to determinate sentences imposed under subsection (2)(a), can be applied also to determinate sentences imposed under subsection (2)(b).”</p>
<p class="para">72.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>R (West) v Parole Board</i> [2005]  1 WLR 350 concerned the application of article 5(4) to the process of recalling to prison two determinate sentence prisoners previously released on licence.  It had been held by a majority in the Court of Appeal in <i>West</i> that the criminal limb of article 6 had no application to a revocation hearing by the Parole Board (no article 5 argument having been advanced), and subsequently by the Court of Appeal in <i>R (Smith) v Parole Board (No 2) </i>(conjoined with West on appeal to the House of Lords) that neither article 5 nor the civil limb of article 6 applied to such a hearing.  Following these decisions and before the appeals came before the House, the ECtHR in <i>Brown v United Kingdom</i>, 26 October 2004) held inadmissible an application based on article 5 brought by a prisoner released from a determinate sentence and later recalled for breach of his licence conditions precisely as <i>West</i> and <i>Smith</i> had been.  Rejecting the article 5(1) complaint the court said:</p>
<p class="qt">“Discretionary and mandatory lifers, after the expiry of the punitive element of their sentence, are detained on the basis of risk—the justification for their continued detention is whether it is safe for the public for them to live in the community once more.  Similarly, the recall of restricted patients is based on factors arising from their mental health.  The applicant however has been sentenced to a fixed prison term by a court as the punishment for his offence.  The lawfulness of his detention does not depend, in Convention law terms, on whether or not he ceases to be at risk of re-offending.  The fact that the applicant before the end of the sentence may expect to be released on licence does not affect this analysis.  When such a prisoner is recalled his detention is again governed by the fixed term imposed by the judge conforming with the objectives of that sentence and thus within the scope of article 5(1)(a) of the Convention.”</p>
<p class="para">Rejecting also the article 5(4) complaint, the court said:</p>
<p class="qt">“The court recalls that where an applicant is convicted and sentenced by a competent court to a determinate term of imprisonment for the purposes of punishment, the review of the lawfulness of detention is incorporated in the trial and appeal procedures (see, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, <i>V  v  United Kingdom</i>; <i>Stafford v United Kingdom </i>[references omitted]).  No new issues of lawfulness concerning the basis of the present applicant’s detention arose on recall and no right to a fresh review of the lawfulness of his detention arose for the purposes of article 5(4) of the Convention.”</p>
<p class="para">Brown’s application was held to be manifestly ill-founded and was rejected.</p>
<p class="para">73.&nbsp;&nbsp;The central complaint made by <i>West</i> and <i>Smith</i> was that the Parole Board had failed to allow them an oral hearing when deciding whether or not to recommend them for re-release after their recall (any such recommendation by the Board being binding on the Secretary of State).  In seeking to resist their appeals the Board naturally placed considerable reliance upon Strasbourg’s rejection of Brown’s case. The House nevertheless allowed the appeals, having regard both to the common law duty of procedural fairness and to article 5(4).  Lord Bingham referred to <i>Brown</i> (and <i>Ganusauskas</i>) in that part of his opinion which rejected the appellant’s case under article 5(1) but not in his discussion of the article 5(4) argument.  Rather in that connection he made no mention of <i>Brown</i> but referred instead to the Strasbourg decisions in <i>Van Droogenbroeck;  Weeks; Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell;</i> and <i>E v Norway</i> before concluding (at para 37):</p>
<p class="qt">“Convention jurisprudence establishes that the judicial review of the lawfulness of detention must be wide enough to bear on those conditions which, under the Convention, are essential for the lawful detention of a person in the situation of the particular detainee.”</p>
<p class="para">Plainly, however, that decision was reached in the very specific context of the recall to prison of prisoners released on licence for breach of their licence conditions. (In each case the appellant had in fact been released automatically after serving the requisite proportion of his sentence and thus, as Lord Bingham pointed out at para 30, had “a statutory right to be free".  Although, however, Lord Bingham described this as “noteworthy", I do not myself understand the opinions as a whole to suggest that article 5(4) would call for any different conclusion in the case of those recalled after discretionary, rather than automatic, release on licence.) </p>
<p class="para">74.&nbsp;&nbsp;Inescapably it follows from <i>West</i> that contrary to the view expressed in the Strasbourg Court’s admissibility decision in <i>Brown</i>,<i> </i>a prisoner’s recall for breach of his licence conditions <i>does</i> raise, “new issues affecting the lawfulness of the detention” such as to engage article 5(4).  And that seems to me clearly correct: it would not be lawful to recall a prisoner unless he <i>had </i>breached his licence conditions and there could well be an issue as to this.  I wonder, indeed, if the ECtHR would have decided <i>Brown</i> as they did had it followed, rather than preceded, the House’s decision in <i>West</i>.  Be that as it may, recall cases certainly so far as domestic law goes, are to be treated as akin both to lifer cases in the post-tariff period and to the <i>Van Droogenbroeck</i>-type of case where, upon the expiry of the sentence, a prisoner is subjected to an executive power of preventive detention.  And all these cases, submits Mr Owen, weaken the Secretary of State’s contention that there exists a core principle of Convention law that article 5(4) cannot be engaged during the term of a determinate sentence.  That said, however, there are passages in Lord Bingham’s speech in <i>West</i> clearly <i>un</i>helpful to Mr Owen’s argument, emphasising as they do the essentially punitive purpose of a determinate sentence—see in particular para 22 (“the predominant purpose of the sentence will be punitive and the sentence which the court imposes will represent the period which the court considers that the defendant should spend in custody as punishment for the crime or crimes of which he has been convicted”) and para 40 (“the primary purpose of [a determinate] sentence is punitive”).</p>
<p class="para">75.&nbsp;&nbsp;The third House of Lords decision to which I must refer is <i>R (Clift) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</i> [2007] 1 AC 484 where the appellant, just as Mr Black in the present case, was a prisoner serving a longer than 15 year (there an 18 year) determinate sentence who was refused parole by the Secretary of State notwithstanding a positive recommendation by the Board.  When advancing the challenge on behalf of Mr Clift, Mr Owen had submitted, not that article 5(4) is directly engaged with regard to the parole process in such cases, but only that the Secretary of State’s part in it violates article 14 of the Convention read with article 5.  The argument was that, compared to life sentence prisoners and those serving less than 15 year sentences, those serving 15 years or more are discriminated against under the early release regime.</p>
<p class="para">76.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the appeal in <i>Clift</i> failed—because those serving sentences of any particular length cannot be regarded as having the necessary “status” for article 14 purposes—the House made very clear its view that the Secretary of State’s continuing discretion in the case of 15 year and longer sentences cannot be objectively justified.  Lord Bingham (para 33) described this as “an indefensible anomaly” since “it had by [2002] come to be recognised that assessment of the risk presented by any individual prisoner, in the application of publicly promulgated criteria, was a task with no political content and one to which the Secretary of State could not (and did not claim to) bring any superior expertise.”  I myself pointed out (para 68) that since 2002 it had become more starkly anomalous still having regard to the 2003 Act (see para 65 above), and added that “it is difficult to see why the Secretary of State would wish to perpetuate it".  The subsequent enactment of the 2008 Act to my mind leaves the problem still unresolved albeit in respect of fewer prisoners.</p>
<p class="para">77.&nbsp;&nbsp;It by no means follows, however, that on a true view of the Convention, article 5(4) has always been directly engaged whenever a determinate sentence prisoner reaches his parole eligibility date and that this has simply been overlooked, or the law misunderstood, whilst cases such as <i>West</i> and <i>Clift</i> were being litigated. (If, of course, Mr Owen is right in his present argument, <i>Clift’s</i> challenge should have succeeded and <i>West’s</i> success would have been <i>a fortiori</i> rather than have depended upon his recall to prison.)  Indeed, so far from the House’s criticism in <i>Clift</i> of the Secretary of State’s continuing discretion supporting Mr Owen’s article 5(4) argument, there are again passages in the opinions appearing to undermine it.  Consider, for example, this from para 16 of Lord Bingham’s speech:</p>
<p class="qt">“I would agree that the sentences passed on the respective appellants satisfied article 5(1)(a) and provided lawful authority for the detention of the appellants until such time as, under domestic law, their detention became unlawful.  <i>Giles</i> [2004] 1 AC 1 established that a prisoner sentenced to a determinate term of years cannot seek to be released at any earlier time than that for which domestic law provides.  During the currency of a lawful sentence, article 5(4) has no part to play.”</p>
<p class="para">But immediately thereafter Lord Bingham recognised: </p>
<p class="qt">“both the importance, in our system, of the statutory rules providing for early release and the close relationship between those rules and the core value which article 5 exists to protect.”</p>
<p class="para">And there is an echo of that at para 66 of my own opinion:</p>
<p class="qt">“. . . the core value protected by article 5 is liberty and, where the penal system includes a parole scheme, liberty is dependent no less upon the non-discriminatory operation of that than on a fair sentencing process in the first place.”</p>
<i><p class="qt">Considerations and conclusions</p></i>
<p class="para">78.&nbsp;&nbsp;As already noted, the focus of Mr Owen’s argument in <i>Clift</i> was on article 14 discrimination rather than the direct application of article 5(4).  Given, however, the critical part played by the parole scheme in determining how long a determinate sentence prisoner will in fact  remain in custody, it is not difficult to suggest an equal need to operate that scheme judicially as to have a proper initial sentencing process.</p>
<p class="para">79.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor is it difficult to recognise the force of the suggested close analogy between the position of lifers and that of long-term determinate sentence prisoners with regard to release on licence.  Assume two defendants convicted of an identical crime, one sentenced to a determinate term of 14 years imprisonment, the other (because the judge feels unable to assess his future dangerousness) to a discretionary life sentence with an order pursuant to section 82A of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 (as inserted by section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000) that the “early release provisions” should apply to him after seven years (half the appropriate notional determinate sentence as routinely now specified under section 82A following <i>R v Szczerba</i> [2002]  2 Crim App Rep (S) 387).  The latter, all agree, is entitled at the seven year point to an article 5(4) compliant decision by the Parole Board which, if favouring release, binds the Secretary of State.  Why should that not be so too in the case of the 14 year prisoner who also becomes eligible for parole at the seven year point?  Is there not otherwise, as Waller LJ suggested in <i>Johnson </i>[1997] 1 WLR 1990, para 28, an “evident incongruity” between the two cases?  Is there not perhaps this further incongruity too: the Secretary of State’s directions to the Parole Board regarding the release of lifers stipulate as the test “the level of risk to life and limb"( Directions to the Parole Board under section 32(6) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991. Issued August 2004); the equivalent directions as to  determinate sentence prisoners require the Board to “consider primarily the risk to the public of a further offence [not necessarily of violence] being committed at a time when the prisoner would otherwise be in prison,” seemingly a more demanding test for the prisoner to satisfy. (Directions to the Parole Board under section 32(6) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991. Issued May 2004.)  Considerations such as these to my mind represent the strength of Mr Owen’s case.  But as I shall come to explain it has its weaknesses too.</p>
<p class="para">80.&nbsp;&nbsp;The core reasoning in the Court of Appeal’s decision in the present case [2008] 3 WLR 845 appears at para 17 of Latham LJ’s leading judgment: </p>
<p class="qt">“[Section 35] leaves the decision as to release in the hands of the executive, and is therefore capable of being applied arbitrarily which is the mischief at which article 5(4) of the Convention is directed.”</p>
<p class="para">That mirrored the views earlier and more fully expressed by the learned Lord Justice in <i>O'Connell</i> [2008] 1 WLR 979, at para 14:</p>
<p class="qt">“It seems to me . . . that the question as to whether or not article 5(4) is engaged is not answered by any formal analysis of the original order of the court in cases such as the present.  The question is whether, bearing in mind its purpose, namely to prevent arbitrariness, it has a function to perform in the particular circumstances of the case in question.  In the present case, the decision as to whether or not to direct release is critical to the claimant’s entitlement to release after he has served one half of the custodial period.  That decision is capable of being an arbitrary decision unless controlled by a mechanism which is article 5(4) compliant.  In other words there is a clear purpose to be served by the article in this context, in exactly the same way as it has a function to perform in the case of indeterminate sentences.”</p>
<p class="para">That in turn reflected Waller LJ’s approach in <i>Johnson</i> [2007] 1 WLR 1990, para 29 that article 5(4) applies in these cases “because there is a risk, unless the sentence is kept under review, of [the] sentence becoming arbitrary".</p>
<p class="para">81.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cogently though these judgments are reasoned, and broadly sympathetic though I am to the conclusions they arrive at, I have finally come to regard them as mistaken.  In the end they seem to me to involve widening the reach of article 5(4) beyond its proper limits, certainly beyond its hitherto recognised scope.  Article 5(4) cannot be held to apply merely because it would be useful if it did—because “it has a function to perform", “a clear purpose to be served” (<i>O'Connell</i> [2008] 1 WLR 979, para 14).  There is suggested to be a risk of arbitrariness in the operation of the parole system if the Secretary of State can overrule the Parole Board on the question of risk.  But the Secretary of State’s decision is, of course, judicially reviewable and, if found arbitrary or irrational, it will be struck down.  There was, indeed, an irrationality challenge in this very case but it failed before the judge and permission to appeal was refused in respect of it.  There is nothing intrinsically objectionable (certainly in Convention terms) in allowing the executive, subject to judicial review, to take the parole decision, notwithstanding that it involves rejecting another body’s recommendation.  In one sense it may be said to be putting the cart before the horse.  And, as we said in <i>Clift</i>, it is indefensibly anomalous.  But it is not contrary to article 5(4). </p>
<p class="para">82.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no need for the Parole Board to have been involved in the process at all: a state could perfectly lawfully, and consistently with the Convention, leave the entire question of release, whether absolutely or on licence, and whether throughout the sentence or only after a given period, solely to the executive.  Does then the fact that the UK has chosen to give the Parole Board a role in the process and statutory directions as to how to approach that role, and has chosen to fix precisely the period within a determinate sentence during which the prisoner is to be considered for parole (the period before which he cannot be released and after which he must be released), mean that article 5(4) is necessarily thereby engaged so that the Board’s decision must be final?</p>
<p class="para">83.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my judgment not.  The essential contrast struck by the ECtHR is between on the one hand “the administrative implementation of the sentence of the court", for example decisions regarding “early or conditional release from a determinate term of imprisonment” (para 87 of the court’s judgment in <i>Stafford</i> 35 EHRR 1121 set out at para 67 above), and on the other hand “fixing the tariff” and later determining the length of post-tariff detention in life sentence cases. The administrative implementation of determinate sentences does not engage article 5(4); the decision when to release a prisoner subject to an indeterminate sentence does.</p>
<p class="para">84.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cases such as <i>Van Droogenbroeck</i> 4 EHRR 443 and <i>E v Norway</i> 17 EHRR 30 to my mind  ultimately weaken, not strengthen, the respondent’s argument.  As the court observed in <i>Van Droogenbroeck</i> (see para 68 above), the detention provided for there was “striking for its relatively indeterminate character”—analogous therefore to a life sentence case and “fundamentally different from” a determinate sentence case when  considering the impact of article 5 on decisions whether or not to release.  In the final analysis, it seems to me one thing to say that “new issues affecting the lawfulness of the detention” (Strasbourg’s core and oft repeated touchstone for determining when article 5(4) is engaged) arise when assessing dangerousness in the post-tariff period of a life sentence (there being otherwise no finite end to a term which, everyone agrees, in the great majority of cases was never meant to last for life); quite another to apply the same approach to the release of determinate sentence prisoners.</p>
<p class="para">85.&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly nothing in the Strasbourg jurisprudence affords any support for Mr Owen’s contention that the two categories should be assimilated and, even were I to conclude that the ECtHR might now be prepared, notwithstanding its earlier dicta and admissibility decisions on the point, to extend the reach of article 5(4) to encompass also determinate sentence prisoners once they become eligible for parole, I would feel bound, consistently with the approach dictated by <i>R (Ullah) v Special Adjudicator</i> [2004] 2 AC 323, 350, para 20 (and the many subsequent endorsements of that approach), to leave any such development to the ECtHR itself.</p>
<p class="hditl">Result</p>
<p class="para">86.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the result I would allow the Secretary of State’s appeal, set aside the Court of Appeal’s declaration of incompatibility, and restore the order of Kenneth Parker QC, sitting as a deputy High Court judge in the Administrative Court, dismissing the respondent’s judicial review application.</p>
