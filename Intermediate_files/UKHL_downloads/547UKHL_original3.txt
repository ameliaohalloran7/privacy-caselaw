<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;58. I would reject the first of these three arguments on the ground that it was based on a misunderstanding of the requirements of the tort.  The claimants' case on the pleadings is that at each stage in the history the Bank knew that the likely consequences were that depositors and potential depositors would suffer losses, wilfully disregarded the risk of the consequences or was recklessly indifferent to the consequences: new draft particulars, paragraphs 31 - 35.  Knowledge that the depositors were likely to suffer loss is averred. But the claimants are also offering in the alternative to prove reckless indifference to the risk of loss.  As I have already said (in section (2)) I do not think that it is necessary for present purposes to choose between the various phrases that may be used to describe the nature or degree of the risk.  This would be to raise issues of fact and degree that are best considered at trial.  It was not suggested that, if there was a case to be made on knowledge of probable loss, the pleading as to recklessness should be struck out at this stage.  The Bank's position, as explained in its written case, is that it will not be possible to identify with precision which allegations should be struck out until the parties have seen your Lordships' judgment and that for the time being this exercise is premature.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;59. Mr Stadlen said that the essential difference between the parties on this part of the case at this stage is on the question whether knowledge, belief or suspicion of probable loss has to be established where the allegation is that the act or omission was done or made recklessly.  He accepted that an allegation of knowledge that loss was "likely" was, in effect, the same as an allegation that it was "probable".  He also accepted that the words used in the new draft particulars to describe the tort, although not precisely the same as those used in your Lordships' judgment, were formulated with sufficient accuracy.  But he maintained that the material referred to in the particulars did not support an allegation of knowledge, belief or suspicion of likely or probable loss.  He said that none of this material came near to meeting that test, and that there was no indication in the Bingham report that material which would do so was available.  At best it supported an allegation of knowledge that there was a risk of loss.  But this was not enough to satisfy the test of knowledge that loss was probable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60. As I have already said more than once, I do not think that it is appropriate at this stage to attempt to define the required state of mind more precisely.  This is a matter which is so bound up with the facts that it is best left until trial.  It is a question of fact and degree.  The greater the risk of loss the easier it is likely to be to say that loss was probable and the easier it will be to find that where that risk was known, believed or suspected there was recklessness.  The statutory powers of supervision were conferred on the Bank for the protection of depositors and potential depositors.  As the fourth recital of the First Council Banking Co-ordination Directive (77/780/EEC) puts it, supervision of a credit institution is needed "in order to protect savings".  The system is based on the assumption that, where that protection is lacking, deposits are likely to be at risk.  The question whether at any given point of time that risk is sufficiently serious to justify a finding of recklessness on the part of a supervisor, who knows that the statutory requirements are not fulfilled, is aware of the risk but takes no action to withdraw authorisation or otherwise limit the activities of the deposit-taker, is one of degree.  I would hold that it is essentially a question of fact for the trial judge.  I do not think that a view on this matter can safely be formed at this stage by a reading of the available documents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;61. I should add, in order to emphasise the importance which I attach to seeing this as a question of fact and degree, that I see much force in Auld LJ's observation in his dissenting judgment about the Orwellian illogicality of sharpening the test of foresight of probable damage for the purposes of the strike out application to one of foresight of probable (imminent) collapse of BCCI.  He said at [2000] 2 WLR 15, 177C:</p>
<p></p><ul>"If such a test is to survive it will enable a banking regulator who deliberately and knowingly does not supervise a bank as it should do (as is conceded to be arguable here), with resulting damage to its depositors, to defeat a misfeasance claim simply by saying 'because I did not make the inquiries that I should have done, I did not suspect that the plaintiff would <i>probably </i>suffer loss.'  In short it enables a banking regulator to rely on its own deliberate and knowing illegality as a justification for its lack of foresight that it would cause damage.  If 'policy' and 'principle' are to be invoked, it must be against providing such an incentive to a banking regulator, or any public body exercising a supervisory function over institutions in the interest of persons for whom they provide a service, not to do their duty.  And to load a plaintiff/depositor with the further burden of proving that, despite the regulator's self-imposed ignorance, it foresaw damage in the particular form in which it occurred seems to me, with respect, even more illogical and unjust in a common law remedy the purpose of which is to provide a remedy for abuse of public duty."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;62. The second argument on the pleadings is that the claimants have failed to give particulars of their allegation of dishonesty and to link those allegations with particular officials of the Bank.  Here again regard must be paid to the fact that the claimants rely in the alternative on the concept of recklessness.  I refer to the comments which I made in the previous section about Mr Stadlen's submission that an allegation of dishonesty in the sense of subjective bad faith is an essential element.  The effect of your Lordships' decision following the first hearing is to the contrary.  Recklessness is demonstrated where it is shown that the public officer was aware of a serious risk of loss due to an act or omission on his part which was unlawful but chose deliberately to disregard that risk.  That is sufficient to establish that he did not have an honest belief in the lawfulness of the conduct which, to his knowledge, gave rise to that risk.  Recklessness about the consequences, in the sense of not caring whether the consequences happen or not, will satisfy the test.  In this context there is no additional element of dishonesty or bad faith that requires to be satisfied.  As for the particular officials against whom the allegation is made, I consider that the Bank has been given sufficient notice of the claimants' case against their officials in the particulars when read with the documents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;63. It is alleged in paragraph 31 of the new draft particulars that the Bank in bad faith at all times from 1979 onwards purported to rely pursuant to section 3(5) of the 1979 Act, and subsequently section 9(3) of the 1987 Act, upon assurances given by LBC/IML concerning the management and financial soundness of BCCI SA.  Particulars are then given in that paragraph of the matters about this arrangement which are said to have been known to the Bank or about which it was recklessly indifferent.  These are that the principal place of business of BCCI SA was in the UK, that LBC/IML did not and could not assure the Bank that it was satisfied with the management and overall financial soundness of BCCI SA, and that for various reasons that are specified LBC/IML had declared itself unable to carry out adequate supervision of both BCCI SA and the BCCI group.  It is also said that the Bank knew that the consequence of its unlawful reliance upon LBC/IML was that BCCI SA would be and would continue to be unlawfully licensed, and subsequently authorised, and that it was recklessly indifferent to the risk that this presented to depositors and potential depositors.  In paragraph 37 of the new draft particulars, under reference at each stage in the history to the facts and matters set out in Schedules 2 to 7 of the particulars, details are given of the respects in which the motives of the Bank for breaching its statutory duties as regulator were in bad faith.  It seemed to me at first sight that these particulars give ample notice to the Bank of the case which is being made against it as to the requirement of bad faith.  But the point requires further examination in the light of further points in Mr Stadlen's argument.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;64. The claimants are taken some distance down the road they must travel by a concession which the Bank made to Clarke J which the judge recorded in his third judgment, at p 32, in these terms:</p>
<p></p><ul>"with one exception I shall assume that they can establish that the Bank knew, believed or suspected at each stage that its proposed act or its omission was unlawful.  With that one exception, the Bank has conceded that it cannot show that the plaintiffs' case that it knew, believed or suspected that its acts or omissions were unlawful is doomed to failure.  That exception is the way that section 3(5) of the Banking Act 1979 was applied."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;65. In the Court of Appeal, as appears both from the majority judgment and that of Auld LJ, it was understood to be common ground that there was an arguable case that the Bank was aware of illegality in its supervision of BCCI SA: [2000] 2 WLR 15, 92H, 179G .  Mr Stadlen objected to these passages on the ground that the extent of the Bank's concession was being misrepresented.  He said that the Bank made one very narrow concession only, which was that for the purposes of the preliminary issue it was arguable that the Bank knew, believed or suspected that it was not entitled to rely, for the purpose of ongoing supervision of BCCI SA, on assurances given by LBC/IML because after, but not before, the licence was granted it knew, believed or suspected that its principal place of business was not in Luxembourg.  I am content to accept Mr Stadlen's assurance that the concession was limited to this point.  Nevertheless it seems to me to be a significant one.  It limits the areas for discussion to the granting of the licence on the one hand, as to which all issues remain in play, and to the Bank's ongoing supervision on the other hand, as to which the issue relates to the question whether the pleadings reveal an arguable case as to recklessness about the consequences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66. With regard to the question whether the claimants have sufficiently alleged dishonesty or bad faith when the Bank granted the licence in the first place, the majority in the Court of Appeal agreed with Clarke J's finding at p 44 of his third judgment that there was material from which it was at least arguable that the Bank must have known at that stage that LBC were not regulating BCCI SA<i> </i>properly and that it did not have the resources to do so in the future:  [2000]  2 WLR 15, 92B.  I agree, and I also consider that sufficient notice of the facts on which the claimants propose to rely is given in Schedule 2 to the new draft particulars.  As for Mr Stadlen's argument that the documents read in the light of the Bingham report do not provide any support for these particulars, I consider that issues of fact are raised here which, subject to further arguments about abuse of process, I would not expect to be answered satisfactorily in advance of a trial.  As for the later stages in the history, the issue of dishonesty or bad faith is so bound up with the broad issue of recklessness that here too, subject to further arguments about abuse of process, I would hold that the issue raises questions of fact and degree which are best left for decision by the trial judge in the light of the evidence. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;67. The third argument is that there was a failure to provide particularised allegations in regard to the revocation claim.  Mr Stadlen accepted that the initial decision to licence BCCI SA was particularised.  But he said that, despite Clarke J's warning that particulars had to be given of the decisions that were said to amount to misfeasance, the claimants' case was still largely based on alleged omissions.  He said that only three instances could be identified in the new draft particulars where it was alleged that decisions had been taken by the Bank not to revoke.  These were the decision in October 1986 not to revoke the authorisation despite its knowledge of the scale of BCCI SA's central treasury losses, the decision not to revoke in December 1989 in the light of the criticisms expressed in the paper prepared by the Banking Supervision Department for the Board of Banking Supervision in November of that year and the decision not to revoke in January 1990 following the plea bargain which led to the settlement of the Tampa indictment: new draft particulars, Schedule 5, paragraphs 27 and Schedule 6, paragraphs 19 and 24.  He maintained that this was a fundamental defect in the revocation claim, as a conscious decision was needed to support a case of misfeasance in public office.  It was not open to the claimants to rely on a general reference to the Bank's omission to act day by day over the entire period, as the tort required proof of acts done by the public official intentionally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;68. In my opinion this argument is based on a misconception of the thrust of the claimants' allegations and on a misunderstanding of the requirements of the tort.  The claimants' case, as Lord Neill explained, is that the Bank deliberately ran away from its responsibility as the relevant supervisory authority throughout the history of BCCI SA's activities in this country to safeguard the interests of depositors and potential depositors.  He said that a series of events could be identified in the particulars to show that the Bank deliberately failed to take steps which it might have taken to deal with the situation despite its awareness of facts or circumstances which revealed the extent of the risk to those interests.  I agree that particulars are given throughout the pleadings of events which are arguably of this character.  Examples of such events are given in the new draft particulars, Schedule 5, paragraphs 17 and 34-35, and there are many more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;69. Furthermore, as Lord Neill pointed out, the tort extends to decisions not to exercise powers as well as decisions to exercise them.  In the early days, when the tort was largely confined to disputes over voting rights, it was invoked to deal with the improper exercise of official power.  Later, it was invoked in other areas of official regulation through licensing and other controls of that kind.  Again the typical complaint was of the improper exercise of the power.  That remains true in the majority of the more modern cases.  <i>Bourgoin SA v Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</i> [1986]  QB 716 is an example, as that case was concerned with the withdrawal of a licence.  But, as Brennan J said in <i>Northern Territory of Australia v Mengel</i> (1995) 69 ALJR 527, 545 in a passage which was approved in your Lordships' previous judgment in this case, any act or omission done or made by a public official can found an action for misfeasance in public office.  If it were otherwise, a banking regulator would be able to defeat a misfeasance claim simply by resorting to inaction in the face of obvious and immediate risks despite the fact that it knew, believed or suspected that its reckless and deliberate course of inaction was likely to result in damage to depositors and potential depositors.  For these reasons I would reject the argument that proof of conscious decisions to act or not to act is required.  In my view the tort extends to a deliberate or wilful failure to take those decisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70. For these reasons I would hold that the facts pleaded by the claimants in the new draft particulars are capable, if proved, of meeting the requirements of the tort.  I must now turn to the alternative ground for striking out, which was that of abuse of process.</p>
<i><p>(4) The decision of the courts below to strike out</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;71. Clarke J said that he understood it to be common ground between the parties that in appropriate circumstances the court had power to strike an action out under its inherent jurisdiction and under RSC Ord 18 r 19.  The question which he then asked himself was whether the Bank had shown that the claimants' case was bound to fail on the material presently available and that there was no reasonable possibility of evidence becoming available to them, whether by further investigation, discovery, cross-examination or otherwise sufficiently to support their case and to give it some prospect of success.  As he put it, if the Bank were to discharge that burden, it would follow that the claim was bound to fail: third judgment, pp 6-7.  He then embarked on a detailed examination of all the material which was available to the claimants to support their claim.  I agree with the majority in the Court of Appeal that this was a vastly difficult undertaking: [2000] 2 WLR 15, 90A.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72. Clarke J's conclusion, after examining the available material over many days, was that the claimants had no arguable case on the material then available that the Bank dishonestly licensed BCCI SA or dishonestly failed to revoke the licence or authorisation in circumstances when it knew, believed or suspected that it would probably collapse without being rescued: third judgment, p 166.  The Court of Appeal agreed with the judge that it was right, in the exceptional circumstances of this case, to conduct this exercise: [2000] 2 WLR 15, 88B-D, 90A-B.  After reviewing the judge's conclusion in great detail, the majority agreed with the judge that all the evidence indicated that up to April 1990 the Bank did not actually foresee BCCI SA's imminent collapse, and thereafter that it did but properly relied on the prospect of a rescue: p 101H.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73. Concurrent findings of fact are not normally open to review in your Lordships' House.  For the like reasons as those on which this rule is based I would not have thought that it was appropriate for your Lordships to interfere with the concurrent findings of the judge and the majority in the Court of Appeal after conducting such a detailed and time-consuming exercise unless some flaw in their reasoning could be demonstrated.  There are however two grounds on which it was contended they misdirected themselves.  The first relates to the requirements of the tort.  The second relates to the use which they made of the Bingham report.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74. It is not necessary for me to deal in detail with the differences which have emerged between your Lordships and the courts below as to the requirements of the tort.  For the most part Clarke J's conclusions as to the legal principles to be applied which he summarised at the end of his first judgment [1996] 3 All ER 558, 632G-633E were approved in the judgment given by your Lordships after the first hearing of this appeal [2000] 2 WLR 1220.  The majority in the Court of Appeal said that they were in broad agreement with the judge's conclusions on the tort and that they had adopted the same approach as he had taken when they were considering whether the claimants' case was bound to fail: [2000] 2 WLR 15, 67E-F, 101H.  But there is one point of difference which is of obvious importance, as it lies at the heart of the argument between the parties.  This relates to the state of knowledge of the public officer about the prospect of loss that has to be demonstrated where the claim is based on the concept of recklessness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75. In his formulation Clarke J said that, for the purposes of the requirement that the officer knows that his act will probably injure the claimant, it is sufficient if he has actual knowledge that his act will probably damage the claimant or, in circumstances in which he believes or suspects that his act "will probably" damage the plaintiff, he does not ascertain whether that is so or fails to make inquires as to "the probability" of such damage: [1996] 3 All ER 558, 633A-B.  In the Court of Appeal the majority asked themselves whether the claimants had an arguable case that the Bank "actually foresaw" BCCI's imminent collapse at each relevant stage: [2000] 2 WLR 15, 101H.  They went on to say at p 102A-B that that formulation might have been too favourable to the claimants and that, in view of the stringent requirements of the tort of misfeasance in public office, the more appropriate question might be whether the Bank "knew" that its decision would cause loss to the claimants.  I would not regard the fact that the latter observation is not supported by your Lordships' judgment as important, as the majority do not say that they based their decision on this view.  But it is clear that the theme of knowledge of probable loss informed the approach which was taken throughout these judgments to the question whether the claim should be struck out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76. Mr Stadlen sought to support this approach.  But, for the reasons which I have already given, I would hold that it is not consistent with the effect of your Lordships' judgment following the first hearing.  As I have already said when I was reviewing the requirements of the tort in an earlier section of this judgment (section (2)), the state of mind which amounts to subjective recklessness is demonstrated where it is shown that the public officer was aware of a serious risk of loss due to an act or omission on his part which he knew to be unlawful but chose deliberately to disregard that risk, and the question whether at any given point of time that risk is sufficiently serious to justify a finding of recklessness is one of degree.  I consider that this point alone is sufficient to justify taking a fresh look at the question whether the claimants have a seriously arguable case directed to the issue of recklessness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77. Then there is the use which was made in their judgments by Clarke J and the majority in the Court of Appeal of the findings and conclusions in the Bingham report.  Clarke J said (at p 167 of his third judgment) that he recognised that Bingham LJ was not conducting a trial but an inquiry, that he did not see a number of Bank officials, that the witnesses whom he did see were not cross-examined in an adversarial process and that there was no right of appeal.  But he went on to say this, at pp 167-169:</p>
<p></p><ul>"On the other hand, it is plain that in addition to questioning witnesses Bingham LJ considered in detail all the relevant internal documents in the possession of the Bank, which involved a perusal of a mass of documentation.  As I have already said, it is clear from the terms of Bingham LJ's covering letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and indeed from many passages in the report itself, that he was applying his mind to question what was the state of mind of the Bank at each stage.  In these circumstances I accept Mr Stadlen's submission that it is inconceivable that Bingham LJ was aware of material which was materially at odds with his conclusions as to the state of mind of the Bank.  There is, in my judgment, no realistic possibility that he has not correctly set out the state of mind of the Bank at each stage.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"While it is, of course, true that I have seen only the report and not the appendices, the published report is a summary of an even more detailed narrative in the appendices. Since, as just stated, Bingham LJ was expressly considering the state of mind of the Bank at each stage, it is in my judgment inconceivable that there is in the appendices material which would or might support the conclusion that the Bank had the state of mind which the plaintiffs must establish.  If there was, Bingham LJ would have referred to it, even if only to dismiss it.  He would certainly not have disregarded it.  As I have tried to indicate, at no doubt inordinate length, there is nothing in the material which I have seen which gives arguable support for the plaintiffs' case.  I would, however, go further.  There is nothing in that material which gives reasonable grounds for supposing that there might be other evidence which might in the future support the plaintiffs' case.  In these circumstances I accept Mr Stadlen's further submission that there is no realistic possibility of more evidence becoming available, whether by further investigation, discovery, cross-examination or otherwise, which might throw light upon the state of mind of the Bank or any of its relevant officials during the period in which BCCI was operating."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78. The Court of Appeal said that, while the judge seemed to them to be putting the matter too high in the first of the two paragraphs which I have quoted from his judgment, they agreed with him that there was no realistic possibility that the picture which would emerge if officials of the Bank were to give evidence which was tested by cross-examination would be fundamentally different.  In that respect the report was, despite its informal status, an invaluable aid to distinguishing between what was a practical possibility and what was fanciful and inconceivable: [2000] 2 WLR 15, 91F-G.  Auld LJ disagreed with this approach.  In his view Clarke J was not entitled to treat the Bingham report effectively as conclusive on the questions that arise in this litigation or to conclude that all the available evidence about the Bank's state of knowledge had been gathered in or properly tested.  He said that there were no exceptional circumstances to justify departing from the normal rule of leaving the matter to the trial judge: p180D-H.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79. As I said in a previous section of this judgment (section (1)(b)), there are important limitations on the use which can be made of the Bingham report in these proceedings.  A sharp dividing line must be observed between Bingham LJ's narrative of the evidence, which is a legitimate source to which reference can be made for the purposes of the motion to strike out, and his findings and conclusions in the light of that evidence.  It is not just that those findings and conclusions would not be admissible at trial.  Fairness to the claimants requires that proper weight is given to the nature of Bingham LJ's inquiry and its limitations.  He was not asked to determine the issues relating to the tort of misfeasance in public office which the claimants now seek to raise.  These issues were not on trial in those proceedings.  There is no doubt that Bingham LJ was chosen to conduct the inquiry because of his outstanding qualities as a judge and the weight of authority which his findings and recommendations would command.  But those considerations must not be allowed to affect the rigorous distinction that must be maintained between those parts of the report that are and are not relevant to the Bank's motion to strike out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80. As I have already said, Clarke J made it clear that he recognised these limitations: see p 167 of his third judgment.  Nevertheless I have formed the clear impression that his view that the claim should be struck out was materially influenced by findings and conclusions and the absence of findings and conclusions in the Bingham report, and that he did not confine himself, as I consider he should have done, strictly to the narrative.  I do not leave out of account the fact that he was responding to the way in which the claimants had presented their case.  It is clear that they were drawing on those aspects of the report that suited them.  It is not surprising that the Bank replied by pointing out those parts of the report that did not, and that the judge in his turn was drawn into this argument.  Nevertheless the claimants are, in my view, entitled to say that Bingham LJ's findings and conclusions ought not to be used against them in this way.  Bingham LJ's findings and conclusions about the availability of further evidence coming to light were made in proceedings to which they were not parties, and they could not challenge them on appeal.  Cogent though these findings and conclusions may appear to be, the claimants are entitled to a fair trial of the claim which they have made against the Bank.</p>
