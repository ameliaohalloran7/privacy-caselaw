<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;128. It is, however, to be noticed that the phrases "sexual behaviour" and "other sexual experience" seem to be referring to matters of conduct or activity, to acts or events, of a sexual character and not to general considerations of the existence of a relationship or to the objective facts of acquaintanceship or familiarity or the lack of such factors.  The background to the critical incident forming the subject of the trial is not excluded from the evidence by the section, at least to the extent that it does not trespass into the particular field of any sexual behaviour or experience on the part of the complainant.  The converse of this point is made in section 41(6) where the evidence of behaviour which may be permitted under subsections (3) and (5) must relate to specific instances of behaviour and not to anything other than specific instances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;129. The present appeal is concerned strictly with the admission of evidence in relation to an issue of consent.  We are thus not immediately concerned to explore section 41(3)(a).  But it has to be noticed that on the face of that provision evidence of sexual behaviour of the complainant is not excluded by the statute under any limitations beyond that of the exercise of a judicial discretion under section 41(2).  Evidence of sexual behaviour is thus potentially treated as admissible by the statute on any issue other than that of consent.  To take one example which was raised during the hearing under reference to the recent Scottish case, <i>Love v H M Advocate</i> 1999  SCCR 783, evidence might be admitted about a sexual experience of the complainant, in that case a boy of fifteen, which had occurred two years after the abuse which was the subject of the charge but which could provide an alternative explanation for his evidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;130. One example of such evidence which caught the attention of the Court of Appeal is that of evidence directed to showing that the defendant had an honest belief that the complainant was consenting.  It was not disputed before us that such evidence falls under section 41(3)(a).  That evidence of sexual behaviour with other persons than the defendant should be so allowed seems questionable, but the only safeguard is the discretion of the judge and that would have to be relied upon as excluding irrelevant material.  On the other hand evidence of sexual behaviour with the defendant might well be relevant to a defence that he honestly believed that the complainant was consenting on the occasion in question.  That might seem to let in by a back door evidence which, apart from the express statutory limitations, might be excluded if presented as evidence relating to an issue of consent.  Where evidence of sexual behaviour is admitted under section 41(3)(a) the jury then require to be directed by the judge that they may look to such evidence for the purpose of determining the issue of honest belief but must ignore the evidence for the purpose of determining consent.  Such a summing up was thought in the Court of Appeal to be worthy of Wonderland.  But such mental ability as the distinction requires may not constitute an impossible feat for a jury.  Nor may they be required to engage in it in so many cases.  The recognition of the element of honest belief as a factor to be excluded if the necessary mens rea in a charge of rape is to be proved was established in <i> Director of Public Prosecutions v Morgan </i>[1976]  AC 182.  But even there, as Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone pointed out (p 207) the question was wholly unreal:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The choice before the jury was thus between two stories each wholly incompatible with the other, and in my opinion it would have been quite sufficient for the judge, after suitable warnings about the burden of proof, corroboration, separate verdicts and the admissibility of the statements only against the makers, to tell the jury that they must really choose between the two versions, the one of a violent and unmistakable rape of a singularly unpleasant kind, and the other of active co-operation in a sexual orgy, always remembering that if in reasonable doubt as to which was true they must give the defendants the benefit of it.  In spite of the valiant attempts of counsel to suggest some way in which the stories could be taken apart in sections and give rise in some way to a situation which might conceivably have been acceptable to a reasonable jury in which, while the victim was found not to have consented, the appellants, or any of them could conceivably either reasonably or unreasonably have thought she did consent, I am utterly unable to see any conceivable half-way house."<p></p></ul>
<p>In practice the incidence of cases where a real issue of honest belief arises and calls for a delicate analysis may be fewer than may be feared.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;131. But in the present case we are concerned only with evidence sought to be presented as relating to an issue of consent.  Further the issues as presented in the appeal relate only to evidence of sexual behaviour with the accused.  As I have already stated the section recognises the possibility that sexual behaviour with others than the defendant are not necessarily to be excluded.  But that is not the question in the present appeal.  It is necessary to consider the two categories of case where evidence may be admitted in relation to an issue of consent as set out in section 41(3)(b) and (c).  That provision is made for the admission of evidence of specific instances of sexual behaviour in these two paragraphs reflects a recognition that such instances may be relevant to the resolution of a dispute on the issue of consent, that is to say, that the sexual history of the complainant may be relevant to the issue of consent and admissible in evidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;132. The former provision, section 41(3)(b), relates to the possible admission of evidence of behaviour "alleged to have taken place at or about the same time as the event which is the subject matter of the charge against the accused".  There is a degree of elasticity in this provision, but it cannot be strained so far as to allow evidence of incidents remote in time.  The problem is to assess the permissible degree of remoteness, and that is a question which will have to be determined finally in light of the circumstances of each particular case. Certainly it appears that incidents must be outwith anything which has taken place as part of the event which is the subject matter of the charge. Section 42(1)(c) excludes such things from the definition of "sexual behaviour" so far as section 41(3)(b) is concerned.  But how far backwards or indeed forwards one may go beyond the borders of the event remains for the judge to determine.  In <i>State of Missouri v Murray</i> (1992)  842 SW (2d) 122 it was held that incidents bearing on consent which had occurred 3½ and 6½ months before the alleged rape should have been admitted, but the statutory test there was  that the incidents be "reasonably contemporaneous" which is a different and broader test than that in section 41(3)(b).  It would be undesirable to prescribe any test in terms of days or hours, but where the point of reference is to the time of the event it may be difficult to extend that to a period of several days.  Certainly the period which the defendant in the present case seeks to explore could not be treated as within the scope of section 41(3)(b).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;133. I turn next to section 41(3)(c).  Some use was made in the hearing of the phrase "striking similarity" in relation to this particular provision.  That phrase was no doubt used because of the comparison which can be made between the drafting of section 41(3)(c) and the language used in particular by Lord Salmon in <i>R v Boardman</i> [1975]  AC 421, 462.  But Parliament has chosen not to use that phrase and the standard which it has selected is to my mind something short of a striking similarity.  <i>R v Boardman</i> was concerned with the problem of similar fact evidence used for the purpose of establishing that the accused had committed the offence with which he was charged.  An example can be seen in <i> R v Butler</i> (1986)  84 Cr App R 12.  In the present context the defence is seeking to fortify its proposition that the complainant was consenting to intercourse.  The context and the purpose of the evidence is not so much to show from past events that history has been repeated, as to indicate a state of mind on the part of the complainant towards the defendant which is potentially highly relevant to her state of mind on the occasion in question.  The language used is thus not quite the language of <i>R v Boardman</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;134. The provision seeks to make a comparison between the sexual behaviour of the complainant on some other occasion or occasions and the sexual behaviour of the complainant on the occasion of the alleged rape.  That latter occasion is more particularly detailed as being either (i) of sexual behaviour which took place as part of the event which is the subject matter of the charge (the definition of "sexual behaviour" in section 42(1)(c) being expressly qualified for this purpose) or (ii) of any other sexual behaviour of the complainant which took place at or about the same time as that event but not as part of the event which is the subject matter of the charge.  It may be that the scope of the latter may coincide with the scope of section 41(3)(b), but that is not a point for decision here.  The former occasion or occasions, that is to say the other occasion or occasions of similar behaviour, are not limited by reference to time or to place.  In particular it may be noticed that behaviour subsequent to the critical event might be admissible where it bears upon the issue of an alleged earlier consent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;135. The essentials for the application of the provision are that there should be a similarity in any respect between the two incidents of sexual behaviour which cannot reasonably be explained as a coincidence.  It is only a similarity that is required, not an identity.  Moreover the words "in any respect" deserve to be stressed.  On one view any single factor of similarity might suffice to attract the application of the provision, provided that it is not matter of coincidence.  That the behaviour was with the same person, the defendant, must be at least a relevant consideration.  But if the identity of the defendant was alone sufficient as the non-coincidental factor, that would seem to open the way in almost every case for a complete inquiry into the whole of the complainant's sexual behaviour with the defendant at least in the recent past, and that can hardly have been the intention of the provision.  What must be found is a similarity in some other or additional respect.  Further the similarity must be such as cannot reasonably be explained as a coincidence.  To my mind that does not necessitate that the similarity has to be in some rare or bizarre conduct.  So long as the particular factor is of a significance which goes beyond the realm of what could reasonably be explained as a coincidence, it should suffice.  Something about the sexual behaviour of the complainant on each of the occasions, such as something said or done by him or her which is not so unremarkable as to be reasonably explained as a coincidence has to be found.  I would not attempt any kind of definition and in any event it is the words of the statute which matter, but the language seems to me to be looking for some characteristic or incident of the complainant's sexual behaviour which can reasonably be seen to have a significance beyond the fact that it is contemporaneous with the behaviour and which bears some kind of connection or relationship with the behaviour which on a reasonable view is not a mere matter of chance.  The task for the judge is to examine the evidence proposed to be led and see if such a similarity in some respect can be found.  The matter comes eventually to be one of the circumstances of the particular case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;136. It may well be that the problem can be resolved in practice without any straining of the language of section 41(3)(c).  But if the situation is such that the case cannot readily be fitted within the ordinary meaning of the words, then it would be necessary to resort to the special rule of construction embodied in section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998.  If a case occurred where the evidence of the complainant's sexual behaviour was relevant and important for the defence to make good a case of consent, then it seems to me that the language would have to be strained in order to avoid the injustice to the accused of excluding from a full and proper presentation of his defence.  Evidence of other occasions in which the accused had engaged with the complainant in sexual behaviour may not always be relevant.  It may, for example, be so remote in time as to make the drawing of any inference from it impossible.  But in many cases it may be highly relevant, and a fair trial would be endangered if in such a case it was excluded.  I do not consider that the terms of the section are so rigid as to make it impossible for such evidence to be admissible and so to create an incompatibility with the Convention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;137. The question then is whether or not the evidence which is sought to be led in the present case can fall within the scope of section 41(3)(c). This will depend upon a careful assessment of the presence or absence of a similarity beyond coincidence between the previous and the critical occasions.  That is properly a matter for the trial judge to determine.  In interpreting the section he must bear in mind that he may require to adopt the special standard laid down in section 3 of the Human Rights Act.  From the sparse facts which are before us, if not on the ordinary approach to construction, at least if one was to follow the instruction contained in section 3, I am not able to affirm that the evidence in question may not fall within the scope of section 41(3)(c).  I consider that the judge should be afforded a fresh opportunity of considering the matter in light of the present appeal. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;138. I do not propose to consider the provisions of subsections (4) and (5) in any depth.  It seems to me that the former will require a very fine analysis in its practical application.  Issues of consent and issues of credibility may well run so close to each other as almost to coincide.  A very sharp knife may be required to separate what may be admitted from what may not.  The purpose of subsection (4) may be taken to be the abolition of the false idea that a history of sexual behaviour in some way was relevant to credit.  The recognition of that myth as heresy is to be welcomed.  But the subsection may have to be carefully handled in order to secure that that myth remains buried in the past and at the same time secure the availability of evidence of sexual behaviour which is properly admissible as bearing on the issue of consent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;139. Subsection (5) opens the way for the admissibility of questioning and evidence by or on behalf of the defendant for the sole purposes of rebutting or explaining evidence adduced by the prosecution about any sexual behaviour of the complainant.  This includes behaviour forming part of the event which is the subject of the charge and is obviously necessary to give the defendant even a minimal right to present his defence.  There may well be room for debate about the precise scope of the subsection. Indeed the respondent sought to argue that a denial of consent by the complainant would enable him to call evidence of the previous sexual relationship which he claims he had with the complainant during the few weeks before the alleged rape.  I am not persuaded that the subsection can properly by any standard be construed as to lead to that result.  But it is unnecessary to explore its scope for the purposes of the present appeal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;140. Critically this appeal has been concerned with section 41(3)(c) and it is important that there should be some general guidance on the application of that section.  I have had the opportunity of seeing in draft the formulation which my noble and learned friend Lord Steyn has proposed in paragraph 46 of his speech.  I agree that the effect of the decision in this case can be expressed in the statement which he has made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;141. I recognise the peculiarity of the way in which this problem has come before us, as has been described in the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Hutton.  The circumstances do not make it altogether easy to determine the formal outcome.  In light of the view which I have taken and of the consequence of the decision reached by the Court of Appeal I do not consider that their reasoning can be allowed to stand without qualification.  On the other hand the appellant has substantially failed in the submissions presented on its behalf.  I consider that the proper course is to dismiss the appeal and enable the trial judge to have the opportunity of making a fresh ruling in light of the decision of this House after such further procedure as he may consider appropriate.</p>
<p><b>LORD HUTTON</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;142. In a criminal trial there are two principal objectives of the law. One is that a defendant should not be convicted of the crime with which he is charged when he has not committed it.  The other is that a defendant who is guilty of the crime with which he is charged should be convicted.  But where the crime charged is that of rape, the law must have a third objective which is also of great importance:  it is to ensure that the woman who complains that she has been raped is treated with dignity in court and is given protection against cross-examination and evidence which invades her privacy unnecessarily and which subjects her to humiliating questioning and accusations which are irrelevant to the charge against the defendant.  The need to protect a witness against unfair questioning applies, of course, to all trials but it is of special importance in a trial for rape.  Linked to the third objective is the further consideration that allegations relating to the sexual history of the complainant may distort the course of the trial and divert the jury from the issue which they have to determine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;143. It is the need to achieve both the objective of protecting an innocent defendant and the objective of protecting a woman complainant which gives rise to the difficult and important issue before the House on this appeal.  The issue is difficult because in some cases where an innocent defendant wishes to give evidence that prior to the sexual intercourse which gives rise to the charge against him he had had consensual sexual intercourse with the complainant on previous occasions, it may be necessary to permit him to give such evidence and the complainant to be cross-examined on the matter in order to enable the jury to come to a just verdict.  On the other hand there will be other cases where the adducing of evidence of the complainant's past sexual conduct and cross-examination about it will be unnecessary to ensure that justice is done and may prevent the conviction of a guilty defendant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;144. Parliament enacted section 41 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 to give effect to the third objective.  In the course of their submissions counsel referred to the statements of Ministers in Parliamentary debates in order to show the mischief at which the section was aimed.  In the debate on the Bill in the House of Commons on 24 June 1999 a Minister of State at the Home Office, Mr Paul Boateng, said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Women—it normally is women although it might be a man—who are considering making an allegation of rape are all too often deterred from so doing, or from going through with the process of prosecution, because they are terrified of having their sexual history trawled through in a gratuitous way ….<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>The intention of the Bill is to keep as much evidence of complainants' sexual behaviour out of trials as possible.  That is vital if complainants are to pursue their complaints through to trial and not to feel that their privacy is being invaded to discredit and humiliate them.  We must ensure that victims have faith in the criminal justice system and believe that their attacker will be on trial, not them and their history.  Sexual history should be admitted only in very limited circumstances where it is really relevant to an issue at trial:" HC Official Report, Standing Committee E (Human Rights Bill), 24 June 1999, col 203.<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;145. The thinking of the Government was explained as follows by Lord Williams of Mostyn QC, a Minister of State at the Home Office, during the third reading debate on the Bill in the House of Lords on 23 March 1999:</p>
<p></p><ul>"I have to make it plain that as a matter of government policy we have concluded that evidence of a complainant's past attitude to or experience of sexual relations is not material upon which a jury should reasonably rely to conclude that the complainant might indeed have consented on the occasion that is the subject of the complaint.  Consensual sex does not mean consent to sex in general—it does not even mean consent to sex with a particular person—it means consent to sex with a particular individual on a particular occasion ….<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>The fact that a complainant has consented previously does not mean that she will consent again.  A woman exercises—and is entitled to exercise—her consent independently on each occasion.  The defendant's accumulated knowledge and experience of the complainant may affect his belief in consent at the time of the alleged offence, even though, if he reflects on it later, he may recognise and concede that that belief was mistaken." Hansard (HL Debates), 23 March 1999, cols 1216-1217, 1218.<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;146. Section 41 provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"(1)	If at a trial a person is charged with a sexual offence, then, except with the leave of the court—<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)	no evidence may be adduced, and<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)	no question may be asked in cross-examination,<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>by or on behalf of any accused at the trial, about any sexual behaviour of the complainant.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(2)	The court may give leave in relation to any evidence or question only on an application made by or on behalf of an accused, and may not give such leave unless it is satisfied—<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)	that subsection (3) or (5) applies, and<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)	that a refusal of leave might have the result of rendering unsafe a conclusion of the jury or (as the case may be) the court on any relevant issue in the case.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(3)	This subsection applies if the evidence or question relates to a relevant issue in the case and either—<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)	that issue is not an issue of consent; or<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)	it is an issue of consent and the sexual behaviour of the complainant to which the evidence or question relates is alleged to have taken place at or about the same time as the event which is the subject matter of the charge against the accused; or<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(c)	it is an issue of consent and the sexual behaviour of the complainant to which the evidence or question relates is alleged to have been, in any respect, so similar—<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(i)	to any sexual behaviour of the complainant which (according to evidence adduced or to be adduced by or on behalf of the accused) took place as part of the event which is the subject matter of the charge against the accused, or<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(ii)	to any other sexual behaviour of the complainant which (according to such evidence) took place at or about the same time as that event,<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>that the similarity cannot reasonably be explained as a coincidence.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(4)	For the purposes of subsection (3) no evidence or question shall be regarded as relating to a relevant issue in the case if it appears to the court to be reasonable to assume that the purpose (or main purpose) for which it would be adduced or asked is to establish or elicit material for impugning the credibility of the complainant as a witness.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(5)	This subsection applies if the evidence or question—<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)	relates to any evidence adduced by the prosecution about any sexual behaviour of the complainant; and<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)	in the opinion of the court, would go no further than is necessary to enable the evidence adduced by the prosecution to be rebutted or explained by or on behalf of the accused.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(6)	For the purposes of subsections (3) and (5) the evidence or question must relate to a specific instance (or specific instances) of alleged sexual behaviour on the part of the complainant (and accordingly nothing in those subsections is capable of applying in relation to the evidence or question to the extent that it does not so relate)."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;147. The intent of section 41 is to counter what have been described as the two myths.  One is that because a woman has had sexual intercourse in the past she is more likely to have consented to intercourse on the occasion in question.  The other is that by reason of her sexual behaviour in the past she is less worthy of belief as a witness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;148. As regards the first myth it is important to recognise that the present case is one where the defendant wishes to make the case that the complainant had previously had consensual sexual intercourse with him—he does not wish to make the case that the complainant had previously had consensual sexual intercourse with other men and that therefore it was likely that she had consented to have sexual intercourse with him.  This is an important distinction, and I propose to confine my observations to a case such as the present one where a defendant seeks to give evidence of the complainant having had previous consensual sexual intercourse with him.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;149. The Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R v Seaboyer</i> (1991)  83 DLR (4th) 193 and <i>R v Darrach</i> (2000)  191 DLR (4th) 539 has given powerful and learned judgments demonstrating that the two myths have no place in modern law, but the judgments were given in cases where the defences which the defendants wished to advance related to the alleged sexual conduct of the complainants with other men and the judgments are primarily directed to this situation.  In <i>R v Seaboyer,</i> at p 280D, McLachlin J accepted by implication that in some cases evidence of previous sexual conduct of the complainant with the accused might be admissible.  The learned Justice considered, at p 279, the proposal of Professor Harriet Galvin in an article entitled "Shielding Rape Victims in the State and Federal Courts: A Proposal for the Second Decade" (1986) 70 Minn L Rev 763, 903: </p>
<p></p><ul>"Sexual conduct of victim of rape.  In a prosecution for rape, evidence that the victim has engaged in consensual sexual conduct with persons other than the accused is not admissible to support the inference that a person who has previously engaged in consensual sexual conduct is for that reason more likely to consent to the sexual conduct with respect to which rape is alleged.  Evidence of consensual sexual conduct on the part of the victim may, however, be admissible for other purposes."<p></p></ul>
<p>McLachlin J then stated, at p 280C:</p>
<p></p><ul>"While accepting the premise and the general thrust of Galvin's proposal, I suggest certain modifications …. I question whether evidence of other sexual conduct with the accused should automatically be admissible in all cases;  sometimes the value of such evidence might be little or none."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;150. The first question which arises on this appeal is whether evidence that there had been previous consensual sexual intercourse between the complainant and a defendant is a relevant matter for the jury to consider.  On this issue I would make two observations.  The first is that in enacting section 41(3)(c) Parliament has accepted that there may be circumstances in which previous sexual behaviour on the part of the complainant is relevant to the issue of consent, because paragraph (c) permits evidence of previous sexual behaviour of the complainant where it is alleged to have been, in any respect, so similar to any alleged sexual behaviour of the complainant at the time of the alleged offence that the similarity cannot reasonably be explained as a coincidence. </p>
