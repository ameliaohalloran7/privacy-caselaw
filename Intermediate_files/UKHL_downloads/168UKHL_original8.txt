<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;190.&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue now is whether a company unlawfully required to pay ACT is entitled, under European or domestic principles, to interest for the loss of use of money on a compound or only a simple interest basis. Under a Group Litigation Order made 26th November 2001, Sempra Metals Limited ("Sempra"), as Metallgesellschaft Limited is now known, is a test claimant for the determination of this issue, and four sample dividends have been identified for consideration. Their relevant details are as follows:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the table shows, often very substantial periods of years passed before Sempra was able to set off the ACT payments which the 1988 Act called upon it to make. Sempra started the present proceedings by writ issued 6th March 1996, by when Sempra had not been able to set off the whole of its fourth payment of ACT, although it was able to do so shortly afterwards. But the only claim made in the present proceedings relates to the periods prior to set off. The claim as pleaded is for damages to compensate for the loss of use of the ACT or, by later amendment, for restitution in respect of the loss of use of the ACT during such periods. The course of argument before the House led Sempra to reformulate the latter claim as a claim for the benefit, actual or notional, obtained by the Revenue by having the use of the money. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;191.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Park J ([2004] EWHC 2387 Ch); [2004] STC 1178 and the Court of Appeal, consisting of Chadwick, Laws and Jonathan Parker LJJ, ([2005] EWCA Civ 389; [2005] STC 687) held that Community law, and in particular the principles laid down by the European Court in the <i>Metallgesellshaft </i>case, require English domestic courts to give a full remedy or full compensation in order to restore equal treatment and that only an award of compound interest would fully achieve this. Park J accepted a submission by the Inland Revenue that such interest should be calculated on a "conventional basis", that is by fixing a single market-based rate for all claimants, irrespective of whether they were net borrowers or depositors and of any actual rates at which they borrowed or lent (paragraphs 18 to 22). On this last point his decision was not appealed, but Chadwick LJ giving the only full judgment in the Court of Appeal commented that "if the matter is to be approached on the basis of 'one rate suits all', then (as it seems to me) there is really no alternative to adopting a borrower's rate rather than a lender's rate" (paras. 50-52). The Court of Appeal added the rider that interest should be computed by compounding at the same periodic rests as those to reference to which the applicable rate was fixed (para. 54). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;192.&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the award of compound interest the Revenue now appeals. The Revenue submits that the remedy to be provided in respect of ACT payments made under the discriminatory legislative scheme identified by the European Court in the <i>Metallgesellschaft </i>case depends on English domestic law. It submits that, whatever form the remedy takes under English domestic law, only simple interest is recoverable, but that, if this is wrong, distinctions should be drawn between the various remedies. Unfortunately, until the submissions before the House, no such distinction appears to have been suggested (cf paragraph 11 of Park J's judgment), but the matter is one of pure law. Three possible domestic remedies exist: (a) a claim for damages for or analogous to breach of statutory duty or (b) a restitutionary claim based on or by analogy with the principle in <i>Woolwich Equitable Building Society v. Inland Revenue Commissioners</i> [1993] AC 70 and (c) a restitutionary claim based on or by analogy with the principle of mistake of law recognised in the House's decisions in<i> Kleinwort Benson Ltd. v. Lincoln C.C. </i>[1999] 2 AC 349 and <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Group Plc v. Inland Revenue Commissioners </i>[2007] 1 AC 558. Sempra, I understand, accepts that it would, before entry of any final judgment, have to elect between, on the one hand, the first and, on the other hand, the second and third remedies. I leave aside whether the second and third remedies may combine at some higher level of abstraction, such as absence of any basis for the payment or retention of the ACT. For domestic law purposes there is on any view a significant difference between them: the third remedy would, under section 32(1)(c) of the Limitation Act 1980, potentially postpone the commencement of the limitation period until the time when Sempra discovered or could with reasonable diligence have discovered that the ACT was not due. Sempra and other claimants intend to identify that time with the European Court of Justice's decision on 8th March 2001 in the <i>Metallgesellschaft </i>case. Without such a postponement, interest losses prior to 6th March 1990 would on the face of it be time-barred, a matter of great relevance to ACT paid by Sempra on the first three sample dividends shown in the table above. If the third remedy proves available, Sempra will be likely therefore to elect for it, rather than for the first. Finally, the Revenue submits that, even if the nature of the interest awarded is a matter of Community law as the courts below considered, there is nothing in Community law to require or to make appropriate an award of compound interest. </p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Metallgesellschaft case</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;193.&nbsp;&nbsp;I start with the European Court's reasoning and decision in the <i>Metallgesellschaft </i>case [2001] Ch 620.  The second question put by the High Court was</p>
<p></p><ul>"(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;If the answer to question 1 is 'no' [i.e. if the legislative scheme regarding ACT was not consistent with the EC Treaty], do the above-mentioned provisions of the EC Treaty give rise to a restitutionary right for a resident subsidiary of a parent company resident in another member state and/or the said parent to claim a sum of money by way of interest on the [ACT] which the subsidiary paid on the basis that the national laws did not allow it to make a group income election, or can such a sum only be claimed, if at all, by way of an action for damages pursuant to the principles laid down by the Court of Justice in <i>Brasserie du Pêcheur SA</i> v <i>Federal Republic of Germany</i>; <i>R</i> v <i>Secretary of State for Transport</i>, <i>Ex p</i> <i>Factortame Ltd (No 4) </i>(Joined Cases C-46/93 and C-48/93) [1996] QB 404 and <i>R</i> <i>v</i> <i>Secretary of State for Social Security</i>, <i>Ex p Sutton</i> (Case C-66/95) [1997] ICR 961, and in either case is the national court obliged to grant a remedy even if under national law interest cannot be awarded (whether directly or by way of restitution or damages) on principal sums which are no longer owing to the claimants?"<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;194.&nbsp;&nbsp;The European Court's answer in paragraph 96 and in its ruling was as follows:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Where a subsidiary resident in one member state has been obliged to pay advance corporation tax in respect of dividends paid to its parent company having its seat in another member state even though, in similar circumstances, the subsidiaries of parent companies resident in the first member state were entitled to opt for a taxation regime that allowed them to avoid that obligation, article 52 of the Treaty requires that resident subsidiaries and their non-resident parent companies should have an effective legal remedy in order to obtain reimbursement or reparation of the financial loss which they have sustained and from which the authorities of the member state concerned have benefited as a result of the advance payment of tax by the subsidiaries.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>The mere fact that the sole object of such an action is the payment of interest equivalent to the financial loss suffered as a result of the loss of use of the sums paid prematurely does not constitute a ground for dismissing such an action.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>While, in the absence of Community rules, it is for the domestic legal system of the member state concerned to lay down the detailed procedural rules governing such actions, including ancillary questions, such as the payment of interest, those rules must not render practically impossible or excessively difficult the exercise of rights conferred by Community law." <p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;195.&nbsp;&nbsp;This answer establishes the principles by reference to which English courts must approach Sempra's claim. Domestic law is required to provide "an effective legal remedy in order to obtain reimbursement or reparation of the financial loss which they [in casu, Sempra] have sustained and from which the authorities of the member state concerned have benefited as a result of the advance payment of tax by [Sempra]". The answer involves no requirement that the remedy should take any particular form, an impression confirmed by the following paragraph in the European Court's reasoning:</p>
<p></p><ul>"81.&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be stressed that it is not for the Court of Justice to assign a legal classification to the actions brought by the claimants before the national court. In the circumstances, it is for the claimants, to specify the nature and basis of their actions (whether they are actions for restitution or actions for compensation for damage), subject to the supervision of the national court."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;196.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, Mr Rabinowitz QC for Sempra submits that the European Court determined, as a matter of Community law, that a remedy must be available in domestic law in both restitution and damages, and that in each case it must consist in allowing recovery of compound interest. He bases this submission on ensuing paragraphs of the European Court's reasoning, which discuss the position firstly "on the assumption that the actions brought by the claimants ….. are to be treated as claims for restitution of a charge levied in breach of Community law" (paragraphs 82-89) and secondly "assuming that the claimants' claims are to be treated as claims for compensation for damage caused by breach of Community law" (paragraphs 90-95). Again, on the face of it, the Court's introduction to each of these sets of paragraphs indicates no more than an intention to discuss the two alternative possibilities envisaged in the bracketed phrase in paragraph 81. However, in paragraphs 82 to 89 the European Court rested its reasoning regarding restitution firmly on "well-established [European] case-law", in terms which, it may be suggested, <i>require</i> a restitutionary remedy to be available. In my opinion, that would be a mistaken understanding of the Court's actual or likely intentions. In paragraph 84, the Court was emphasising that, in circumstances like those under discussion, Community law requires there to be <i>a</i> (not any particular) right to a refund: </p>
<p></p><ul>"84 According to well-established case law, the right to a refund of charges levied in a member state in breach of rules of Community law is the consequence and complement of the rights conferred on individuals by Community provisions as interpreted by the court: <i>Amministrazione delle Finanze dello Stato v SpA San Giorgio </i>(Case 199/82) [1983] ECR 3595, 3612, para 12; <i>Barra v Belgian State </i>(Case 309/85) [1988] ECR 355, 376, para 17; <i>BP Supergas Anonimos Etairia Geniki Emporiki-Viomichaniki kai Antiprossopeion v Greek State </i>(Case C-62/93) [1995] ECR I-1883, 1919, para 40; <i>Dilexport Srl v Amministrazione delle Finanze dello Stato </i>(Case C-343/96) [1999] ECR I-579, 610-611, para 23 and <i>Kapniki Mikhailidis AE v Idrima Kinonikon Asphaliseon </i>(Joined Cases C-441 and 442/98) [2000] ECR I-7145, 7176, para 30.  The member state is therefore required in principle to repay charges levied in breach of Community law: <i>Société Comateb v Directeur Général des Douanes et Droits Indirects </i>(Joined Cases C-192-218/95) [1997] ECR I-165, 188, para 20; <i>Dilexport</i>, para 23 and <i>Mikhailidis</i>, para 30.<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;197.&nbsp;&nbsp;A reading of the cases cited in paragraph 84 shows the European Court consistently stating that "repayment may be sought only within the framework of the conditions as to both substance and form, laid down by the various national laws applicable thereto" (cf the <i>San Giorgio </i>case, para. 12) and in the <i>Dilexport </i>case, paras. 24-25 it stated that </p>
<p></p><ul>"24 ……. the Court has also observed on several occasions that the problem of disputing charges which have been unlawfully claimed or refunding charges which have been paid when not due is settled in different ways in the various Member States, and even within a single Member State, according to the various kinds of taxes or charges in question. In certain cases, objections or claims of that kind are subject to specific procedural conditions and time-limits under the law with regard both to complaints submitted to the tax authorities and to legal proceedings. In other cases, claims for repayment of charges which were paid but not due must be brought before the ordinary courts, mainly in the form of actions for refund of sums paid but not owed, such claims being available for varying lengths of time, in some cases for the limitation period laid down under the general law (see, most recently, Case C-228/96 <i>Aprile v Amministrazione delle Finanze dello Stato</i> [1998] ECR I-7141, paragraph 17). <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>25 This diversity between national systems derives mainly from the lack of Community rules on the refund of national charges levied though not due. …..".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;198.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court was also repeating its previous jurisprudence when it said in paragraph 85 of its present judgment that it is for the domestic legal system </p>
<p></p><ul>"to designate the courts and tribunals having jurisdiction and to lay down the detailed procedural rules governing actions for safeguarding rights which individuals derive from Community law, provided, first, that such rules are not less favourable than those governing similar domestic actions (principle of equivalence) and, secondly, that they do not render practically impossible or excessively difficult the exercise of rights conferred by Community law (principle of effectiveness) ….".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In paragraph 86, the Court further stated that it was for national law</p>
<p></p><ul>"to settle all ancillary questions relating to the reimbursement of charges improperly levied, such as the payment of interest, including the rate of interest and the date from which it must be calculated". <p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In paragraphs 87 to 89 it reiterated why, in the circumstances of the present case, an award of interest is <i>not</i> an ancillary matter for the national court, but is <i>required</i> by Community law:</p>
