<p class="para">86.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Martin QC (for the Commissioners) described this passage as plainly wrong. Mr Flint QC (for Total) showed little enthusiasm for its reasoning. But to say that the reasoning in <i>Powell v Boladz</i> is unsound is only the first step towards identifying the correct principle. That question has been considered in a number of recent cases, which (to say the least) do not speak with one voice. The judgment of the Court of Appeal in this case, holding itself bound by <i>Powell v Boladz</i>, was handed down on 31 January 2007. That judgment referred to the unreported decision of Davis J in <i>Mbasogo v Logo Ltd</i> [2005] EWHC 2034 (QB) (“Mbasogo”) but not to the fact that that case had by then gone to the Court of Appeal (Sir Anthony Clarke MR, Dyson and Moses LJJ) [2006] EWCA Civ 1370; [2007] 2 WLR 1062 which gave its reserved judgment on 23 October 2006. That division of the Court of Appeal declined to go far into the law on unlawful means conspiracy (since it held the claim unjusticiable on wider grounds) but the Court did (at para 104) express doubt as to whether it was bound by <i>Powell v Boladz</i>.</p>
<p class="para">87.&nbsp;&nbsp;Davis J’s judgment in <i>Mbasogo</i> contains an admirable discussion of the “unlawful means” issue, with mention of all the recent cases. Because the judgment is unreported I will give a brief summary. Davis J pointed out that in an interlocutory appeal in <i>Associated British Ports v Transport &amp; General Workers’ Union</i> [1989] 1 WLR 939, Stuart-Smith LJ had (in agreement with Butler-Sloss LJ but contrary to the view of Neill LJ) taken the view, for the purposes of the intentional harm tort (p 966):</p>
<p class="qt">“that at the very least it is strongly arguable that where the unlawful relied upon in this tort is a breach of statute, it is not necessary that it should be one that is actionable in tort at the suit of the plaintiff.”</p>
<p class="para">That case was not referred to in <i>Powell v Boladz</i> (decided on 1 July 1997), nor in <i>Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland NV v Export Credit Guarantee Department</i> [1998] 1 LLR 19, decided by the Court of Appeal (Stuart-Smith, Hobhouse and Thorpe LJJ) on 23 July 1997. At p 32 Stuart-Smith LJ recorded (using the same language and referring to the same authorities) counsel’s concession that the unlawful act must be actionable at the suit of the plaintiff. That statement of the law was followed by Toulson J in <i>Yukong Line Ltd of Korea v Rendsburg Investments Corp. of Liberia</i> [1998] 1 WLR 294, 311-314. Toulson J’s reasoning was based, it seems to me, on an over-elaborate textual analysis of Lord Diplock’s speech in <i>Lonrho v Shell</i>, without regard to the authoritative explanation given by Lord Bridge in <i>Lonrho v Fayed</i>. I would make the same respectful criticism of the judgment of Laddie J in <i>Michaels v Taylor Woodrow Developments Ltd</i> [2001] Ch 493 (especially paras 30-34). </p>
<p class="para">88.&nbsp;&nbsp; In <i>Surzur Overseas Ltd v Koros</i> [1999]  2 LLR 611, the Court of Appeal refused to strike out a claim alleging an unlawful means conspiracy by deception of the Court (leading it to lift an order preventing the sale of three ships). Waller LJ (with whom Hirst and Aldous LJJ agreed) stated at p 617: </p>
<p class="qt">“This aspect was not debated in any detail before Mr Justice Longmore at all and was raised very much at the last moment in argument [before] us.  It would clearly be wrong to reach any final conclusion.  What is clear, in my view, is that it is eminently arguable that in an unlawful means conspiracy the unlawful means do not have to be actionable at the suit of the plaintiff.”</p>
<p class="hditl">Crime as unlawful means</p>
<p class="para">89.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, faced with this confusion in the recent case-law, the House must, I suggest, go back to the general principles to be derived from the older cases in which the economic torts have been developed. It is however necessary to bear in mind that their development has been a long and difficult process, and may not yet be complete, as Lord Templeman observed (with the concurrence of the majority) in <i>Lonrho v Fayed</i> [1992] 1 AC 448, 471. A particular difficulty is that it has been generally assumed, throughout the 20th-century cases, that “unlawful means” should have the same meaning in the intentional harm tort and in the tort of conspiracy. A good deal of legal reasoning in the speeches and judgments (as to the ingredients of one or other of these torts) has been based on the assumption that the meaning must be the same in both. That assumption is however challenged, if the Commissioners are correct, by the speech of Lord Hoffmann in <i>OBG</i> (with which the majority concurred).  I shall have to come back to that difficulty.  </p>
<p class="para">90.&nbsp;&nbsp;In searching for general principle I start with a very simple, even naïve point. The man in the street, if asked what an unlawful act was, would probably answer ‘a crime.’ He might give as an example theft, obtaining money by false pretences, or assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He might or might not know that each of these was also a civil wrong (or tort) but it is unlikely that civil liability would be in the forefront of his mind.  </p>
<p class="para">91.&nbsp;&nbsp;The reaction of a lawyer would be more informed but it would not, I suggest, be essentially different. In its ordinary legal meaning “unlawful” certainly covers crimes and torts (especially intentional torts). Beyond that its scope may sometimes extend to breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and perhaps even matters which merely make a contract unenforceable, but the word’s appropriateness becomes increasingly debatable and dependent on the legal context. In the very important criminal case of <i>R v Clarence</i> (1888)  22 QBD 23 (in which a question of law on sections 20 and 47 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 was argued before a court of 13 judges, several of whom later gave their opinions to the House in <i>Allen v Flood</i>) Stephen J (at p 40) expressed the view that:</p>
<p class="qt">“The word ‘unlawfully’ must here be construed to mean ‘unlawfully’ in the wide general sense in which the word is used with reference to acts which if done by conspirators are indictable, though not if they are done by individuals.  This general sense may, I think, be said to be ‘immoral and mischievous to the public'. I do not agree with the doctrine that the word ‘unlawfully’ is used here in this wide sense. The use of the word in relation to conspiracy appears to me to be exceptional.”</p>
<p class="para">What was exceptional about it was its extension <i>downwards</i> in the scale of blameworthy conduct. The unlawfulness of criminal conduct was at the top end of the scale, and too obvious to call for mention.</p>
<i>
</i><p class="para">92.&nbsp;&nbsp;The enquiry how far <i>downwards</i> to go seems to me to be a feature common to all the leading cases in which the tort of unlawful means conspiracy has been developed. Until Lord Diplock’s speech in <i>Lonrho v Shell</i> there was never a clear issue as to whether the alleged unlawful means must be actionable (as a separate tort) at the suit of the plaintiff. Lord Diplock himself acknowledged this [1982] AC 173, 189. His attention may have been drawn to the point by his earlier disapproval (at p187) of some wide observations made by Lord Denning MR in an interlocutory appeal in <i>Ex parte Island Records Ltd</i> [1978] Ch 122. </p>
<p class="para">93.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long period during which this issue did not arise for decision there is, unsurprisingly, little discussion of it in the authorities. They concentrate on the issue of intention (which was also at the heart of question 5(b) in <i>Lonrho v Shell</i>). But all the statements of general principle in the classic cases seem to me to be consistent with the proposition that unlawful means, both in the intentional harm tort and in the tort of conspiracy, include both crimes and torts (whether or not they include conduct lower on the scale of blameworthiness) provided that they are indeed the means by which harm is intentionally inflicted on the claimant (rather than being merely incidental to it). I do not want to multiply citations but I would instance Lord Watson in <i>Allen v Flood </i>at p96 (emphasising “illegal means <i>directed against</i> that third party”); Viscount Cave LC in <i>Sorrell v Smith</i> at p 714 (“means which are in themselves unlawful, such as violence or the threat of violence or fraud”); Lord Wright in <i>Crofter</i> at p 462 (quoted in para 75 above, and instancing some statutory offences); Lord Devlin in <i>Rookes v Barnard</i> [1964] AC 1129, 1209 (“in some of the dicta [on conspiracies] the language suggests that the means must be criminal or tortious and in others that breach of contract would do; but in no case was the point in issue;” in the earlier much-discussed sentence at p 1204 I would not give much weight to the position that the word “usually” occupies in the sentence); and Lord Denning MR and Russell LJ in <i>Daily Mirror Newspapers Ltd v Gardner</i> [1968] 2 QB 762, 783, 785 (though that decision is questionable: see (1968) 84 LQR 310).</p><i>
</i><p class="para">94.&nbsp;&nbsp;From these and other authorities I derive a general assumption, too obvious to need discussion, that criminal conduct engaged in by conspirators as a means of inflicting harm on the claimant is actionable as the tort of conspiracy, whether or not that conduct, on the part of a single individual, would be actionable as some other tort. To hold otherwise would, as has often been pointed out, deprive the tort of conspiracy of any real content, since the conspirators would be joint tortfeasors in any event (and there are cases discussing the notion of conspiracy “merging” into some other tort, but I need not go far into those: <i>Surzur Overseas Ltd v Koros</i> [1999] 2 LLR 611; <i>Kuwait Oil Tanker Co. SAK v Al Bader</i> [2000] 2 All ER (Comm) 271).</p>
<p class="para">95.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion your Lordships should clarify the law by holding that criminal conduct (at common law or by statute) can constitute unlawful means, provided that it is indeed the means (what Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead in <i>OBG</i> at para 159 called “instrumentality”) of intentionally inflicting harm. In <i>Lonrho v Shell </i>the sanctions order against Southern Rhodesia was part of the story, but it was not the instrument for the intentional infliction of harm. With great respect to Lord Hoffmann (in <i>OBG</i> at para 57) it is in my view what Shell and BP did not intend, rather than what Parliament did not intend, that is most relevant to that decision.</p>
<p class="para">96.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that I would accept that the sort of considerations relevant to determining whether a breach of statutory duty is actionable in a civil suit (<i>Cutler v Wandsworth Stadium Ltd</i> [1949] AC 398) may well overlap, or even occasionally coincide with, the issue of unlawful means in the tort of conspiracy. But the range of possible breaches of statutory duty, and the range of possible conspiracies, are both so wide and varied that it would be unwise to attempt to lay down any general rule. What is important, to my mind, is that in the phrase “unlawful means” each word has an important part to play. It is not enough that there is an element of unlawfulness somewhere in the story.</p>
<p class="hditl">OBG revisited</p>
<p class="para">97.&nbsp;&nbsp;I must now come back to <i>OBG</i> [2007] 2 WLR 920. It was a case about an invalid appointment of receivers in which the appellants sought to widen the scope of the tort of conversion. It was heard with <i>Douglas v Hello! Ltd</i>, which raised issues about breach of confidence, and <i>Mainstream Properties Ltd v Young,</i> a case which might have been run as a claim for dishonest assistance in breach of fiduciary duty. Despite these disparate issues the appeals were heard together because they all raised issues as to the intentional harm tort. In a passage of his opinion with which the majority concurred (paras 45-60) Lord Hoffmann observed in relation to the intentional harm tort (para 49):</p>
<p class="qt">“In my opinion, and subject to one qualification, acts against a third party count as unlawful means only if they are actionable by that third party.  The qualification is that they will also be unlawful means if the only reason why they are not actionable is because the third party has suffered no loss.”</p>
<p class="para">Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead took a different view (paras 149-163).  </p>
<p class="para">98.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Hoffmann stated at para 56:</p>
<p class="qt">“Your Lordships were not referred to any authority in which the tort of causing loss by unlawful means has been extended beyond the description given by Lord Watson in <i>Allen v Flood</i> [1898] AC1, 96 and Lord Lindley in <i>Quinn v Leathem</i> [1901] AC 495, 535. Nor do I think it should be.”</p>
<p class="para">He added at para 57 (on which I have already commented):</p>
<p class="qt">“Likewise, as it seems to me, in a case like [<i>Lonrho v Shell</i>], it is not for the courts to create a cause of action out of a regulatory or criminal statute which Parliament did not intend to be actionable in private law.”</p>
<p class="para">And at para 60:</p>
<p class="qt">“I do not think that the width of the concept of ‘unlawful means’ can be counteracted by insisting upon a highly specific intention, which ‘targets’ the plaintiff.  That, as it seems to me, places too much of a strain on the concept of intention.”</p>
<p class="para">99.&nbsp;&nbsp;These passages (on which Mr Flint relied in his printed case and his oral submissions) prompted me to mention, near the beginning of this opinion, the risk of a new layer of anomaly being added to the tort of conspiracy (that is, that “unlawful means” would have a meaning for the purposes of a conspiracy claim different from its meaning for the purposes of a claim based on the intentional harm tort). But as Lord Hoffmann develops his reasoning in paras 51-58 of his opinion it becomes apparent that he is concerned, not only with the legal quality of the unlawful means (tort or crime?) but also with their effect in interfering with a third party’s freedom of economic action. Cases like <i>RCA Corporation v Pollard</i> [1983] Ch 135 and <i>Isaac Oren v Red Box Toy Factory</i> [1999] FSR 785, show that a trader may suffer economic loss as the result of a civil wrong by a bootlegger actionable by the proprietor (or sometimes, an exclusive licensee) of intellectual property rights, without the trader having a remedy. The breach of the intellectual property rights is a statutory tort, but it is actionable only by those with a sufficient title to them. As I understand his opinion, Lord Hoffmann was concerned to limit the intentional harm tort to cases where the claimant has been “intentionally struck at through others” (in the words of Lord Lindley in <i>Quinn v Leathem</i> [1901] AC 495, 535, quoted by Lord Hoffmann at para 46). He made clear (para 61) that “two party intimidation” raises quite different issues. This point is developed in para 43 of the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Hope of Craighead, and in para 124 of the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Mance, and I respectfully agree with their observations.</p>
<p class="para">100.&nbsp;&nbsp;The intentional harm tort and the “unlawful means” variety of conspiracy share the ingredients of the intentional infliction of harm on the claimant. But that variety of conspiracy is not simply the intentional harm tort committed by joint tortfeasors. The gist of the intentional harm tort (apart from exceptional “two party” cases) is striking at the claimant through a third party, and doing so by interfering with his freedom of economic activity. The gist of conspiracy is damage intentionally inflicted by persons who combine for that purpose (Viscount Simon LC in <i>Crofter</i> at p 444) and the claimant need not be a trader who is injured in his trade, though that is the most common case. In my opinion your Lordships are driven to the conclusion that, as the economic torts have developed, “unlawful means” has a wider meaning in the tort of conspiracy than it has in the intentional harm tort.</p>
<p class="para">101.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some scholars have classified the tort of unlawful means conspiracy as a form of secondary liability (notably Hazel Carty, An Analysis of the Economic Torts (2001) p 22, agreeing with Philip Sales, The Tort of Conspiracy and Civil Secondary Liability [1990] CLJ 491). They would not apply this classification to a conspiracy to injure by lawful means. If an unlawful means conspiracy is indeed a form of secondary liability for a civil wrong then the need for the unlawful means to be actionable as a civil wrong would be self-evident.</p>
<p class="para">102.&nbsp;&nbsp;However the premise is in my opinion mistaken. The best judicial support for it seems to be some comments by Palles CB in <i>Kearney v Lloyd</i> (1889) 26 LR Ir 268, but in <i>Crofter </i>[1942] AC 435, 461-462 Lord Wright said that later cases have decisively held the contrary (this passage immediately precedes the passage which I have set out in para 75 above). Sales’ article was written (like other scholarly comments such as John Eekelaar, The Conspiracy Tangle (1990) 106 LQR 223) in the uneasy period after this House’s decision in <i>Lonrho v Shell</i> and the Court of Appeal’s decision in <i>Metall </i> and before the House’s decision in <i>Lonrho v Fayed</i>. A later well-regarded article by Sales and Stilitz, Intentional Infliction of Harm by Unlawful Means (1999) 115 LQR 411 repeated (at p435) the proposition:</p>
<p class="qt">“It is now clear that conspiracy to injure another by unlawful means is a distinct form of liability, under which the conspirators are made jointly liable for acts committed by one or more of them, which are acts which would be independently actionable by P if committed by only one person.  Unlawful means conspiracy is thus an example of secondary liability, and is quite distinct from the intentional harm tort (for which the unlawful means involved do not have to be actionable independently of the tort itself).”</p>
<p class="para">103.&nbsp;&nbsp;The last part of this passage has been shown to be incorrect by the decision of this House in <i>OBG</i> (see the speech of Lord Hoffmann at paras 59-61). In my opinion the first part of the passage is also unsustainable. The authors cite in support of it <i>Lonrho v Shell; Lonrho v Fayed; Rookes v Barnard; Marrinan v Vibart; </i>and<i> Powell v Boladz.</i> I need not repeat why those authorities do not in my opinion support it, beyond noting the passage relied on in the speech of Lord Bridge in <i>Lonrho v Fayed</i> [1992] 1 AC 448, 466G: </p>
<p class="qt">“As the judgments in both courts below and the speech of Lord Diplock make clear, the fact dictating a negative answer to the second question was the absence of any intention to injure Lonrho. Parker J said:</p>
<p class="qt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The claimants accept that there is no case in which &nbsp;&nbsp;an undirected crime, not itself a civil wrong, &nbsp;&nbsp;committed without intent to injure, has been &nbsp;&nbsp;held, or, I think, even alleged to be actionable on &nbsp;&nbsp;the mere ground that it was committed pursuant to &nbsp;&nbsp;agreement.’”</p>
<p class="para">The whole context of <i>Lonrho v Shell </i>shows that the emphasis in this passage (and the other passages quoted) was on the absence of an intention to injure, and not on the need for an independently actionable wrong.</p>
<p class="para">104.&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, and with great respect to those who take a different view, any suggestion that the unlawful means conspiracy is a form of secondary liability, and must therefore have an actionable wrong as an essential ingredient, seems to me to be a circular argument which assumes what it sets out to prove.</p>
 
<p class="hditl">Is a private law action open to the Commissioners?</p>
<i>
</i><p class="para">105.&nbsp;&nbsp;All the foregoing discussion is academic if, as my noble and learned friend Lord Hope of Craighead would hold, a private law action for damages for conspiracy is not open to the Commissioners. Lord Hope founds his conclusion, as I understand it, not so much on the Bill of Rights 1688 as on the comprehensive and exhaustive nature of the statutory code for the administration and collection of VAT contained in the Value Added Tax Act 1994. My noble and learned friend also considers that the Commissioners have no commercial interests needing to be protected by the tort of conspiracy. This last point was not, so far as I can see, raised by Mr Flint in his written and oral submissions.</p>
<p class="para">106.&nbsp;&nbsp;I respectfully differ from Lord Hope on this part of the case. The Commissioners’ statutory powers are not derived solely from the Value Added Tax Act 1994. They are also derived from the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005, which lays down the Commissioners’ statutory functions in connection with VAT (section 5(1)(b) and (2)(b)). The Commissioners have ancillary powers (section 9) and specific power to conduct civil proceedings (section 25).</p>
<p class="para">107.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commissioners regularly present bankruptcy petitions and winding-up petitions against defaulting taxpayers of all sorts. In a winding up they can if necessary proceed against a receiver for misfeasance (<i>Inland Revenue Commissioners v Goldblatt</i> [1972] Ch 498). They do so in order to recover tax (not to “levy” it). So far as I can see they have no express statutory power to seek these remedies, but it has never been doubted that they are available. Similarly (though your Lordships heard no argument on the point from either side) there does not appear to be any specific statutory power for the Commissioners to obtain a freezing order. But it was only by obtaining a freezing order in private law proceedings that the Commissioners were able to prevent the conspirators from removing their ill-gotten gains out of the jurisdiction. But for a freezing order, there would have been a severe loss to the Commissioners and to the general body of taxpayers.</p>
<p class="para">108.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commissioners’ action in this case has been described in Total’s written and oral submissions as unprecedented. That may be so. The first-ever application for a freezing order (originally called a <i>Mareva</i> injuction) was unprecedented, but it has proved very efficacious in strengthening civil remedies against fraud. In the well-known case of <i>Ramsay v Inland Revenue Commissioners</i> [1982] AC 300, 326, Lord Wilberforce said:</p>
<p class="qt">“While the techniques of tax avoidance progress and are technically improved, the courts are not obliged to stand still. Such immobility must result either in loss of tax, to the prejudice of other taxpayers, or to Parliamentary congestion or (most likely) to both.”</p>
<p class="para">Lord Wilberforce said that in relation to artificial (but not unlawful) tax avoidance which was then costing the Exchequer millions of pounds a year. Your Lordships are now concerned with illegal, fraudulent tax evasion which is costing the Exchequer more than a billion pounds a year. Indeed it is worse than evasion: it is the fraudulent extraction of money from the Exchequer.</p>
<p class="para">109.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commissioners do not now handle large sums of cash, since there are safer means for the transfer of money. But if an official vehicle carrying cash belonging to the Commissioners (cash representing collected taxes) were hijacked and the cash stolen, it seems to me that the Commissioners would undoubtedly have a civil remedy available to reclaim it, if the robbers were apprehended and the proceeds of the robbery traced to a bank account.  In my opinion the present case is essentially the same.</p>
<p class="para">110.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons I disagree with the conclusion of the Court of Appeal on what it called the third issue (paras 80-87 of its judgment). I would therefore, if necessary, have upheld the Commissioners’ fallback position (para 63 above). I would allow the Commissioners’ appeal and dismiss Total’s cross-appeal. </p>

<p>LORD MANCE</p>
<p class="lawlord">My Lords, </p>
<p class="para">111.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the benefit of reading in draft the opinions of my noble and learned friends, Lord Hope of Craighead, Lord Scott of Foscote, Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe and Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury. I gratefully adopt the summary of the facts in paragraphs 3 to 10 of Lord Hope’s and paragraphs 49 and 51 of Lord Scott’s opinions. The questions to which they give rise are (a) whether the pursuit of any claim by the Commissioners against Total Network SL in conspiracy is precluded by (i) the Bill of Rights and/or (ii) the statutory scheme of the Value Added Tax Act 1994 (“the VAT Act 1994”) and (b) whether, if it is not, it can as pleaded exist in law.</p>
<p class="para">112.&nbsp;&nbsp;I will start with issue (b). All of your Lordships are of the view on issue (b) that the Commissioners’ pleaded claim can as pleaded exist in law. The Commissioners put their claim in two alternative ways, as Lord Neuberger explains in paragraphs 142 and 164-167 of his opinion. I agree with him that both are arguable under the domestic and European legal principles that he examines. But I would put this on a narrow basis. </p>
<p class="para">113.&nbsp;&nbsp;One way in which the Commissioners put their case focuses on the non-payment of VAT by Redlaw (£249,054.75) and, to a much lesser extent, Lockparts (£993); the other on the VAT credit which was claimed by, and in respect of which the Commissioners were induced to pay £253,345.50 to, Alldech. The Commissioners allege a conspiracy to cause them loss by unlawful means, consisting of the commission of the common law offence of cheating the public revenue either in respect of the VAT which the Commissioners should have received from Redlaw and Lockparts or out of the VAT credit they were induced to pay to Alldech. It is not, for present purposes, disputed that there is a good case for saying that Total, Redlaw, Lockparts and Alldech were together guilty of this common law offence of cheating the revenue. There is nothing in the scheme of the VAT Act 1994, or in the various civil and criminal remedies for which it provides, to prevent prosecution for the common law offence such as was pursued under the predecessor legislation in <i>R v. Mavji </i>[1987] 2 AER 758. </p>
