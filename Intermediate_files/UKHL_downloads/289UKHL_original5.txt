<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would accordingly reject the suggested analogy.  To have held, as was unsuccessfully argued in <i>Kansal</i> and <i>Alconbury</i>, that a statutory power can never be exercised would be one thing; to say that it must always be exercised is another.  The first, as was decided in those cases, would be to give no effect whatever to the legislation; the second, it is true, would be to convert the power into a duty, but that, as already explained, is often required so as to secure Convention compliant decision-making.  To recognise that the power must invariably be exercised is still "to give effect" to it.  The legislation is not, as it would have been in <i>Kansal</i> and <i>Alconbury</i>, set at nought.  Rather it is to be interpreted as required by section 3 of the 1998 Act: the word "may" is to be construed and applied as "must" whenever this is necessary to achieve Convention compatibility.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120.&nbsp;&nbsp;In deciding this question it should be borne in mind that the wider the ambit given to section 6 (2) the more often will the United Kingdom be acting incompatibly with article 13 of the Convention: the requirement (not incorporated into domestic law) to provide an effective domestic remedy for any breach of the Convention.  This no doubt is the thinking underlying the submissions advanced in the leading textbooks on the 1998 Act that section 6 (2) should be given a narrow construction—consistent with the construction given by this House in <i>Hampson v Department of Education and Science</i> [1991] 1 AC 171 to a comparable provision, section 41 (1)(b) of the Race Relations Act 1976—see <i>Clayton &amp; Tomlinson</i> The Law of Human Rights (2000), vol 1, at para 5.105 A and <i>Grosz, Beatson &amp; Duffy</i> Human Rights: the 1998 Act and the European Convention (2000) at para 4-21.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121.&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows that I reject too Forbes J's reasoning in <i>Friends Provident</i> [2002] 1 WLR 1450: even had it been necessary for Convention compatibility always to exercise the section 77 call in power, that would not in my judgment have given rise to a section 6 (2)(b) defence.  I therefore conclude that this part of Moses J's reasoning in the present case and in <i>Wilkinson</i> is unsound—an issue upon which the Court of Appeal in <i>Wilkinson</i> expressly declined to express a view.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122.&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not follow, however, that the Secretary of State's section 6 (2)(b) defence here (or in <i>Wilkinson</i>) must fail as the Court of Appeal held it must.  All that I have concluded thus far is that, in deciding not to make matching payments to widowers, the authority was not "acting so as to give effect to" their power to make such payments (the Secretary of State's common law discretion in the present case; the commissioners' (wrongly assumed) statutory discretion in <i>Wilkinson</i>).  In short, I have rejected the argument that to hold that the power <i>must</i> be exercised would be to convert the power into a duty and thus destroy it.  That, however, is not the end of the case.  Rather there seems to me a quite separate and distinct argument available to the respondent authority both here and in <i>Wilkinson</i>.  This is the argument that they cannot be required to act in such a way as to subvert the intention of Parliament.  It is on this basis that I would hold that the section 6 (2) defence to be available.  In each case it is plain that Parliament's unambiguous intention was that payments (or allowances) <i>should</i> be made to widows and <i>should not</i> be made to widowers.  The failure of the widowers' section 3 argument in both cases establishes this beyond question.  Despite the Secretary of State's argument set out in para 116 of the Court of Appeal's judgment in the present case—see para 111 above—the position is not, in my judgment, the same as it would have been had the 1992 and 1999 Acts expressly stated:</p>
<p></p><ul>"(i) The Secretary of State may pay benefits to widowers if he chooses so to do."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had those been the circumstances it could plainly not have been said that Parliament's unambiguous intention was that widows only were to be paid.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123.&nbsp;&nbsp;Given Parliament's unambiguous intention in the matter it would seem to me an obvious abuse of power for the Secretary of State to have introduced a scheme to make matching extra-statutory payments to widowers.  Whatever his general common law power to make such payments, he could not lawfully exercise it inconsistently with Parliament's clearly expressed will.  The extra-statutory Criminal Injury Compensation scheme, for example, would not have been lawful had Parliament just rejected a Bill promoted to enact it—consider the analogous situation in <i>R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p Fire Brigades Union</i> [1995] 2 AC 513, in particular Lord Nicholls' analysis, at p 575 H - 576 B.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;124.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for this reason that in my judgment the Secretary of State is entitled to rely on the section 6 (2) defence.  I understand that my Lords prefer to put the case under section 6(2)(b), on the basis that in deciding not to make matching payments the Secretary of State was "acting so as to give effect to" sections 36 and 37 of the 1992 Act, sections mandating payment of the benefits to widows only.  My preference is rather to put it under section 6 (2)(a) on the basis that: "as a result of [sections 36 and 37], the [Secretary of State] could not have acted differently": he had to pay the widows and could not lawfully have made matching payments to widowers.  Either way I conclude that the defence is made out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125.&nbsp;&nbsp;I should say that I have some difficulty in accepting the approach adopted in para 50 of Lord Hoffmann's speech: that the whole case for unlawful discrimination in domestic law collapses because section 6 (1) "does not apply" to the acts of making payments under sections 36 and 37, an essential part of the discrimination complaint.  On this approach, of course, the section 6 (2) defence would apply equally even had the statute conferred on the Secretary of State an express discretion to pay benefits to widowers too.  As already pointed out, the complaint here is not that mandatory payments <i>were</i> made to widows but rather that, despite such payments to widows and the power to make them also to widowers, they were not in fact made to widowers.  An act includes a failure to act (section 6 (6)) and it is that failure which is said to be unlawful under section 6 (1) and which accordingly needs to be immunised under section 6 (2).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;126.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal, I should note, thought that the introduction of the 1998 Act made all the difference to whether it would have been unlawful for the Secretary of State to create a matching scheme for widowers; they held that the 1998 Act <i>required</i> the introduction of such a scheme so as to avoid incompatibility.  I respectfully disagree: such a conclusion to my mind undermines rather than respects the sovereignty of Parliament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;127.&nbsp;&nbsp;I add just this.  The unusual feature of this case and the particular difficulty it presents is that, as a discrimination case, it has two limbs: payment to widows, non-payment to widowers.  It is in this context that the courts have to decide what the sovereignty of Parliament dictates.  Two arguments appear to me to have become entangled in the course of this litigation: one, that the will of Parliament is subverted by treating a power as a duty; the other that the will of Parliament is subverted by paying widowers as well as widows.  The first argument I reject, the second I accept.  It is on that basis that I agree that the section 6 (2) defence applies in this case.</p>
