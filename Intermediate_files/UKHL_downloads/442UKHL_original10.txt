<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;163. The court held that proof, that exposure to a defendant's product was a substantial factor contributing to the risk of developing cancer, was to be equated with proof that the exposure was a substantial factor in causing or bringing about the disease.  Mr Stewart accepted that analysis of the decision.  Allowing for slight differences in terminology, the doctrine espoused by the Californian court is similar to the principle to be derived from <i>McGhee</i> which the appellants contend should be applied in these cases.  There is nothing in the report of the judgment to show that the Supreme Court of California were referred to <i>McGhee</i>.  The fact that, apparently independently, they came to an essentially similar conclusion is powerful corroboration of the approach in <i>McGhee</i> and of its applicability in the present cases.  Mr Stewart criticised <i>Rutherford</i> on the ground that the law should not develop principles to be applied only in the case of asbestos-related illness.  While the court's opinion is indeed couched solely in relation to cases of that kind, the reasoning itself develops from the impossibility of proof inherent in those cases.  There is nothing in that reasoning to suggest that the Supreme Court would refuse to apply a similar approach in other cases where similar irremediable problems of proof of causation arose.  I would therefore reject that criticism, which in any event does not strike at the application of the reasoning in <i>McGhee</i> to cases of mesothelioma.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;164. Counsel referred to many cases decided by the courts of Australia and Canada and Lord Bingham of Cornhill has analysed the most important of them.  Again, they illustrate the very real problem which confronts the law in cases of this kind.  The decisions vary but, overall, they tend to reflect the same rival lines of thinking as are to be found in <i>McGhee</i> and <i>Wilsher</i>.  I merely mention some that are favourable to plaintiffs.  In the classic case of <i>Cook v  Lewis</i> [1951] SCR 830 the Supreme Court of Canada were faced with a situation where the jury in a civil action had been unable to determine which of two huntsmen had fired the shot which injured the plaintiff.  For the majority, Cartwright J held ([1951] SCR 830, 842) that, if the shot had been fired negligently, both should have been held liable.  The fact that, otherwise, the victim would have been remediless appears to have been a factor in the court's decision.  In some more recent cases examples are to be found of courts and judges applying the kind of approach adopted in <i>McGhee</i>:  <i>Birkholtz v R J Gilbertson Pty Ltd</i> (1985) 38 SASR 121, 130 per King CJ; <i>Bendix Mintex Pty Ltd v Barnes</i> (1997) 42 NSWLR 307 per Stein JA dissenting; <i>Chappel v Hart (</i>1998) 195 CLR 232, 244, para 27, per McHugh J dissenting.  I draw support for my view on the applicability of the <i>McGhee</i> principle from these judgments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;165. The Commonwealth cases were supplemented, at your Lordships' suggestion, by a certain amount of material describing the position in European legal systems.  Again I do not repeat Lord Bingham of Cornhill's survey.  The material provides a check, from outside the common law world, that the problem identified in these appeals is genuine and is one that requires to be remedied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;166. So, for instance, the French courts have been particularly exercised by cases, similar to <i>Cook v Lewis</i>, arising out of hunting accidents where the victim is unable to pinpoint which of a group of huntsmen caused his injury.  The law has permitted the victim to recover damages, partly at least by finding that the substantial cause of the victim's injury was some negligence or recklessness of the group as a whole.  The decision of the Second Chamber of the Cour de Cassation in <i>Litzinger c Kintzler </i>D 1957 493 note Savatier is an early example.  I refer to the discussion in W van Gerven, J Lever, P Larouche, <i>Tort Law</i> (2000) pp 442 - 444.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;167. The German position is even more instructive.  Since its inception, Article 830(1) second sentence of the Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch has contained a special provision which in effect provides that, where it cannot be ascertained which of a number of individual wrongdoers caused the victim's injury, each of them is to be held liable:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Haben mehrere durch eine gemeinschaftlich begangene unerlaubte Handlung einen Schaden verursacht, so ist jeder für den Schaden verantwortlich.  Das Gleiche gilt, wenn sich nicht ermitteln lässt, wer von mehreren Beteiligten den Schaden durch seine Handlung verursacht hat."<p></p></ul>
<p>The translation is:</p>
<p></p><ul>"If several persons have caused damage by an unlawful act committed in common, each is responsible for the damage.  The same rule applies if it cannot be discovered which of several participants has caused the damage by his act."<p></p></ul>
<p>The mere fact that the draftsmen of the Code identified the need for a general provision of this type shows that the problem of injury caused by unidentified wrongdoers was thought to be of some significance.  It is, moreover, a problem that is not necessarily to be solved simply by leaving the loss to lie on the victim.  On the other hand, it is equally plain that in Germany the policy is to resolve such difficulties in favour of the claimant on a wide front and, therefore, to do so in many cases where the law in this country would simply hold that he had failed to prove his case.  See, for instance,<i> Motive zu dem Entwurfe eines Bürgerlichen Gesetzbuches für das Deutsche Reich</i> (1888) vol 2, p 738.  That reflects the particular policy choice of German law, which the courts articulate:  BGHZ 25, 271, 274; OLG München MDR 1967, 671, 672.  A good example of this more extensive approach is the case of the lady who fell on an uneven surface and could not establish whether the precise place where she fell was on an unfinished street belonging to the local authority or on land belonging to an individual.  The Bundesgerichtshof held that the provision in Article 830(1) applied and allowed her to recover damages against the individual: BGHZ 25, 271;  van Gerven, <i>Tort Law</i>, pp 444 - 445.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;168. At the very least, the cross-check with these systems suggests that it is not necessarily the hallmark of a civilised and sophisticated legal system that it treats cases where strict proof of causation is impossible in exactly the same way as cases where such proof is possible.  As I have tried to show, there are obvious policy reasons why, in certain cases at least, a different approach is preferable in English law too.  The present are among such cases.  Following the approach in <i>McGhee</i> I accordingly hold that, by proving that the defendants individually materially increased the risk that the men would develop mesothelioma due to inhaling asbestos fibres, the claimants are taken in law to have proved that the defendants materially contributed to their illness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;169. While that is sufficient for the decision of the appeals, Mr Stewart urged that, if minded to apply some version of the principle in <i>McGhee</i>, the House should define its scope.  He pointed out that the speeches in <i>McGhee</i> had left doubt as to the scope of the principle that the House had been applying and the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Wilsher</i> had shown only too clearly that it could be extended too far.  It is indeed plain that, as Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead has observed, considerable restraint is called for in using the principle.  Identifying, at an abstract level, the defining characteristics of the cases where it is, none the less, proper to apply the principle is far from easy.  The common law naturally and traditionally shies away from such generalisations especially in a developing area of the law.  But, having regard to the cases cited by counsel and also, in particular, to the cases and textbooks on the German law referred to in van Gerven's <i>Tort Law</i>, pp 444 - 447 and 459 - 461, I would tentatively suggest that certain conditions are necessary, but may not always be sufficient, for applying the principle.  All the criteria are satisfied in the present cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;170. First, the principle is designed to resolve the difficulty that arises where it is inherently impossible for the claimant to prove exactly how his injury was caused.  It applies, therefore, where the claimant has proved all that he possibly can, but the causal link could only ever be established by scientific investigation and the current state of the relevant science leaves it uncertain exactly how the injury was caused and, so, who caused it.  <i>McGhee</i> and the present cases are examples.  Secondly, part of the underlying rationale of the principle is that the defendant's wrongdoing has materially increased the risk that the claimant will suffer injury.  It is therefore essential not just that the defendant's conduct created a material risk of injury to a class of persons but that it actually created a material risk of injury to the claimant himself.  Thirdly, it follows that the defendant's conduct must have been capable of causing the claimant's injury.  Fourthly, the claimant must prove that his injury was caused by the eventuation of the kind of risk created by the defendant's wrongdoing.  In <i>McGhee</i>, for instance, the risk created by the defenders' failure was that the pursuer would develop dermatitis due to brick dust on his skin and he proved that he had developed dermatitis due to brick dust on his skin.  By contrast, the principle does not apply where the claimant has merely proved that his injury could have been caused by a number of different events, only one of which is the eventuation of the risk created by the defendant's wrongful act or omission. <i>Wilsher</i> is an example.  Fifthly, this will usually mean that the claimant must prove that his injury was caused, if not by exactly the same agency as was involved in the defendant's wrongdoing, at least by an agency that operated in substantially the same way.  A possible example would be where a workman suffered injury from exposure to dusts coming from two sources, the dusts being particles of different substances each of which, however, could have caused his injury in the same way.  Without having heard detailed argument on the point, I incline to the view that the principle was properly applied by the Court of Appeal in <i>Fitzgerald v Lane </i>[1987] 1 QB 781.  Sixthly, the principle applies where the other possible source of the claimant's injury is a similar wrongful act or omission of another person, but it can also apply where, as in <i>McGhee</i>, the other possible source of the injury is a similar, but lawful, act or omission of the same defendant.  I reserve my opinion as to whether the principle applies where the other possible source of injury is a similar but lawful act or omission of someone else or a natural occurrence.</p>
