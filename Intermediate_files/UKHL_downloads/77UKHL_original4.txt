<p class="para">73.&nbsp;&nbsp;But this might not be enough. The race and sex legislation recognise both direct discrimination of that sort, when race or sex or disability is the reason why the landlord behaves as he does, and indirect discrimination, where the landlord imposes some requirement which is ostensibly neutral but has a disproportionate effect on one sex, or one race, and which cannot be justified. The DDA undoubtedly aimed to cover this sort of discrimination too. An obvious example is a ban on dogs in restaurants, which has a disproportionate effect upon blind people who rely upon guide dogs to get about. The White Paper, <i>Ending discrimination against disabled people</i>, 1995, Cm 2729, which preceded the 1995 Act, made it clear in para 4.5 that the intention was to cover such cases.</p>
<p class="para">74.&nbsp;&nbsp;One way of dealing with this would have been to provide for both direct and indirect discrimination in the same way that the race and sex discrimination legislation does. But this was not done. One reason may be that it would not have gone far enough. Restaurant owners may have very good reasons for a general rule banning dogs in their establishments. This would not have helped the blind person who had a very good reason for wanting them to make an exception in his case. The race and sex legislation could simply require that race and sex be ignored when employers and service providers made their decisions. The premise was the race and sex were irrelevant (save in some very narrowly defined circumstances). No special consideration was needed (save in some very narrowly defined circumstances) for a particular sex or a particular race. But if the object of the disability discrimination legislation is to “level the playing field", to enable disabled people to do things that they otherwise would not be able to do, then simply ignoring their disability and asking that they be treated in exactly the same way as non-disabled people will not do. A reasonable adjustment has to be made for the special difficulties which their disabilities present. </p>
<p class="para">75.&nbsp;&nbsp;The question in essence is whether the definition of discrimination in sections 5(1), 20(1) and 24(1) was intended to require employers and suppliers or goods, facilities, services and accommodation to be kinder to disabled people than they would be to others. It could be said that any duty to make reasonable adjustments to cater for the special needs of disabled people is covered, in the employment field by section 6, and in the goods, facilities and services field by section 21. Section 21(1), for example, is apt to cover the guide dog example: it would require the restaurant owner to make an exception for the blind person with a guide dog, without requiring the restaurant owner to let everyone take dogs into his restaurant. Thus, it could be said, sections 5(1), 20(1) and 24(1) were designed only to ensure that disabled people were treated in the same way as non-disabled people in the same situation.</p>
<p class="para">76.&nbsp;&nbsp;One problem with this construction in our context is that there is (or rather was at the material time) no express duty on landlords and others with the power to dispose of premises to make any adjustments to cater for disabled people. To take the narrower construction of section 24(1)(a) would mean that only direct discrimination against disabled people, or against people with a particular disability, would clearly be covered. Indirect discrimination might be included in the concept of treating someone “less favourably” but it would not be clear how far that went. There would be no duty to give special consideration to the needs of disabled people.   </p>
<p class="para">77.&nbsp;&nbsp;The more serious problem with this construction is that Parliament could have chosen a form of words which made it entirely plain that it intended the comparison to be made with people who did not have the disability in question but Parliament deliberately chose a different formulation. The Parliamentary history of what became sections 5(1)(a), 20(1)(a) and 24(1)(a) is very instructive. In view of the acknowledged ambiguity of their wording, and the way in which those provisions reached the statute book, this appears to me to be a case in which the criteria laid down in <i>Pepper v Hart </i>[1993] AC 593, as explained by Lord Bingham in <i>R v Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions </i>[2001] 2 AC 349, 391-2, are not. </p>
<p class="para">78.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill as introduced provided that an employer discriminated against a disabled person if for a reason related to the disability, “he treats him less favourably than he treats or would treat others who do not have that disability” (clause 4(1)(a)). A service provider discriminated if “he treats him less favourably than he treats or would treat other members of the public” (clause 13(1)(a)). The original Bill did not contain anything about premises. These clauses were moved in standing committee in the House of Commons, and the Bill as amended adopted the formula that a person discriminated if “he treats him less favourably than he treats or would treat others who do not have that disability” (clause 18(a)). There matters stood until Report stage in the House of Lords. Then the Minister of State, Department for Education and Employment, Lord Henley, moved a series of amendments to substitute the words “to whom that reason does not or would not apply” for the words “who do not have that disability” in what became section 5(1)(a) and section 24(1)(a), and “others to whom that reason does not or would not apply” for  the words “other members of the public” in what became section 20(1)(a). </p>
<p class="para">79.&nbsp;&nbsp;The history alone is enough to indicate that Parliament did not intend the comparison to be with someone who did not have the disability.  For what it may additionally be worth, it is clear from Lord Henley’s speech in the House that a change of substance and not just of wording was intended (<i>Hansard (HL)</i>, 18 July 1995, col 120):</p>
<p class="para">“Currently the comparison is with the treatment of a person who does not have the disability in question. For example, there may be two employees who cannot type - one because of arthritis and one (who is not disabled) because he has never been taught. Both would argue that he is not treating the disabled person less favourably than someone without that disability. He is treating all people who cannot type in the same way. That argument may well succeed and the person with arthritis would have no ground for complaint, even though the employment was refused for a reason relating to disability.</p>
<p class="para">&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment No. 21 would ensure that the comparison is made with people to whom the reason in question does not apply. It correctly reflects the need to show that the treatment was for a reason relating to the disability and not necessarily the mere fact of disability. Thus if the employer is rejecting people who cannot type he will be treating more favourably those who can. The person with arthritis who did not get the job can show that he or she was treated less favourably than the person with typing abilities who did. The employer may well be able to justify that treatment . . . But at least the disabled person would have to be given the consideration due under the Bill.”</p>
<p class="para">These amendments were welcomed in the House of Lords. A similar explanation was given in the House of Commons when it was invited to agree to the Lords’ amendments: <i>Hansard (HC) </i>31 October 1995, cols 118-9. This was Parliament’s final and considered response to questions raised during the passage of the Bill.</p>
<p class="para">80.&nbsp;&nbsp;This confirms that the construction chosen by the Court of Appeal in <i>Clark v Novacold Ltd </i>was indeed the construction which Parliament intended. There is nothing to suggest that, when Parliament changed all three provisions at the same time, so that they had all the same wording, it was intended that they should have different meanings. The fact that they were all changed at the same time (and that one of them had previously been different from the other two) suggests that they were all intended to have the same meaning. The history also explains why there are three different provisions defining discrimination in exactly the same way. It may well be that Parliament had not understood that the narrow scope for justification in relation to services and premises would give rise to the problems we face in this case. But in the light of the Parliamentary history, I do not think that it is possible, either to hold that <i>Clark v Novacold Ltd </i>was wrongly decided or to distinguish it on the ground that the same words mean something different in the context of employment. They must mean the same throughout, however inconvenient the result may now appear to be.</p>
<p class="para">81.&nbsp;&nbsp;In reaching this conclusion I believe that I am faithfully following the intention of Parliament. I am sorry to be disagreeing with your Lordships, but even more sorry that the settled understanding of employment lawyers and tribunals is to be disturbed as a result of your Lordships’ disapproval of <i>Clark v Novacold</i>. That decision has stood unchallenged for nine years and has not, so far as we are aware, caused difficulty in practice. Furthermore, Parliament has since legislated on the basis that it is correct. The definition of discrimination for employment purposes is now contained in section 3A of the DDA (inserted by the 2003 Amendment Regulations). Section 3A(1) is in the same terms as the old section 5(1). A new section 3A(5) provides: </p>
<p class="paraleft">“A person directly discriminates against a disabled person if, on the ground of the disabled person’s disability, he treats the disabled person less favourably than he treats or would treat a person not having that particular disability whose relevant circumstances, including his abilities, are the same as, or not materially different from, those of the disabled person.” </p>
<p class="paraleft">Direct discrimination of this sort cannot be justified. If the old section 5(1) (now section 3A(1)) had had the narrow scope which your Lordships’ interpretation would give it, it is difficult to see why Parliament needed to introduce section 3A(5). It could simply have repealed the justification provision in section 5(1)(b). </p>
<i><p class="para">“A reason related to his disability”</p>
</i>
<p class="para">82.&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate that, as Lord Neuberger explains, on your Lordships’ interpretation of the comparison required by section 24(1), the closeness of the connection between the person’s disability and the reason for the landlord’s treatment of him becomes less critical. On my interpretation of the comparison, it becomes more important.  There is a remarkably percipient comment forecasting the problem in <i>Disability Discrimination: The Law and Practice</i> (1996, FT Law and Tax, p 162) by Declan O'Dempsey and Andrew Short (incidentally also anticipating <i>Clark v Novacold</i>):</p>
<p class="para">“The absence of a duty to adjust and the limited circumstances in which less favourable treatment can be justified . . . make it particularly important to establish how closely connected the reason must be to the disability in order to come within s 24(1)(a). For example, if a person has been excluded from employment because of his disability, the fact that he has little or no money and is unable to pay a deposit and a month’s rent in advance is, to an extent, related to his disability. As the comparison is to be made with someone ‘to whom that reason does not apply’ rather than someone without that (or any) disability, it is to be made with someone who is able to pay a deposit and a month’s rent. Presumably the DDA does not require landlords to let premises to those unable to pay sums that would be required of any tenant. . . . In such a case the link between the disability and the reason for the treatment is likely to be too remote to satisfy the first part of the definition. Other cases may be less straightforward . . . “</p>
<p class="para">How close, therefore, does the connection have to be between the reason for the landlord’s behaviour and the complainant’s disability?</p>
<p class="para">83.&nbsp;&nbsp;The focus is on the reason why the landlord acted as he did. In a direct discrimination case, the reason may be the disability itself. In other cases, the reason may not be the disability, but the disability may have been the cause of the reason. But that is not necessarily enough. The connection between the disability and the reason must not be too remote. It is not easy to lay down a simple test by which the judge that remoteness. The number of links in the chain may be a pointer.</p><i>
</i><p class="para">84.&nbsp;&nbsp;Another pointer, it seems to me, is whether or not the landlord knew or ought to have known of the disability and of its connection with the reason for the landlord’s decision. Again, in a direct discrimination case, this is obvious. The landlord has failed to let the flat to the disabled person because of the disability. The example given in Standing Committee E was a landlord who refused to let a flat to a disabled woman who was perfectly capable of looking after herself because he feared that in due course she might become a burden (<i>Official Report, Standing Committee E, Disability Discrimination Bill</i>, 28 February 1995, col 453). </p>
<p class="para">85.&nbsp;&nbsp;In an indirect discrimination case, it may be less obvious. The landlord may not know that a particular policy has a disproportionate effect upon disabled people. When he decides on the policy, he is not treating any particular disabled person less favourably for a reason relating to his disability. But if he is told of the effect of that policy, and still applies it to the particular disabled person, then his reason may now be related to the disability in a way which it was not before. Thus, if the landlord has a “no animals” policy, it may not have occurred to him that this will have a disproportionate effect on blind people with guide dogs. If he is simply asked whether a prospective tenant may keep a dog, his refusal has nothing to do with the disability. It has to do with his policy and the reasons for the policy. But if he is told that the prospective tenant is blind, the position alters. He has to think about it. His reason for acting may still be the policy and the reasons for the policy. This was, for example, the position in <i>Williams v Richmond Court (Swansea) Ltd</i> [2006] EWCA Civ 1719, where the landlord refused to allow a stair-lift to be installed for the benefit of (and at the expense of) a disabled tenant. There were several reasons why the claim had to fail, but among them was the fact that the landlord’s reasons for not wanting a stair-lift had nothing to do with the disability.</p><i>
</i><p class="para">86.&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Lord Bingham that to establish liability for the statutory tort of discrimination against a disabled person, it is necessary to show that the alleged discriminator either knew or ought to have known of the disability (not, of course, that in law it amounted to disability within the meaning of the Act). This not only accords with principle. It also accords with the language of the Act in two ways. First, the alleged discriminator is liable if he cannot show that the treatment in question is justified: section 24(1)(b). Justification depends upon his having formed an opinion that one of the specified justifications exists: section 24(2). He could not do that without knowing of the disability. Secondly, although the DDA does not adopt the language of the sex and race discrimination legislation, which talks of less favourable treatment “on grounds of” race or sex, it does require a relationship between the treatment and the disability. This suggests that the person doing the treating must have at least the means of knowing about that relationship.</p>
<p class="para">87.&nbsp;&nbsp;This view is not inconsistent with such previous authority as there is. In <i>Taylor v OCS Group Ltd </i>[2006] EWCA Civ 702, [2006] ICR 1602, a profoundly deaf employee was dismissed for emailing to himself files which he had no authority to see. The Court of Appeal held that to be guilty of unlawful discrimination, the employer had to have a disability-related reason “present to his mind” when dismissing the disabled person. There was no evidence that this employer did; indeed it had never been suggested. Emailing the files had nothing to do with the employee’s deafness.  Nor, of course, had it ever been suggested that the employer did not know that the employee was profoundly deaf. More directly in point is <i>H J Heinz Co Ltd v Kenrick </i>[2000] ICR 491, in which the Employment Appeal Tribunal held that an employee had been dismissed “for a reason which relates to [his] disability” when the employer knew about the symptoms which had led to his prolonged absence through sickness although it did not know the precise diagnosis until afterwards. Lindsay J said this at pp 499-500: </p>
<p class="para">“As we see it, the expression may include a reason deriving from how the disability manifests itself even where there is no knowledge of the disability as such . . . it does require employers to pause to consider whether the reason for some dismissal that they have in mind <i>might </i>relate to disability and, if it might, to reflect upon the Act and Code of Practice before dismissing".</p>
<p class="para">This was a case in which the employer knew all the material facts. There was every reason to think that the reason for the dismissal might be related to a disability. It was not a case where the alleged discriminator did not know and had no reason to know that the reason for his actions might be related to a disability.</p>
<i><p class="para">Answering the factual questions in this case </p>
<p class="para">(a) What is the treatment complained of?</p>
</i><p class="para">88.&nbsp;&nbsp;The treatment complained of is the eviction process as a whole. This began with the service of the Notice to Quit and continued with making and pursuing the claim for possession. This clearly falls within the prohibited acts defined in section 22(3)(c).<i> </i>At each step along the way, the Council had to decide whether or not to proceed.</p>
<p class="para">89.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing much was made in the argument before us of the requirement in section 22(3) that the disabled person be “occupying those premises". It may be that they deserve closer attention another day: can a squatter, for example, claim to be occupying premises when he has not and had never had a lawful right to do so? But although Mr Malcolm was not actually occupying the premises when the Notice to Quit was served, he had evicted the sub-tenants and resumed occupation in April 2005, long before the possession action was tried.   </p>
<i>
<p class="para">(b) What was the reason for the treatment?</p>
</i><p class="para">90.&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate reason for serving the Notice to Quit was the subletting and parting with possession of the flat. The reasons for bringing the possession claim were those set out in the claim form and quoted in para 46 above. Neither was done because of Mr Malcolm’s disability as such. A local authority might well be vulnerable to judicial review if they did not take action against a tenant who did not require to occupy a dwelling as his principal home and had gone so far as to disable himself from doing so by subletting it.</p><i>
<p class="para">(c) Did that reason relate to the disabled person’s disability?</p>
</i><p class="para">91.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have great difficulty in seeing how the Council’s reason for serving the Notice to Quit could have been related to Mr Malcolm’s disability. Although they may have had the means of knowing about his mental illness, there is no evidence at all that either the illness or a potential link with his behaviour was “present to their minds” when that decision was taken, nor that it should have been.</p><i>
</i><p class="para">92.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bringing the possession action, however, was another matter. By that stage they had been told of the illness. They had not yet had Dr Sivathasan’s report, but they had had the letter of 8 July 2004 from Mr Clifford and Dr Sivathasan which was quite sufficient to put them on notice that there might have been a connection between the subletting and the mental illness. If the analysis above is correct, they should at least have addressed their minds to this question and then weighed it up in deciding what action to take. </p><i>
</i><p class="para">93.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event, however, the judge found as a fact that the reason for the treatment, that is the subletting, was not causally related to the illness. On the contrary, it was a “planned decision closely linked with [his] proposed purchase on mortgage as a result of the Right to Buy . . . the error was in the timing of the events because he arranged to sub-let before the purchase had been completed. But I cannot conclude on all the evidence that. . . that it was an irrational act caused by his illness".</p><i>
</i>
<i>
</i><p class="para">94.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal felt able to go behind that finding because they thought it was affected by the judge’s earlier conclusion that Mr Malcolm was not disabled at all. There was, of course, a connection between the two findings. The evidence of his business dealings over that time was one reason for her finding on the first issue. But there was nothing irrational about the decision to sublet. It was done when the purchase was apparently “in the bag". It would enable him to service the mortgage and get some return on the property while he was out of work. The only error was in jumping the gun. The judge was in a much better position than anyone else to form a view of his thinking and motivation at the time. I cannot say that her conclusion on this point was one to which she not entitled to come.</p><i>
</i><p class="para">95.&nbsp;&nbsp;This also suggests that, if the Council had addressed their mind to whether the subletting was related to the mental illness, they too would have reached the conclusion that it was not. The connection would not have displaced the reasons why they had begun the process by serving the Notice to Quit. </p><i>

<i><p class="para">(d) Was the treatment less favourable than the treatment of others to whom that reason did not apply? </p>
 
</i><p class="para">96.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the comparison has to be made with people who had not sublet. Obviously their treatment is more favourable. So were it not for the conclusion I have reached on (c), I would have been bound to conclude that there had been unlawful discrimination (unless it could be justified, which it could not). This does place a huge focus on the reason for the treatment and the closeness of the connection between that reason and the treatment. But it appears that that was the result which Parliament intended. </p><i>
</i><p class="para">(3) <i>What is the consequence of unlawful disability discrimination for the landlord’s right to regain possession?</i></p><i>
</i><p class="para">97.&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn at last to the appellant’s primary argument - that the DDA does not supply a defence to a claim for possession to which the claimant is entitled. The Court of Appeal’s decision in <i>Manchester City Council v Romano (Disability Rights Commission intervening) </i>[2005] 1 WLR 2775 can be distinguished, because that was a case where the court had a discretion whether or not to grant the claim for possession. The health of the tenant has always been a factor in judging whether it is reasonable to do so. The landlord’s obligations under the DDA can be taken into account in that context although they are not determinative. </p>
<p class="para">98.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, where the landlord has the right to possession, Mr Goudie relies upon the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>S v Jacqueline Floyd (Equality and Human Rights Commission intervening) </i>[2008] EWCA Civ 201. Mrs Floyd was the private landlord of premises let to S on an assured tenancy since 1996. There was an outstanding order in earlier proceedings for over £4,000 in unpaid rent. The rent had again fallen into very substantial arrears, which were admitted. It is a mandatory ground for possession under the Housing Act 1988 that at least eight weeks’ rent lawfully due is unpaid at the date of the notice of intended proceedings and of the hearing of the claim. The tenant, S, defended the claim among other things on the ground of his disability, ill-health and old age.  The district judge refused to grant an adjournment in order that his capacity to defend the proceedings could be investigated. In the Court of Appeal it was also argued that the judge should have adjourned in order to investigate a possible defence under the DDA. Rejecting that argument, Mummery LJ, giving the judgment of the court, said this at para 48:</p>
<p class="para">“It is not immediately obvious (a) how the 1995 Act could provide a basis for resisting a claim for possession on a statutory mandatory ground or (b) how a landlord would be unlawfully discriminating against a disabled tenant by taking steps to enforce his statutory right to a possession order for admitted non-payment of rent for 132 weeks. The 1995 Act was intended to provide remedies for disabled people at the receiving end of unlawful discrimination. It was not aimed at protecting them from lawful litigation or at supplying them with a defence to breach of a civil law obligation. Like other anti-discrimination legislation, the 1995 Act created statutory causes of action for unlawful discrimination in many areas, such as employment, the provision of goods facilities and services and the disposal or management of premises, but it did not create any special disability defence to the lawful claims of others, such as a landlord’s claim for possession of premises for arrears of rent.”</p>
<p class="para">Mummery LJ went on to distinguish <i>Floyd </i>from the Court of Appeal’s decision in this case on two grounds. First, the Council here were relying on their contractual right to possession rather than the statutory right in the 1988 Act (para 70).  Second, the Court of Appeal had held that the subletting related to the tenant’s disability. In <i>Floyd, </i>a finding that the reason for the proceedings related to the disability was impossible. It had never been suggested that the reason for the non-payment of rent was disability rather than the tenant’s objection to the increase in rent (paras 70 and 71). The Court remarked upon the urgent need for this House to clarify the scope of the application of the DDA in possession proceedings (para 73).<i> </i> </p>
