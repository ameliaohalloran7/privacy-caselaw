<p class="para">123.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reasons given earlier, I agree that a blanket ban on all joint adoptions by unmarried couples can no longer be justified. Furthermore, there are no obstacles elsewhere in the 1987 Order to simply ignoring article 14(1) of the 1987 order and permitting this couple to apply to adopt jointly. If in due course an adoption order is made, then article 40 will apply. Of course, simply allowing them to apply is very far from granting them the order. Their reasons for not being willing to afford to one another the greater legal security that marriage would bring will require careful scrutiny. Nor does it follow that because a blanket ban infringes their Convention rights, the denial of an adoption order would do so.  </p>
<p class="para">124.&nbsp;&nbsp;I too would allow this appeal and make the declaration proposed by Lord Hoffmann. </p>
<p class="lawlord">LORD MANCE</p>
<p class="mylords">My Lords,</p>
<i><p class="para">General</p>
</i><p class="para">125.&nbsp;&nbsp;The issues on this appeal are whether the absolute bar under the Adoption (Northern Ireland) Order 1987  to joint adoption of the mother’s natural child by the mother and her unmarried opposite sex partner (a) engages articles 8 and 14 of the Human Rights Convention and (b) is, if so, unjustifiably discriminatory. For the reasons given by my noble and learned friends Lord Hoffmann in paragraphs 1 to 29 and 38 of his speech and Lord Hope in his speech as well as those given in paragraphs 131 to 144 below, I consider that both issues would be likely to be answered affirmatively by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg and should thus be answered affirmatively in Northern Ireland. </p>
<p class="para">126.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree with the alternative route identified by Lord Hoffmann in paragraphs 30 to 37 of his speech by which he would, if necessary, be prepared to reach the same conclusion on issue (b). In short, even assuming that the European Court of Human Rights would hold that whether to permit joint adoption of a mother’s natural child by the mother and her unmarried opposite sex partner is a matter within the United Kingdom’s margin of appreciation, this does not resolve the question whether a prohibition on such adoption is at the domestic level compatible with the Convention rights as incorporated into United Kingdom law. In this respect, what Lord Hoffmann says would, as I see it,  be consistent with dicta in Lord Steyn’s leading speech in <i>R (S) v. Chief Constable of the South Yorkshire Police</i> [2004] UKHL 49; [2004] 1 WLR 2196, para. 27, which I cited more fully in <i>M v. Secretary of State for Work and Pensions </i>[2006] UKHL 11, [2006] 2 AC 91, para. 130. Lord Steyn distinguished between article 8(1), which should, in accordance with Lord Bingham of Cornhill’s dictum in <i>R (Ullah) v. Special Adjudicator </i> [2004] UKHL 26, [2004] 2 AC 323, para. 20, in the absence of special circumstances receive a uniform interpretation throughout member states, unaffected by different cultural traditions, and article 8(2), in relation to which differing cultural traditions can be material to the question of objective justification. </p>
<p class="para">127.&nbsp;&nbsp;United Kingdom courts should, normally, follow any “clear and constant jurisprudence of the Strasbourg court” (see <i>Ullah</i>, para. 20) in deciding whether any particular article(s) of the Convention are engaged by particular facts. That was the issue in <i>Ullah </i>and is issue (a) on the present appeal. But issue (b), whether objective justification exists in the context of a particular Contracting State, involves different considerations. The margin of appreciation is a principle which distributes responsibility between the international and national levels. As the Strasbourg court put it in <i>Handyside v. United Kingdom</i> (Application no. 5493/72)<i> </i>(1976) 1 EHRR 737, para. 48:</p>
<p class="qt">“….. the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights [<i>Belgian Linguistic Case (No 2) </i>(1968) 1 EHRR 252, 296, para 10 fine]. The Convention leaves to each Contracting State, in the first place, the task of securing the rights and freedoms it enshrines. The institutions created by it make their own contribution to this task but they become involved only through contentious proceedings and once all domestic remedies have been exhausted (Article 26) ……</p>
<p class="qt">Consequently, Article 10 para. 2 leaves to the Contracting States a margin of appreciation. This margin is given both to the domestic legislator (‘prescribed by law’) and to the bodies, judicial amongst others, that are called upon to interpret and apply the laws in force force [<i>Engel v The Netherlands</i> (1976)  EHRR 684, para. 100; cf., for Article 8(2), <i>De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v Belgium</i> <i>(No 1) </i>(1971) 1 EHRR 373, 412, para. 93, and <i>Golder v United Kingdom </i>(1975) 1 EHRR 524, 539, para. 45).”</p>
<p class="para">At the international level, the margin is not unpoliced by the European Court of Human Rights. The European Court sets its parameters by taking a European view of the acceptability of the aims and proportionality of the measure in issue. But the width of the margin thus identified may vary not only with the nature of the right protected, but also with the extent to which the Court is able to identify a common approach or common standards among member states.  </p>
<p class="para">128.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the domestic level, nothing in the Convention precludes Contracting States from introducing in their constitutions or general laws more extensive protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms than the Convention provides (see article 53 of the Convention). The United Kingdom does not have a written constitution with its own inbuilt protections of fundamental rights. But it has, by the Human Rights Act 1998, incorporated into domestic law the rights contained in the Convention. The Act creates as “part of this country’s law” rights in the same terms as the Convention rights, and the interpretation and impact of those new domestic rights depends upon the 1998 Act: see <i>In re McKerr </i>[2004] UKHL 12; [2004] 1 WLR 807, para. 25 per Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, para. 48 per Lord Steyn and paras. 73 and 75 per Lord Rodger of Earlsferry. Ss. 3, 4 and 6 of the Human Rights Act define the courts’ role in relation to the new domestic Convention rights. Courts must act compatibly with them (unless primary legislation precludes this, when all that courts can do is make a declaration of incompatibility). </p>
<p class="para">129.&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of the new domestic rights scheduled to the 1998 Act is a matter of domestic law, though United Kingdom courts must “take into account” any Strasbourg case-law: s.2(1) of the 1998 Act. But a Strasbourg decision that a matter falls within Contracting States’ margin of appreciation leaves issue (b) to the national authorities of Contracting States. It would be contrary to the Strasbourg court’s purpose, and circular, if national authorities were to take the view that they should not consider any question other than whether a particular solution was within the United Kingdom’s margin of appreciation. Under the 1998 Act, United Kingdom authorities (legislators and courts) have domestically to address the impact of the domestically enacted Convention rights in the particular context of the United Kingdom. </p>
<p class="para">130.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is an exercise which may (as here) fall to be performed in the first instance by the relevant United Kingdom law-makers, but it is subject to United Kingdom courts’ duties of interpretation and review under ss. 3, 4 and 6 of the 1998 Act: see also <i>Kay v. Lambeth London Borough Council</i> [2006] UKHL 10; [2006] 2AC 465, para. 44, where Lord Bingham of Cornhill, speaking of circumstances falling within the margin of appreciation, identified the role of “national authorities, including national courts particularly” in deciding “how the principles expounded in Strasbourg should be applied in the special context of national legislation, law, practice and social and other conditions". In the case of subordinate legislation like the Adoption (Northern Ireland) Order 1987, the application of s.6(1) is not constrained by s.6(2) of the 1998 Act (and no question therefore arises of making a declaration of incompatibility under s.4). In performing their duties under ss. 3 and 6, courts must of course give appropriate weight to considerations of relative institutional competence, that is “to the decisions of a representative legislature and a democratic government within the discretionary area of judgment accorded to those bodies": see <i>Brown v. Stott </i>[2003] 1 AC 681, 703, though the precise weight will depend on inter alia the nature of the right and whether it falls within an area in which the legislature, executive or judiciary can claim particular expertise: see <i>R v. DPP, ex p. Kebilene </i>[2000] 2 AC 326, 381 per Lord Hope of Craighead. </p>
<i><p class="para">The facts</p>
</i>
<p class="para">131.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the House can on the present appeal express no view on the suitability of the particular adoption proposal by the two appellants, such facts as do appear serve to highlight the legal issues. The child was born nearly eleven years ago. The child’s natural father has had no relationship with the mother or child since before the birth and has not contributed financially to the child’s upbringing. The mother’s relationship with her partner, with whom she wishes to be able jointly to adopt the child while maintaining her legal status as mother, dates back to before the child’s birth and has continued uninterrupted since then. All that the House is told about the couple’s reasons for not marrying is that they do not have religious or moral beliefs that require marriage, but do not believe that marriage would aid or strengthen their relationship.</p>
<i>
<p class="para">Issue (a) - are articles 8 and 14 engaged?)</p>
</i>
<p class="para">132.&nbsp;&nbsp;As to issue (a), in order for articles 8 and 14 to be engaged, it is necessary for there to have been discrimination in the exercise of a right engaged by article 8 (here the right to respect for private and/or family life) on a ground such as sex, race, colour, etc “or other status". I agree with Lord Hoffmann that being either married or unmarried is another such “status". In its recent decision in <i>Burden v. United Kingdom </i>(Application no. 13378/05) [2008] ECHR 357, para 63 the Grand Chamber confirmed its previous statement in <i>Shackell v. United Kingdom </i>(Application no. 45851/99) that “marriage remains an institution which is widely accepted as conferring a particular status on those who enter into it". The discrimination alleged was in <i>Shackell </i>the grant of limited social security benefits to surviving spouses not available to unmarried couples and in <i>Burden</i> the grant to married couples and civil partners of inheritance tax exemptions not available to the survivor of co-habiting siblings. The discrimination was in each case regarded as justified. The Court in <i>Burden </i>put the matter as follows (paragraph 65):</p>
<p class="qt">“Just as there can be no analogy between married and Civil Partnership Act couples, on one hand, and heterosexual or homosexual couples who choose to live together but not to become husband and wife or civil partners, on the other hand (see Shackell, above), the absence of such a legally binding agreement … renders their relationship of co-habitation, despite its long duration, fundamentally different to that of a married or civil partnership couple.” </p>
<p class="para">133.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Shackell </i>and <i>Burden </i>were decisions in the context of taxation and social benefits, where the right to which the alleged discrimination related was the right to protection of property provided under article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. The present appeal arises in the different context of the right to respect for private and family life, in relation to which it is clear that distinctions between married and unmarried persons may be unjustifiably discriminatory. Lord Hoffmann has in paragraph 9 cited paragraph 28 of the Court’s ruling in <i>P. M. v. United Kingdom </i>(Application no. 6638/03) (2005) 18 BHRC 668, which demonstrates that differences in marital status may, even in the context of article 1 of Protocol No. 1, be unjustifiably discriminatory. In that case, the unjustified discrimination consisted of unequal tax treatment of payments made by an unmarried father to support the child of a former relationship, compared with similar payments made by a father who had been married and was now separated or divorced. The Court in paragraph 28 also noted that “as a general rule unmarried fathers, who have established family life with their children, can claim equal rights of contact and custody with married fathers (see <i>Sahin v. Germany </i>(2001) 36 EHRR 765, para 94". <i>Sahin </i>was a case like the present where the alleged discrimination consisted of lack of appropriate respect for the applicant’s family life; the Court concluded that there had been a breach of article 8 read with 14. In my opinion, articles 8 and 14 are also engaged in the present case.</p>
<i><p class="para">Issue (b) - was there unjustifiable discrimination?</p>
</i><p class="para">134.&nbsp;&nbsp;The present case concerns the strengthening and deepening of private and family relationships that can arise on all sides from adoption. Adoption cements a family unit. It gives the child maintenance rights against the adoptor(s). It makes the child a member of the adoptor(s)’ wider family, and confers inheritance rights in that connection. It is a process in relation to which the child’s well-being ought to be paramount. The fact that proposed adoptors are a married couple is on any view a material factor. Society is entitled to place weight on the existence of such a bond. But that does not mean that every married couple are suitable or every unmarried couple unsuitable as adoptors. A close scrutiny of all the circumstances is required in the particular  child’s interests before any adoption can be sanctioned. A couple’s decision to remain unmarried cannot determine what is in the child’s best interests. In today’s world, failure to tie the knot is not to be equated with lack of actual commitment; and one would have thought that a joint wish to adopt was itself, at least to some extent, a counter-balancing factor. The threshold criterion of marriage which exists under the Northern Irish legislation looks at the matter in terms of the couple’s decision whether or not to marry, rather than from the viewpoint of the child or the potential benefits of joint adoption for the child.  It excludes all possibility of adoption by all unmarried couples, however long-standing and stable their relationship It precludes any second stage: any scrutiny at all of the circumstances, the needs or the interests of the particular child. The legislation distinguishes between a married and an unmarried couple, both equally suitable as adoptors, purely on the basis of marital status. The line drawn does not avoid the need for a second stage scrutiny where adoption is possible. It simply makes adoption and the security and benefits which it would bring for the child impossible in the case of this child unless the couple marry.</p>
<p class="para">135.&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation is thus in my view unjustifiably discriminatory on any objective assessment in a manner which cannot in a United Kingdom or Northern Irish context be reconciled with the respect for private and family life protected by article 8 read with article 14. The rights of family and private life engaged and the interests of the children potentially affected merit a high level of legal and judicial protection. Objections to joint adoption by an unmarried couple face the problem that adoption by either one of such a couple is anyway permissible. Objections to cohabitation focus on the wrong point, quite apart from their Canute-like qualities. I share the view of Baroness Hale of Richmond (in paragraphs 121 and 122 of her speech) that cultural differences between Northern Ireland and Great Britain cannot justify a diametrically opposite approach to the possibility of adoption by an unmarried opposite sex couple in a child’s interests. The Department of Health and Social Services and Public Safety of Northern Ireland has in its January 2007 report on the responses to its 2006 consultation document <i>Adopting the Future </i>demonstrated the difficulty of defending the present position in relation to Northern Ireland. I would further agree specifically with what Lord Hoffmann says in these respects in paragraphs 10 to 20 of his speech.</p>
<p class="para">136.&nbsp;&nbsp;I consider that the Court’s decisions in <i>Fretté v. France</i> (Application no. 36515/97) and <i>E.B. v. France</i> (Application no. 43546/02) are more easily reconciled and present less difficulty than might at first sight appear. In <i>Fretté v. France</i> the same two general issues arose as on the present appeal: (a) were articles 8 and 14 engaged? And (b) if so, had there been unjustifiable discrimination? As to issue (a) a majority of the judges (consisting of the sole judge apparently subscribing to the actual reasoning of the main judgment, Judge Kuris) and the three authors of the partially dissenting opinion (Sir Nicolas Bratza and Judges Fuhrmann and Tulkens) took the view that articles 8 and 14 of the Convention were engaged by the refusal, attributed to Mr Fretté’s sexual orientation, to allow Mr Fretté to adopt: see paragraphs 33 and O-II1 (and also the analysis in paragraph 14 of the Joint Committee on Human Rights in its 24th Report on the Adoption and Children Bill: HL Paper 177, HC 979). The minority view on this point expressed by Judge Costa, joined  by Judges Jungwiert and Traja, rested essentially on the consideration that the Convention does not guarantee a right to adopt: see paragraph O-I8 to 11 and Judge Costa’s own analysis in his later dissenting judgment in <i>E.B. v. France</i> at paragraph 3. </p>
<p class="para">137.&nbsp;&nbsp;As to issue (b) in <i>Fretté v. France</i>, Judge Kuris held that the difference in treatment was justified so that there was no unjustifiable discrimination (paragraph 43). Sir Nicolas Bratza and Judges Fuhrmann and Tulkens considered that there had been unjustifiable discrimination, while Judge Costa, joined by Judges Jungwiert and Traja, said that if he had had to decide the issue, he “would have been very hesitant” (paragraph O-I15) and that “the fundamental paradox of this judgment seems to me that it would have been easier to justify the rejection of the complaint on the legal basis of the inapplicability of Art. 14 than to declare Art. 14 applicable and then find no breach of it” (paragraph O-I18). There appears therefore (contrary to the analysis in paragraph 15 of the Joint Committee Report mentioned above) to have been no majority in favour of the view that, if articles 8 and 14 were engaged, the discrimination was justifiable. The majority in favour of dismissing the complaint consisted of one (minority) judge (Judge Kuris) on issue (b) joining with three minority judges (Judges Costa, Jungwiert and Traja) on issue (a). The composite finding that there was no violation of articles 8 and 14 therefore certainly has a paradoxical aspect. Had the two issues, (a) and (b), been taken separately, it appears that there would have been (different) majorities on each issue in favour of the applicants’ case that there had been a violation of articles 8 and 14 read together. </p>
<p class="para">138.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>E.B. v. France</i> the French authorities had refused to authorise a woman living in a lesbian relationship to adopt a child, having regard to “her current lifestyle: unmarried and cohabiting with a female partner", who they also noted “did not feel committed” by the proposal. The majority of the European Court of Human Rights treated <i>Fretté v. France</i> - wrongly, it appears to me - as a case where, taking account of the broad margin of appreciation to be left to States, the refusal to authorise adoption had not infringed the principle of proportionality and had been objectively justified. On this basis, the majority sought to distinguish <i>Fretté v. France </i>on the facts, pointing inter alia to “the applicant’s qualities and child-raising and emotional capacities” and to her “stable and permanent relationship” with her partner “which was a factor that had not featured in the application lodged by Mr Fretté” (paragraph 71). Finding that “the influence of the applicant’s avowed homosexuality … was a decisive factor leading to the decision to refuse her authorisation to adopt” (paragraph 89), the majority held that there had been unjustifiable discrimination under Article 8 read with 14. </p>
<p class="para">139.&nbsp;&nbsp;Judge Costa wrote a dissenting opinion, in which he was joined by three other judges. His dissent considered <i>Fretté v. France</i>, of which he said (paragraph 3) that: </p>
<p class="qt">“…. whilst I did vote with the majority in favour of finding that there had not been a violation that was because, in my view, the Articles of the Convention relied on were not applicable because the Convention does not guarantee a right to adopt (but the Chamber did not agree with my reasoning on that point, and I will not go into it again here - <i>perseverare diabolicum</i>)".</p>
<p class="para">So, instead of repeating his stance in <i>Fretté v. France</i>, he accepted in <i>E.B. v. France</i> that articles 8 and 14 were engaged. But he considered that on its facts<i> </i>the French authorities’ decision could be justified by reference to the applicant’s partner’s disinterest in the adoption plan. </p>
<p class="para">140.&nbsp;&nbsp;In paragraph 3 of his judgment in <i>E.B. v. France</i>, Judge Costa confirmed that he had not subscribed to the reasoning of the “majority” of the Chamber in <i>Fretté v. France </i>that the French authorities’ rejection of Mr Fretté’s application for authorisation to adopt could be justified under articles 8 and 14, if these were engaged. He described the judgment of the Grand Chamber in <i>E.B. v. France </i>as one which “overturns” the “majority” of the Chamber in <i>Fretté v. France </i>on this aspect. But it appears that in fact, as explained above, only one member of the seven-judge Chamber in <i>Fretté v. France </i>rejected the complaint on the basis that the discrimination was justified. </p>
<p class="para">141.&nbsp;&nbsp;In both <i>Fretté v. France </i>and <i>E.B. v. France </i>the complaint was of unjustified discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. In the present case the complaint is of unjustified discrimination, consisting of the absolute bar to joint adoption of the mother’s natural child by the unmarried opposite sex appellant couple and relating to the right to respect for private and/or family life based on article 8 read with article 14. It is clear that differing religious and social attitudes have affected and continue to affect thinking in the wider European area. A Council of Europe questionnaire, replies to which were summarised in the European Committee on Legal Co-operation’s final activity report dated 22 March 2004 yielded information that 10 out of 23 States were not opposed to the joint adoption of a child by heterosexual cohabitees, if they had lived together for a considerable time, and 12 were against it, while one took no position on the point. 5 were not opposed to the joint adoption of a child by homosexuals living together in a registered partnership, 17 were against it, and one again took no position.</p>
<p class="para">142.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council of Europe’s Convention on the Adoption of Children (24.IV.1967) remains in terms which provide positively that “the law shall not permit a child to be adopted except by either persons married to each other, whether they adopt simultaneously or successively, or by one person” (article 6(1)). The United Kingdom partially denounced the Convention, in order to be able to permit adoption on a wider basis, as is now possible in England and Wales and will shortly be in Scotland as a consequence of the Adoption and Children (Scotland) Act 2007, s 29.  Further, there are moves to amend the Convention. In the final activity report of 22 March 2004 and again on 1 March 2006 internal working groups or committees of the Council of Europe suggested a relaxation of the Convention to permit adoption by “two persons of a different sex married to each other or living together in a relationship for at least 5 years without being married". Instead of this, on 7 May 2008 the 118th Session of the Committee of Ministers adopted a new draft Convention, which would if ratified permit a child to be adopted by different sex married couples or (where such an institutions exists) registered partners, but would also provide that</p>
<p class="qt">“States are free to extend the scope of this Convention to same sex couples who are married to each other or who have entered into a registered partnership together. They are also free to extend the scope of this Convention to different sex couples and same sex couples who are living together in a stable relationship.”</p>
<p class="para">143.&nbsp;&nbsp;What support this draft Convention may obtain remains to be seen. It is in terms drafted presumably with an eye to achieving as much international support as possible. The Strasbourg court would not be under the same constraints. While the Strasbourg court would no doubt take close note of its provisions and background, it would not be bound by them, and would be bound to analyse the position under the Human Rights Convention for itself. For reasons I have given, I consider that the barrier to adoption presented by the present Northern Irish legislation cannot be justified in terms of that Convention, and that the European Court of Human Rights would be likely to reach that conclusion. If I am wrong on this, and if that Court would take the view that the present restriction on adoption falls within the margin of appreciation open to national authorities, then it is, as I have explained in paragraphs 128 to 130 above, for United Kingdom courts to assess whether objective justification exists for discrimination engaging private and family life, giving due weight to the role of the legislator, and the policy choices made (before the Human Rights Act 1998) in ss. 14 and 15(1) of the Adoption (Northern Ireland) Order 1987 and the consideration that the legislator has to date left those choices unchanged (apart from the ill-judged amendment of s 15(1)(a) by the Civil Partnership Act 2004 to exclude a civil partner from making a sole application, without giving civil partners any joint right to apply). For reasons indicated above (in particular in paragraphs 134 and 135), I would conclude that no such objective justification exists. </p>
