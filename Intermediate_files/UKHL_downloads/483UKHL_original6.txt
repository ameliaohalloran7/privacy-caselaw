<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;148. The scope of article 6 accordingly extends to administrative determinations as well as judicial determinations.  But, putting aside criminal proceedings with which we are not here concerned, the article also requires that the determination should be of a person's civil rights and obligations.  The concept of civil rights in article 6(1) is an autonomous one (<i>König v Federal Republic of Germany</i> (1978)  2 EHRR 170.  In <i>H v France</i> (1989)  12 EHRR 74, para 47 the court stated: </p>
<p></p><ul>"It is clear from the court's established case law that the concept of 'civil rights and obligations' is not to be interpreted solely by reference to the respondent state's domestic law and that article 6(1) applies irrespective of the parties' status, be it public or private, and of the nature of the legislation which governs the manner in which the dispute is to be determined; it is sufficient that the outcome of the proceedings should be 'decisive for private rights and obligations'." <p></p></ul>
<p>It relates to rights and obligations "which can be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law" (<i>James v United Kingdom</i> (1986)  8 EHRR 123, para 81).  The rights with which the present appeals are concerned are the rights of property which are affected by development or acquisition.  Those clearly fall within the scope of "civil rights."  But there is no issue about the existence of these rights and no determination of the rights in any strict sense is raised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;149. The opening words of article 6(1) are "In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him…."  Here again a broad interpretation is called for.  The decision need not formally be a decision on the rights. Article 6 will still apply if the effect of the decision is directly to affect civil rights and obligations.  In <i>Le Compte, Van Leuven &amp; De Meyere </i>4 EHRR 1, para 46 the court observed:</p>
<p></p><ul>"it must be shown that the 'contestation' (dispute) related to 'civil rights and obligations', in other words that the 'result of the proceedings' was 'decisive' for such a right."<p></p></ul>
<p>The dispute may relate to the existence of a right, and the scope or manner in which it may be exercised (<i>Le Compte</i>, at paragraph 49, also <i>Balmer-Schafroth v Switzerland</i> (1997)  25 EHRR 598).  But it must have a direct effect of deciding rights or obligations.  The court continued, at paragraph 47:</p>
<p></p><ul>"As regards the question whether the dispute related to the above-mentioned right, the court considers that a tenuous connection or remote consequences do not suffice for article 6 (1) in either of its official versions ('contestation sur'; 'determination of'): civil rights and obligations must be the object - or one of the objects - of the 'contestation' (dispute): the result of the proceedings must be directly decisive for such a right."  <p></p></ul>
<p>That case was followed in <i>Sporrong and Lönnroth v Sweden</i> (1982)  5 EHRR 35, where at paragraph 80 the court noted that article 6(1) extended to a dispute concerning "an administrative measure taken by the competent body in the exercise of public authority."  It is also said that the dispute must be "genuine and of a serious nature": <i>Benthem v The Netherlands</i> (1985)  EHRR 1, para 32.  In that case a genuine and serious dispute was held to have arisen "at least" from the date when the licence which the applicant had earlier obtained from the local municipality was cancelled by the Crown. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;150. It is thus clear that article 6(1) is engaged where the decision which is to be given is of an administrative character, that is to say one given in an exercise of a discretionary power, as well as a dispute in a court of law regarding the private rights of the citizen, provided that it directly affects civil rights and obligations and is of a genuine and serious nature.  It applies then to the various exercises of discretion which are raised in the present appeals.  But while the scope of the article extends to cover such discretionary decisions, the particular character of such decisions cannot be disregarded.  And that particular factor has important consequences for the application of the article in such cases.</p>
<i></i><p><i>Compatibility with the Convention</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;151. If one was to take a narrow and literal view of the article, it would be easy to conclude that the respondents are correct and that the actions of the Secretary of State are incompatible with the article.  It is accepted that he does not constitute an impartial and independent tribunal.  In the context of a judicial proceeding that may well be fatal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;152. The first point to be noticed here, however, is that the opening phrase in article 6(1), "in the determination", refers not only to the particular process of the making of the decision but extends more widely to the whole process which leads up to the final resolution.  In  <i>Zumtobal v Austria </i>(1993) 17 EHRR 116, para 64 the Commission under reference to <i>Ettl </i>v <i>Austria</i> (1987)  10 EHRR 255 paras 77 et seq, recalled that:</p>
<p></p><ul>"article 6(1) of the Convention does not require that the procedure which determines civil rights and obligations is conducted at each of its stages before tribunals meeting the requirements of this provision.  An administrative procedure may thus precede the determination of civil rights by the tribunal envisaged in article 6(1) of the Convention."<p></p></ul>
<p>It is possible that in some circumstances a breach in one respect can be overcome by the existence of a sufficient opportunity for appeal or review.  While the failure to give reasons for a decision may in the context of some cases constitute a breach of the article, the existence of a right of appeal may provide a remedy in enabling a reasoned decision eventually to be given and so result in an overall compliance with the article.  In the context of criminal cases article 6 will bite when a charge has been made, which could be long in advance of the trial or any subsequent appeal at which the actual resolution of the issue of guilt or innocence is made.  In the civil context the whole process must be considered to see if the article has been breached.  Not every stage need comply.  If a global view is adopted one may then take into account not only the eventual opportunity for appeal or review to a court of law, but also the earlier processes and in particular the process of public inquiry at which essentially the facts can be explored in a quasi-judicial procedure and a determination on factual matters achieved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;153. Next, account has to be taken of the context and circumstances of the decision.  Here an important distinction has been made by the European Court of Human Rights.  The distinction was explained in the context of medical disciplinary proceedings in <i>Albert and Le Compte v Belgium</i> (1983) 18 EHRR 533.  In paragraph 29 of the judgment the court observed:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In many member states of the Council of Europe, the duty of adjudicating on disciplinary offences is conferred on jurisdictional organs of professional associations.  Even in instances where article 6(1) is applicable, conferring powers in this manner does not in itself infringe the Convention.  Nonetheless, in such circumstances the Convention calls at least for one of the two following systems: either the jurisdictional organs themselves comply with the requirements of article 6(1), or they do not so comply but are subject to subsequent control by a judicial body that has full jurisdiction and does provide the guarantees of article 6(1)."<p></p></ul>
<p>The court has recognised that planning decisions fall into a "specialised area" (<i>Chapman v United Kingdom </i>Application No 27238/95 (unreported) 2001) and have applied this distinction in relation to such decisions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;154. As regards the first of the two systems referred to in <i>Albert</i> <i>and Le Compte</i>, where the "jurisdictional organ" is the Secretary of State it cannot be said that the requirements of Article 6(1) are met.  So it is the second system which falls to be considered in the present context.  In the first place consideration has to be given to the expression "full jurisdiction."  At first sight the expression might seem to require in every case an exhaustive and comprehensive review of the decision including a thorough review of the facts as well as the law.  If that were so a remedy by way of a statutory appeal or an application to the supervisory jurisdiction of the courts in judicial review would be inadequate.  But it is evident that this is not a correct understanding of the expression.  Full jurisdiction means a full jurisdiction in the context of the case.  As Mr N Bratza stated in his concurring opinion in<i> </i>the decision of the Commission in <i>Bryan v United Kingdom</i> (1995) 21 EHRR 342, p 354:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It appears to me that the requirement that a court or tribunal should have 'full jurisdiction' cannot be mechanically applied with the result that, in all circumstances and whatever the subject matter of the dispute, the court or tribunal must have full power to substitute its own findings of fact, and its own inferences from those facts, for that of the administrative authority concerned."<p></p></ul>
<p>The nature and circumstances of the case have accordingly to be considered before one can determine what may comprise a "full jurisdiction."  In the very different context of disciplinary proceedings a more exhaustive remedy may be required in order to satisfy article 6(1). In <i>Le Compte, Van Leuven &amp; De Meyers </i>5 EHRR 533 in the context of medical disciplinary proceedings the court stated, at paragraph 51:</p>
<p></p><ul>"For civil cases, just as for criminal charges, article 6(1) draws no distinction between questions of fact and questions of law.  Both categories of question are equally crucial for the outcome of proceedings relating to 'civil rights and obligations'.  Hence, the 'right to a court' and the right to a judicial determination of the dispute cover questions of fact just as much as questions of law."<p></p></ul>
<p>In that case the article was held not to be satisfied since the Court of Cassation had no jurisdiction to rectify factual errors or to examine whether the sanction was proportionate to the fault.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;155. I turn then next to consider whether in the circumstances of the present cases as they presently stand the opportunities for appeal and review are such as to constitute a full jurisdiction.  Guidance here may be found in <i>Bryan v United Kingdom </i>21 EHRR 342 where the court, echoing a passages from the opinion of Mr N Bratza in the Commission (see p 354) stated, at paragraph 45, that in assessing the sufficiency of the review available:</p>
<p></p><ul>"it is necessary to have regard to matters such as the subject matter of the decision appealed against, the manner in which that decision was arrived at, and the content of the dispute, including the desired and actual grounds of appeal."<p></p></ul>
<p>These three matters may be considered separately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;156. First, the subject matter of the decisions are in each case matters of planning determination in relation to proposed developments which are of some considerable public importance.  As planning decisions, even if they were not of some size and importance, they fall within what the court has recognised as a specialised class of case (<i>Chapman v United Kingdom</i> Application No 27238/95, 18 January 2001).  The rights affected are principally rights to use land, which may be the subject of development or of compulsory acquisition. Moreover the right to use land is not an absolute right.  It is under the domestic law subject to the controls of the planning regime, whereby permission may be required for the carrying out of a development or for the making of some change of use.  Planning permission is not in general a matter of right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;157. So far as the manner in which the decisions will be taken is concerned it is to be noticed that in each case there will be a public inquiry before an inspector.  That will be an occasion for the exploration of the facts, including the need and desirability of the development.  The inquiry will be regulated by rules whose broad intention is to secure fairness in the procedure.  The eventual decision in the present cases is to be taken by the Secretary of State.  A remedy by way of appeal or judicial review is available, and there may be opportunities for judicial review at earlier stages as indeed is demonstrated in the present appeals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;158. So far as the content of the dispute is concerned, the present point is that the Secretary of State should not be the decision-maker.  The challenge is advanced substantially as one of principle, although in relation to the Huntingdonshire case a variety of particular points were raised regarding the interest or involvement in the Alconbury proposals on the part of various persons connected with the department or the Government.  But I find it unnecessary to explore these in detail.  The Secretary of State is admittedly not independent for the purposes of article 6(1).  I do not consider that it can be decided at this stage whether the interest or involvement of these other persons is going to provide grounds for challenging the legality of the eventual decision. Grounds for challenge which are at present unpredictable may possibly arise in due course.  As matters presently stand the issue is whether article 6(1) is necessarily breached because the decision is to be taken by the Secretary of State with the assistance of his department.  The challenge is directed not against the individual but against the office which he holds.  The question which arises is whether the Secretary of State or some person altogether unconnected with the Secretary of State should make the decision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;159. As I indicated at the outset, Parliament, democratically elected, has entrusted the making of planning decisions to local authorities and to the Secretary of State with a general power of supervision and control in the latter.  Thereby it is intended that some overall coherence and uniformity in national planning can be achieved in the public interest and that major decisions can be taken by a minister answerable to Parliament.  Planning matters are essentially matters of policy and expediency, not of law.  They are primarily matters for the executive and not for the courts to determine. Moreover as matter of generality the right of access to a court is not absolute.  Limitations may be imposed so long as they do not so restrict or reduce the access that the very essence of the right is impaired (<i>Tinnelly &amp; Sons Ltd v United Kingdom</i> (1998)  27 EHRR 249, para 72).  Moreover the limitation must pursue a legitimate aim and the relationship between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved must be reasonably proportionate (<i>Ashingdane v United Kingdom</i> (1985)  7 EHRR 528).  In the context of the present cases the aim of reserving to a minister answerable to Parliament the determination of cases which will often be of very considerable public interest and importance is plainly a legitimate one.  In light of the considerations which I have already canvassed it seems to me that there exists a reasonable balance between the scope of matters left to his decision and the scope of the control possessed by the courts over the exercise of his discretionary power.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;160. Accordingly as matters presently stand I find no evident incompatibility with article 6(1).  That view seems to me to accord fully with the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights.  A consideration of the cases on the specialised area of town and country planning to which I now turn  suggests that the court has recognised the sufficiency of a limited appeal and the decisions fully support the view which I have expressed.  It was correctly pointed out that the court is always careful to relate its decisions to the facts of the case before it.  But that does not mean that the cases do not or cannot provide guidance by way of close precedent or principle.  I turn first to <i>Bryan v United Kingdom</i> 21 EHRR 342.</p>
161. <i></i><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bryan</i> concerned an enforcement notice for the demolition of two agricultural buildings which had the appearance of large detached houses.  The scope of the appeal open to the applicant was on points of law.  One ground of his complaints, referred to as ground (b), was on the decision as matter of fact and degree, whether the buildings could be considered to have been designed for the purposes of agriculture.  That ground was not pursued before the High Court on appeal.  It was a question of fact and degree.  The European Court of Human Rights held that the other grounds had all been dealt with by the High Court, and continued, at paragraph 47:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Furthermore, even if the applicant had sought to pursue his appeal under ground (b), the court notes that, while the High Court could not have substituted its own findings of fact for those of the inspector, it would have had the power to satisfy itself that the inspector's findings of fact or the inferences based on them were neither perverse or irrational."<p></p></ul>
<p>It is evident from this decision that where there was an inquiry before an inspector who could not be regarded as "independent", but nevertheless  with "uncontested safeguards" attending the procedure which  were open to review by the High Court, the limitations of the eventual remedy by way of appeal, limitations which equate with those attending a judicial review, did not mean that the requirements of article 6(1) were not satisfied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;162. I do not consider that <i>Bryan</i> can be put aside as distinguishable on its facts, nor that its importance is confined to its own particular circumstances.  The Divisional Court made a distinction between a decision taken by an inspector and one taken by the Secretary of State. That appears to have been one of the three considerations which weighed with the Lord Ordinary (MacFadyen) in <i>County Properties Ltd v The Scottish Ministers  </i> 2000 SLT 965 in distinguishing the case.  It seems to me that this difference is too slight to be of serious consequence.  The Secretary of State is admittedly not independent. The inspector also lacks independence.  As was pointed out by the Commission in paragraph 42 of their opinion in <i>Bryan</i>, he was chosen for the staff of the Planning Inspectorate which served the Secretary of State in the furtherance of the Secretary of State's policies, he was making the decision on behalf of the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of State's policies could be at issue in the appeal.  The court held, at paragraph 38, that the very existence of a power in the Secretary of State was "enough to deprive the inspector of the requisite appearance of independence."  But that is not to say that the institutional link with the Secretary of State is not also of significance.  The court in <i>Bryan,</i> at paragraph 42, noted that a remedy would lie if the inspector showed some lack of independence of judgment, or had otherwise not acted fairly, or had been subjected to improper pressure.  Those grounds should also apply to a review of a  decision by the Secretary of State.  In so far as the Divisional Court sought to distinguish <i>Bryan</i> I am not persuaded that they were correct. But in any event the case does not stand on its own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;163. In <i>ISKCON v United Kingdom </i>Application No 20490/92, 8 March 1994, an enforcement notice had been served by the local authority on the grounds of an alleged change of use of land.  Again the complaint was made by the applicant before the Commission that the review by the High Court was limited to questions of law.  The Commission noted that the discretion of the local authority in taking enforcement proceedings was subject to certain statutory limitations, that the High Court had dealt with each of ISKCON'S grounds of appeal and that a challenge was available on the grounds that the findings of fact were unsupported by the evidence, that actual facts had not been taken into account, or that account had been taken of immaterial facts, or that the decision was irrational.  The Commission held that review by the High Court satisfied the requirements of article 6(1).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;164. The decision in <i>Bryan </i>was followed in <i>Varey v United Kingdom </i> Application No 26662/95 (unreported) 27 October 1999, where the Secretary of State had overruled recommendations made by inspectors after a public inquiry.  Recalling <i>Bryan</i> the Commission, at paragraph 86, had regard: "in particular to the court's finding that in the specialised area of town planning law full review of facts may not be required by article 6(1)" and held that the scope of review available in the High Court was sufficient to comply with that article.  The Commission stated: "the Secretary of State gave reasoned decisions on the basis of the facts found by the inspectors, and the matters relied on by him in overruling their recommendations could be challenged on appropriate grounds before the High Court."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;165. The recent decision in  <i>Chapman v United Kingdom</i> 18 January 2001 is of particular interest because the complaint there was expressly that the High Court could not review questions of fact, nor questions of the weight given to the needs of the applicant and her family.  The court however held, at paragraph 124, following <i>Bryan</i>, "that in the specialised area of town planning law full review of the facts may not be required by article 6 of the Convention" and that the opportunity to challenge the decision "on the basis that it was perverse, irrational, had no basis on the evidence or had been made with reference to irrelevant factors or without regard to relevant factors" afforded adequate judicial control of the administrative decisions in issue. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;166. Two other cases may be mentioned where the concern was about the sufficiency of a remedy in the context of the compulsory acquisition of land.  <i>Howard v United Kingdom</i> Application No 10825/84 16 July 1987 concerned the requirement in article 13 of the Convention that everyone whose rights and freedoms are violated should have "an effective remedy before a national authority."  The complaint was that in relation to a compulsory purchase order neither the statutory remedy nor judicial review extended to the content or substance of the decision, which was the object of the attack.  The Commission took account of the opportunities which the applicants had of challenging the decision to make the order by way of judicial review, of making representations to an inspector at a public inquiry, and of making a statutory challenge to the confirmation of the order.  They held that the limited review which was available satisfied the requirements of article 13. </p>
167. <i></i><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zumtobel v Austria</i> (1993)  17 EHRR 116 concerned an order to expropriate land for the construction of a highway.  The court held that the opportunity for challenge before the Constitutional Court was not sufficient to overcome the objection that the applicants had had no right to a fair and public hearing, because the jurisdiction of that court only extended to testing the constitutionality of the order.  But the opportunity to challenge the order before the Administrative Court was sufficient, because (in distinction from <i>Obermeier v Austria</i> (1990) 13 EHRR 290, para 70 that court could consider whether a statutory pre-condition for the validity of the order had been met and were able to meet and deal with all the points raised by the applicants in their challenge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;168. It is also of significance that as matter of generality the state parties to the Convention treat a limited review as an appropriate remedy in administrative matters.  In <i>Kaplan</i> 4 EHRR 64 the Commission recognised that where an individual's right had been adversely affected by action taken by a public authority article 6(1) entitled him to access to a court for such remedy as the domestic law might allow.  The question then arose whether the limited right of judicial review was sufficient.  The Commission noted that the limit to control of the lawfulness of the decision was fairly typical of many of the contracting states, and indeed the scope of protection afforded under article 173 of the Treaty of Rome was similarly limited.  The Commission observed, paragraph 161:</p>
<p></p><ul>"An interpretation of article 6(1) under which it was held to provide a right to a full appeal on the merits of every administrative decision affecting private rights would therefore lead to a result which was inconsistent with the existing and long-standing, legal position in most of the contracting states".<p></p></ul>
<p>In <i>Bryan </i>the court observed that while the High Court could not have substituted its own findings of fact for those of the inspector it was able to determine whether the findings or the inferences from them were perverse or irrational.  The court continued, paragraph 47:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Such an approach by an appeal tribunal on questions of fact can reasonably be expected in specialised areas of the law such as the one at issue, particularly where the facts have already been established in the course of a quasi-judicial procedure governed by many of the safeguards required by article 6(1).  It is also frequently a feature in the systems of judicial control of administrative decisions found throughout the Council of Europe member states."<p></p></ul>
<i></i><p><i>The scope of judicial review</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;169. The suggestion was advanced that if the respondents were correct in their contention that the present proceedings are in breach of article 6(1), the scope of judicial review might somehow be enlarged so as to provide a complete remedy.  The point in the event does not arise, but I consider that it might well be difficult to achieve a sufficient enlargement to meet the stated purpose without jeopardising the constitutional balance between the role of the courts and the role of the executive.  The supervisory jurisdiction of the court as it has now developed seems to me adequate to deal with a wide range of complaints which can properly be seen as directed to the legality of a decision.  It is sufficient to note the recognition of the idea of proportionality, or perhaps more accurately, disproportionality, and the extent to which the factual areas of a decision may be penetrated by a review of the account taken by a decision-maker of facts which are irrelevant or even mistaken (<i>R v Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, Ex p </i>A [1999]  2 AC 330, 344-345.)  But consideration of the precise scope of the administrative remedies is not necessary for the purposes of the present appeals. </p>
<i></i><p><i>The Divisional Court</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;170. The Divisional Court recognised that the Secretary of State could not disagree with the material findings of fact made by the inspector without giving the parties an opportunity of making representations.  But what gave rise to concern, at paragraph 94, was the consideration that he was then "free to make his own decision and does so after taking account of internal legal and policy 'elucidation' and the recommendation of the decision officer…which are not seen by the parties."  It appears to be that consideration which led the Divisional Court to reach their conclusion.  These matters bring me back to what I said at the outset of this speech.  The Secretary of State is not entirely free to make his own decision.  He cannot ignore what has passed at the inquiry.  He cannot act in an arbitrary way.  He has to proceed upon a reasonable assessment of the material before him.  He has to respect the necessity to produce a decision which is not open to attack on grounds of legality.  Nor is there anything wrong in seeking or taking into account advice which he may obtain from within his department, at least where that advice is sought to clarify or elucidate law or policy.  If his decision is materially affected by some error of law or misconstruction of policy that may be open to review.  The precise mechanics of the decision-making process in a large department are necessarily more complex than the process in which an inspector would engage if he was to make the actual decision. What is required is that there should be a decision with reasons. Provided that these set out clearly the grounds on which the decision has been reached it does not seem to me necessary that all the thinking which lies behind it should also be made available, whether the decision is made by an inspector or by the head of a government department.</p>
