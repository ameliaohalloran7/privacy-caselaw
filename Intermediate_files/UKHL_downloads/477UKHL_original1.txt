<p><b>LORD BINGHAM OF CORNHILL</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Section 1(1) of the Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978 provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Subject to the following provisions of this section, any person liable in respect of any damage suffered by another person may recover contribution from any other person liable in respect of the same damage (whether jointly with him or otherwise)."<p></p></ul>
<p>This appeal turns on the interpretation of the six words I have emphasised and their application to the facts of this case.  I am indebted to my noble and learned friend Lord Steyn for his account of the factual, contractual and legislative background to the case, which I adopt and need not repeat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The law has for many centuries recognised the existence of situations in which, if B is called upon to discharge a legal obligation owed to A, fairness demands that B should be entitled to claim a contribution from other parties subject with him to that obligation.  Thus a rule first developed to cover parties to a common maritime adventure was over time extended to cover co-sureties, co-trustees, co-contractors, partners, co-insurers, co-mortgagors, co-directors and co-owners (see Goff &amp; Jones, <i>The Law of Restitution</i>, 5th ed, (1998) pp 394, 399, 409, 413, 415, 421, 424, 425 and 427).  The common link between all these situations was the obvious justice of requiring that a common liability should be shared between those liable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The advent of the motor car however highlighted a situation in which B, if called upon to discharge a liability to A, could not seek any contribution from others also subject to the same liability to A.  The old rule in <i>Merryweather v Nixan</i> (1799) 8 TR 186 forbade claims for contribution or indemnity between joint tortfeasors and a more recent decision in <i>The Koursk</i> [1924]  P 140 showed that even where independent acts of negligence by different parties resulted in one injury and gave rise to a cause of action against each party there could be no contribution between them.  The Law Revision Committee in its <i>Third Interim Report</i> (Cmd 4637) of July 1934 addressed this problem.  In paragraph 7 of its report the committee said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"We think that the common law rule should be altered as speedily as possible.  <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>The simplest way of altering the law would seem to be to follow the lines of Section 37(3) of the Companies Act [1929], and to give a right of contribution in the case of wrongs as in cases of contract.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>If this were done, joint tortfeasors in the strict sense would be given a right of contribution inter se.  We think, however, that such a right might with advantage also be conferred where the tort is not joint (ie, the same act committed by several persons) but where the same damage is caused to the Plaintiff by the separate wrongful acts of several persons.  This is the position which frequently arises where the plaintiff sustains a single damage from the combined negligence of two motor car drivers, and recovers judgment against both . . .<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>We think therefore that when two persons each contribute to the same damage suffered by a third the one who pays more than his share should be entitled to recover contribution from the other."<p></p></ul>
<p>The committee included the following among its recommendations:</p>
<p></p><ul>"(II)&nbsp;&nbsp;Any person who is adjudged to be liable to make any payment . . . in respect of an actionable wrong may recover contribution . . . from any other person who has been made liable in respect of the same wrong, or who, if sued separately, would have been so liable, unless . . .<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(III)&nbsp;&nbsp;Where two or more persons have committed independent wrongful acts which have been the cause of the same damage they shall have the same right to contribution among themselves but subject to the same exception as in the case of persons liable in respect of the same wrong."<p></p></ul>
<p>Effect was given to these recommendations in section 6(1)(c) of the Law Reform (Married Women and Tortfeasors) Act 1935 which provided:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Where damage is suffered by any person as a result of a tort . . . any tortfeasor liable in respect of that damage may recover contribution from any other tortfeasor who is, or would if sued have been, liable in respect of the same damage, whether as a joint tortfeasor or otherwise. . . ."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The Law Revision Committee's <i>Third Interim Report</i> and section 6(1)(c) were directed only to the liability, as between each other, of those who had committed tortious acts, whether jointly or concurrently.  This limited field of application came in time to be recognised as a weakness, for section 6(1)(c) did not apply to wrongdoers other than tortfeasors and did not apply if only one of the wrongdoers was a tortfeasor.  This was one of the weaknesses addressed by the Law Commission in its <i>Report on Contribution</i> (Law Com No 79) published in March 1977.  A number of recommendations were made with the main aim of widening the jurisdiction given to the courts by the 1935 Act (paragraph 81) and specific recommendations were made:</p>
<p></p><ul>"(a) . . .  that statutory rights of contribution should not be confined, as at present, to cases where damage is suffered as a result of a tort, but should cover cases where it is suffered as a result of tort, breach of contract, breach of trust or other breach of duty . . .<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(d) . . . that the statutory right to recover contribution should be available to any person liable in respect of the damage, not just persons liable in tort . . ."<p></p></ul>
<p>In the draft bill appended to its report the Law Commission proposed a subsection (in clause 3(1)) which differed from section 1(1) of the 1978 Act quoted at the outset of this opinion only in its reference to the time when the damage occurred, a reference which has been omitted in the subsection as enacted.  The words which I have emphasised at the outset were included in the Law Commission draft.  Section 1(1) of the 1978 Act is supplemented by section 6(1):</p>
<p></p><ul>"A person is liable in respect of any damage for the purposes of this Act if the person who suffered it . . . is entitled to recover compensation from him in respect of that damage (whatever the legal basis of his liability, whether tort, breach of contract, breach of trust or otherwise)."<p></p></ul>
<p>This differs more obviously, at least in wording, from the interpretation clause proposed by the Law Commission:</p>
<p></p><ul>"(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purposes of this Act -<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul><ul>(a) a person is liable in respect of any damage if he is subject to a duty enforceable by action to compensate for that damage, whether or not he has in fact been held to be so liable in any action actually brought against him; and<p></p></ul></ul>
<p></p><ul><ul>(b) it is immaterial whether he is liable in respect of a tort, breach of contract, breach of trust or on any other ground whatsoever which gives rise to a cause of action against him in respect of the damage in question."<p></p></ul></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. It is plain beyond argument that one important object of the 1978 Act was to widen the classes of person between whom claims for contribution would lie and to enlarge the hitherto restricted category of causes of action capable of giving rise to such a claim.  It is, however, as I understand, a constant theme of the law of contribution from the beginning that B's claim to share with others his liability to A rests upon the fact that they (whether equally with B or not) are subject to a common liability to A.  I find nothing in section 6(1)(c) of the 1935 Act or in section 1(1) of the 1978 Act, or in the reports which preceded those Acts, which in any way weakens that requirement.  Indeed both sections, by using the words "in respect of the same damage", emphasise the need for one loss to be apportioned among those liable. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. When any claim for contribution falls to be decided the following questions in my opinion arise:</p>
<p></p><ul>(1) What damage has A suffered?<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(2) Is B liable to A in respect of that damage?<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(3) Is C also liable to A in respect of that damage or some of it?<p></p></ul>
<p>At the striking-out stage the questions must be recast to reflect the rule that it is arguability and not liability which then falls for decision, but their essential thrust is the same.  I do not think it matters greatly whether, in phrasing these questions, one speaks (as the 1978 Act does) of "damage" or of "loss" or "harm", provided it is borne in mind that "damage" does not mean "damages" (as pointed out by Roch LJ in <i>Birse Construction Ltd v Haiste Ltd </i>[1996] 1WLR 675, at p 682) and that B's right to contribution by C depends on the damage, loss or harm for which B is liable to A corresponding (even if in part only) with the damage, loss or harm for which C is liable to A.  This seems to me to accord with the underlying equity of the situation: it is obviously fair that C contributes to B a fair share of what both B and C owe in law to A, but obviously unfair that C should contribute to B any share of what B may owe in law to A but C does not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Approached in this way, the claim made by the Architect against the Contractor must in my opinion fail in principle.  It so happens that the Employer and the Contractor have resolved their mutual claims and counterclaims in arbitration whereas the Employer seeks redress against the Architect in the High Court.  But for purposes of contribution the parties' rights must be the same as if the Employer had sued both the Contractor and the Architect in the High Court and they had exchanged contribution notices.  The question would then be whether the Employer was advancing a claim for damage, loss or harm for which both the Contractor and the Architect were liable, in which case (if the claim were established) the court would have to apportion the common liability between the two parties responsible, or whether the Employer was advancing separate claims for damage, loss or harm for which the Contractor and the Architect were independently liable, in which case (if the claims were established) the court would have to assess the sum for which each party was liable but could not apportion a single liability between the two.  It would seem to me clear that any liability the Employer might prove against the Contractor and the Architect would be independent and not common. The Employer's claim against the Contractor would be based on the Contractor's delay in performing the contract and the disruption caused by the delay, and the Employer's damage would be the increased cost it incurred, the sums it overpaid and the liquidated damages to which it was entitled.  Its claim against the Architect, based on negligent advice and certification, would not lead to the same damage because it could not be suggested that the Architect's negligence had led to any delay in performing the contract. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. For the reasons given by Lord Steyn, and also for these reasons, I conclude that Judge Hicks QC and the Court of Appeal made correct decisions and I would dismiss this appeal.</p>
<p><b>LORD MACKAY OF CLASHFERN</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. I have had the advantage of reading in draft the speeches prepared by my noble and learned friends Lord Bingham of Cornhill and Lord Steyn.  I agree that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons they have given.</p>
<p><b>LORD STEYN</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. In a tripartite relationship under a building contract between an employer, a contractor and an architect a question of the correct interpretation of section 1(1) of the Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978 arises.  Subject to its other provisions section 1 provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"any person liable in respect of any damage suffered by another person may recover contribution from any other person liable in respect of the same damage (whether jointly with him or otherwise)."<p></p></ul>
<p>The issue centres on the meaning of the words "in respect of the same damage" read in the context of the language and purpose of the 1978 Act.  Having ascertained the meaning of the operative words of section 1 the application of the statute requires a close examination of the nature of claims by the employer against the contractor and the architect respectively in order to decide whether they are "in respect of the same damage".</p>
<i><p>I.  The History of the Contract.</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. By a contract incorporating the articles of agreement and other conditions of the JCT Standard Form of Building Contract 1980 Edition, Local Authorities with Quantities, with Amendment No. 1 of 1984, the Royal Brompton Hospital National Health Service Trust (the Employer) employed Taylor Woodrow Construction Ltd (the Contractor) as the main contractor in the development and construction of phase 1 of new hospital premises in Sydney Street, Chelsea (the works).  Watkins Gray International (UK), and two named architects, acted as architects under the contract.  Collectively, I will call them "the Architect".  This is a well-known standard form of contract, which is readily available to interested parties, and it is therefore unnecessary to set out its provisions verbatim:  <i>Keating on Building Contracts,</i> 7th ed, (2001), p 591 et seq.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. The contract between the Employer and the Contractor was not dated but it came into effect on about 2 March 1987 when the Contractor took possession of the site.  The contract fixed the date for the completion of the works as 23 July 1989.  Under clause 24 of the contract the Contractor had to pay or allow the Employer liquidated and ascertained damages at the rate of £47,000 per week if the Contractor failed to complete the works by the completion date.  In the event practical completion was certified 43 weeks and 2 days later than the contractual completion date.  The Contractor made numerous applications on a variety of grounds for extensions of time under clause 25 of the contract and for the payment of loss and expense for prolongation and disruption under clause 26 of the contract, for variations and other matters.  The Architect granted extensions of time totalling 43 weeks, 2 days, ie up to the date on which practical completion was certified ie on 22 May 1990.  The effect of this was to relieve the Contractor of its obligation to pay or allow liquidated and ascertained damages for any of the delay.  The Contractor claimed for loss and expense amounting to some £22m.  The Architect certified as due and the Employer paid some £5.2m of which about £2.3m related to prolongation and the balance to disruption.</p>
<i><p>II.  The Proceedings.</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. The Contractor commenced arbitration proceedings, claiming a further £17.1m.  The Employer disputed the claim and counter-claimed for a sum of some £6.6m.  The Employer was able to make these claims notwithstanding the extensions of time granted by the Architect because by article 5.3 of the contract the arbitrator had power to open up, review and revise any certificate to determine all matters in dispute in the same manner as if no such certificate had been given.  On 19 December 1995 the parties settled the arbitration on terms that the Employer paid to the Contractor some £6.2m and agreed to indemnify the Contractor against any claim for contribution made against the Contractor by, amongst others, the Architect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. On 21 January 1993 the Employer issued a writ against the Architect and others.  Between 1993 and 1997 the action was by consent stayed.  On 5 August 1997 the statement of claim was served.  The Employer alleged that the Architect had been negligent.  The relevant heads of claim are summarised in the agreed statement of facts and issues.  Subject to minor alterations the relevant paragraphs read:</p>
<p></p><ul><ul>"(a)  Section F of the re-amended statement of claim: Hydrotite:  The Contractor had responsibility for drying out the floor slabs.  By April 1989 it had become apparent that the slabs would not dry out for a very long time.  On 18 May 1989 the Architect issued an instruction to lay a proprietary damp-proof membrane called Hydrotite so that the Contractor could proceed to lay the floor coverings before the concrete was dry.  The Contractor made claims for loss and expense incurred by reason of the instruction to lay Hydrotite, for which the Contractor was paid £669,070 (for prolongation) and £189,062 (for disruption) before the arbitration and claimed further sums in the arbitration.  The Architect granted extensions of time totalling 12 weeks (including 2 for Christmas) by reason of delay caused by the application of Hydrotite.  The Employer counterclaimed in the arbitration to recover the sums paid for prolongation and damages in respect of the sums paid for disruption.  The Employer claims that the Architect was negligent in failing to give adequate advice as to the options available to the Employer (and in particular in failing to advise of the option of holding the Contractor to its undoubted contractual responsibility for the drying out of the works) or as to the possible consequences of issuing an architect's instruction to lay Hydrotite in terms of claims for extension of time and loss and expense.<p></p></ul></ul>
<p></p><ul><ul>(b) Section G of the re-amended statement of claim: Extensions of Time:  The Contractor claimed loss and expense by reason of the events giving rise to the extensions of time, for which the Contractor was paid £2,319,169 before the arbitration and claimed further sums in the arbitration.  The Employer counterclaimed to set aside the extensions of time and to recover the sums paid before the arbitration.  The Employer also claimed liquidated damages for which, but for the extensions of time, the Contractor would have been liable.  The total claim for liquidated damages was £2,021,000 at the contractual rate of £47,000 per week."<p></p></ul></ul>
<p>The Architect issued Part 20 proceedings to recover a contribution from the Contractor under the 1978 Act.  In respect of section F (Hydrotite) the Architect alleged in the third party notice:</p>
<p></p><ul>"[The Employer] alleges that [the Architect], inter alia, was negligent in that the Architect should have known that [the Contractor] was not therefore entitled to an Architect's instruction to lay a moisture resistant membrane . . . and [the Employer] seeks to recover damages from [the Architect].<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>If [the Employer] is right in its allegations made against [the Architect], which is denied, and in its allegations against [the Contractor], then it was entitled . . . to recover £858,132 paid to [the Contractor] in respect of and consequential upon the instruction; the recovery of liquidated damages in the sum of £564,000 and/or any other sums allegedly paid to [the Contractor] in consequence of the instruction, extensions of time and/or prolongation.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>In the premises [the Contractor] is and/or was liable to [the Employer] in respect of the same damage, the subject matter of this part of the action against [the Architect] and thus liable to contribute to the extent of an indemnity for such loss as [the Architect] may be held liable to [the Employer] pursuant to the provisions of the Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978."<p></p></ul>
<p>In respect of section G (extensions of time) the Architect alleged in the third party notice:</p>
<p></p><ul>"If, which is denied, [the Architect] was negligent as alleged by [the Employer] in granting extensions of time to [the Contractor] to which [the Contractor] was not entitled and liable to [the Employer] for the liquidated damages and/or loss and expense paid to [the Contractor] as alleged in the amended statement of claim, then [the Contractor] is and/or was also liable to [the Employer] in respect of the same damage the subject matter of this part of the action against [the Architect] and thus liable to contribute to the extent of any indemnity for such loss as [the Architect] may be held liable to [the Employer] pursuant to the provisions of the Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978."<p></p></ul>
<p>The Contractor applied to strike out the Part 20 claim.  Given the indemnity given by the Employer to the Contractor in the settlement of the arbitration, the Contractor was represented by the same solicitors and counsel as the Employer.</p>
<i><p>III.  The Decisions of Judge Hicks QC and the Court of Appeal.</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. Sitting in the Technology and Construction Court, Judge Hicks QC held that in respect of sections F and G, as described above, the Contractor was not liable in respect of the same damage as the Architect.  He therefore struck out the third party notice of the Architect against the Contractor: <i>Royal Brompton Hospital National Health Trust v Hammond</i> [1999]  BLR 385.  The Architect appealed to the Court of Appeal.  By agreement the argument concentrated on the Architect's claim for a contribution in respect of the section G (extensions of time).  It was assumed that if the Architect failed in the arguments on section G he must necessarily also to fail in his arguments on section F (Hydrotite).  Dismissing the appeal Stuart-Smith LJ held that the Contractor's breach consisted in the failure to deliver the building on time whereas the damage caused by the Architect occurred at the time of the certification of extensions and was the impairment of the ability of the Employer to obtain financial recompense in full from the Contractor; and, accordingly, it was not a claim in respect of "the same damage": <i>Royal Brompton Hospital National Health Service Trust v Hammond </i>[2000]  Lloyd's Rep PN 643.  Buxton LJ agreed.  With some hesitation Ward LJ also agreed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. Since the Court of Appeal decision a trial has taken place of the Employer's claims against the Architect in respect of section G (extensions of time).  The Architect was held to have been negligent in granting five weeks for laying Hydrotite on 24 November 1989.  The issues on quantum still await decision.  The trial in respect of section F (Hydrotite) has not yet taken place.</p>
<i><p>IV.  The Issues.</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. On appeal to the House counsel for the Architect broadened his case by making submissions both on section F (Hydrotite) and section G (extensions of time).  Both aspects arise for decision in the context of a striking-out application: the focus is therefore on the arguability of claims.  The agreed statement of facts and issues formulates the issues as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the [case] of Hydrotite (section F):</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the assumptions</p>
(i) <p></p><ul><ul><ul>that the relevant facts and matters alleged in the third party statement of claim were established at trial against [the Contractor] and<p></p></ul></ul></ul>
(ii) <p></p><ul><ul><ul>that the relevant facts and matters alleged in the re-amended statement of claim were established at trial against [the Architect].<p></p></ul></ul></ul>

<p>It will be convenient first to consider the position under section G (extensions of time) which was the subject-matter to which the judgments in the Court of Appeal were directed.</p>
<i></i><p><i>V.  The Operation of the Contract</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. It is necessary at the outset to describe in uncontroversial fashion how this standard form JCT contract operates.  Drawing on a helpful summary in the Contractor's printed case, the position is as follows.  The Contractor is obliged to proceed regularly and diligently with the works and to complete them by the completion date: clause 23.1.  If he fails to do so, he is liable to pay or allow to the Employer a sum by way of liquidated and ascertained damages calculated at the agreed rate: clause 24.  Those damages are either deducted from sums otherwise payable to the Contractor or the Employer may recover them "as a debt": clause 24.2.1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. If the works are delayed, or are likely to be delayed, beyond the completion date by a relevant event as defined by clause 25.4, the Contractor is entitled to an extension of time; if, on the Contractor's application, the Architect is satisfied that there has been a relevant event and that the completion of the works is likely to be delayed thereby beyond the completion date<i>,</i> he must give an extension of time by fixing such a later date as the completion date which he considers fair and reasonable: clause 25.3.  Thus the effect of giving an extension of time is twofold.  First, the Employer no longer has the right to take possession of the works on the original date for completion, but only on the later date fixed by the Architect.  Secondly, the Contractor becomes relieved from any liability to pay liquidated damages in respect of the delay between the two dates.  In addition, where the regular progress of the works is materially affected by one or more of the matters listed in clause 26.2 and the Contractor has thereby incurred loss and/or expense for which he would not be reimbursed under any other provision of the contract, the Contractor is entitled to have such loss and expense ascertained (by the Architect or quantity surveyor) and paid to him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20. Each of the matters listed in clause 26.2. is also a relevant event under clause 25.  Thus if an extension of time is given for one or more of those events, this will entitle the Contractor to recover any loss and expense under clause 26.  In practice, when the Architect gives an extension of time because of a relevant event that entitles the Contractor to loss and expense, he will also ascertain (or instruct the quantity surveyor to ascertain) the amount of that loss and expense.  The loss and expense so ascertained then becomes added to the contract<i> </i>sum: clauses 26.5 and 30.6.2.13.  At the conclusion of the contract (before the expiry of the defects liability period) the Architect must issue a final certificate stating (1) the sum of the amounts already due by way of interim certificates and (2) the contract sum as adjusted in accordance with the contractual provisions.  The balance representing the difference between these two sums becomes (subject to any further deductions authorised by the contract) a debt payable by the Employer to the Contractor, or vice versa, as the case may be: clause 30.8.  The liability of either the Employer or the Contractor is to pay the balance. </p>
