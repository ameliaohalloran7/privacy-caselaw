<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;65.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appeal of the Kingdom in the case of Mitchell, Sampson and Walker raises the question of whether the same immunity covers the individual agents of the state allegedly responsible for the infliction of torture upon the claimants.  The Court of Appeal concluded that it did not and I must at the outset pay tribute to the careful judgment of my noble and learned friend Lord Mance, which meticulously confronts and deals with every objection to his view of the case; a tribute no less sincere for the opinion I have formed that he was wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66.&nbsp;&nbsp;I start with the proposition that, as a matter of international law, the same immunity against suit in a foreign domestic court which protects the state itself also protects the individuals for whom the state is responsible.  Article 2(1)(b)(iv) of the Immunity Convention defines "state" to include "representatives of the state acting in that capacity".  The traditional way of expressing this principle in international law is to say that the acts of state officials acting in that capacity are not attributable to them personally but only to the state.  Thus in <i>Prosecutor v Blaskic</i> (1997) 110 ILR 607, 707 the Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, presided over by the distinguished international lawyer Professor Antonio Cassese, said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Such officials are mere instruments of a state and their official action can only be attributed to the state. They cannot be the subject of sanctions or penalties for conduct that is not private but undertaken on behalf of a state. In other words, state officials cannot suffer the consequences of wrongful acts which are not attributable to them personally but to the state on whose behalf they act: they enjoy so-called 'functional immunity'. This is a well-established rule of customary international law going back to the 18th and 19th centuries, restated many times since."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;67.&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, in the <i>Church of Scientology Case</i> (1978) 65 ILR 193, 198 the German Federal Supreme Court, in according immunity to the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police for acts done pursuant to the Federal Republic of Germany - United Kingdom Agreement on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters 1961, said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Scotland Yard - and consequently its head - was acting as the expressly appointed agent of the British State so far as performance of the treaty in question between the United Kingdom and the Federal Republic was concerned.  The acts of such agents constitute direct state conduct and cannot be attributed as private activities to the person authorised to perform them in a given case…Any attempt to subject state conduct to German jurisdiction by targeting the foreign agent performing the act would undermine the absolute immunity of sovereign states in respect of sovereign activity."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;68.&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the undoubted authority for expressing the rule in this way, I do respectfully think that it is a little artificial to say that the acts of officials are "not attributable to them personally" and that this usage can lead to confusion, especially in those cases in which some aspect of the immunity of the individual is withdrawn by treaty, as it is for criminal proceedings by the Torture Convention. It would be strange to say, for example, that the torture ordered by General Pinochet was attributable to him personally for the purposes of criminal liability but only to the State of Chile for the purposes of civil liability.  It would be clearer to say that the Torture Convention withdrew the immunity against criminal prosecution but did not affect the immunity for civil liability.  I would therefore prefer to say, as Leggatt LJ did in <i>Propend Finance Pty Ltd v Sing</i> (1997)  111 ILR 611, 669, that state immunity affords individual employees or officers of a foreign state "protection under the same cloak as protects the state itself". But this is a difference in the form of expression and not the substance of the rule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;69.&nbsp;&nbsp;What is important, however, is that, as Lord Diplock said in <i>Alcom Ltd v Republic of Columbia</i> [1984]  AC 580, 597, the provisions of the SIA "fall to be construed against the background of those principles of public international law as are generally recognised by the family of nations."  That means that "state" in section 1(1) of the SIA and "government", which the term "state" is said by section 14(1)(b) to include, must be construed to include any individual representative of the state acting in that capacity, as it is by article 2(1)(b)(iv) of the Immunity Convention.  The official acting in that capacity is entitled to the same immunity as the state itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70.&nbsp;&nbsp;In his judgment in the Court of Appeal, Mance LJ says more than once that the SIA does not expressly mention officials: see [2005] QB 699, 719H, 721G.  True, it does not use the words "officials" or "representatives" or the like. But the question is not what words the Act uses but what it means.  If, against the background of established rules of international law, "the state" or "the government" includes individual officials, then they are entitled to the same immunities as if they had been expressly mentioned.  The absence of express reference may make it easier, if section 3 of the HRA applies, to construe references to the state as not including officials. (Even that would have its difficulties, since there is no suggestion that the state should not include officials other than in cases of torture or other jus cogens prohibitions).  But before one gets to section 3 of the HRA, it is necessary to establish that the immunity of an official would infringe the right of access to a court guaranteed by article 6 of the Convention and therefore be inconsistent with a Convention right. For that purpose it is necessary, as in the case of the immunity of the state itself, to show that international law does not require immunity against civil suit to be accorded to officials who are alleged to have committed torture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;71.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, it is impossible to find any such exception to the immunity of representatives of the state in a treaty.  The Immunity Convention does not contain one.  The Torture Convention, which defines torture as the infliction of severe pain and suffering for various purposes "when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in a public capacity" was held in <i>Pinochet (No 3) </i>[2000] 1 AC 147, by necessary implication, to remove the immunity from criminal prosecution which would ordinarily attach to acts performed by individuals in a public capacity.  But the Torture Convention says nothing to remove the immunity of such individuals from civil process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72.&nbsp;&nbsp;The essence of the reasoning of the Court of Appeal in denying immunity to individuals who are alleged to have committed acts of torture is that torture cannot constitute an official act.  It is so illegal that it must fall outside the scope of official activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73.&nbsp;&nbsp;This argument is based upon judicial dicta; first, in the <i>Pinochet</i> litigation and secondly in a series of United States cases under ATCA.  But before I come to these dicta, I will examine the proposition in principle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74.&nbsp;&nbsp;It has until now been generally assumed that the circumstances in which a state will be liable for the act of an official in international law mirror the circumstances in which the official will be immune in foreign domestic law.  There is a logic in this assumption: if there is a remedy against the state before an international tribunal, there should not also be a remedy against the official himself in a domestic tribunal.  The cases and other materials on state liability make it clear that the state is liable for acts done under colour of public authority, whether or not they are actually authorised or lawful under domestic or international law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75.&nbsp;&nbsp;So for example in <i>Mallén v United States of America</i> (1927) IV Reports of International Arbitral Awards 173,<i> </i>a US deputy constable in El Paso, Texas boarded a street car, showing his badge, beat up the Mexican consul and took him to the county jail. The assault was in pursuit of a private grudge but an international arbitration tribunal held that the United States was liable because the deputy constable had acted under colour of public authority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76.&nbsp;&nbsp;The International Law Commission is in the process of preparing a draft with a view to a UN treaty on the responsibility of states for intentionally wrongful acts.  Article 4 of the 2001 draft provides that the conduct of any state organ shall be considered an act of that state under international law and that an organ includes a person or entity which has that status in accordance with the internal law of that state. In its commentary, the commission says:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is irrelevant for this purpose that the person concerned may have had ulterior or improper motives or may be abusing public power. Where such a person acts in an apparently official capacity, or under colour of authority, the actions in question will be attributable to the State."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77.&nbsp;&nbsp;The commission went on to say that the distinction between unauthorised conduct of a state organ and purely private conduct had been "clearly drawn in international arbitration decisions" and referred to the <i>Mallén</i> case.  Article 7 of the draft dealt specifically with the point:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The conduct of an organ of a state or of a person or entity empowered to exercise elements of the government authority shall be considered an act of the state under international law if the organ, person or entity acts in that capacity, even if it exceeds its authority or contravenes instructions."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78.&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems thus clear that a state will incur responsibility in international law if one of its officials, under colour of his authority, tortures a national of another state, even though the acts were unlawful and unauthorised.  To hold that for the purposes of state immunity he was not acting in an official capacity would produce an asymmetry between the rules of liability and immunity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79.&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, in the case of torture, there would be an even more striking asymmetry between the Torture Convention and the rules of immunity if it were to be held that the same act was official for the purposes of the definition of torture but not for the purposes of immunity. Lord Millett in <i>Pinochet (No 3)</i> [2000] 1 AC 147, 273 drew attention to this feature of the definition:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The very official or governmental character of the acts which is necessary to found a claim to immunity ratione materiae, and which still operates as a bar to the civil jurisdiction of national courts, was now to be the essential element which made the acts an international crime."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was this feature which made Lord Millett conclude, at p 278, that the Torture Convention must, by necessary implication, have removed the immunity which would ordinarily attach to an act of official or governmental character:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In my opinion there was no immunity to be waived. The offence is one which could only be committed in circumstances which would normally give rise to the immunity.  The international community had created an offence for which immunity ratione materiae could not possibly be available. International law cannot be supposed to have established a crime having the character of a jus cogens and at the same time to have provided an immunity which is coextensive with the obligation it seeks to impose."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, this reasoning is unassailable. The reason why General Pinochet did not enjoy immunity ratione materiae was not because he was deemed not to have acted in an official capacity; that would have removed his acts from the Convention definition of torture. It was because, by necessary implication, international law had removed the immunity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Court of Appeal, Mance LJ met the charge of inconsistency by saying [2005] QB 699, 742:</p>
<p></p><ul>"the requirement that the pain or suffering be inflicted by a public official does no more in my view than identify the author and the public context in which the author must be acting. It does not lend to the acts of torture themselves any official or governmental character or nature, or mean that it can in any way be regarded as an official function to inflict, or that an official can be regarded as representing the state in inflicting, such pain or suffering.  Still less does it suggest that the official inflicting such pain or suffering can be afforded the cloak of state immunity."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not, with respect, find this answer satisfactory.  The acts of torture are either official acts or they are not.  The Torture Convention does not "lend" them an official character; they must be official to come within the Convention in the first place. And if they are official enough to come within the Convention, I cannot see why they are not official enough to attract immunity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84.&nbsp;&nbsp;The notion that acts contrary to jus cogens cannot be official acts has not been well received by eminent writers on international law.  Professor Antonio Cassese, who presided over the Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, described it as "unsound and even preposterous": see "When May Senior State Officials be Tried for International Crimes? Some Comments on the <i>Congo v Belgium</i> Case" (2002) 13 EJIL 853-875 (hereafter "<i>International Crimes</i>") at p 869, while Professor Andrea Gattini gave it short shrift in a footnote: see "War Crimes and State Immunity in the <i>Ferrrini</i> Decision"  (2005) Journal of International Criminal Justice 224-242, at p 234 n 41 ("an argument which can be easily discarded"). More moderately, in a comment on the present case, Hazel Fox said that it was "directly contrary to current international law": (2005) 121 LQR 353-359, at p 355.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85.&nbsp;&nbsp;In principle, therefore, I would reject the argument that torture or some other contravention of a jus cogens cannot attract immunity ratione materiae because it cannot be an official act.  I must now examine some of the dicta which have been relied upon in support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the dicta in the <i>Pinochet</i> litigation. In order to understand some of the passages in the judgments of the Law Lords, it is necessary to bear in mind that General Pinochet did not only claim immunity at common law by virtue of the official nature of his acts.  He also claimed a special statutory immunity for former heads of state by virtue of section 20(1) of the SIA, which provides that "subject to…any necessary modifications" the Diplomatic Privileges Act 1964 shall apply to a head of state as it applies to a head of a diplomatic mission."  The 1964 Act gave effect to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1961), article 39 of which provided that when the functions of a diplomat came to an end, immunity continued to subsist "with respect to acts performed … in the exercise of his functions as a member of the mission."  If one applied that article with the necessary modifications to a Head of State, it would (on the broadest possible construction) mean that immunity would continue to subsist with respects to acts performed in the exercise of his functions as head of state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 20(1) of the SIA therefore gave rise to the question of whether torturing people could be an exercise of the functions of a head of state, which is a very different question from whether it could be an official act for the purposes of common law immunity ratione personae.  It is in this context that one must read some of the dicta on which the Court of Appeal relied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88.&nbsp;&nbsp;The judgments of the majority in <i>Pinochet (No 1)</i> [2000] 1 AC 61 concentrated almost entirely upon the question of whether General Pinochet was entitled to immunity under section 20(1) of the SIA.  Reliance upon ordinary immunity ratione materiae was summarily rejected on the ground that it was inconsistent with the universal jurisdiction over torture as an official act created (pursuant to the Torture Convention) by section 134 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988.  It was in relation to article 39 of the Vienna Convention that Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead said (at p 109) that "torture of his own subjects, or of aliens, would not be regarded by international law as a function of a head of state".  Although it is true that Lord Steyn (at p 116) expressed some doubt about whether "what was allegedly done in secret in the torture chambers of Santiago" could be regarded as official acts, he founded his judgment upon the failure to satisfy the "further essential requirement" that the acts were part of the functions of a head of state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Pinochet (No 3)</i> [2000] 1 AC 147 the argument rather different. Lord Browne-Wilkinson appeared to assimilate the immunity under section 20(1) with common law immunity ratione materiae, expressed doubts as to whether torture was a "state function" but concluded that in any event the universal criminal liability created by the Torture Convention would be inconsistent with the existence of immunity ratione materiae.  There are passages which can be read as saying that torture therefore cannot be an official act, but nothing to explain why, if that is the case, it satisfies the definition of torture in the Convention. His conclusion (at p 205) is simply that "continued immunity for ex-heads of state is inconsistent with the provisions of the Torture Convention", which is consistent with Lord Millett's view that, though the acts are official, the Convention lifts the immunity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Goff of Chieveley formulated the argument against immunity (at p 213) with great clarity:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In broad terms I understand the argument to be that, since torture contrary to the Convention can only be committed by a public official or other person acting in an official capacity, and since it is in respect of the acts of these very persons that states can assert state immunity ratione materiae, it would be inconsistent with the obligations of state parties under the Convention for them to be able to invoke state immunity ratione materiae in cases of torture contrary to the Convention."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Goff went on to point out that since the Torture Convention did not expressly lift the immunity, the argument must be that it did so by necessary implication.  He went on to reject the implication, but his formulation of the argument shows that he did not understand it as a claim that the same act could be official for the purposes of the Torture Convention and not official for the purposes of immunity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Hope of Craighead said in terms (at p 242) that in principle the immunity ratione materiae protected all acts which the head of state has performed in the exercise of the functions of government.  He was willing to allow only two exceptions under customary international law: "criminal acts which the head of state did under the colour of his authority as head of state but which were in reality for his own pleasure or benefit" and war crimes.  I would respectfully doubt the first exception: if the act is done under colour of official authority, the purpose of personal gratification (as in the <i>Mallén</i> case) should be irrelevant. The second is well established.  But Lord Hope doubted whether customary international law had brought torture within the second exception.  It was the Torture Convention which had done so: see p 247.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Hutton concentrated on section 20 of the SIA and said, like Lords Nicholls and Steyn in <i>Pinochet (No 1),</i> that torture was not a function of a head of state.  But he must have regarded it as an official act for the purposes of the common law ratione materiae rule, because he said, at p 264:</p>
<p></p><ul>"I consider that under international law Chile is responsible for acts of torture carried out by Senator Pinochet, but could claim state immunity if sued for damages for such acts in a court in the United Kingdom. Senator Pinochet could also claim immunity if sued in civil proceedings for damages…."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Saville of Newdigate clearly based his opinion on the proposition that the Torture Convention had removed the immunity ratione materiae and Lord Millett, as I have already noted, did the same.  Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers likewise said (at p 290) that the Convention was "incompatible with the applicability of immunity ratione materiae" but (at p 281) that in civil proceedings against General Pinochet for damages, the State of Chile could claim immunity on his behalf.  In the Court of Appeal in this case Lord Phillips said that he had changed his mind on the latter point but I respectfully think that his first thoughts were correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95.&nbsp;&nbsp;The respondents next rely on cases decided in the United States under ATCA.  This Act, passed in 1789, confers jurisdiction upon Federal Courts in "all causes where an alien sues for a tort only [committed] in violation of…the law of nations".  There are dicta and some lower court decisions which support the view that, for the purposes of the act of state doctrine and the FSIA, torture cannot be an official act. For example, <i>Filartiga v Pena-Irala</i> (1980) 630 F 2d 876 concerned the torture and killing of a Paraguayan citizen in Paraguay by a Paraguayan policeman who was served with process in New York. The court assumed jurisdiction under ATCA on the ground that torture was a tort contrary to the law of nations.  There was no reference to the immunity of an "agency or instrumentality of a foreign state" under the FSIA and only a brief reference to the act of state doctrine, which the court said (at p 889) was "not before us on this appeal". It was in this context that Kaufman J said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"We note in passing, however, that we doubt whether action by a state official in violation of the Constitution and laws of the Republic of Paraguay, and wholly unratified by that nation's government, could properly be characterized as an act of state".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>In re Estate of Ferdinand Marcos</i> (1994)  25 F 3d 1467, in the US Court of Appeals (Ninth Circuit), was an application to strike out a claim for damages for torture and killing by ex-President Marcos on the ground, inter alia, that he had been an agent or instrumentality of the state for the purposes of the FSIA. The court said (at pp 1470-1471) that for the purposes of the application, the claimants' allegations must be taken as true, including the allegation that his actions were "taken without official mandate pursuant to his own authority". The government of the Philippines made no claim to immunity. But the judgment does contain an extensive discussion of authorities which are said to support the proposition that unlawful or very unlawful acts cannot be official.</p>
<i>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Xuncax v Gramajo</i> (1995)  886 F Supp 162, a judgment of the US District Court for Massachusetts, was a judgment in default, the defendant (a former Guatemalan Minister of Defence) having been served with process while attending a course at Harvard and thereafter taken no part in the proceedings. Woodlock J followed cases in the Ninth Circuit such as <i>In re Estate of Ferdinand Marcos</i> and held, at p 175 that although immunity under the FSIA extended to an individual official of a foreign state acting in his official capacity:</p>
<p></p><ul>"an individual official of a foreign state is <i>not</i> entitled to immunity under the FSIA in an action brought against him for acts beyond the scope of his authority".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(See also, for a similar ruling, <i>Cabiri v Assasie-Gyimah</i> (1996)  921 F Supp 1189, a decision of a District Judge in the Second Circuit).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98.&nbsp;&nbsp;The approval (or at any rate, lack of disapproval) of <i>Filartiga v Pena-Irala</i> 6630 F 2d 876 by the Supreme Court in <i>Sosa v Alvarez-Machain</i> (2004)  542 US 692 was solely concerned with the assumption of jurisdiction under the ATCA and not with any question of state immunity. In a concurring opinion, Breyer J speculated (at p 762) that international acceptance of universal criminal jurisdiction over certain criminal offences by state officials (as in <i>Pinochet</i>) may in due course lead to an acceptance of a similar tort jurisdiction.  But there is no suggestion that this represents current international law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although, as Professor Cassese says, the ATCA cases may be "meritorious" as "a practical expedient for circumventing the [FSIA]" (<i>International Crimes</i>, at p 869) and were, as I have noted, described by Judges Higgins, Kooijmans and Buergenthal in the <i>Arrest Warrant</i> case, at para 48, as a "unilateral exercise of the function of guardian of international values", they are in my opinion contrary to customary international law and the Immunity Convention and not in accordance with the law of England.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal, having held that the English court had jurisdiction to entertain proceedings alleging torture against foreign officials, drew back from allowing the court to exercise that jurisdiction on ordinary principles. It recognised that such proceedings could create difficulties about both proof and enforcement and could cause difficulties with foreign governments. It therefore proposed that the power to allow service out of the jurisdiction or to stay proceedings on grounds of forum non conveniens should be exercised with due regard to the potential sensitivity of the subject-matter (the word "sensitive" appears six times in the concluding pages of the judgment).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion this approach is inappropriate for questions of state immunity.  As Lord Millett said in <i>Holland v Lampen-Wolfe</i> [2000]  1 WLR 1573, 1588, state immunity is not a "self-imposed restriction on the jurisdiction of its courts which the United Kingdom has chosen to adopt" and which it can, as a matter of discretion, relax or abandon. It is imposed by international law without any discrimination between one state and another. It would be invidious in the extreme for the judicial branch of government to have the power to decide that it will allow the investigation of allegations of torture against the officials of one foreign state but not against those of another.  As Kingsmill Moore J said in a different but not wholly unrelated context, "safety lies only in universal rejection": see <i>Peter Buchanan Ltd v McVey</i> [1955] AC 516, 529.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore allow the appeal of the Kingdom and restore the order of Master Whitaker.  I have had the advantage of reading in draft the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill, with which I agree.</p>
<p><b>LORD RODGER OF EARLSFERRY</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the advantage of considering the complementary speeches of my noble and learned friends, Lord Bingham of Cornhill and Lord Hoffmann, in draft.  I agree with them and there is nothing which I can usefully add.  For the reason they give I would dispose of the appeals as they propose.</p>
<p><b>LORD WALKER OF GESTINGTHORPE</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
