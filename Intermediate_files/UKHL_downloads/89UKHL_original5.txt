<p class="para">80.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the Strasbourg Court said in para 76 in <i>Doorson</i> that:</p>
<p class="qt">“76 &nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, it should be recalled that, even when ‘counterbalancing’ procedures are found to compensate sufficiently the handicaps under which the defence labours, a conviction should not be based either solely or to a decisive extent on anonymous statements. …..”</p>
<p class="para">Similar statements appear in paras 55 and 56 in <i>Van Mechelen v The Netherlands </i>and in para 76 in <i>Krasniki v Czech Republic </i>(Application No 51277/99) (unreported) 28 February 2006.<i> </i>The caveat that a conviction should not be based “to a decisive extent” on anonymous evidence can be traced back to the Strasbourg Court’s earlier decision in <i>Kostovski v The Netherlands </i>(Application No 11454/85) (1989) 12 EHRR 434. There, the conviction for armed robbery had been based on statements of two anonymous witnesses both heard by the police and one also heard by an examining magistrate, in each case in the absence of the defendant and his counsel. Both the opportunity for cross-examination and the existence of a full investigating magistrate’s report from which conclusions as to credibility could be drawn by Dutch trial court and Court of Appeal were seen in <i>Doorson </i>(para. 73) as factors distinguishing <i>Doorson </i>from <i>Kostovski</i>. The Court in <i>Kostovski </i>also noted that the Netherlands accepted that the conviction was based to a decisive extent on the anonymous statements. </p>
<p class="para">81.&nbsp;&nbsp;In<i> </i>practice however, where the Strasbourg Court has found a violation of the right to a fair trial, it has commonly done so by reference to a conjunction of considerations, and not merely because the conviction was based solely or decisively on anonymous evidence. Thus, in <i>Windisch v Austria </i>(Application No 12489/86) (1990) 13 EHRR 281 a mother and daughter reported that they had the previous evening seen two suspicious looking men near the place where a robbery had that evening taken place, and had noted down their minibus licence number. They also identified the defendant as one of the men at a covert confrontation arranged by the police. The two women feared retaliation and the trial court rejected defence requests to have them summoned to appear to be examined. Their written statements to the police were simply produced by the relevant police officers (who the defence were able to question). The Strasbourg Court said that, being unaware of the witnesses’ identity, “the defence was confronted with an almost insurmountable handicap: it was deprived of the necessary information permitting it to test the witnesses’ reliability or cast doubt on their credibility” (para 28).  Further their identification was the only evidence indicating the defendant’s presence on the scene of the crime. There had been a violation of article 6.</p>
<p class="para">82.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Lüdi v Switzerland </i>(Application No 12433/86) (1992) 15 EHRR 173 the conviction was only to some extent (rather than solely or decisively) based on notes and transcripts of conversations with the defendant produced by an undercover agent whose activities, although supervised by an investigating magistrate were, the defendant claimed, illegal. The trial court refused to summon the undercover officer to give evidence. The case is of interest in that <i>Kostovski </i>and<i> Windisch</i> were viewed as distinguishable, because of the investigating judge’s role and because the defendant knew the undercover officer by physical appearance, though not by his real identity. Although there was a violation (because the defendant and his counsel had had no opportunity to question the officer or cast doubt on his credibility), the court said (para 49):</p>
<p class="qt">“Yet it would have been possible to do this in a way which took into account the legitimate interest of the police authorities in a drug trafficking case in preserving the anonymity of their agent, so that they could protect him and also make use of him again in the future.” </p>
<p class="para">This passage from <i>Lüdi</i> is consistent with the later statement in <i>Doorson</i> that the Strasbourg Court does not set its face absolutely against the admission of anonymous evidence in all circumstances.</p>
<p class="para">83.&nbsp;&nbsp;That this is so is further confirmed by the Strasbourg Court’s finding that an application made in the case of <i>Murphy</i> (sub nom <i>X v United Kingdom) </i>was manifestly unfounded (Application No 20657/92) (1992) 15 EHRR CD 113. The Court said:</p>
<p class="qt">“The defendant must be given an adequate and proper  opportunity to challenge and question the witnesses against him [<i>Asch v Austria </i>(1991) 15 EHRR 597].  In the present case, the witnesses whose identity was not disclosed to the public or the accused, were present in court and could be seen by the judge and by the representatives of both prosecution and defence.  The evidence itself concerned not the question of identification of the applicant (which evidence was given by police officers whose identity was not withheld), but merely the making of certain filmed and photographic evidence.  It was accepted by the defence that the evidence did not implicate the applicant.</p>
<p class="qt">Accordingly, given that the applicant was able, through his representatives who could see the witnesses, to put all questions he wished to the witnesses in question, and that, far from being the only item of evidence on which the trial court based its decision to convict, the evidence in question did not implicate the applicant at all, the Commission finds no indication that the decision to screen witnesses from the applicant interfered with his rights under either Article 6(1) or Article 6(3)(d) of the Convention.”</p>
<p class="para">84.&nbsp;&nbsp;Para 70 in <i>Doorson </i>(above) was quoted and set out in full in <i>Van Mechelen v The Netherlands </i>(Application Nos 21363/93, 21364/93, 21427/93 and 22056/93)) (1997) 25 EHRR 647. But the Court noted (paras. 52-53) that, if anonymity exists, “the defence will be faced with difficulties which criminal proceedings should not normally involve” and that article 6(1) and 6(3)(d) accordingly require “that the handicaps under which the defence labours be sufficiently counterbalanced by the procedures followed by the judicial authorities". The same message was reiterated by the Court in <i>Birutis v. Lithuania </i>(Applications Nos 47698/99 and 48115/99) (unreported) 28 March 2002. In neither <i>Van Mechelen </i>nor <i>Birutis </i>had the necessary balance been maintained. In the former case anonymous police officer witnesses were interrogated before an investigating judge who wrote a detailed report, but this took place in the absence of the defendants and their lawyers, and their evidence was the only evidence positively identifying the defendants as the perpetrators of the attempted manslaughter and robbery of which they were convicted. Further, another witness, a civilian, gave evidence without anonymity and had not been at any time threatened. The Court evidently doubted the justification for any anonymity, contrasting <i>Doorson </i>as a case where the witnesses “had sufficient reason to believe that he [the defendant] might resort to violence". It also pointed out that in <i>Doorson </i>the anonymous witnesses had been heard in the presence of counsel. Finally, it noted (however open to question though this may be in fact) that <i>Doorson </i>had proceeded on the basis that there had been other evidence identifying the defendant; in contrast, in <i>Van Mechelen </i>the defendants’ conviction was based “to a decisive extent” on the anonymous statements (para 62). In <i>Birutis</i>, although the conviction was not based solely or to a decisive extent upon the anonymous evidence, the defendants had not been able to question such witnesses, and the courts had failed either to do so or to conduct a scrutiny of the manner and circumstances in which their statements, on which the courts relied, had been obtained. So in both cases there were violations of article 6.</p>
<i>
</i><p class="para">85.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Kok v The Netherlands </i>(Application No 43149/98) Reports of Judgments and Decisions 2000-VI, p 597 provides an interesting contrast. Following a police raid leading to the discovery of a cache of arms, the police took a statement from an anonymous witness as to the delivery of the arms to the house (though the precise date of delivery was withheld). The investigating judge heard evidence satisfying her that the witness’s desire for anonymity was based on well-founded fear. She heard and saw the witness’s evidence direct, and then decided which answers could be relayed, with voice distortion, to the prosecutor and the applicant’s counsel who were in another room. Defence counsel were able to submit questions to the witness. The applicant complained inter alia that the withholding of the precise date made it impossible to show an alibi. The Strasbourg Court was satisfied with the procedures. It was satisfied that, in contrast with <i>Van Mechelen</i>, the evidence was not based to a decisive extent on the anonymous witness. (The applicant<i> </i>was arrested with a loaded pistol, documents, keys and a mobile telephone found in an Audi car linked him to the house where the arms cache was seized, his fingerprints were found on dustbin liners used to package such arms and he had lied about not knowing the owner of the Audi car.)  What is of greater interest about this case, is however, the Court’s statement immediately after reaching these conclusions:</p>
<p class="qt">“In the Court’s view, in assessing whether the procedures involved in the questioning of the anonymous witness were sufficient to counterbalance the difficulties caused to the defence due weight must be given to the above conclusion that the anonymous testimony was not in any respect decisive for the conviction of the applicant. The defence was thus handicapped to a much lesser degree.”</p>
<p class="para">86.&nbsp;&nbsp;This statement of principle may be read as suggesting that the extent of any handicap and the extent to which anonymous evidence is decisive are not separate, but inter-related, aspects of a single overall question, viz whether the trial was “fair".</p>
<p class="para">87.&nbsp;&nbsp;This statement of principle has also been quoted in more recent cases. In <i>Visser v The Netherlands </i>at paras 45-46, the Court first cited a line of authority, including <i>Asch v Austria </i>(Application No 12398/86) (1991) 15 EHRR 597, <i>Saïdi v France </i>(Application No 14647/89) (1993) 17 EHRR 251, <i>PS v Germany</i>, para 24 and <i>Lucà v Italy </i>(para 40, quoted below), for the proposition that reliance on testimony (in those cases of identified witnesses) not adduced before the trial court only required the possibility of cross-examination where such testimony played a main or decisive role in securing the conviction. The Court in <i>Visser </i>then cited the statement quoted above from <i>Kok</i>. The Court’s reliance, in a case concerning anonymous evidence, on principles governing the use of out of court statements by <i>identified </i>witnesses, coupled with the citation from <i>Kok</i>, again suggests that, even in relation to anonymous evidence, there may be no absolute requirement that such evidence should not be the sole or decisive factor in conviction. On the facts, the Court in <i>Visser</i>  concluded both that the need for anonymity had not been made out and “in addition” that the conviction was based to a decisive extent on the anonymous testimony. On this basis, it was not necessary to examine whether the procedures had sufficiently counterbalanced the difficulties faced by the defence.</p>
<p class="para">88.&nbsp;&nbsp;More recently, the Court in <i>Krasniki v Czech Republic </i>(Application No 51277/99) (unreported) 28 February 2006 not only quoted in para 76 of its judgment from <i>Doorson </i>and <i>Van Mechelen </i>(see para 79 above), but went on in paras 78-79 to repeat what it had said in <i>Visser </i>at paras 45-46. Again this may be read as an indication that there are circumstances in which even decisive testimony may be given anonymously. In <i>Krasniki </i>the conviction for unauthorised production and possession of drugs was based on evidence from two anonymous witnesses, in the form of  statements taken at pre-trial proceedings in the presence of the defendant’s lawyer who had had the opportunity to question such witnesses, and in the case of one of such witnesses in the form also of evidence given orally at trial with the witness outside the courtroom and out of sight of the defendant and his counsel who were however able to put questions to the witness through the judge. The Court was not satisfied that the need for anonymity had been sufficiently examined, and also observed that the conviction had been based at least to a decisive extent on the anonymous testimonies. </p>
<p class="para">89.&nbsp;&nbsp;In his submissions for the Crown Mr Perry QC suggested that any requirement that anonymous evidence should not be the sole or decisive basis for conviction derived from the authorities on pre-trial statements by (identified) witnesses who were not called for cross-examination at trial. That submission derives possible support from the citation in <i>Kok,</i> <i>Visser </i>and <i>Krasniki </i>of authorities which deal with that subject matter, rather than with anonymous witnesses. But it does not mean that a similar principle is inappropriate in relation to anonymous witnesses who are available for such cross-examination as is possible at trial. Whatever its origin, the requirement has been deployed without drawing this distinction, which is probably less real in those civil law countries with procedures involving use of an investigating magistrate than it is in the United Kingdom. Further, in <i>Krasniki </i>the requirement was applied to one anonymous witness who was called at trial. It is considerably less certain, for the reasons I have mentioned in paragraphs 84 to 86 above, that there is an absolute requirement that anonymous testimony should not be the sole or decisive evidence, or whether the extent to which such testimony is decisive may be no more than a very important factor to balance in the scales. I doubt whether the Strasbourg Court has said the last word about this. </p>
<p class="para">90.&nbsp;&nbsp;The position regarding the use at trial of pre-trial statements by identified witnesses is worth brief further consideration. The Strasbourg Court summarised the legal position in <i>Lucà v Italy </i>(Application No 33354/96) (2001) 36 EHRR 807 in these terms:</p>
<p class="qt">“40.  As the Court has stated on a number of occasions (see, among other authorities, <i>Isgrò v Italy</i>, judgment of 19 February 1991, Series A no 194-A, p 12, para 34, and <i>Lüdi</i> (1992) 15 EHRR 173, para 47), it may prove necessary in certain circumstances to refer to depositions made during the investigative stage (in particular, where a witness refuses to repeat his deposition in public owing to fears for his safety, a not infrequent occurrence in trials concerning Mafia-type organisations). If the defendant has been given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge the depositions, either when made or at a later stage, their admission in evidence will not in itself contravene article 6(1) and (3) (d). The corollary of that, however, is that where a conviction is based solely or to a decisive degree on depositions that have been made by a person whom the accused has had no opportunity to examine or to have examined, whether during the investigation or at the trial, the rights of the defence are restricted to an extent that is incompatible with the guarantees provided by article 6 (see <i>Unterpertinger v Austria</i> (1991) 13 EHRR 175, paras 31-33; <i>Saïdi v France</i> (1993) 17 EHRR 251, paras 43-44; and <i>Van Mechelen v The Netherlands  </i>para 55; see also <i>Dorigo v Italy</i>, application no 33286/96, Commission’s report of 9 September 1998, para 43, unpublished, and, on the same case, Committee of Ministers Resolution DH (99) 258 of 15 April 1999).” </p>
<p class="para">However, two English Court of Appeal cases, <i>R v M(KJ) </i>[2003] EWCA Crim 357, [2003] 2 Cr App R 322, para 59 and <i>R v Sellick </i>[2005] EWCA Crim 651, [2005] 1 WLR 3257 have doubted whether this mean’s that it would always be in violation of article 6 to admit written statements as evidence under the relevant provisions of (at that time) the Criminal Justice Act 1988 from witnesses who, it had been shown, could not be called or cross-examined because they could not be traced or had been kept away by intimidation by the defendant. The Court of Appeal deployed a similar rationale to that deployed in <i>Lord Morley’s case</i>,<i> Reynolds v United States </i>and <i>Crawford v Washington </i>(see para 68 above) - the defendant could not benefit from his own established wrongdoing. That, if accepted, is a qualification that does not bear directly on the present case where the evidence in question was adduced anonymously and the appellant was not established to have brought about the witnesses’ fear by intimidation. But the two Court of Appeal cases may serve as a caution against treating the Convention, or apparently general statements by the Strasbourg Court in different contexts, as containing absolutely inflexible rules.</p>
<i>
<p class="para">The position in International Criminal Courts</p>
</i>
<p class="para">91.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also relevant to consider the framework governing and the case-law generated by the activities of international courts established under the aegis of the United Nations. The framework, common to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and the International Criminal Court, consists in a statute supplemented by detailed rules. Detailed consideration has been given to both in case-law of the first of these Tribunals, notably in decisions in <i>Prosecutor v Tadic </i>(10 August 1995) and <i>Prosecutor v Blaskic </i>[1996] IT-95-14 (5 November 1996). In the former case, the Tribunal by a majority of two to one  allowed a number of witnesses to give anonymous testimony. Judge Sir Ninian Stephen, dissenting, concluded, after reviewing the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights (particularly <i>Kostovski</i>) at that date as well as that of United States, Victorian and United Kingdom courts, that the Tribunal’s statute “does not authorise anonymity of witnesses where this would in a real sense affect the rights of the accused specified in Article 21". The rights under Article 21 included the right to a fair trial, the presumption of innocence, the right to minimum guarantees, including the right to trial in his presence, to defend himself in person or through legal assistance, and to examine or have examined the witnesses against him and examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions). Judge Stephen went on to conclude that the rules also “give no support for anonymity of witnesses at the expense of fairness of the trial and the rights of the accused spelt out in Article 21". </p>
<p class="para">92.&nbsp;&nbsp;However Judge Stephen was not thereby excluding anonymity in all situations. Citing <i>Jarvie v Magistrates’ Court of Victoria at Brunswick </i>[1995] 1 VR 84, he accepted that, where an accused had known the witness in the past, but only under an assumed name (as in the case of an under-cover police witness) “in that case what justice may require, when protection of witnesses is important, is that only the false name should be revealed". In <i>Jarvie </i>Brooking J, giving the judgment of the court, had said that the identity of a witness could not be withheld “if there is good reason to think that disclosure may be of substantial assistance to the defendant in combating the case for the prosecution". A second category of anonymity which Judge Stephen was prepared to accept in principle was “where a witness has been a mere chance observer who is not known to the accused by any name or at all, having had no direct contact with him but having seen occurrences involving the accused to which he can testify". Judge Stephen was  prepared to go this far, noting that “Such non-disclosure may, it is true, impede or perhaps prevent enquiries as to past history of these witnesses, which might go to credit, but it will not obstruct cross-examination as to the matters observed by them and of which they give evidence” This category is not far from <i>Murphy</i>, but it goes further, because in <i>Murphy </i>the witnesses were producing hard, unobjectively unassailable film evidence, rather than giving oral evidence open in any realistic sense to cross-examination as to creditworthiness. </p>
<p class="para">93.&nbsp;&nbsp;Judge Stephen’s dissent received retrospective support, when during the trial in <i>Tadic </i>the identity of one of the anonymous witnesses was eventually discovered by the defence. The witness had asserted that he had seen Mr Tadic execute 30 males including the witness’s own father. After managing to identify the witness, the defence were able to produce his father, still alive, and only then did the witness admit that he had been trained by Bosnian Government authorities to give his evidence against Mr Tadic.</p>
<p class="para">94.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Blaskic </i>the Tribunal agreed with Judge Stephen rather than the majority in <i>Tadic</i>, and in particular with his conclusion that nothing in the rules supported anonymity of witnesses at the expense of fairness of the trial. However, it added a lengthy coda in which it made clear that it too was not excluding absolutely the possibility of anonymity in all circumstances. It said that, in principle the rights of the defence “take precedence, but the protection of witnesses will at times also claim its right, loud and clear” (para 39) and that “achieving this balance is a delicate operation” (para 40). It went on to underline that, for anonymity to be granted, there must not only be real fear for the safety of the witness or his family, but also proof to the Tribunal’s satisfaction of the importance of the evidence, the absence of any prima facie evidence of untrustworthiness and the absence of any available witness protection programme and of the need for anonymity rather than any less restrictive measures. In practice, there appears to have been no case in which any of the relevant Tribunals has granted anonymity applying these criteria, although it is not known when or how many applications for anonymity may subsequently have been made.</p>
<p class="para">95.&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite references made to <i>Kostovski</i>, the criteria accepted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugloslavia suggest, at least in principle, a flexible approach, free at least of any absolute requirement that anonymous testimony should not be the sole or decisive evidence against a defendant. The two cases of <i>Tadic </i>and <i>Blaskic </i>were of course decided before the Strasbourg Court had in <i>Doorson</i>, <i>Van Mechelen </i>and <i>Visser </i>spelled out that requirement separately. But, as I have noted in paras 84 to 87 above, the Strasbourg case-law may itself prove to have a greater flexibility than some of the dicta used in them would suggest. </p>
<i>
<p class="para">Conclusion on the present facts</p>
</i><p class="para">96.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever may be the position in that regard, I do not believe that the Strasbourg Court would accept that the use of anonymous evidence in the present case satisfied the requirements of article 6. Not only was the evidence on any view the sole or decisive basis on which alone the defendant could have been convicted, but effective cross-examination in the present case depended upon investigating the potential motives for the three witnesses giving what the defence maintained was a lying and presumably conspiratorial account. Cross-examination was hampered by the witnesses’ anonymity, by the mechanical distortion of their voices and by their giving evidence from behind screens, so that the appellant (and, since he was not prepared to put himself in a position where he had information that his client did not, his counsel) could not see the witnesses. Assuming that the sole or decisive nature of the evidence is not itself fatal, it is on any view an important factor which would require to be very clearly counter-balanced by other factors. Here there are none. The other factors are here very prejudicial in their impact on effective cross-examination.</p>
<p class="para">97.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if the matter rested with the Strasbourg jurisprudence, I would allow the appeal. However, on the basis that there is in the present Strasbourg jurisprudence nothing that requires states in their national law to balance anonymity against defendants’ rights, the primary question is whether English domestic law permits anonymous evidence in any circumstances. I am prepared to accept that there is a limited flexibility in exceptional circumstances such as those of <i>Murphy </i>discussed in para 73 above. In <i>Murphy </i>the judge could be sure to the necessary high standard that the witness was not in any realistic sense implicating the accused, and that there was no issue of credibility to which relevant cross-examination could have been directed if the witnesses’ identity had been known to the defendant. Another example of exceptional circumstances might be suggested to be the undercover officer who has met and dealt with an accused under a pseudonym. But the difficulty about accepting that would be that it would leave it to the judge, prosecution and police to investigate and decide whether any concerns existed about the officer’s record and reliability; the defence would be precluded from knowing or asking questions disclosing the officer’s true identity and background; and it would become difficult to draw the line between this and more radical in roads into the basic common law rule.</p>
