<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Brindle thus submits that no duty of care on the bank can be recognised because the bank did not voluntarily undertake responsibility even for the task which it is now alleged negligently to have executed. But Mr Sales can point to cases where a duty of care has been recognised even though the defendant cannot realistically be said to have voluntarily undertaken the relevant task. Instances may be found in <i>Ministry of Housing and Local Government v Sharp </i>[1970] 2 QB 223, <i>Spring v Guardian Assurance plc </i>and <i>Phelps v Hillingdon London Borough Council </i>[2001] 2 AC 619. Mr Brindle questions the correctness of the first of these decisions, but submits that none of them points towards the recognition of a duty on the present facts. First, it is convenient to summarise their effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Ministry of Housing and Local Government v Sharp</i> Mr Sharp was the local land registrar charged by statute with keeping the local registry, and where requested searching it and issuing a certificate setting forth the result. A clerk was seconded by Hemel Hempstead Rural District Council to assist Mr Sharp with this work. The clerk negligently issued an inaccurate certificate to a prospective purchaser of land, omitting any reference to a claim to reimbursement of compensation which the Ministry had against the seller. The effect was to extinguish the right which the Ministry would otherwise have had to pursue its claim against the purchaser.  It was conceded that, if the clerk was liable in negligence to the Ministry, then the council was vicariously liable for its clerk. The Court of Appeal held that the clerk was so liable. Lord Denning MR (at p 268F-G) did not agree that a duty of care could only arise when there was a voluntary assumption of responsibility. Salmon LJ (at p 279D-F) said</p>
<p></p><ul>"It has been argued â€¦. that since the council did not voluntarily make the search or prepare the certificate for their clerk's signature they did not voluntarily assume responsibility for the accuracy of the certificate and accordingly owed no duty to the  Minister. I do not accept that, in all cases, it necessarily depends upon a voluntary assumption of responsibility."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He added that he was anyway far from satisfied that the council did not voluntarily assume responsibility in circumstances where they had chosen to discharge "this somewhat pedestrian task" through their clerk, so that their registrar "might be left free to carry out other far more difficult and important functions on their behalf". Cross LJ (at p 291B) saw</p>
<p></p><ul>"no sufficient reason why in an appropriate case the liability should not extend to cases in which the defendant is obliged to make the statement which proves to be false"<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Spring v Guardian Assurance plc</i> the company acting as referee was obliged to give a reference (which the company considering whether to engage its subject was also obliged to seek). The obligation arose under the rules of the relevant self-regulatory body, Lautro (the Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation), set up under the Financial Services Act 1986. No member of the House saw such obligations as an obstacle to the recognition of a duty of care (see especially per Lord Goff of Chieveley at p 321D-F and Lord Lowry at p 327A-B). The main focus was on whether the existence of a potential defence of qualified privilege in any action for defamation was a bar to the recognition of a duty of care, which the House also held was not the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Phelps v Hillingdon London Borough Council</i> the House was concerned with claims arising in the statutory context of education authorities operating to a considerable extent under the Education Acts. The primary issue was whether the authorities' employees responsible for diagnosing special needs could owe a duty of care to those pupils affected by their diagnoses or failures to diagnose or treat properly. It was not suggested that the statutory duties themselves gave rise to any claim for breach of statutory duty, and the authorities argued that their employees' only duty of care was owed to the authorities. The House held that duties of care existed, even though the failures complained of took place in the course of purported fulfilment of the authorities' statutory duties, and of the employees' duties in that regard to the authorities. Further, Lord Slynn of Hadley did not accept that an authority could never owe a direct duty to pupils affected by its own (as opposed to one of its employees') failures to take care in the exercise of its powers relating to children with special needs (p 658E), while Lord Clyde (at p 676C) was "certainly not prepared to deny the possibility that such a duty may exist". Although there were allegations of damage amounting to physical loss in the cases before the House, the House did not draw any clear distinction between physical and economic loss and Lord Clyde (at p 670C) expressly said that "The loss claimed may be purely of an economic character".  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before considering further the relevance of these cases to the present, it is convenient to look more closely at factors which may assist to determine whether or not a duty of care should be recognised. Starting with the broad framework of the three-fold test, no issue arises regarding foreseeability. The rationale of a non-proprietary freezing order is the risk of dissipation of assets, so the loss to the Commissioners if the order was breached by the defendants or not implemented by the bank is exactly what is foreseen and foreseeable. Proximity is a vaguer notion, which may take in aspects which can also be considered under the head of fairness, justice and reasonableness. In legal, financial and practical terms, the freezing orders once notified to the bank created a most proximate relationship between the Commissioners and the bank. The orders were specifically directed to Brightstar's and Doveblue's accounts, the Commissioners gave direct notice of them to the bank, and the Commissioners were obviously likely to be heavily dependent on the bank's observance of such orders if they were to hope to satisfy any judgments they might obtain against Brightstar and Doveblue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100.&nbsp;&nbsp;The key question therefore is whether it is therefore fair, just and reasonable to recognise a duty? Here, in particular, it is necessary to descend to a level of greater particularity. What are the factors which can be identified as relevant? Foremost among those which have militated against the recognition of a duty of care in respect of economic loss in the past has been the fear of the indeterminacy of any resulting liability. This arises both when economic loss is liable to have what the respondents (citing Jane Stapleton in <i>Duty of Care and Economic Loss: A Wider Agenda</i> (1991) 107 LQR 249, 255) call a "ripple" effect, creating a chain or network of potential claimants and when it is likely to give rise to individual claims in indeterminate amounts. But neither of those aspects of the "floodgates" objection has any weight in circumstances such as the present. The freezing orders define both the potential claimants and the maximum amounts of any claim (although situations are conceivable in which it could take a third party given notice of such an order a little time to ascertain what assets belonging to the claimant he was actually holding).  The fact that a bank served with a freezing order has, prior to notice of its making, no idea which of its customers may attract such an order seems to me an irrelevance. The bank's duty only arises and is only to comply once it has notice of the order. In practice, of course a reputable and well-organised bank will have machinery in place to meet all the contingencies and requirements which may be expected commonly to arise in banking life. But that does not militate for or against recognition of any duty of care which it would otherwise be appropriate to recognise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101.&nbsp;&nbsp;A second potentially relevant factor is the availability of adequate alternative protection for the Commissioners. Here the position is again not unfavourable for the Commissioners' case that a duty of care should be recognised. The bank, once notified of the freezing orders was informed by paragraph 1 under the heading <i>"Effect of this Order"</i> that it was liable to contempt proceedings, if it knowingly assisted in or permitted a breach of their terms. The bank was obliged to do its best to implement the order, and no reputable bank could or should do anything but take the notification of a freezing order extremely seriously. But contempt requires proof to a standard commensurate with the seriousness of the offence, and the sanctions available to the court are not directed primarily at compensation, but at the imposition of a penalty. It is true that, with sensible ingenuity, a sanction can sometimes be tailored in such a way as to encourage the restoration of an asset which has been improperly released from a freezing order or perhaps even compensation: see e.g. the order made by Colman J in <i>Z Bank v D1 and Others</i> [1994] 1 Lloyd's Rep 657, 668. But a civil remedy for breach of a duty of care would be a much more satisfactory and complete protection than potential contempt proceedings for a claimant like the Commissioners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102.&nbsp;&nbsp;A third factor is the availability of insurance. There is no obvious likelihood that the Commissioners could have obtained insurance against the risk of negligence by the bank. In contrast, one would, as Mr Brindle accepts, expect any exposure of the bank under any duty of care to be covered by a banker's blanket policy, the terms of which are typically of extreme width. If the recognition of a duty of care involves any risk which the bank's insurers have not yet taken into account, any additional premium could either be a basis for increasing the conventional sum (in 2001 Â£150) which the bank charges those obtaining freezing orders against it, or be factored more generally into the bank's profit and interest margins. However third parties other than banks may be notified of a freezing order, e.g. individuals or businesses holding a defendant's assets or monies. It is not so obvious that they will have or could obtain insurance to cover the risk of negligent release to the defendant of such assets or monies. A distinction might, possibly, be advanced between third parties like banks whose business it is to look after monies and who could be expected to have procedures and insurance in place to meet the requirements and cover the risks of a freezing order and others of whom this would or could not necessarily be expected. But this would, I think, prove a difficult distinction both to justify in principle and to draw and apply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103.&nbsp;&nbsp;A fourth factor to be considered is whether the suggested duty of care to the claimants would be inconsistent with the bank's or the defendants' duty to the court.  Clearly it would not. It would complement and if anything reinforce performance of that duty, as Colman J recognised in paragraph 63 in his judgment: [2004] 1 WLR 2027, 2052. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, the suggested duty of care would be equally consistent with the bank's duty to the defendants as its customers, bearing in mind that each freezing order revoked the bank's mandate to make payments pursuant to the relevant defendant's instructions to the extent necessary to ensure compliance with its terms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixthly (and associated with the previous two points), the nature of a freezing order means that a duty could without difficulty be recognised, although it would amount to a duty to take care to avoid a disposition which would itself involve an intentional contempt of court by the bank's customer. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106.&nbsp;&nbsp;A seventh factor which weighed heavily and proved decisive with Colman J was that the bank was in his view in a similar position to an adverse party or an adverse party's legal representative in civil proceedings. An adverse party owes no duty of care in the commencement of proceedings: cf <i>Business Computers International Ltd v Registrar of Companies </i>[1988] Ch 229, where a petitioner had negligently caused the plaintiff to be put into liquidation by serving a petition for the plaintiff's winding up at the wrong address. This decision was approved in <i>Al-Kandari v J R Brown &amp; Co </i>[1988]  QB 665, where Bingham LJ (as he was) went on to say:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In the ordinary course of adversarial litigation a solicitor does not owe a duty of care to his client's adversary"<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107.&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting from this point, Mr Brindle pointed out that a solicitor might well hold client money which might be caught by a freezing order of which he was given notice, and submitted that, if such a solicitor could not owe a duty of care to the claimant, no more could or should the bank in the present case. But that submission assumes what it has to prove - it assimilates the role of a defendant's solicitor to whom a freezing order is notified with his adversarial role on behalf of his client. In some (albeit rare) circumstances one party's solicitor may at the same time occupy a separate, non-partisan role giving rise to a duty of care to the other party. The decision in <i>Al-Kandari</i> demonstrates this. The solicitors there agreed to hold the defendant's passport to the order of the court. As Lord Donaldson of Lymington MR said (at p 672D):</p>
<p></p><ul>"In voluntarily agreeing to hold the passport to the order of the court, the solicitors had stepped outside their role as solicitors for their client and accepted responsibilities towards both their client and the plaintiff and the children."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bingham LJ (as my Lord then was) said (at p 675E);</p>
<p></p><ul>"If the client intends to confer a benefit on a third party, the solicitor may owe a duty to the third party to take reasonable care to see that effect is given to the client's intentions."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went on (at 676D-E):</p>
<p></p><ul>"In so holding the passport the [solicitors] were not acting as solicitors and agents of the husband, their client, but as independent custodians subject to the directions of the court and the joint directions of the parties."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first passage quoted from Bingham LJ's judgment refers to circumstances like those in <i>White v Jones</i>. In <i>Dean v Allin &amp; Watts </i>[2001] 2 Lloyd's Rep 249, on which Mr Sales relied, the Court of Appeal took the view that such circumstances existed in the context of a property transaction where one party's solicitor was instructed and endeavouring to put security in place to enable a transaction to proceed in both parties' interests. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Brindle points out that third parties such as banks may not only be affected by notification of freezing orders, but may themselves actually be joined as co-defendants or sued in separate proceedings for relief (usually by way of disclosure, but in appropriate circumstances also by way of freezing order) which is essentially ancillary to a freezing order against the main defendant, the bank's customer: see eg <i>A  v C (Note) </i>[1981] QB 956, 961, <i>TSB Private Bank International SA v Chabra</i> [1992] 1 WLR 231 and <i>Mercantile Group (Europe) AG v Aiyela </i>[1994] QB 366.  (They may also, and not uncommonly are, sued for disclosure of information about apparent wrong-doing in which they have innocently become involved: <i>Norwich Pharmacal Co v Customs and Excise Commissioners </i>[1974] AC 133.) Apart from the relative rarity of the cases in which banks are joined as defendants to obtain freezing orders against them in respect of assets of the main defendant, I do not consider that their ancillary role as defendants in such cases would of itself be a reason for refusing to recognise a duty of care, if it were otherwise appropriate to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109.&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me back to what is in my opinion the determinative factor in this case, that is the absence of any real voluntary aspect to the involvement of a third party such as the bank in relation to a claimant's freezing order such as the present. <i>Al-Kandari </i>is a quite different case to the present, since the specific task was there voluntarily undertaken. In <i>White v Jones </i>and <i>Dean v Allin &amp; Watts</i> the solicitors also acted voluntarily on 0their clients' instructions, although the scope of their resulting duty was extended to third parties for whose benefit they so acted. In <i>Spring v Guardian Assurance plc </i>the relevant regulatory regime did no more than impose an obligation to obtain and give a reference of a familiar type which a former employer would commonly give, irrespective of any compulsion. It would have been incongruous if a duty of care was owed, when such a reference was not given under compulsion, but was absent just because it was. Further, if the reference had been unduly favourable, the recipient's reliance on it would have introduced an element bringing the situation close to that in <i>Hedley Byrne</i>, and it would have been strange if a duty were not also owed to the subject of an unduly unfavourable reference (cf per Lord Goff at p 321F). <i>Phelps v Hillingdon London Borough Council </i>is similarly a case where, although the defendant council and its employees were operating in the context of public statutory duties, they were nonetheless providing services which could equally well be and are provided in the private sector, and it would have been surprising if a similar duty of care were not owed by those providing them to that owed in the private sector: see per Lord Clyde (at pp 670H-671B). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110.&nbsp;&nbsp;The closest case to the present on which Mr Sales can rely is <i>Ministry of Housing and Local Government v Sharp</i>. But the statutory scheme there was aimed at protecting persons in respect of property purchases and, so far as necessary for that purpose, overriding other proprietary interests. Again, it would have been incongruous if a person relying on such a certificate to his detriment could have a claim because of the closeness of the situation to <i>Hedley Byrne</i>, but the Minister whose cause of action for reimbursement was extinguished had none (cf per Lord Denning MR at p 268H and Salmon LJ at p 278F-H). I consider that <i>Ministry of Housing and Local Government v Sharp </i>was rightly decided. It was referred to without disapproval in the speeches of both Lord Templeman and Lord Griffiths in <i>Smith v Bush</i> (at pp 846D-G and 862F). The result reached was eminently fair, just and reasonable. The role of land registrar was established as a public service to keep accurate records and provide reliable information. The information was to enable buyers to be secure in the property rights they acquired but concomitantly to override other property interests in the public interest in order to achieve this, even though such security and overriding occurred through negligence of the registrar or a clerk fulfilling his function. It would be unjust if no compensation could be obtained for the adverse consequences on property rights of negligence of an official performing such a service in the public interest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no analogy between any of these cases and the present. The recognition of a duty of care in the present case would not be closely incremental upon any existing duty. Here, the bank has not been entrusted by statute or otherwise with the provision of any public service. It has simply been notified of an order made by the court in favour of a claimant, and warned that it will be liable for contempt if it knowingly assists or permits a breach of that order. In a case of contempt, the court has control of the situation and a discretion which enables it to match the appropriate penalty to the seriousness of the particular contempt. It may be said that, if the court can revoke the bank's contractual mandate from its customer and can impose on the bank a potential liability for contempt in a case of knowing assistance in or permission of a breach, the court may also go further and impose a duty on the bank towards the claimant to take care to avoid any disposition of the defendants' frozen assets contrary to the freezing order. But that would be to impose a liability on an involuntary third party which would be outside the court's control, and which might be measured in very large sums, even for quite venial fault. The amounts caught by a freezing order can be very large, even though one would usually expect a third party notified of such an order to be able to ascertain quite quickly, from the order itself and from its own records, how much is actually caught by such an order. Nor does it seem to me that such a liability is required to maintain standards or ensure good practice. In practice, banks must and will try to do their best to ensure compliance with freezing orders, while their clients are, as this case shows, likely to try to evade them. Problems are, as here, most likely to arise at the very outset of such orders, when assets have not been fully ascertained or all possible avenues of evasion have not been closed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112.&nbsp;&nbsp;A further subsidiary consideration is that the Commissioners, at least in a case such as the present, cannot be said to have relied to their detriment on anything said or done by the bank. All that has happened is that the defendants have succeeded in abstracting assets which the Commissioners hoped to have frozen. In addition, if a duty of care were owed by a bank in this type of situation, it would be difficult to avoid the conclusion that other third parties, even private individuals, would also owe a duty of care, on receiving notification of a freezing order in respect of a defendant's assets which they happened to be holding. In the case of physical assets, questions could arise as to how far that would impose duties similar to those incurred by bailees to preserve or guard such assets (although I would accept that, if such duties were owed, it might be possible to limit them in extent to those owed to the defendant).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113.&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the consistency of many of the factors in play with the recognition of a duty of care, I would therefore answer the question whether it is fair, just and reasonable to impose such a duty on the bank in the negative. The common law has, it seems to me, developed a system offering very significant protection for claimants, together with very considerable incentives, backed by ample sanctions, for banks and other third parties to do their best to comply. Having imposed such an obligation on a third party, I do not consider that it should go further by imposing a duty on the third party towards a claimant to take care to prevent abstractions committed by the defendant in breach of a freezing order.  This would not be analogous with or incremental to any previous development of the law. The position as it is without any such duty of care seems to me to represent a fair and normally effective balance between the respective interests involved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore allow the appeal, and restore the order made by Colman J.</p>
