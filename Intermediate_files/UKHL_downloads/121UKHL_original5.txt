<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92.&nbsp;&nbsp;None of this is, of course, to diminish the tragedy of those deaths or to belittle the suffering of their relatives. The question is not whether they are entitled to our sympathy and our respect but whether they are entitled to a remedy before the courts of the United Kingdom. For the reasons given by Lord Rodger and Lord Brown, upon which I cannot improve, I would hold that, except in the case of Mr Mousa, they are not.</p>
<p><b>LORD CARSWELL</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a sad but inescapable consequence of armed conflict that lives will be lost.  Unhappily, some of the persons killed will be peaceable civilians caught in cross-fire.  Others will have been shot by members of the armed forces involved, and the extent of the justification for shooting them which may be advanced will vary enormously with the circumstances.  One of the appeals before the House concerned such an innocent civilian, and it cannot even be determined on the evidence presently available which group fired the shot which killed her.  In four of the appeals the victims were shot by members of the British armed forces.  As is very commonly the case in such situations, the versions of the facts retailed by witnesses differ markedly.  The soldiers maintain that they were or reasonably thought themselves to be under attack, and so were within the rules of engagement.  Civilian witnesses aver, however, that the victims were harmless and uninvolved citizens and that the shootings were unjustified.  The sixth case is wholly different: Mr Baha Mousa died as a result of appalling maltreatment in a prison occupied and run by British military personnel.  His treatment cannot for a moment be defended, but due to a regrettable paucity of evidence it has not proved possible to bring to justice those responsible for his death.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94.&nbsp;&nbsp;The families of the deceased persons understandably want a full and effective investigation carried out into each death.  Certain investigations were done by the Army authorities, but the relatives claim that they were insufficiently thorough and seek to have the government put in train more extensive inquiries at which evidence and opinions on all sides can be advanced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95.&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has been unwilling to commit itself to conduct further inquiries, but the appellants, who are relatives of the deceased persons, claim that it is bound to do so by the terms of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms ("the Convention") as applied in domestic law by the Human Rights Act 1998.  It is not in dispute that under article 2, as interpreted by Strasbourg jurisprudence, an obligation to conduct a proper investigation into a death caused by agents of the state is imposed upon a contracting state (though it is not admitted by the Secretary of State that the investigations carried out were insufficient to discharge such an obligation).  The anterior question before the House, however, is whether the Convention obligation applied at all in respect of deaths caused in Iraq.  That involves two issues (a) whether the Human Rights Act 1998 applies to acts or omissions of the state agencies of the United Kingdom outside the territorial boundaries of the UK (b) if so, whether the deceased persons were within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom, within the meaning of article 1 of the Convention, when they were killed in Iraq.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96.&nbsp;&nbsp;These two issues are closely interlinked, for the conclusion which one reaches on the extent of the UK's jurisdiction within article 1 has a considerable bearing on the intention which one imputes to Parliament in respect of the territorial extent of the Human Rights Act.  I have had the advantage of reading in draft the opinions prepared by my noble and learned friends, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry and Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood, with which I am in entire agreement.  For the reasons set out by Lord Rodger, I respectfully agree that section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 is to be interpreted as applying both when a public authority acts within the boundaries of the United Kingdom and when it acts outside those boundaries but within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom for the purposes of article 1 of the Convention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also respectfully agree with Lord Rodger and Lord Brown on the extent of that jurisdiction.  I would only observe that any extra-territorial jurisdiction of one state is <i>pro tanto</i> a diminution or invasion of the territorial jurisdiction of another, which must lead one to the conclusion that such extra-territorial jurisdiction should be closely confined.  It clearly exists by international customary law in respect of embassies and consulates.  It has been conceded by the Secretary of State that it extends to a military prison in Iraq occupied and controlled by agents of the United Kingdom.  Once one goes past these categories, it would in my opinion require a high degree of control by the agents of the state of an area in another state before it could be said that that area was within the jurisdiction of the former.  The test for establishing that is and should be stringent, and in my judgment the British presence in Iraq falls well short of that degree of control.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98.&nbsp;&nbsp;The stringency of the test for establishing jurisdiction makes it the more likely that Parliament intended the Human Rights Act to operate extra-territorially within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom, as Lord Brown points out in paragraph 150 of his opinion.  This assists one to accommodate the intention of Parliament, as it has to be ascertained by the courts, with the statements made inside and outside Parliament at the time when it was passed.  Although those statements may be to some extent rhetorical rather than definitive, they point very clearly to a general intention to equate the scope of the Act with the scope of the Convention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the result I would dismiss the appeals of the first five appellants, dismiss the Secretary of State's cross-appeal and make the order proposed by Lord Rodger to remit the sixth appellant's case to the Divisional Court.</p>
LORD BROWN OF EATON-UNDER-HEYWOOD
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100.&nbsp;&nbsp;These appeals arise out of the deaths of six Iraqi civilians caused by the actions of British soldiers in southern Iraq in the latter part of 2003 (between the cessation of major combat operations and the handover of sovereignty to the Iraqi interim government).  Five of the deceased were shot in the course of security operations (one in crossfire); the sixth died following gross ill-treatment whilst in custody in a UK military detention facility.  The appellants are their relatives who in each case seek principally Convention-compliant investigations into the respective killings and, in the long run, damages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101.&nbsp;&nbsp;It need hardly be said that all these deaths (and the thirty or so more leading to further claims now stayed pending the outcome of these proceedings) are greatly to be regretted, and the sixth utterly deplored.  The issues now arising, however, have to be decided by reference to legal principle, not out of sympathy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Lordships are here called on to decide two very important questions which arise by way of preliminary issue.  One concerns the reach of the European Convention on Human Rights: Who, within the meaning of article 1 of the Convention, is to be regarded as "within [a contracting party's] jurisdiction" so as to require that state to "secure to [them] the rights and freedoms" defined in the Convention?  The other concerns the reach of the Human Rights Act 1998 (the Act), the only basis on which the domestic courts have jurisdiction to hear human rights claims:  Does the Act apply extra-territorially and, if so, in what way?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103.&nbsp;&nbsp;These might be thought to be discrete questions, wholly unrelated to each other.  But I question this.  Suppose that article 1 of the Convention applies only to the extent contended for here by the respondent Secretary of State, with just a limited extra-territorial reach in certain closely defined circumstances.  To conclude that Parliament intended the Act to apply to these few additional cases as well as to the great majority of cases where the Convention is breached within the UK's own borders would be one thing.  To reach that conclusion, however, were the Convention found to extend as widely as the appellants (supported by the interveners) contend, encompassing not merely all the present claims but, it may be, others still more contentious, might be regarded as another thing entirely.  I propose, therefore, to consider first the reach of the Convention.</p>
<i><p><i></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104.&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall take as read the detailed facts of each case.  So too much of the copious jurisprudence and academic writings—domestic, Strasbourg-based and international—surrounding the issues arising.  A great deal of all this is to be found in the lengthy and impressive judgments given by each of the courts below—the Divisional Court's judgment of 14 December 2004 and the Court of Appeal's judgments of 21 December 2005 are reported successively at [2007] QB 140 (to p305).  I want to concentrate on what seem to me to be the core points.</p>
<p><i></i></p>
<i><p><i></i></p>
<p><i>Article 1 - the reach of the Convention</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ultimate decision upon this question, of course, must necessarily be for the European Court of Human Rights.  As Lord Bingham of Cornhill observed in <i>R (Ullah) v Special Adjudicator</i> [2004]  2 AC 323, 350 (para 20), "the Convention is an international instrument, the correct interpretation of which can be authoritatively expounded only by the Strasbourg court."  In the same paragraph Lord Bingham made two further points: first, that a national court "should not without strong reason dilute or weaken the effect of the Strasbourg case law"; secondly that, whilst member States can of course legislate so as to provide for rights more generous than those guaranteed by the Convention, national courts should not interpret the Convention to achieve this: the Convention must bear the same meaning for all states party to it.  Para 20 ends:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The duty of national courts is to keep pace with the Strasbourg jurisprudence as it evolves over time: no more, but certainly no less."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would respectfully suggest that last sentence could as well have ended: "no less, but certainly no more."  There seems to me, indeed, a greater danger in the national court construing the Convention too generously in favour of an applicant than in construing it too narrowly.  In the former event the mistake will necessarily stand: the member state cannot itself go to Strasbourg to have it corrected; in the latter event, however, where Convention rights have been denied by too narrow a construction, the aggrieved individual <i>can</i> have the decision corrected in Strasbourg. <i>Ullah,</i> of course, was concerned with the particular scope of individual Convention rights, there article 9, in the context of removing non-nationals from a member state.  Lord Bingham's cautionary words must surely apply with greater force still to a case like the present.  As the Grand Chamber observed in <i>Bankovic v Belgium</i> (2001)  11 BHRC 435, 449 (para 65): "the scope of article 1 . . . is determinative of the very scope of the contracting parties' positive obligations and, as such, of the scope and reach of the entire Convention system of human rights' protection."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Lordships accordingly ought not to construe article 1 as reaching any further than the existing Strasbourg jurisprudence clearly shows it to reach.  How far is that and, more particularly, (a) does article 1 encompass the first five appellants and (b) on what basis does it encompass the sixth appellant (as, following the Divisional Court's judgment, the respondent concedes it does); is this on the narrow basis (found by the Divisional Court) that detention in a British military facility, operated with the consent of the Iraqi sovereign authorities, falls within the same exceptional category as embassies and consulates, or on the wider basis (found by the Court of Appeal) that Mr Mousa, from the moment of his arrest, "came within the control and authority of the UK", or on a wider basis still (as the appellants contend and as would be necessary were it to avail the other appellants too)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108.&nbsp;&nbsp;In considering how far Strasbourg has gone in extending article 1 jurisprudence extra-territorially, I propose to take as my starting point the decision of the Grand Chamber in <i>Bankovic</i>.  This I have no doubt the Divisional Court was right to describe (at para 268) as "a watershed authority in the light of which the Strasbourg jurisprudence as a whole has to be re-evaluated".  The case was referred to the Grand Chamber specifically for a definitive judgment on this fundamental issue.  It was fully argued, and the judgment, which was unanimous, was fully reasoned.  The travaux préparatoires<i>,</i> the entire previous case law of the Commission and the Court, the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (1969), the practice of the contracting states with regard to derogating for extra-territorial military operations (none had ever done so), comparative case law and the international law background were for the first time all considered in a single judgment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lengthy extracts from <i>Bankovic</i> have already been set out in the judgments of the courts below and I shall not repeat them.  Rather I shall at once set out certain central propositions for which in my judgment <i>Bankovic</i> stands:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 1 reflects an "essentially territorial notion of jurisdiction" (a phrase repeated several times in the Court's judgment), "other bases of jurisdiction being exceptional and requiring special justification in the particular circumstances of each case" (para 61).  The Convention operates, subject to article 56, "in an essentially regional context and notably in the legal space (<i>espace juridique</i>) of the contracting states" (para 80) (ie within the area of the Council of Europe countries). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court recognises article 1 jurisdiction to avoid a "vacuum in human rights' protection" when the territory "would normally be covered by the Convention" (para 80) (ie in a Council of Europe country) where otherwise (as in Northern Cyprus) the inhabitants "would have found themselves excluded from the benefits of the Convention safeguards and system which they had previously enjoyed" (para 80).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;The rights and freedoms defined in the Convention cannot be "divided and tailored" (para 75).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;The circumstances in which the Court has exceptionally recognised the extra-territorial exercise of jurisdiction by a state include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the state "through the effective control of the relevant territory and its inhabitants abroad as a consequence of military occupation or through the consent, invitation or acquiescence of the government of that territory,  exercises all or some of the public powers normally to be exercised by [the government of that territory]" (para 71) (ie when otherwise there would be a vacuum within a Council of Europe country, the government of that country itself being unable "to fulfil the obligations it had undertaken under the Convention" (para 80) (as in Northern Cyprus).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cases involving the activities of its diplomatic or consular agents abroad and on board craft and vessels registered in, or flying the flag of, that state [where] customary international law and treaty provisions have recognised the extra-territorial exercise of jurisdiction" (para 73).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain other cases where a state's responsibility "could, in principle, be engaged because of acts … which produced effects or were performed outside their own territory" (para 69). <i>Drozd v France</i> (1992) 14 EHRR 745 (at para 91) is the only authority specifically referred to in <i>Bankovic</i> as exemplifying this class of exception to the general rule. <i>Drozd</i>, however, contemplated no more than that, if a French judge exercised jurisdiction extra-territorially in Andorra in his capacity as a French judge,then anyone complaining of a violation of his Convention rights by that judge would be regarded as being within France's jurisdiction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>Soering v United Kingdom</i> (1989) 11 EHRR 439 line of cases, the Court pointed out, involves action by the state whilst the person concerned is "on its territory, clearly within its jurisdiction" (para 68) and not, therefore, the exercise of the state's jurisdiction abroad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, on the face of it, nothing in <i>Bankovic</i> which gives the least support to the appellants' arguments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before turning to examine whether subsequent Strasbourg jurisprudence has weakened these principles, it is, I think, instructive first to consider the implications of article 56 of the Convention, an article mentioned in <i>Bankovic</i> merely as a provision which "enables a contracting state to declare that the Convention shall extend to all or any of the territories for whose international relations that state is responsible" (para 80). </p>
<i><p><i>Article 56</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111.&nbsp;&nbsp;When under article 56 a state chooses to extend the Convention to a dependent territory (ex hypothesi not within the Council of Europe area—see, for example, <i>Tyrer v United Kingdom</i> (1978) 2 EHRR 1, at para 38), the Convention is applied "with due regard . . . to local requirements" (article 56(3)).  <i>Py v France</i> (2005) 42 EHRR 548, where voting restrictions in New Caledonia were found justified, provides an up to date illustration of this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112.&nbsp;&nbsp;Save under article 56, the Convention cannot apply to dependent territories.  In particular, as the Court recently explained in <i>Quark v United Kingdom </i>(2006) 44 EHRR SE 70, the "effective control principle" does not apply to them.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113.&nbsp;&nbsp;How then could that principle logically apply to any other territory outside the area of the Council of Europe?  As the respondent submits, it would be a remarkable thing if, by the exercise of effective control, for however short a time, over non-Council of Europe territory, a state could be fixed with the article 1 obligation to secure within that territory, without regard to local requirements, all Convention rights and freedoms whereas, despite its exercise of effective control over a dependent territory, perhaps for centuries past, the state will not be obliged to secure any Convention rights there unless it has made an article 56 declaration and even then it would be able to rely on local requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114.&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be noted that thirty years ago Turkey unsuccessfully sought to rely (directly or by analogy) on article 56 (then article 63) to contest its liability to secure Convention rights for the inhabitants of Northern Cyprus unless it chose to do so—<i>Cyprus v Turkey </i> (1978)  21 Yearbook of the ECHR 100.  The argument failed: Northern Cyprus being part of a Council of Europe country, whichever member state has effective control must secure all Convention rights.  True it is that thirty years ago the reasoning of the Commission (by reference to the acts of state agents abroad) was different from that of the Strasbourg Court today: it was not until <i>Loizidou v Turkey</i> (Preliminary Objections) (1995) 20 EHRR 99, another Northern Cyprus case, that the Court for the first time articulated the effective control of an area principle.  The logic, however, remains clear: subject only to a few narrow exceptions the Convention applies solely within the Council of Europe area and must then apply in full measure.  The same point was more recently made in <i>Ilascu v Moldova</i> (Admissibility) (Application No 48787/99) (unreported) 4 July 2001 where the Court, rejecting Moldova's assertion that the Convention did not extend to Transdniestria, expressly distinguished a state's right not to extend the Convention to non-Council of Europe territories under article 56.</p>
<i></i><p><i><i>The post-Bankovic cases</i></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grand Chamber has considered the reach of article 1 of the Convention four times since <i>Bankovic</i>, on each occasion expressly following the <i>Bankovic</i> analysis.  <i>Assanidze v Georgia</i> (2004)  39 EHRR 653 concerned the Ajarian Autonomous Republic in Georgia over which both parties accepted that Georgia exercised jurisdiction.  The Grand Chamber emphasised the exceptional nature of extra-territorial jurisdiction and confirmed the indivisible nature of article 1 jurisdiction:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The general duty imposed on the state by article 1 of the Convention entails and requires the implementation of a national system capable of securing compliance with the Convention throughout the territory of the state for everyone" (para 147).<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ilascu v Moldova and Russia</i> (2004)  40 EHRR 1030, concerned human rights in Transdniestria, an area of Moldova subject to a separatist regime supported by Russia.  The Grand Chamber held by a majority of 16 to 1 that Russia exercised jurisdiction and by 11 votes to 6 that Moldova did too.  Because, however, Moldova lacked effective control within its own territory it could not be held responsible for violations save to the extent that they arose out of failures by Moldova to comply with its positive obligations "to take the diplomatic, economic, judicial or other measures that it is in its power to take and are in accordance with international law to secure to the applicants the rights guaranteed by the Convention" (para 331).  Judge Bratza, speaking for five of the six judges dissenting on whether Moldova exercised jurisdiction, expressed</p>
<p></p><ul>"difficulty in accepting the proposition that those within a part of the territory of a state over which, as a result of its unlawful occupation by a separatist administration, the state is prevented from exercising any authority or control, may nevertheless be said to be within the 'jurisdiction' of the state according to the autonomous meaning of that term in article 1 of the Convention, which term presupposes that the state has the power 'to secure to everyone . . . the rights and freedoms' defined therein."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever view one takes of the majority's approach, however, it cannot avail the appellants here: there was simply no question of Moldova exercising any form of extra-territorial jurisdiction.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117.&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 1 was only briefly touched on by the Grand Chamber in <i>Bosphorus Hava Yollari Turizm ve Ticaret Anonim Sirketi v Ireland</i> (2005)  42 EHRR 1.  <i>Bankovic, Assanidze </i>and<i> Ilascu </i>were all cited in footnotes to para 136.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Öcalan v Turkey </i>(2005) 41 EHRR 985 concerned (in part) the applicant's arrest by members of the Turkish Security Forces inside a Turkish registered aircraft in the international zone of Nairobi Airport.  The Grand Chamber stated (at para 91) the basis upon which it accepted that Turkey had at that early stage exercised jurisdiction over the applicant:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is common ground that, directly after being handed over to the Turkish officials by the Kenyan officials, the applicant was under effective Turkish authority and therefore within the 'jurisdiction' of that state for the purposes of article 1 of the Convention, even though in this instance Turkey exercised its authority outside its territory.  It is true that the applicant was physically forced to return to Turkey by Turkish officials and was under their authority and control following his arrest and return to Turkey (see, in this respect, the aforementioned decisions in the cases of [<i>Sánchez</i>]<i> Ramirez v France</i> and <i>Freda v Italy</i>; and, by converse implication, <i>Bankovic v Belgium</i>)."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both <i>Sánchez Ramirez  v France </i>(1996) 86-A DR 155  and <i>Freda v Italy </i>(1980) 21 DR 250 (the authorities there referred to) also concerned irregular extradition, one a revolutionary known as Carlos (the Jackal), the other an Italian.  Each was taken into custody abroad, respectively by French police in Khartoum and by Italian police in Costa Rica, and flown respectively in a French military airplane to France and in an Italian Air- force plane to Italy.  In each case, as in <i>Öcalan</i>, the forcible removal was effected with the full cooperation of the foreign authorities and with a view to the applicant's criminal trial in the respondent state.  Unsurprisingly in these circumstances the Grand Chamber in <i>Öcalan</i> had felt able to distinguish <i>Bankovic</i> "by converse implication".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120.&nbsp;&nbsp;This line of cases clearly constitutes one category of "exceptional" cases expressly contemplated by <i>Bankovic</i> as having "special justification" for extraterritorial jurisdiction under article 1.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121.&nbsp;&nbsp;Another category, similarly recognised in <i>Bankovic</i>, was <i>Drozd </i>(see para 109(4)(iii) above) into which category can also be put cases like <i>X and Y v Switzerland</i> (1977) 9 DR 57 and <i>Gentilhomme v France</i> (Application No 48205/99) (unreported) 14 May 2002.  In <i>X and Y v Switzerland</i>, Switzerland was held to be exercising jurisdiction where, pursuant to treaty provisions with Liechtenstein, it legislated for immigration matters in both states, prohibiting <i>X</i> from entering either.  In <i>Gentilhomme,</i> France operated French state schools in Algeria, again pursuant to a treaty arrangement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122.&nbsp;&nbsp;The cases involving the activities of embassies and consulates (see para 109(4)(ii) above) themselves subdivide into essentially two sub-categories, those concerning nationals of the respondent state and those concerning foreign nationals.  The former includes cases like <i>X v Federal Republic of Germany</i> (1965)  8 Yearbook of the ECHR 158 and <i>X v UK</i> (1977)  12 DR 73; the latter cases like <i>M v Denmark</i> (1992)  73 DR 193 and <i>R (B) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs</i> [2005] QB 643.  It is unnecessary for present purposes to consider the facts of any of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123.&nbsp;&nbsp;None of the cases in any of these categories appear to me in any way helpful to the first five appellants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;124.&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn, therefore, to the one post-<i>Bankovic</i> Strasbourg judgment upon which the appellants seek to place particular reliance: <i>Issa v Turkey (Merits)</i> (2004) 41 EHRR 567.  <i>Issa</i> was not, be it noted, a judgment of the Grand Chamber (although three of its seven judges had been members of the Grand Chamber in <i>Bankovic</i>); nor in the event did the application succeed.  It had, moreover, been found admissible in a decision (Application No 31821/96) (unreported) 30 May 2000 which pre-dated <i>Bankovic</i> when (as noted in the <i>Bankovic</i> judgment at para 81) no issue of jurisdiction had been raised.</p>
