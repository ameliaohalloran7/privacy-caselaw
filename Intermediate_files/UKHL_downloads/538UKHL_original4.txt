<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the conclusion of his judgment, referring to the decision of Judge Appleby, Kennedy LJ stated, at para 48:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The judge did not hear evidence and thus did not reach any conclusions of primary fact.  He reached the conclusion he did with evident reluctance.  He formed the view that the decision in <i>Teixeira de Castro</i> robbed him of the power to make any decision other than he did, and created a situation where the only test to be applied was whether the officer was acting as an agent provocateur in the sense that he was enticing the accused to commit that particular offence which he did.  In that we are satisfied he fell into error.  He further appears to have directed himself that the accused's proven history of dealing on some scale in Class B drugs was of no relevance.  Since his disposition to commit the offence in the absence of persuasion by the officers was directly relevant, that was a misdirection, as Mr Emmerson only faintly disputed.  If, on the facts we have recited, the judge had asked himself whether the undercover officers had done more than give the accused an opportunity to break the law of which the accused had freely taken advantage then, in our judgment, he would have answered that question in the negative, and he would not have ruled as he did."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having delivered its judgment the Court of Appeal referred the point of law to the House for its opinion.</p>
<i><p><i>The issue</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97. The problem which arises where there has been entrapment by police officers is one which has been considered by appellate courts in many jurisdictions.  It is apparent from the authorities to which I am about to refer that the approach of the English courts has been to consider whether the prosecution should be stayed as an abuse of process or whether the evidence obtained by the police officers should be excluded on the ground of unfairness.  As the authorities cited by my noble and learned friends, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead and Lord Hoffmann show, in the United States entrapment is held to be a substantive defence, in Canada a stay of proceedings is granted, and in Australia evidence obtained by unlawful or improper conduct on the part of law enforcement officers is excluded on the grounds of public policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98. In <i>R v Latif</i> [1996]  1 WLR 104 Lord Steyn in his speech, with which the other members of the House agreed, considered the circumstances in which the conduct of law enforcement officers should cause a prosecution to be stayed for abuse of process.  It had been established by this House in <i>R v Sang</i> [1980]  AC 402 that entrapment is not a substantive defence under English law, in the sense that it does not have the effect that no crime is committed by the alleged principal offender as, notwithstanding the entrapment, he has the mens rea and commits the actus reus to constitute the offence.  After recognising this and commenting that it was not the end of the matter  Lord Steyn stated the dilemma in this way, at p 112E:</p>
<p></p><ul>"If the court always refuses to stay such proceedings, the perception will be that the court condones criminal conduct and malpractice by law enforcement agencies.  That would undermine public confidence in the criminal justice system and bring it into disrepute.  On the other hand, if the court were always to stay proceedings in such cases, it would incur the reproach that it is failing to protect the public from serious crime."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer which Lord Steyn gave, at pp 112G and 113B, was as follows:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The weaknesses of both extreme positions leaves only one principled solution.  The court has a discretion:  it has to perform a balancing exercise . . . .<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>". . . . the judge must weigh in the balance the public interest in ensuring that those that are charged with grave crimes should be tried and the competing public interest in not conveying the impression that the court will adopt the approach that the end justifies any means."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the facts before the House in that case Lord Steyn said, at p 113D:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The conduct of the customs officer was not so unworthy or shameful that it was an affront to the public conscience to allow the prosecution to proceed.  Realistically, any criminal behaviour of the customs officer was venial compared to that of Shahzad.  In these circumstances I would reject the submission that the judge erred in refusing to stay the proceedings."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99. In <i>Nottingham City Council v Amin</i> [2000]  1 WLR 1071 a taxi driver licensed by the local authority was hailed by two plain clothes police officers while driving in an area not covered by his licence.  He stopped and took the two officers to the address they requested in return for a fare.  He was prosecuted for using his taxi to ply for hire when he had not previously obtained a licence to operate in that area.  At the hearing of the prosecution the stipendiary magistrate ruled that having regard to the effect of article 6 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (1953) (Cmd 8969) the evidence of the police officers, whom he described as agents provocateurs, should be excluded from evidence under section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.  On appeal by the local authority the Divisional Court allowed the appeal and remitted the case to the magistrate with a direction to convict.  Lord Bingham of Cornhill CJ stated, at p 1076H:</p>
<p></p><ul>"On the one hand it has been recognised as deeply offensive to ordinary notions of fairness if a defendant were to be convicted and punished for committing a crime which he only committed because he had been incited, instigated, persuaded, pressurised or wheedled into committing it by a law enforcement officer.  On the other hand, it has been recognised that law enforcement agencies have a general duty to the public to enforce the law and it has been regarded as unobjectionable if a law enforcement officer gives a defendant an opportunity to break the law, of which the defendant freely takes advantage, in circumstances where it appears that the defendant would have behaved in the same way if the opportunity had been offered by anyone else."  <p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100. Therefore the approach taken by the English cases is that it is necessary to balance the competing requirements that those who commit crimes should be convicted and punished and that there should not be an abuse of process which would constitute an affront to the public conscience.  In carrying out this balancing exercise it will be necessary for the court in each individual case to take into account a number of factors.  These factors have been discussed in the speeches of my noble and learned friends, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead and Lord Hoffmann and I am in full agreement with the views which they express.  I further consider, with respect, that the approach to be taken by a court and the matters to be considered are well set out in the dissenting judgment of McHugh J in the High Court of Australia in <i>Ridgeway v The Queen</i> (1995)  184 CLR 19, 92 (save that, in my opinion, a prosecution should not be permitted to proceed when the evidence had been obtained by threats):</p>
<p></p><ul>"I do not think that it is possible to formulate a rule that will cover all cases that arise when an accused person seeks to stay a prosecution on the ground that the offence was induced by or was the result of the conduct of law enforcement authorities.  The ultimate question must always be whether the administration of justice will be brought into disrepute because the processes of the court are being used to prosecute an offence that was artificially created by the misconduct of law enforcement authorities.  That question should be determined after considering four matters:<p></p></ul>
(1) <p></p><ul>Whether conduct of the law enforcement authorities induced the offence.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether, in proffering the inducement, the authorities had reasonable grounds for suspecting that the accused was likely to commit the particular offence or one that was similar to that offence or were acting in the course of a bona fide investigation of offences of a kind similar to that with which the accused has been charged.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether, prior to the inducement, the accused had the intention of committing the offence or a similar offence if an opportunity arose. <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the offence was induced as the result of persistent importunity, threats, deceit, offers of rewards or other inducements that would not ordinarily be associated with the commission of the offence or a similar offence."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101. In balancing the relevant factors the English courts have placed particular emphasis on the need to consider whether a person has been persuaded or pressurised by a law enforcement officer into committing a crime which he would not otherwise have committed, or whether the officer did not go beyond giving the person an opportunity to break the law, when he would have behaved in the same way if some other person had offered him the opportunity to commit a similar crime, and when he freely took advantage of the opportunity presented to him by the officer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102. In considering the distinction (broadly stated) between a person being lured by a police officer into committing an offence so that it will be right to stay a prosecution, and a person freely taking advantage of an opportunity to commit an offence presented to him by the officer, it is necessary to have in mind that a drugs dealer will not voluntarily offer drugs to a stranger, unless the stranger first makes an approach to him, and the stranger may need to persist in his request for drugs before they are supplied.  Therefore, in my opinion, a request for drugs, even if it be persistent, need not be regarded as luring the drugs dealer into committing a crime with the consequence that a prosecution against him should be stayed.  If a prosecution were not permitted in such circumstances the combating of the illegal sale of drugs would be severely impeded, and I do not consider that the integrity of the criminal justice system would be impaired by permitting a prosecution to take place.  In my opinion a prosecution should not be stayed where a police officer has used an inducement which (in the words of McHugh J in <i>Ridgeway v The Queen</i> 184 CLR 19, 92) "is consistent with the ordinary temptations and stratagems that are likely to be encountered in the course of criminal activity".  This is in conformity with the approach taken by the United States Supreme Court in <i>Sorrells v United States</i> (1932) 287 US 435, 441 where the court stated:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is well settled that the fact that officers or employees of the Government merely afford opportunities or facilities for the commission of the offense does not defeat the prosecution.  Artifice and stratagem may be employed to catch those engaged in criminal enterprises . . . . The appropriate object of this permitted activity, frequently essential to the enforcement of the law, is to reveal the criminal design;  to expose the illicit traffic, the prohibited publication, the fraudulent use of the mails, the illegal conspiracy, or other offenses, and thus to disclose the would-be violators of the law.  A different question is presented when the criminal design originates with the officials of the Government, and they implant in the mind of an innocent person the disposition to commit the alleged offense and induce its commission in order that they may prosecute."<p></p></ul>
<p>See also <i>United States v Russell</i> (1973) 411 US 423, 435 and 436.</p>
<i><p><i></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i>Section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984</i></p>
</i><p><i><i></i></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103. There is one further observation which I wish to make in respect of the English authorities.  In many of the cases where the issue of entrapment has been considered no detailed consideration has been given to the question whether the prosecution should be stayed as being an abuse of process or whether the evidence should be excluded under section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 on the ground that its submission would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the court ought not to admit it.  However in<i> R v Shannon</i> [2001]  1 WLR 51 the Court of Appeal gave consideration to the relationship between entrapment and section 78 and, at p 68C, Potter LJ stated in relation to section 78:</p>
<p></p><ul>"the ultimate question is not the broad one:  is the bringing of proceedings fair (in the sense of appropriate) in entrapment cases.  It is whether the fairness of the proceedings will be adversely affected by admitting the evidence of the agent provocateur or evidence which is available as the result of his action or activities.  So, for instance, if there is good reason to question the credibility of evidence given by an agent provocateur, or which casts doubt on the reliability of other evidence procured by or resulting from his actions, and that question is not susceptible of being properly or fairly resolved in the course of the proceedings from available, admissible and 'untainted' evidence, then the judge may readily conclude that such evidence should be excluded.  If, on the other hand, the unfairness complained of is no more than the visceral reaction that it is in principle unfair as a matter of policy, or wrong as a matter of law, for a person to be prosecuted for a crime which he would not have committed without the incitement or encouragement of others, then that is not itself sufficient, unless the behaviour of the police (or someone acting on behalf of or in league with the police) and/or the prosecuting authority has been such as to justify a stay on grounds of abuse of process."<p></p></ul>
<p>I am in agreement with this analysis which accords with the statement of Lord Steyn in <i>R v Latif</i> [1996] 1 WLR 104, 112G:</p>
<p></p><ul>"If the court concludes that a fair trial is not possible, it will stay the proceedings.  That is not what the present case is concerned with.  It is plain that a fair trial was possible and that such a trial took place.  In this case the issue is whether, despite the fact that a fair trial was possible, the judge ought to have stayed the criminal proceedings on broader considerations of the integrity of the criminal justice system."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104. Therefore I consider that if a defendant wishes to rely on entrapment he should normally do so by applying before the proceedings begin for a stay on the ground of abuse of process.  If his application is refused it will still be open to him to seek to exclude the evidence under section 78 on the kind of ground stated by Potter LJ.  But I agree with my noble and learned friend, Lord Hoffmann, that if a later application to exclude evidence under section 78 is, in substance, an application to stay on the ground of entrapment, a court should apply the principles applicable to the grant of a stay.</p>
<i><p><i>The judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in Teixeira de Castro v Portugal</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105. The European Court sets out the facts at (1998) 28 EHRR 101, 104-105:</p>
<p></p><ul>"9.&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with an operation monitoring drug-trafficking, two plain clothes officers of the Public Security Police (PSP) from the Famaliçao police station approached an individual, VS, on a number of occasions.  He was suspected of petty drug-trafficking in order to pay for drugs—mainly hashish— for his own consumption.  They hoped that through VS they would be able to identify his supplier and offered to buy several kilograms of hashish from him.  Unaware that they were police officers, VS agreed to find a supplier.  However, despite being pressed by the two officers, he was unable to locate one.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly before midnight on 30 December 1992 the two officers went to VS's home saying that they were now interested in buying heroin.  VS mentioned the name of Francisco Teixeira de Castro as being someone who might be able to find some;  however, he did not know the latter's address and had to obtain it from FO.  All four of them went to the applicant's home in the purported buyers' car.  The applicant came outside at FO's request and got into the car where the two officers, accompanied by V.S., were waiting.  The officers said that they wished to buy 20 grams of heroin for 200,000 escudos and produced a roll of banknotes from the Bank of Portugal.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Teixeira de Castro agreed to procure the heroin and, accompanied by FO, went in his own car to the home of another person, JPO.  The latter obtained three sachets of heroin, one weighing 10 grams and the other two five grams each, from someone else and, on his return, handed them over to the applicant in exchange for a payment, which, though the precise figure is not known, exceeded 100,000 escudos.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;The applicant then took the drugs to VS's home;  VS had in the meantime returned there and the two police officers were waiting outside.  The deal was to take place in the house.  The officers went inside at VS's invitation; the applicant then took one of the sachets out of his pocket whereupon the two officers identified themselves and arrested the applicant, VS and FO, shortly before 2 am.  They searched all three and found the applicant to be in possession of another two sachets of heroin, 43,000 escudos in cash and a gold bracelet."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106. The applicant, Mr Teixeira de Castro, was prosecuted before a criminal court in Portugal which convicted him and sentenced him to six years imprisonment.  The applicant appealed to the Supreme Court in Portugal against his conviction but the Supreme Court dismissed his appeal.  Before the European Court of Human Rights the applicant complained that he had not had a fair trial in violation of article 6(1) of the Convention in that he had been incited by plain clothes police officers to commit the offence of which he was later convicted.  The European Court upheld the applicant's complaint and held that there had been a violation of article 6(1). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107. At p 115 of its judgment the court stated:</p>
<p></p><ul>"36.&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of undercover agents must be restricted and safeguards put in place even in cases concerning the fight against drug-trafficking.  While the rise in organised crime undoubtedly requires that appropriate measures be taken, the right to a fair administration of justice nevertheless holds such a prominent place that it cannot be sacrificed for the sake of expedience.  The general requirements of fairness embodied in article 6 apply to proceedings concerning all types of criminal offence, from the most straightforward to the most complex.  The public interest cannot justify the use of evidence obtained as a result of police incitement."<p></p></ul>
<p>The essence of the reasoning of the court is, at pp 115-116 of its judgment:</p>
<p></p><ul>"38.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the instant case it is necessary to determine whether or not the two police officers' activity went beyond that of undercover agents.  The court notes that the Government have not contended that the officers' intervention took place as part of an anti-drug-trafficking operation ordered and supervised by a judge.  It does not appear either that the competent authorities had good reason to suspect that Mr Teixeira de Castro was a drug-trafficker; on the contrary, he had no criminal record and no preliminary investigation concerning him had been opened.  Indeed, he was not known to the police officers, who only came into contact with him through the intermediaries, VS and FO.  Furthermore, the drugs were not at the applicant's home:  he obtained them from a third party who had in turn obtained them from another person.  Nor does the Supreme Court's judgment of 5 May 1994 indicate that, at the time of his arrest, the applicant had more drugs in his possession than the quantity the police officers had requested thereby going beyond what he had been incited to do by the police.  There is no evidence to support the Government's argument that the applicant was predisposed to commit offences.  The necessary inference from these circumstances is that the two police officers did not confine themselves to investigating Mr Teixeira de Castro's criminal activity in an essentially passive manner, but exercised an influence such as to incite the commission of the offence.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Lastly, the court notes that in their decisions the domestic courts said that the applicant had been convicted mainly on the basis of the statements of the two police officers.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>39.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of all these considerations, the court concludes that the two police officers' actions went beyond those of undercover agents because they instigated the offence and there is nothing to suggest that without their intervention it would have been committed.  That intervention and its use in the impugned criminal proceedings meant that, right from the outset, the applicant was definitively deprived of a fair trial.  Consequently, there has been a violation of article 6(1)."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108. In my opinion the principle stated by the court is that the fairness of a trial is violated if the crime for which the defendant is prosecuted has been incited or instigated by police officers:  thus the court concluded its reasoning, at p 116, in paragraph 39 by stating that: </p>
<p></p><ul>"the two police officers' actions went beyond those of undercover agents because they instigated the offence and there was nothing to suggest that without their intervention it would have been committed.  That intervention and its use in the impugned criminal proceedings meant that, right from the outset, the applicant was definitively deprived of a fair trial.  Consequently, there has been a violation of article 6(1)."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109. Accordingly I consider that the approach of the English courts and of McHugh J in <i>Ridgeway v The Queen</i> 184 CLR 19 is in no way inconsistent with the ratio decidendi<i> </i>of the European Court in <i>Texeira de Castro</i>.  As the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Bingham of Cornhill, stated in <i>Nottingham City Council v Amin </i>[2000] 1 WLR 1071, 1076-1077, there would be a violation of the concept of fairness "if a defendant were to be convicted and punished for committing a crime which he only committed because he had been incited, instigated, persuaded, pressurised or wheedled into committing it by a law enforcement officer."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110. In some cases in England the argument has been advanced by counsel for the defence that the European Court has laid down as a principle that unless the police officers act "in an essentially  passive manner" they have incited the commission of the offence and that, in consequence, there must be a breach of article 6(1).  Defence counsel point to the penultimate sentence at p 116, para 38 in support of this submission.  Thus in <i>Amin</i> is case [2000] 1 WLR 1071, 1080G,<i> </i>Lord Bingham described counsel for the defendant as advancing the following argument:</p>
<p></p><ul>"None the less, Mr Beloff is entitled to, and does, attach significance to the precise language which the court uses in paragraph 38 of the judgment.  He submits that the two police constables in Nottingham did not confine themselves to investigating the defendant's criminal activity and did not do so in an 'essentially passive manner.'  Accordingly he submits that they are to be regarded, in the light of that authority, as having instigated the offence or incited it and so as having acted as agents provocateurs so as to render the proceedings as a whole unfair, there being no other significant evidence against the defendant."<p></p></ul>
<p>Lord Bingham rejected this argument at p 1080H stating:</p>
<p></p><ul>"While I for my part am willing to accept that, on a precise and literal reading of the court's language, Mr Beloff is entitled to make that submission, I am wholly unwilling to accept the far-reaching proposition which he bases on it.  It seems to me that that conclusion has to be understood in the context of the whole argument before the court on that occasion and on the special facts of that case.  It is true that in the present case the criminal activity alleged was much more minor.  It is also true that the facts are much simpler and that they simply cannot lend themselves to the construction that this defendant was in any way prevailed upon or overborne or persuaded or pressured or instigated or incited to commit the offence.  The question for the stipendiary magistrate was whether, on the facts which he found, the admission of this evidence had such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that he should exclude it, or whether (to put the test in a different way) the effect of admitting it was to deny the defendant a fair trial.  In my opinion the only possible answer to both questions was 'No.'"<p></p></ul>
<p>In my respectful opinion Lord Bingham was right to conclude that some of the wording of paragraph 38 was based on the special facts of that case and it is relevant to observe that in its judgments the court has often emphasised that it is concerned with the particular facts of the case before it:  see per Lord Bingham in <i>Brown v Stott</i> [2001]  2 WLR 817, 836C. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111. The particular facts which the court emphasises in paragraph 38 included the following:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;the police officers' intervention did not take place as part of an anti-drug-trafficking operation ordered and supervised by a judge;</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;the competent authorities had no good reason to suspect that Mr Teixeira de Castro was a drug-trafficker;  he had no criminal record and no preliminary investigation concerning him had been opened;</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;there was no evidence to suggest that Mr Teixeira de Castro was predisposed to commit offences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112. Therefore I am of opinion that the court did not intend to state as a general principle that there was a breach of article 6 of the Convention whenever police officers gave a person an opportunity to break the law and he took advantage of that opportunity in circumstances in which it appeared that he would have behaved in the same way if some other person had given him the opportunity to commit a similar crime.  In my opinion if a person freely takes advantage of an opportunity to break the law given to him by a police officer, the police officer is not to be regarded as inciting or instigating the crime in the context of the prohibition of entrapment.  The conduct of the police officer should not be viewed as constituting incitement or instigation where, as McHugh J states in <i>Ridgeway v The Queen</i> 184 CLR 19, 92, that conduct is "consistent with the ordinary temptations and stratagems that are likely to be encountered in the course of criminal activity", and I do not consider that the judgment of the court lays down a principle to the contrary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113. In the case of Looseley, as appears from his ruling, the judge considered that tape recordings which were played to him gave a degree of support to the contention of the prosecution that Looseley was an active and current drugs dealer.  The undercover police officer made contact with Looseley in the course of an undercover police operation concerning the supply of drugs in the Guildford area.  A senior police officer had authorised the operation and had overseen its progress.  The judge found that the undercover officer had presented himself to Looseley as an ideal customer for a drugs deal, but the judge also found specifically that he did not go beyond that portrayal and that he presented himself exactly as someone in the drugs world would expect to see a heroin addict.  There then arose a relationship between Looseley and the officer during which Looseley supplied him with heroin on more than one occasion.  The judge found that there was evidence to show that Looseley was steeped in the drug culture and encouraged the officer, whom he probably saw as a lucrative customer, to take more heroin from him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114. The judge's conclusion in the light of the facts before him was that, whilst the officer presented himself as an ideal customer so far as a drugs dealer was concerned, the officer did not do anything other than present himself as such, and accordingly the conduct of the officer did not constitute incitement.  In my opinion the judge's assessment, which he made in the course of a lucid and careful ruling, was one which he was fully entitled to make. </p>
