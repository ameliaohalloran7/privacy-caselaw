<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107.&nbsp;&nbsp;I respectfully agree.  Indeed if a security has Romer LJ's third characteristic I am inclined to think that it qualifies as a floating charge, and cannot be a fixed charge, whatever may be its other characteristics.  Suppose, for example, a case where an express assignment of a specific debt by way of security were accompanied by a provision that reserved to the assignor the right, terminable by written notice from the assignee, to collect the debt and to use the proceeds for its (the assignor's) business purposes, ie, a right, terminable on notice, for the assignor to withdraw the proceeds of the debt from the security.  This security would, in my opinion, be a floating security notwithstanding the express assignment.  The assigned debt would be specific and ascertained but its status as a security would not.  Unless and until the right of the assignor to collect and deal with the proceeds were terminated, the security would retain its floating characteristic.  Or suppose a case in which the charge were expressed to come into existence on the future occurrence of some event and then to be a fixed charge over whatever assets of a specified description the chargor might own at that time.  The contractual rights thereby granted would, in my opinion, be properly categorised as a floating security.  There can, in my opinion, be no difference in categorisation between the grant of a fixed charge expressed to come into existence on a future event in relation to a specified class of assets owned by the chargor at that time and the grant of a floating charge over the specified class of assets with cystallisation taking place on the occurrence of that event.  I endeavoured to make this point in <i>In re Cosslett (Contractors) Ltd</i> [2002] 1 AC 336, 357, para 63.  Nor, in principle, can there be any difference in categorisation between those grants and the grant of a charge over the specified assets expressed to be a fixed charge but where the chargor is permitted until the occurrence of the specified event to remove the charged assets from the security.  In all these cases, and in any other case in which the chargor remains free to remove the charged assets from the security, the charge should, in principle, be categorised as a floating charge.  The assets would have the circulating, ambulatory character distinctive of a floating charge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108.&nbsp;&nbsp;The debenture in the <i>New Bullas Trading </i>case [1994] 1 BCLC 485 had features which illustrate the ingenuity of equity draftsmen in seeking to produce for their clients fixed charges out of circumstances that would normally be associated with floating charges.  The debenture was expressed to grant the chargee a fixed charge over the company's present and future book debts.  The chargee was entitled to demand that the debts be assigned to it, but never in fact made any such demand.  The chargee was entitled to give the chargor instructions as to how the chargor should deal with its book debts, but apparently never in fact gave any such instructions, at any rate none prior to liquidation.  The debenture left the chargor free to collect the debts and required the chargor to pay into a specified bank account all money it received in payment of the debts.  The debenture then provided that on payment of the money into the bank account the fixed charge would be released and replaced by a floating charge over the money in the account.  The obvious intention of these provisions was that on the occurrence of a crystallisation event, eg liquidation, the uncollected book debts at that time would be subject to the fixed charge notwithstanding that if the debts had been paid prior to the crystallisation event the collected money would have been subject to only a floating charge.  The preferential creditors would then enjoy no priority over the debenture holder so far as the uncollected debts were concerned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nourse LJ could see no reason in law to prevent the parties from providing for a fixed charge on book debts while uncollected but a floating charge on the money collected.  He referred at p 492 to the question and answer posed by Lord Macnaghten in <i>Tailby v Official Receiver</i> 13 App Cas 523, 545 -</p>
<p></p><ul>"Between men of full age and competent understanding ought there to be any limit to the freedom of contract but that imposed by positive law or dictated by considerations of morality or public policy?  The limit proposed is purely arbitrary, and I think meaningless and unreasonable."<p></p></ul>
<p>These reservations, he thought, supported the view that it was open to contracting parties, if they wished to do so, to provide for a fixed charge on uncollected book debts but a floating charge on the money received in payment of those debts.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Millett expressed the Board's disagreement with Nourse LJ's reasoning and conclusion.  Essentially Lord Millett challenged the notion that the security rights granted over a book debt could be any greater than the rights, if any, granted over the money received in payment of the debts (see [2001] 2 AC 710, para 46).  If a book debt were to be charged as security but with an accompanying provision that any money received from the debtor in payment of the debt would belong to the chargor, the so-called 'charge', whether expressed to be a fixed charge or a floating charge, would not be a security at all.  It would not constitute a possible source for the repayment of the allegedly secured debt.  As Lord Millett said, it would be worthless.  If the accompanying provision were, instead, to say that any money received from the debtor would be subject to a floating charge, that provision would, in my opinion, necessarily describe and limit the nature of the charge over the receivable debt.  And if the charge were to be expressed to be a fixed charge as respects the receivable debt but a floating charge as respects the money received from the debtor there would be an internal contradiction in the formulation of the charge.  Since the essential value of a book debt as a security lies in the money that can be obtained from the debtor in payment it seems to me that Lord Millett was right in concluding that such a security should be categorised as a floating security and that <i>New Bullas </i>[1994] 1 BCLC 485 was wrongly decided.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, the essential characteristic of a floating charge, the characteristic that distinguishes it from a fixed charge, is that the asset subject to the charge is not finally appropriated as a security for the payment of the debt until the occurrence of some future event.  In the meantime the chargor is left free to use the charged asset and to remove it from the security.  On this point I am in respectful agreement with Lord Millett.  Moreover, recognition that this is the essential characteristic of a floating charge reflects the mischief that the statutory intervention to which I have referred was intended to meet and should ensure that preferential creditors continue to enjoy the priority that section 175 of the 1986 Act and its statutory predecessors intended them to have.  </p>
<i><p>Did the bank's debenture create a fixed charge or only a floating charge?</p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112.&nbsp;&nbsp;If, as I think, the hallmark of a floating charge and a characteristic inconsistent with a fixed charge is that the chargor is left free to use the assets subject to the charge and by doing so to withdraw them from the security, how should the charge over book debts granted by the bank's debenture be categorised?  The following features of the debenture and the arrangements regarding the bank account into which the collected debts had to be paid need to be taken into account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;The extent of the restrictions imposed by the debenture (para 81 above)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;The rights retained by Spectrum to deal with its debtors and collect the money owed by them (para 81 above)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;Spectrum's right to draw on its account with the bank into which the collected debts had to be paid, provided it kept within the overdraft limit (para 82 above)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;The description "fixed charge" attributed to the charge by the parties themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113.&nbsp;&nbsp;Restrictions on Spectrum's right to deal with its uncollected book debts go very little way, in my opinion, in supporting the characterisation of the charge as a fixed charge for the reasons I have given in criticising the <i>New Bullas </i>decision.  It is restrictions on the use that Spectrum could make of the payments made by its debtors that are important.  I have already cited the passage at p.158 from Slade J's judgment in <i>Siebe Gorman</i>[1979] 2 Lloyd's Rep 142, 158<i> </i>(para 105 above) and need not repeat it.  It makes the same point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the restrictions on Spectrum's right to deal with its uncollected book debts did not enable the bank to realise its security over those uncollected book debts.  The bank could not have sold the book debts without first taking some step or steps that would have given it the power to do so.  In effect a crystallisation event would, I think, have had to take place.  The value of the uncollected book debts as a security lay always in the money that could be obtained from the debtors in payment of those debts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115.&nbsp;&nbsp;The bank's debenture required all payments of book debts received by Spectrum to be paid into its account with the bank.  The money once received by the bank would become the bank's money and in return Spectrum's account would be credited with the amount that had been received.  Whether the account was for the time being in credit or in debit the result of each payment would be the accrual to Spectrum of the right to withdraw from the account a corresponding amount for its normal business purposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116.&nbsp;&nbsp;An attempt has been made to justify the categorisation of the charge as a fixed charge by looking no further than the receipt by the bank, through the operation of the clearing system, of the proceeds of the cheques from Spectrum's debtors that were paid in by Spectrum.  The consequent crediting of Spectrum's account with amounts equal to the proceeds of the cheques and Spectrum's ability to draw on that account for its business purposes is not inconsistent, it is suggested, with the categorisation of the charge over the book debts as a fixed charge.  This is the point being made by the Master of the Rolls in para 94 of his judgment (cited in para 93 above).  It was a point pressed before your Lordships by Mr Moss QC, counsel for the bank.  Your Lordships should not, in my opinion, accept this argument.  It seeks to perpetuate what I regard as the <i>New Bullas </i>heresy, namely, that the categorisation of a charge over book debts can ignore the rights of the chargor over the money received in payment of those debts.  The expression "floating charge" has never been a term of art but is an expression invented by equity lawyers and judges to describe the nature of a particular type of security arrangement between lenders and borrowers.  The categorisation depends upon the commercial nature and substance of the arrangement, not upon a formalistic analysis of how the bank clearing system works.  If part of the arrangement is that the chargor is free to collect the book debts but must pay the collected money into a specified bank account, the categorisation must depend, in my opinion, on what, if any, restrictions there are on the use the chargor can make of the credit to the account that reflects each payment in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117.&nbsp;&nbsp;The bank's debenture placed no restrictions on the use that Spectrum could make of the balance on the account available to be drawn by Spectrum.  Slade J in <i>Siebe Gorman </i>[1979] Lloyd's Rep 142, 158 thought it might make a difference whether the account were in credit or in debit.  I must respectfully disagree.  The critical question, in my opinion, is whether the chargor can draw on the account.  If the chargor's bank account were in debit and the chargor had no right to draw on it, the account would have become, and would remain until the drawing rights were restored, a blocked account.  The situation would be as it was in <i>In re Keenan Bros </i>Ltd [1986] BCLC 242. But so long as the chargor can draw on the account, and whether the account is in credit or debit, the money paid in is not being appropriated to the repayment of the debt owing to the debenture holder but is being made available for drawings on the account by the chargor. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118.&nbsp;&nbsp;Slade J said that the debenture in the <i>Siebe Gorman </i>case</p>
<p></p><ul>"… creat[ed] in equity a specific charge on the proceeds of [the book debts] as soon as they are received and consequently prevents the mortgagor from disposing of an unencumbered title to the subject matter of such charge without the mortgagee's consent, even before the mortgagee has taken steps to enforce its security". (p 159)<p></p></ul>
<p>But it is very difficult to see what feature of the arrangement between chargor and bank chargee in <i>Siebe Gorman </i>justified this conclusion.  The debenture was on all fours with the debenture in the present case.  There is nothing in the report of the case to suggest that the bank account into which the chargor had to pay the collected book debts was other than, as here, a normal bank current account on which the chargor could draw for its normal business purposes.  In considering the cited passage it seems to me worth noting that the issues that Slade J had to decide in the <i>Siebe Gorman </i>case did not include the question whether the charge over book debts was a fixed charge or a floating charge.  The main issue in the case was one of priority as between the bank chargee on the one hand and a subsequent assignee of the charged book debts on the other.  This issue turned on notice.  Did the subsequent assignee have notice of the bank's charge and the provision barring subsequent assignments?  If the subsequent assignee did have notice, the bank would have priority.  If not, the subsequent assignee would have priority.  The categorisation of the charge did not matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119.&nbsp;&nbsp;Slade J in <i>Siebe Gorman</i>, Nourse LJ in the <i>New Bullas </i>case, and Mr Moss QC in his submission on behalf of the bank in the present case, attributed considerable significance to the labels that the parties to the debenture had chosen to attribute to the charge over book debts.  Mr Moss indeed argued that a debenture expressed to grant a fixed charge thereby limited by necessary implication the ability of the chargor to deal with the charged assets.  He argued that Spectrum had no right without the consent of the bank to draw on the account into which the cheques received by Spectrum in payment of its book debts had to be paid.  This limitation was, he said, an inevitable result of the grant by the debenture of the fixed charge.  This argument, my Lords, puts the cart before the horse.  The nature of the charge depends on the rights of the chargor and chargee respectively over the assets subject to the charge.  The moneys in the bank account were assets subject to the charge.  If the account had been treated as a blocked account, so long as it remained overdrawn, it would be easy to infer from a combination of that treatment and the description of the charge as a fixed charge that Spectrum had no right to draw on the account until the debit on the account had been discharged.  But the account was never so treated.  The overdraft facility was there to be drawn on by Spectrum at will.  In the operation of the account there was never a suggestion that Spectrum needed to obtain the bank's consent before writing a cheque.  The bank could, by notice, have terminated the overdraft facility, required immediate repayment of the indebtedness and turned the account into a blocked account.  Pending such a notice, however, Spectrum was free to draw on the account.  Its right to do so was inconsistent with the charge being a fixed charge and the label placed on the charge by the debenture cannot, in my opinion, be prayed-in-aid to detract from that right.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120.&nbsp;&nbsp;The correct conclusion, in my opinion, is that the debenture, although expressed to grant the bank a fixed charge over Spectrum's book debts, in law granted only a floating charge.  I think the Vice-Chancellor, save for the precedent point, was correct in his reasoning and his conclusion.</p>
<i><p>Prospective overruling</p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Moss has submitted on behalf of the bank that if your Lordships should conclude that the<i> Siebe Gorman </i>debenture ought to have been held to have created a floating charge over the book debts your Lordships should so rule with prospective effect only.  I take this submission to mean that the overruling of <i>Siebe Gorman </i>would not affect any debenture granted before the date on which your Lordship's opinions were made public.  This submission raises two questions.  The first is whether your Lordships, having come to a conclusion on some issue of disputed law and ruled accordingly, have any power to postpone the coming into effect of that ruling.  The second question, if your Lordships do have that power, is whether this is a case in which it should be exercised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, I find the second question a very easy one.  I can see no good reason for postponing the effect of the overruling of <i>Siebe Gorman.  </i>If <i>Siebe Gorman </i>had been a decision of this House and therefore, subject to subsequent legislative intervention or to an overruling of the decision pursuant to the 1966 Practice Statement (Judicial Precedent) [1966] 1 WLR 1234, a decision that settled the law with finality, I think your Lordships would have need to hesitate long before overruling.  But the rulings of lower courts on points of law do not settle the law with finality.  They never have done.  It was natural that banks and other lenders taking security from corporate borrowers should have modelled their security on the debenture form that had achieved success in <i>Siebe Gorman</i>.  But they would not, or at least should not, have done so on the footing that Slade J's judgment had finally settled the law.  Mr Moss has submitted that the bank's lending decisions, whether to lend, how much to lend, how much interest to charge, and so on, were taken in the belief that the <i>Siebe Gorman </i>decision on fixed charges over book debts would stand, and that otherwise different decisions might have been taken.  My Lords, I am highly sceptical.  Banks are in business to receive and hold money for their customers and to lend on that money to others who want to borrow.  This is a highly competitive business.  The proposition, that the terms on which the bank would have allowed Spectrum a £250,000 overdraft facility would have been significantly different if it had known that its charge over Spectrum's present and future books would be no more than a floating charge, is one that, for me, carries no ring of conviction whatever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123.&nbsp;&nbsp;The question whether the House has power to postpone the coming into effect of a ruling on a point of law does not, therefore, strictly arise.  But your Lordships have had the advantage of detailed submissions on the point, not only from counsel for the bank and for the Crown creditors but also from Mr Ian Glick QC, who was appointed by the Attorney General, at their Lordships' request, to act as <i>amicus curiae </i>to assist your Lordships on this point.  In these circumstances I think I should express my view on the point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;124.&nbsp;&nbsp;The question whether judges in giving judgments make law or simply declare existing law is one that has been debated by generations of law students in universities and law schools across the globe.  It will continue to be so.  There is no single and absolute answer.  There is no doubt that it is one of the functions of judges in a common law country to try and develop the common law so that it serves the needs of the time.  To that extent at least it is not controversial to say that judges make new law and it may  be that in this area it would be open to the House to give a prospective ruling as to what the law would require of individuals in particular situations.  Your Lordships' opinions in <i>Royal Bank of Scotland v Etridge (No 2)</i> [2002]  2 AC 773 may be regarded as an example.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125.&nbsp;&nbsp;But where the issue is as to the meaning of and effect that should be given to a statutory provision on which the rights of the litigating individuals turn, different considerations come into play.  It may be a function of judges incrementally to develop the common law, but it is a duty of judges faithfully to interpret and apply the statutory law.  This duty applies as much to the "always speaking" statute as to other statutes.  The notion that a judge could decide what a statute meant and required and then announce that the effect of the ruling would be postponed for some period or other seems to me inconsistent with that duty.  It is for Parliament, not judges, to decide when statutes are to come into effect.  It is for judges to interpret and apply the statutes.  Where interpretation and application of a statute is the issue, a prospective ruling would absent legislative authority (eg the provisions in the 1998 devolution legislation: see para 17 of the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead), appear to constitute an improper usurpation by the judiciary of the role of the legislature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;126.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Nicholls has reviewed in depth the jurisprudential pros and cons of a prospective overruling and has concluded that, even where interpretation and application of a statute is the issue, the door should be kept open for the possibility of such a ruling in an exceptional case (see para 39 of his opinion). I would respectfully agree with his comment about the wisdom of a "never say never" approach but find myself unable to visualise circumstances in which it would be proper for a court, having reached a conclusion as to the correct meaning of a statute, to decline to apply to the case in hand the statute thus construed. Section 1 of the Bill of Rights 1688 declared that</p>
<p></p><ul>"… the pretended power of suspending of laws or the execution of laws by regall authority without consent of Parliament is illegall."<p></p></ul>
<p>It is probably right that the exercise of judicial authority is not caught by the reference to "regall authority" in the Bill of Rights but your Lordships in this House exercise an appellate jurisdiction deriving from the Queen in Council and if the promoters of the Bill of Rights in 1688 had been asked whether there was a power in the House of Lords to suspend laws without the consent of Parliament I do not think it is difficult to guess what their answer would have been.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;127.&nbsp;&nbsp;The present case requires a decision as to whether the bank's charge over Spectrum's book debts was a fixed charge or a floating charge.  The decision is necessary because statute has given statutory priority to preferential creditors over debenture holders so far as payment of debts out of assets subject to a floating charge is concerned.  If your Lordships decide the charge was a floating charge, it is not, in my opinion, open to your Lordships to deprive the preferential creditors of the rights given to them by statute.  To do so would be to suspend a law that Parliament has enacted and would, in my opinion, be contrary to the spirit and, perhaps, the letter of the Bill of Rights.</p>
<i><p>Conclusion</p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;128.&nbsp;&nbsp;For all these reasons, and for the reasons given by my noble and learned friend, Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe, with which I agree, I would allow this appeal and restore paragraphs 1 and 2 of the order of the Vice-Chancellor.  The bank must pay the costs here and below.</p>
<p><b>LORD WALKER OF GESTINGTHORPE</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;129.&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that this appeal should be allowed, and that the normal effect of allowing the appeal should not be limited in any way.  I gratefully adopt the summary of the facts in the opinion of my noble and learned friend, Lord Scott of Foscote.  I agree with his opinion on the substantive issue, and also with that of my noble and learned friend, Lord Hope of Craighead.  But because of the general interest and importance of this appeal I wish to state my opinion in my own words.</p>
<i><p><i>The history of the floating charge</i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;130.&nbsp;&nbsp;The origins and early history of the floating charge have been clearly explained in a lengthy passage in the opinion of the Privy Council, delivered by Lord Millett, in <i>Agnew v Commissioner of Inland Revenue</i> [2001]  2 AC 710, 717-721, paras 5-15.   This passage shows how the development of the floating charge was enthusiastically encouraged by some of the great Chancery judges of the late 19th century, who were robust defenders of freedom of contract.  But after the floating charge had, with great rapidity, grown to maturity, there was something of a reappraisal.  The floating charge had become a cuckoo in the nest of corporate insolvency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;131.&nbsp;&nbsp;Two quotations from speeches of Lord Macnaghten, eight years apart, serve to illustrate this.  In <i>Tailby v Official Receiver</i> (1888)  13 App Cas 523, 545, he said,</p>
<p></p><ul>"It was admitted by the learned counsel for the respondent, that a trader may assign his future book debts in a specified business.  Why should the line be drawn there?  Between men of full age and competent understanding ought there to be any limit to the freedom of contract but that imposed by positive law or dictated by considerations of morality or public policy?"<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in <i>Salomon v Salomon &amp; Co Ltd</i> [1897]  AC 22, 53, he said,</p>
<p></p><ul>"For such a catastrophe as has occurred in this case some would blame the law that allows the creation of a floating charge.  But a floating charge is too convenient a form of security to be lightly abolished.  I have long thought, and I believe some of your Lordships also think, that the ordinary trade creditors of a trading company ought to have a preferential claim on the assets in liquidation in respect of debts incurred within a certain limited time before the winding-up.  But that is not the law at present.  Everybody knows that when there is a winding-up debenture-holders generally step in and sweep off everything; and a great scandal it is."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;132.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Salomon v Salomon &amp; Co Ltd</i> was decided by this House on 16 November 1896.  With remarkable promptness Parliament responded by enacting sections 2 and 3 of the Preferential Payments in Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1897 ("the 1897 Act"), applicable in winding-up and receivership respectively.  These provisions did not give preference to the trade creditors whom Lord Macnaghten had in mind, but the mischief aimed at was the "scandal" to which Lord Macnaghten had referred.  The widespread use of floating charges over trading stock, book debts and other circulating capital produced a situation in which a company's business might appear to be thriving and prosperous, with goods on its shelves and customers at its doors, until a sudden and unexpected crystallisation of a floating charge revealed that nothing at all was left for the company's unsecured creditors, even if they were preferential creditors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;133.&nbsp;&nbsp;The perceived mischief was therefore akin to that underlying the doctrine of reputed ownership in bankruptcy, that creditors should not be misled by appearances.  The requirement for registration of floating charges, first introduced in 1900, had the same aim, and was comparable to the requirement for registration of bills of sale.  In the United States of America the courts took the same line of thought a good deal further, and rejected floating charges as fraudulent in character: <i>Wallace Benedict, Receiver v Ratner</i> (1925)  268 US 353. </p>
