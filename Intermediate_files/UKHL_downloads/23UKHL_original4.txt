<p class="para">77.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of this discussion, it follows that (a) the admission of title in the Defence and (b) the offer in the Letter were both capable of amounting to acknowledgments for the purpose of section 29. However, (a) the Defence was served more than twelve years before the instant proceedings were brought, and (b) the Letter was part of “without prejudice” correspondence. Hence, Mrs Ofulue’s arguments that (a) the admission in the Defence operated as a continuing acknowledgment, and (b) the Letter can be relied on despite it having been sent “without prejudice". I turn to those two arguments. </p>
<i><p class="para">The admission of title in the Defence as a continuing acknowledgment</p></i>
<p class="para">78.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Richard Wilson QC, on behalf of Mrs Ofulue, contended that the admission in the Defence constituted an effective acknowledgment which prevented time running for the period up to the time the proceedings in which it was served were dismissed. The principal basis for this contention was that, by maintaining her case in the Defence from the date it was served until the first proceedings were dismissed in 2002, Ms Bossert was affirming her acknowledgment of the Ofulues’ title to the property for the purpose of section 29(2).</p>
<p class="para">79.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see no reason why a statement in a pleading or statement of case, or in any other court document, cannot amount to an acknowledgment for the purposes of section 29. Accordingly, the admission in the Defence in this case, as I see it, operated as such as an acknowledgment of the Ofulues’ title as at 18 July 1990, the date on which it was served. Indeed, although the point was in issue below, the contrary was not argued by Mr Peter Crampin QC, for Ms Bossert. </p>
<p class="para">80.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in my opinion, the argument that the admission continued to operate as such an acknowledgment beyond 18 July 1990 was rightly rejected by the Court of Appeal. It is inconsistent both with the language of the relevant provisions, and with the policy, of the 1980 Act. Conceptually and as a matter of language, I accept that an “acknowledgment” could cover a continuing state of affairs. However, particularly where it has to be embodied in a signed document, the more natural meaning of the word would suggest that it arises as at the date of the document - most naturally the date on which the document is provided to the person to whom the acknowledgment is made. The requirement in section 30(1) that an acknowledgment must be in writing and signed was no doubt intended to minimise the room for argument as to whether and when it was made. </p>
<p class="para">81.&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of section 15 of the 1980 Act is that a formal record, such as a conveyance or entry on the register, which appears to establish the paper title owner’s title against the world, cannot be relied on after twelve years of adverse possession have passed. In those circumstances, it would seem very odd if an informal written acknowledgment could be relied on under section 29 of the same Act, where the adverse possession has thereafter continued for a longer period. If Mr Wilson’s argument were correct, an offer to purchase, which remained open for acceptance, because it was not time-limited and not rejected, would presumably continue to operate as an acknowledgment for a potentially indefinite period. That appears surprising, inconvenient, and inconsistent with the purpose of the 1980 Act. Further, it seems clear that an act which could be said to refer to the future, namely a payment of rent in advance, will only stop time running up to the date it actually occurs - see para 5(2) of Schedule 1 to the 1980 Act.</p>
<p class="para">82.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only authority cited in support of the proposition that the Defence operated as a continuing acknowledgment was an Irish case, <i>Johnston v Smith </i>[1896]  2 IR 82. On analysis, it seems to me that that case does not assist at all. It is true that O'Brien J (in his rather intemperate judgment) decided that an originating notice of motion issued in 1881 operated as an acknowledgment for limitation purposes in 1883. However, that decision was based on the fact that it was in 1883 that the notice was amended by the court and “used” by the person claiming adverse possession ([1896] 2 IR 82, 90), and not on the notion that, so long as the proceedings in question were on foot, an admission of title in the notice operated as a continuing acknowledgment. Further, Holmes and Gibson JJ (who concurred in the result for other reasons given by O'Brien J) expressly left the point open (see [1896] 2 IR 82, 91 and 92 respectively). Particularly as O'Brien J said that he “had some difficulty” with the point ([1896] 2 IR, 82, 90), and did not appear to think that the notice operated as some sort of continuing acknowledgment, it seems to me that, if anything, the decision is positively unhelpful to Mrs Ofulue’s case.</p>
<p class="para">83.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Wilson had an alternative argument, namely that the Defence was relied on by Ms Bossert in 2002, at the hearing of the Ofulues’ application to lift the automatic stay on the earlier proceedings. That argument, which was quite rightly advanced briefly, has no merit. It seems to me that, before an acknowledgment in a Defence, or other statement of case, could be treated as renewed for the purposes of section 29, it would normally be necessary for the defendant, or other relevant party, to write and sign something which affirmed or repeated the acknowledgment. This would usually involve an act such as amending and re-serving the Defence, or other statement of case, or confirming its contents in a signed affidavit or witness statement. </p>
<p class="para">84.&nbsp;&nbsp;While it would be wrong to attempt to set out an exhaustive test as to what can or cannot constitute a sufficient affirmation of a previous acknowledgement in a Defence to amount to a fresh acknowledgment, it appears to me that it would, at least normally, require a fresh written and signed document (including an amended Defence) or, quite possibly, an act such as re-service of the original Defence. On any view, merely taking steps in the action, even though it can be said that such steps affirm the defendant’s reliance on the contents of her Defence, will not do for the purposes of section 29, particularly as section 30 requires any acknowledgment to be in writing and signed Many, indeed most, steps taken by a defendant in an action can be said to be taken pursuant to her Defence; yet they often will not be in writing, let alone signed, and even those that are will not normally amount to acknowledgments for the purposes of section 29. On any view, opposing the lifting of the stay and seeking a consequent dismissal of the claim cannot conceivably operate as a written affirmation of any acknowledgment in the Defence.</p>
<i><p class="para">The without prejudice rule</p></i>
<p class="para">85.&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to defeat the claim for adverse possession, therefore, Mrs Ofulue needs to establish that she is entitled to rely on the offer in the Letter, notwithstanding that it was written expressly “without prejudice", with a view to settling the earlier proceedings. The normal rule is, of course, that statements made in negotiations entered into between parties to litigation with a view to settling that litigation are inadmissible and therefore cannot be given in evidence. In <i>Rush &amp; Tompkins Ltd v Greater London Council </i>[1989] AC 1280, 1299, Lord Griffiths explained that the rule was “founded upon the public policy of encouraging litigants to settle their differences rather than litigate them to a finish". As stated by Robert Walker LJ in <i>Unilever plc v The Procter &amp; Gamble Co </i>[2000] 1 WLR 2436, 2442C-D, the rule also rests on “the express or implied agreement of the parties themselves that communications in the course of their negotiations should not be admissible in evidence".</p>
<p class="para">86.&nbsp;&nbsp;As Robert Walker LJ went on to point out at [2001] 1 WLR 2436, 2444C, “there are numerous occasions on which … the without prejudice rule does not prevent the admission into evidence of what one or both of the parties said or wrote". At [2001] 1 WLR 2436, 2444D-2445G, he then set out and explained eight of “the most important instances". Apart from agreement (e.g. where the negotiations are “without prejudice, save as to costs”), the principal occasions he identified were where the negotiations are said to have resulted in a contract, an estoppel, or a misrepresentation, or where they are said to include an impropriety or an explanation for delay. It is common ground that none of those instances is of direct assistance in this case. </p>
<p class="para">87.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, it is indisputable that the Letter was written with a view to settling the earlier proceedings, and that the Ofulues can have been in no doubt but that the without prejudice rule was intended to apply to it. Nor is there any question of Ms Bossert’s reliance on the rule amounting to some sort of abuse. Further, the fact that the rule is being invoked in relation to negotiations involving earlier proceedings involves no new extension of the rule: see both the facts and the reasoning in <i>Rush &amp; Tompkins </i>[1989] AC 1280, the observations in <i>Unilever </i>[2000] 1 WLR 2436, and the reasoning in <i>Muller v Linsley &amp; Mortimer </i>[1996] 1 PNLR 74. I have had the benefit of reading in draft the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Hope of Craighead, who considers this aspect more fully. In my view, it is strongly arguable that the principles which govern the admissibility in subsequent proceedings, of a statement made in without prejudice negotiations to settle earlier proceedings, should be the same as those which would govern its admissibility in the earlier proceedings. Indeed, I find it hard to see how the contrary could even be argued in a case such as this, where the two sets of proceedings involve the same parties and very closely connected issues, namely, in each case, whether the Bosserts had any interest in, or right to possession of, the property.</p>
<p class="para">88.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, it is said by Mr Wilson that the implied acceptance of the Ofulues’ title to the property contained in the offer to purchase in the last sentence of the Letter can be invoked as an acknowledgment under section 29, essentially for  four reasons. First, the admission of title did not go to any issue in the earlier proceedings: indeed, the Ofulues’ title was not merely undisputed; it was specifically admitted in the Defence. Secondly, the admission of title is sought to be invoked as a fact, rather than for the truth of its contents. Thirdly, an acknowledgment which satisfies the requirements of section 29 is an exception to the normal without prejudice rule. Fourthly, the Bosserts’ conduct entitles Mrs Ofulue to override the rule. The first three arguments overlap to some extent, but each of the four arguments is most conveniently considered separately.</p>
<p class="para">89.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before considering these arguments, it is worth quoting a passage from Robert Walker LJ’s invaluable judgment in <i>Unilever </i>[2000] 1 WLR 2436, which, in my opinion, makes a point which should always be borne in mind by any judge considering a contention that a statement made in without prejudice negotiations should be exempted from the rule. After considering a number of authorities, Robert Walker LJ said at pp 2448H-2449B that the cases which he had been considering:</p>
<p class="qt">“make clear that the without prejudice rule is founded partly in public policy and partly in the agreement of the parties. They show that the protection of admissions against interest is the most important practical effect of the rule. But to dissect out identifiable admissions and withhold protection from the rest of without prejudice communications (except for a special reason) would not only create huge practical difficulties but would be contrary to the underlying objective of giving protection to the parties … to speak freely about all issues in the litigation … . Parties cannot speak freely at a without prejudice meeting if they must constantly monitor every sentence, with lawyers … sitting at their shoulders as minders". </p>
<p class="para">This approach is entirely consistent with the approach of your Lordships’ House in <i>Rush &amp; Tompkins </i>[1989] AC 1280, and with that of the courts in the nineteenth century, mentioned by my noble and learned friend Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe in para 57of his opinion, which I have had the benefit of seeing in draft. </p>

<i><p class="para">The Ofulues’ title was not in issue in the earlier proceedings</p></i>
<p class="para">90.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that the Ofulues’ freehold title to the property was not directly in dispute in the earlier proceedings is not, in my judgment, a good ground for admitting the without prejudice offer to purchase into evidence. I reach that conclusion for two reasons; one is rather specific to this case, while the other is more general. The first reason is that the only sentence in the Letter on which the Ofulues seek to rely must, as I see it, be covered by the without prejudice rule on any view. That sentence, after all, is the one which contains the actual offer to settle the earlier proceedings. It appears to me that, even if an admission of title in the Letter could be admissible because it went to a point which was not in issue in the earlier proceedings, a sentence which implies or contains such an admission could not be admissible if that sentence contains the offer to settle those proceedings. After all, there can be nothing in a without prejudice letter or conversation which is more clearly within the scope of the rule than the actual sentence containing the offer to settle the proceedings in question. </p>
<p class="para">91.&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite apart from this, it appears to me that, save perhaps where it is wholly unconnected with the issues between the parties to the proceedings, a statement in without prejudice negotiations should not be admissible in evidence, other than in exceptional circumstances such as those mentioned in <i>Unilever </i>[2000] 1 WLR 2436, 2444D-2445G. It is not only that the offer contained in the relevant sentence of the Letter was connected with the issue between the parties in the earlier proceedings. It is also that the title to the property was in issue in the earlier proceedings in the sense that the Ofueles claimed the unencumbered freehold, whereas the Bosserts were contending that the freehold was subject to their legal or equitable interest. Bearing in mind the point made in the passage quoted above from Robert Walker LJ [2000] 1 WLR 2436, 2448-2449, it seems to me that it would set an unfortunate precedent if your Lordships held that an admission of the claimants’ title in a without prejudice letter was sufficiently remote from the issues in a possession action relating to the same land as to be outside the rule. </p>
<p class="para">92.&nbsp;&nbsp;I leave open the question of whether, and if so to what extent, a statement made in without prejudice negotiations would be admissible if it was “in no way connected” with the issues in the case the subject of the negotiations. That point was mentioned by Lord Griffiths in <i>Rush &amp; Tompkins </i>[1989] AC 1280, 1300, where he referred to <i>Waldridge v Kennison </i>(1794) 1 Esp 142, in which a without prejudice letter was admitted solely as evidence of the writer’s handwriting. That was a factor wholly extraneous to the contents of the letter, and Lord Griffiths described it as “an exceptional case [which] should not be allowed to whittle down the protection given to the parties to speak freely about all issues in the litigation both factual and legal when seeking compromise and, for the purpose of establishing a basis of compromise, admitting certain facts". </p>
<p class="para">93.&nbsp;&nbsp;I note also that in <i>obiter </i>observations, Lord Hope suggested in <i>Bradford &amp; Bingley plc v Rashid </i>[2006] UKHL 37, [2006] 1 WLR 2066, para 25, that “[a]n admission which was made in plain terms is admissible, if it falls outside the area of the offer to compromise". There is no reason to think that this amounts to a different approach from that adopted by Lord Griffiths in <i>Rush &amp; Tompkins </i>[1989] AC 1280 when discussing <i>Waldridge </i>(1794) 1 Esp 142. In any event, it is unnecessary to consider the precise ambit of “the area of the offer to compromise” on the facts of this case. Even if one gives the rule a relatively circumscribed effect, the offer in the Letter fell within “the area of . . . compromise", as I have explained. </p>
<i><p class="para">The offer is relied on as such, and not for the truth of what was said</p></i>
<p class="para">94.&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn to the argument that the offer in the Letter is admissible because it is being relied on to establish that an admission was made as a matter of fact, as opposed to the truth of the admission. In other words, it is said that the offer is admissible as evidence that the Bosserts acknowledged the Ofulues’ title to the property, although it would not be admissible as evidence of the fact that the Ofulues were the owners of the property. Some apparent support for this contention may be found in the judgment of Hoffmann LJ in <i>Muller </i>[1996] PNLR 74, 79C-D. Having stated that “the privilege operates as an exception to the general rule on admissions (which can itself be regarded as an exception to the rule against hearsay)", he then said that “the public policy aspect of the rule is not … concerned with the admissibility of statements which are relevant otherwise than as admissions, <i>i.e. </i>independently of the truth of the facts alleged to have been admitted".</p>
<p class="para">95.&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the very great respect I have for any view expressed by Lord Hoffmann, and the intellectual attraction of the distinction which he draws, I am inclined to think that it is a distinction which is too subtle to apply in practice; I consider that its application would often risk falling foul of the problem identified by Robert Walker LJ in the passage quoted above. In any event, the observation appears to be limited to the public policy reason for the rule, and says nothing about the contractual reason, which plainly applies here. Over and above this, even if the distinction is valid in principle, in any event, I do not consider that it would assist Mrs Ofulue in the present context: the distinction between an acknowledgment and an admission is not one which can be satisfactorily drawn, in my opinion, at least in the context of identifying exceptions to the without prejudice rule.</p>
<p class="para">96.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that in<i> Rashid </i>[2006] 1 WLR 2066, paras 16-18, Lord Hoffmann applied this distinction to an acknowledgment under section 29(5) of the 1980 Act, which for present purposes is in the same terms as section 29(2), and concluded that an acknowledgment which would satisfy section 29 was admissible, even if it was made in without prejudice correspondence.  But none of the other opinions in <i>Rashid </i>[2006] 1 WLR 2066 were based on this reasoning: the other four members of committee based their conclusion on the fact that the correspondence in which the acknowledgment was made was neither expressly nor impliedly without prejudice. However, Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe expressed doubt about Hoffmann LJ’s distinction at<i> </i>[2006] 1 WLR 2066, paras 41-42, and Lord Hope agreed with those doubts at para 35, as did Lord Mance at para 93. And at [2006] 1 WLR 2066, para 67, Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood said that, in contrast with <i>Muller </i>[1996] PNLR 74, “[i]n acknowledgment cases … the statements <i>are </i>sought to be adduced in evidence as admissions". Consequently, he concluded that<i> </i>the principle expressed by Hoffmann LJ did not apply to an acknowledgment for the purposes of section 29. </p>
<p class="para">97.&nbsp;&nbsp;I share Lord Walker’s difficulty, as expressed in <i>Rashid </i>[2006] 1 WLR 2066, para 42, as expanded in paras 51and 52 of his opinion in this case, in distinguishing between an admission and an acknowledgment. To invoke a statement in without prejudice negotiations as an acknowledgment seems to me to be as inconsistent with the protection afforded to such negotiations, and the policy behind it, as invoking such a statement as an admission of the truth of what is stated. As for <i>In re Daintrey; Ex p Holt </i>[1893] 2 QB 116, I also agree with Lord Walker’s analysis. Vaughan Williams J said at [1893] 2 QB 116, 120 that a person could not invoke the rule in relation to “a document which, from its character, may prejudice the person to whom it is addressed if he should reject the offer", a principle which plainly does not apply to the Letter.</p>
<p class="para">98.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since preparing this opinion, I have had the privilege of reading in draft the characteristically trenchant opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Scott of Foscote, in which he comes to a different conclusion. I entirely agree with my noble and learned friend, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, whose opinion I have had the benefit of reading in draft, that it is open to your Lordships to create further exceptions to the rule, and in particular the sort of admission identified by Lord Hoffmann in <i>Rashid </i>[2006] 1 WLR 2066, para 13 and by Lord Scott in this case. However, I also agree with him, and indeed with Lord Hope and Lord Walker, that it would be inappropriate to do so, for reasons of legal and practical certainty. To uphold such an exception in this case would run counter to the thrust of the approach of Lord Griffiths in <i>Rush &amp; Tompkins </i>[1989] AC 1280 and of Robert Walker LJ in <i>Unilever </i>[2000] 1 WLR 2436, and would severely risk hampering the freedom parties should feel when entering into settlement negotiations.</p>
<p class="para">99.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not consider that the nineteenth century cases Lord Scott cites in para 22 really bear on the issue your Lordships have to decide. They emphasise the need for the rule, so as to ensure that parties to negotiations feel free and uninhibited in their settlement discussions, and there is no reason to think that they embody a different approach to the nineteenth century cases cited by Lord Walker in para 57. The same is true of the more recent decision in <i>Cutts v Head </i>[1984] Ch 290, which was, of course, relied on in <i>Rush &amp; Tompkins  </i>[1989] AC 1280 and <i>Unilever</i>  [2000] 1 WLR 2436. As for the more modern cases cited in para 33 by Lord Scott, <i>McDowell v Hirschfield Lipson &amp; Rumney </i>[1992] 2 FLR 126 can be explained by the fact that privilege was waived, in <i>Norwich Union Life Insurance Society v Tony Waller Ltd </i>(1984) 270 EG 42 the “without prejudice” heading to the letter concerned was inappropriate so the rule did not apply, and <i>Hodgkinson &amp; Corby Ltd v Wards Mobility Services Ltd </i>[1997] FSR 178 involved the well established exception of estoppel, as explained in <i>Unilever </i>[2000] 1 WLR 2436, 2444E-F.</p>
<i><p class="para">Does public policy justify an acknowledgment overriding the rule?</p></i>
<p class="para">100.&nbsp;&nbsp;The third ground upon which it was contended that the offer in the Letter could be admitted was that the public policy embodied in section 29 effectively trumped the public policy of not admitting in evidence what was said in without prejudice negotiations. This argument derives some support from what Lord Hoffmann said towards the end of para 18 in <i>Rashid </i>[2006] 1 WLR 2066. It was argued that it also derived support from what Lord Hope said in that case at [2006]1 WLR 2066, paras 34-35, but, as<i> </i>I read those paragraphs, they were primarily directed to a case where, in without prejudice correspondence, statements were made by the defendant to induce the claimant not to issue proceedings, as a result of which the claimant desisted from issuing his claim; (this is also, I think, the effect of what Lord Mance meant at [2006] 1 WLR 2066, para 93). In agreement with Lord Hope, it seems to me that such statements could be relied on by the claimant in such a case as founding an estoppel - one of the exceptions identified in <i>Unilever </i>[2000] 1 WLR 2436, 2444E-F.</p>
<p class="para">101.&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from this, the argument that there is a special exception to the without prejudice rule for acknowledgments for the purpose of section 29 derives no support from any of the other opinions expressed in this House in <i>Rashid </i>[2006] 1 WLR 2066. For my part at any rate, I do not accept that the argument is justified. I do not consider that there is any significant  public policy element in the acknowledgment provisions of the 1980 Act, save in so far as it can be said that any statutory provision carries with it an element of public policy. As Lord Brown (with whom Lord Walker agreed - see [2006] 1 WLR 2066, para 43) said in <i>Rashid </i>[2006] 1 WLR 2066, para 75, “the policy underlying the without prejudice rule seems to me to outweigh the countervailing policy reason for lengthening the period” of limitation through a written acknowledgment. </p>
<p class="para">102.&nbsp;&nbsp;It may well be that the decision in In re <i>Daintrey; Ex p Holt </i>[1893] 2 QB 116 can be distinguished from the present case on this ground as well. An acknowledgment under section 29 operates only as between the parties to and by whom the acknowledgment is made (and their privies), whereas a person’s act of bankruptcy has an impact on all the creditors and potential creditors of that person. Although not mentioned in the judgment of Vaughan Williams J, it appears to me that there is therefore a pretty strong case for saying that the public interest in ensuring that an act of bankruptcy can be referred to and acted on as such, should outweigh the public interest in  the without prejudice rule being observed.</p>
<i><p class="para">The alleged misconduct </p></i>
<p class="para">103.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Wilson submitted that Mrs Ofulue was entitled to refer to the acknowledgment in the Letter because the justice of the case required it. I accept that the without prejudice rule cannot be invoked “as a cloak for perjury, blackmail or other ‘unambiguous impropriety’” (see <i>Unilever </i>[2000] 1 WLR 2436, 2444F). However, any reliance on that principle in this case is in my view misconceived.  There has been no impropriety on the part of Ms Bossert, either generally or in claiming the benefit of the rule.  Further, there is plainly no warrant for overriding the rule simply because many people might think that, in relying on the rule, Ms Bossert is taking an unattractive point, or that, by changing her stance in the two sets of proceedings, she has acted unattractively.</p>
