<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;53. Although the sum involved is very considerable, the point which divides the parties is (as it seems to me) a very narrow one.  Should the prices at which the council actually sold be compared with the prices at which it would have sold if selling in lawful pursuance of its powers under section 32?  If so, it has suffered no loss under this head.  Or should the prices at which the council actually sold be compared with the open market value of the properties with vacant possession at the time of sale?  If so, it has suffered the loss certified by the auditor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;54. Section 20(1) of the 1982 Act provides for the certification by the auditor of the amount of a loss or deficiency incurred or caused by the wilful misconduct of any person.  It is that amount which is due and recoverable for the benefit of the body which has suffered the loss or deficiency.  The underlying principle is one of compensation, to put the body which has suffered the loss or deficiency in the same position as it would have been in had the wilful misconduct which caused the loss or deficiency never occurred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;55. In this case the council was the freehold owner of a number of properties.  The wilful misconduct of Dame Shirley Porter and Mr Weeks caused the sale of some of those properties pursuant to an unlawful policy of designated sales.  Thus the council parted with those properties.  The council did not lose the full market value of the properties because it received discounted prices for them.  But it lost the difference between the full market value of the properties and the discounted prices received.  Had the council wished to replace the properties sold under the unlawful policy it would have had to pay the full market value of comparable properties.  I do not think it is open to those responsible for an unlawful sales policy to contend that if the properties had been sold under a lawful policy they would have been sold at equally discounted prices since, if the policy of the council had been lawful the council might never have sold the properties at all, and it is in any event a matter for the owner of an asset to decide whether he will exploit its value to the maximum extent or not.  A wrongdoer is not entitled to reap the benefit of a benign policy which might, but only might, have been pursued by the owner had it not been unlawfully deprived of the asset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;56. I do not for my part detect any element of double counting in the auditor's calculation, which is in my opinion correct.</p>
<i><p>Impartiality, fairness and delay</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;57. Before the Divisional Court and in the Court of Appeal Dame Shirley Porter and Mr Weeks challenged the impartiality of the auditor, the fairness of his investigation and the time taken to carry out the audit.  This challenge was very fully considered by the Divisional Court, but failed both in that court and in the Court of Appeal.  The challenge has been further pursued before the House.  It must in my opinion be rejected for the detailed reasons given by my noble and learned friend Lord Hope of Craighead.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;58. For all these reasons I would allow the auditor's appeal and restore his certificate in the sum upheld by the Divisional Court.  The parties (and Westminster City Council, if so advised) are invited to make written submissions on costs.  I would in conclusion pay tribute to the clear and comprehensive judgment of the Divisional Court. </p>
<p><b>LORD STEYN</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;59. I am in complete agreement with the opinion of Lord Bingham of Cornhill.  I am also in complete agreement with the reasons given by my noble and learned friend Lord Hope of Craighead in regard to the issues of impartiality, fairness and delay.  I would therefore also allow the auditor's appeal and restore the certificate in the sum upheld by the Divisional Court.</p>
<p><b>LORD HOPE OF CRAIGHEAD</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60. I have had the advantage of reading in draft the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill.  I agree with all that he has said on the issue of liability and, subject to some observations of my own, with what he has said on the issue of quantum.  I wish to concentrate in this speech with the remaining issues in the case, which are those of impartiality, fairness and delay.</p>
<i></i><p><i><i>Introduction </i></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;61. In the Court of Appeal four matters were identified under the broad heading of unfairness: [2000] 2 WLR 1420, per Schiemann LJ, at p 1453H.  These were (a) apparent bias on the part of the auditor, (b) unreasonable delay on the part both of the auditor and on the part of the Divisional Court in confirming the decision by the auditor, (c) failure on the part of the Divisional Court to hold a fair balance between the auditor and Dame Shirley Porter and (d) breach by the Divisional Court of the presumption of innocence.  The Court of Appeal was not persuaded that there had been any unfairness which would justify allowing the appeal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;62. Before your Lordships the respondents have contended that the Court of Appeal should have upheld their appeals on the ground that the proceedings were unfair, applying common law principles as understood before the coming into force of the relevant provisions of the Human Rights Act 1998.  They also contend that the auditor violated their Convention rights and that, as victims, they are entitled to rely directly on those rights under the 1998 Act.  In addition they contend that the Divisional Court violated their Convention rights, that these are legal proceedings brought by the auditor and they are entitled to rely on that violation in these proceedings under the Act.  The main thrust of their contentions on the issue of unfairness was directed to their arguments that the auditor lacked the Convention requirements of independence and impartiality, that he gave the appearance of bias contrary to the requirements of the common law and that there was unreasonable delay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;63. Before dealing with the substance of the points raised by these arguments I must first outline the statutory background and set out the facts.  I shall then deal with a preliminary question which must be addressed.  This is whether it is open to the respondents to rely directly on the provisions of the Human Rights Act 1998 in this appeal.  I shall explain why, notwithstanding the decision of this House in <i>R v Kansal</i> <i>(No 2) </i>[2001]  UKHL 62, I consider it appropriate to deal with the merits of the points which have been raised on the assumption that they can do so.  As to the merits, I shall deal first with the questions relating to independence and impartiality and to the appearance of bias on the part of the auditor.  I shall then deal with the issue of delay.  Finally I shall deal with the points which have been raised about the conduct of the hearing by the Divisional Court.</p>
<i><p><i>The statutory background </i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;64. Provision has been made for many years in local government legislation to protect ratepayers against losses caused by unlawful expenditure or wilful misconduct on the part of members or senior officers of local authorities.  Procedures were laid down for the audit of local authority accounts and, in the event of unlawful expenditure or wilful misconduct by of a member or senior officer, for the surcharge of that member or officer on a certificate given by the auditor.  The provisions which were in force during the period to which this case relates were those in Part III of the Local Government Finance Act 1982.  These provisions were repealed by and re-enacted in the Audit Commission Act 1998, but I shall concentrate on those which are to be found in the 1982 Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;65. Prior to the coming into force of the 1982 Act local authorities and other bodies subject to audit were able to choose whether their accounts should be audited by a district auditor appointed by the Secretary of State or by a private auditor.  The Layfield Committee of Inquiry into Local Government Finance considered that it was wrong in principle that any public body should be able to choose its own auditor.  It recommended that the audit service should be made completely independent of both central government and local authorities, with a head of local audit reporting to a specially constituted higher institution (Cmnd 6453, 1976, Ch 6, paras 18, 30-31).  Section 11 of the 1982 Act provided for the establishment of a body to be known as the Audit Commission for Local Authorities in England and Wales.  Section 12 provided that local authority accounts were in future to be subject to audit by an auditor or auditors appointed by the Commission.  Section 13 provided that an auditor appointed by the Commission to audit the accounts might be an officer of the Commission, an individual with prescribed qualifications who was not such an officer or a firm of such individuals.  Section 14 provided that the Commission was to prepare and keep under review a code of audit practice prescribing the way in which auditors were to carry out their functions under the Act.  It was to be laid before Parliament and approved by a resolution of each House.  Section 15 sets out the general duties of auditors when auditing accounts in accordance with Part III of the Act.  Among these, in terms of subsection (3), is the auditor's duty to consider whether in the public interest he should make a report on any matter coming to his notice in the course of the audit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66. That, in brief, was the system under which Mr John Magill was appointed by the Commission under sections 12 and 13 of the 1982 Act.  His task was to audit the Council's accounts for the years 1987-88 to 1994-95. The Code of Audit Practice for Local Authorities and the National Health Service in England and Wales 1990 stated in paragraph 10 that, in order that his opinions, conclusions, judgments and recommendations would be and would be seen to be impartial, he was to maintain an independent and objective attitude of mind and ensure that his independence was not impaired in any way.  Paragraph 15 of the Code stated that the audit was to be carried out in a professional and timely fashion.  His duties and powers in respect of hearing objections by local government electors and in regard to loss due to wilful misconduct were those set out in sections 17, 19 and 20 of the Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;67. Section 17(1) of the 1982 Act deals with the right of members of the public to inspect the accounts to be audited and all books and other documents relating to them, and subsection (2) of the section provides that at the request of any local government elector the auditor shall give the elector, or any representative of his, an opportunity to question him about the accounts.  Sections 17(3) and 17(4) provide:</p>
<p></p><ul>"(3) Subject to subsection (4) below, any local government elector . . ., or any representative of his, may attend before the auditor and make objections -<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a) as to any matter in respect of which the auditor could take action under section 19 or 20 below; or<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b) as to any other matter in respect of which the auditor could make a report under section 15(3) above.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(4) No objection may be made under subsection (3) above by or on behalf of a local government elector unless the auditor has previously received written notice of the proposed objection and of the grounds on which it is to be made."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;68. Section 19(1) of the Act provides that, where it appears to the auditor that any item of account is contrary to law, he may apply to the court for a declaration that the item of account was unlawful except where it is sanctioned by the Secretary of State.  Where the court is persuaded that it should make the declaration, it has power under section 19(2) to order any person responsible for incurring or authorising the unlawful expenditure to repay it in whole or in part to the body in question, if the expenditure exceeded £2,000 to order the person responsible who was a member of a local authority to be disqualified from being a member of a local authority and to order rectification of the accounts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;69. Section 20(1) of the 1982 Act provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Where it appears to the auditor carrying out the audit of any accounts under this Part of this Act -<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a) that any person has failed to bring into account any sum which should have been so included and that the failure has not been sanctioned by the Secretary of State; or<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b) that a loss has been incurred or deficiency caused by the wilful misconduct of any person,<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>he shall certify that the sum or, as the case may be, the amount of the loss or the deficiency is due from that person and, subject to subsections (3) and (5) below, both he and the body in question (or, in the case of a parish meeting, the chairman of the meeting) may recover that sum or amount for the benefit of that body; and if the auditor certifies under this section that any sum or amount is due from two or more persons, they shall be jointly and severally liable for that sum or amount."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70. Section 20(2)(b) of the 1982 Act provides that a person who is aggrieved by a decision of an auditor to certify under that section that a sum or amount is due from him may require the auditor to state in writing the reasons for his decision.  Section 20(3) provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Any such person who is aggrieved by such a decision may appeal against the decision to the court and - <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a) in the case of a decision to certify that any sum or amount is due from any person, the court may confirm, vary or quash the decision and give any certificate which the auditor could have given;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b) in the case of a decision not to certify that any sum or amount is due from any person, the court may confirm the decision or quash it and give any certificate which the auditor could have given;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>and any certificate given under this subsection shall be treated for the purposes of subsection (1) above and the following provisions of this section as if it had been given by the auditor under subsection (1) above."<p></p></ul>
<p>Section 20 (4) provides for the disqualification of a member of a local authority if a certificate relates to a loss or deficiency caused by his wilful misconduct and the amount due from him exceeds £2,000.</p>
<i><p><i>The facts in outline </i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;71. This narrative begins where that set out in paragraphs 4 to 18 of Lord Bingham's speech breaks off.  Like him, I have taken much of it from the agreed statement of facts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72. By letters dated 18 and 20 July 1989 Councillor Neale Coleman, an opposition member of the housing committee, and a number of other local government electors made objections to the auditor under section 17(3) of the 1982 Act and invited him to take action under sections 19 and 20 of the Act and to make a report in the public interest under section 15(3).  28 individuals were named or referred to in the objections as persons against whom the objectors invited the auditor to take action.  They included the respondents Dame Shirley Porter and Mr Weeks.  By letter dated 8 November 1989 Councillor Coleman made further submissions in support of the original objection and added a further objection.  Following receipt of the objections the auditor embarked on an investigation, the main stages of which were as follows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73. In October 1989 the auditor requested a formal response from the Council to the initial objections.  The Council provided its formal response on 27 November 1989.  On 5 December 1989 he asked the Council if it wished to supplement that formal response to deal with the matters raised in the letter of 8 November.  On 1 May 1990 the Council provided its supplementary response to the auditor.  During the period from June to December 1990 he carried out a review of the documentation at City Hall and obtained preliminary legal advice on matters arising from the objection.  The documentation was extensive but it was incomplete, and he asked the Council to provide further documents.  In December 1990 he commenced his programme of interviews.  From January to April 1991 he visited council offices to inspect further documents made available by the Council, requested further documents and continued his programme of interviews.  He completed his initial round of interviews in November 1992.  He reviewed the evidence which he had received by that date, obtained further legal advice and in January 1993 began a second round of interviews which lasted from January to July 1993.  He found it necessary to conduct further interviews in September and October 1993.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74. On 29 September 1993, at the request of counsel and solicitors acting for Dame Shirley Porter the auditor issued a preliminary provisional indication of net expenditure and loss.  He invited representations by 15 October 1993.  Written submissions on this preliminary indication were made on 15 October 1993 on behalf of Dame Shirley Porter and on 27 October 1993 by Mr Weeks.  On 13 January 1994 the auditor gave notice of his provisional findings to ten individuals and provided copies of them to the objectors and to the Council.  He invited those concerned to indicate whether they wished him to hold an oral hearing.  He made a public statement on the same date which representatives of the media were invited to attend.  This statement attracted widespread publicity.  Recordings of the auditor reading parts of the statement appeared on television news, and the statement was referred to and discussed in Parliament and the media.  Three parties and the Council, but not Dame Shirley Porter or Mr Weeks, then requested the auditor to hold an oral hearing and the auditor agreed to do so.  All parties were informed on 25 March 1994 that there would be an oral hearing starting on 17 October 1994.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75. The public statement by the auditor raised questions about his impartiality.  Solicitors for Mr Phillips and Dame Shirley Porter applied to the Audit Commission on 29 March and 19 April 1994 to replace Mr Magill with a new auditor.  The Audit Commission refused to do so.  At a preliminary meeting on June 1994 applications were made on behalf of Dame Shirley Porter and Mr Phillips that the auditor should disqualify himself from further consideration of the objections.  On 7 October 1994 the auditor held a meeting to consider oral submissions on this matter.  Written representations in support of the application were made on behalf of, among others, Mr Weeks.  Further oral submissions were made on behalf of Dame Shirley Porter on 17 October 1994.  The auditor decided that he should not disqualify himself.  He gave his reasons in writing on 18 October 1994.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76. The auditor held an audit hearing which sat for a total of 32 days between 19 October 1994 and 7 February 1995.  He received further representations and evidence after the hearing.  On 17 August 1995 he circulated a revised provisional calculation of net expenditure and loss.  He invited representations on this calculation by 5 October 1995.  He received representations on it from the objectors.  The parties were informed by him that notification of the arrangements for the issuing of his decision would be given on 21 March 1996.  On 19 March 1996 the solicitors for Dame Shirley Porter wrote to the Audit Commission to request an investigation into the auditor's conduct.  On 16 April 1996 the Audit Commission rejected her complaint.  On 9 May 1996 the auditor issued his decision on the objections, in which he issued certificates in the sum of £31.677m against Dame Shirley Porter and Mr Weeks and four others.  They appealed to the Divisional Court.  The appeal by one of the other four was stayed on the ground of ill health.  The appeals by Dame Shirley Porter and Mr Weeks and the other three were heard between 1 October and 4 November 1997.  On 19 December 1997 the Divisional Court dismissed their appeals but allowed the appeals by the three others.  Their appeals to the Court of Appeal were heard between 22 and 26 March 1999.  On 30 April 1999 the Court of Appeal allowed the appeals by Dame Shirley Porter and Mr Weeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77. There are two key points in this history in regard to the respondent's argument about the fairness of the conduct of the proceedings by the auditor and the conduct of the Divisional Court when it dismissed their appeal.  The first relates to the auditor's public statement on 13 January 1994.  It is said that his conduct on this occasion gave rise to the appearance of bias on his part which could only be cured in the Divisional Court by quashing his certificate.  The second relates to delay.  The auditor issued his report and the certificate of surcharge on 9 May 1996.  The respondents say that this was 15 months after the conclusion of the audit hearing on 7 February 1995, almost seven years after the objection was made on 18 July 1989, nearly nine years after the decision of the housing committee of 8 July 1987 against which the objection was taken and exactly ten years after start of the events following the local government elections on 8 May 1986.  They contend that there had been such excessive delay that for the Divisional Court to quash the decision was the only appropriate remedy.</p>
<i><p><i></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Act 1998 </i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78. The respondents' argument on unfairness was presented on the assumption that they were entitled under section 22(4) of the Human Rights Act 1998 to rely in these proceedings on an alleged infringement of their Convention rights by acts of the auditor and of the Divisional Court, all of which took place before the relevant sections of that Act were brought into force on 2 October 2000.  It assumed that these are proceedings by or at the instance of Mr Magill as auditor, and that an auditor appointed by the Audit Commission under section 12 and 13 of the Local Government Finance Act 1982 was a public authority within the meaning of section 6(1) of the 1998 Act.  It also assumed that section 22(4), which states that section 7(1)(b) applies to proceedings by or at the instigation of a public authority whenever the act in question took place, applies to an appeal in these proceedings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79. Mr Howell did not challenge the proposition, which I would accept, that an auditor appointed by the Audit Commission to audit the accounts of a local authority is a public authority.  But he submitted that the proceedings which were conducted by the auditor and by the Divisional Court in the appeal to that court under section 20(3) of the 1982 Act were proceedings by or at the instigation of the objectors and not the auditor.  He also submitted, following observations which I made in <i>R v Lambert</i> [2001]  3 WLR 206, that the acts of the Divisional Court which were complained of were outside the scope of section 7(1)(b) of the 1998 Act as they were acts of a court.  I would reject both of these arguments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80. As to the first point, the function of the auditor under Part III of the 1982 Act is to audit the accounts which require to be audited.  It is his duty to satisfy himself by examination of the accounts and otherwise that the requirements of the statute have been complied with, that proper practices have been observed and proper arrangements have been made to obtain value for money in the use of resources: section 15(1).  He must also consider whether, in the public interest, he should make a report on any matter coming to his notice in the course of the audit in order that it may be considered by the body concerned or brought to the attention of the public: section 15(3).  He has power under sections 19 and 20 to declare an item of account unlawful and to recover a loss incurred or deficiency caused by wilful misconduct irrespective of whether there has been any objection to the accounts.  It is in that context that the right of any local government elector under section 17(3) to attend before the auditor and make objections as to any matter in respect of which he could take action under section 19 or 20, or as to any matter in respect of which he could make a report under section 15(3), must be seen.  The essence of these proceedings, from start to finish, is that they are proceedings by the auditor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81. As to the second point, it has now been held in <i>R v Kansal</i> <i>(No 2)</i> [2001]  UKHL 62 that section 7(1)(b) of the 1998 Act applies to acts of courts and tribunals in the same way as it applies to acts of other public authorities.  There has been no suggestion that the acts of the Divisional Court which are complained of are acts to which section 6(2) of that Act applies.  It has not been argued that, as the result of primary legislation, the court could not have acted differently or it was acting so as to give effect to primary legislation which could not be read or given effect in a way which was compatible with the respondents' Convention rights.  It follows that the acts of the Divisional Court which are under challenge are in the same position in this respect as the acts of the auditor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82. There remains however the question whether the benefit of retrospectivity under section 22(4) of the 1998 Act is available at the stage of an appeal.  The hearing of this appeal took place before judgment was delivered in <i>R v Kansal (No 2)</i>.  In that case it was held that section 22(4) does not apply to an appeal against a conviction which took place before 2 October 2000.  One of the points which I made in my dissenting judgment was that I did not see how it would be possible to confine the decision in that case to criminal cases only: see para 48 of my judgment.  But this point has yet to be decided in a civil appeal, and it is perhaps still open to argument.  As your Lordships did not hear any argument on it, I would prefer to approach the respondents' submissions as to fairness on the assumption that they are entitled to rely on their Convention rights in this appeal irrespective of the fact that all the acts in question took place before 2 October 2000.</p>
<i></i><p><i>Whether the proceedings are civil or criminal</i> </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83. On the assumption that they were entitled in this appeal to rely on their Convention rights, the respondents submitted that in substance the proceedings under section 20 of the 1982 Act were in the nature of a criminal charge.  This argument was considered and rejected by the auditor.  It was also rejected by the Divisional Court, which held that English law treats the matter as one of civil not criminal liability: (1997) 96 LGR 157, 171D.  Schiemann LJ did not mention the question of classification when he was dealing in the Court of Appeal with the issues of fairness [2000] 2 WLR 1420, 1453-1463.  But this question was addressed by Mr McMullen in the course of his argument in this House, and it is the subject of detailed submissions in his written case.  The Strasbourg cases were reviewed by Lord Bingham of Cornhill in <i>McIntosh v Lord Advocate</i> [2001]  3 WLR 107, 114-119, where the issue was whether a person against whom an application had been made for a confiscation order was, by virtue of that application, charged with a criminal offence: see also <i>Phillips v United Kingdom, </i>(2001) 11 BHRC 280.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84. For the purposes of the Convention the category into which the proceedings are placed by domestic law, while relevant, is not the only consideration.  The court is required to look at the substance of the matter rather than its form, to look behind the appearances and to investigate the realities of the procedure: <i>Deweer v Belgium</i> (1980)  2 EHRR 439, 458, para 44.  The nature of the offence and the nature and degree of severity of the sanction must be taken into account also.  As to the sanction, the question is whether, by reason of its nature and degree of severity, it amounts to a penalty in the sense of punishment: <i>Engel v Netherlands (No 1)</i> (1976)  1 EHRR 647, 678-679, paras 82, 83; <i>Lutz v Germany</i> (1987)  10 EHRR 182, 197, para 54; <i>Demicoli v Malta</i> (1991)  14 EHRR 47, 62-63, para 34.  For example, <i>Engel v Netherlands</i> concerned proceedings in a military court for disciplinary offences for which one of the sanctions liable to be imposed as punishment was deprivation of liberty.  In <i>Demicoli v Malta </i>too the applicant was at risk of imprisonment if the fine was not paid.  In <i>AP, MP and TP v Switzerland</i> (1997)  26 EHRR 541, 559 para 42, the court said that it attached great weight to the domestic court's finding that the fine in question was penal in character and depended on the "guilt" of the offending taxpayer.  In <i>DC, HS and AD v United Kingdom </i>[2000]  BCC 710 the European Court held that proceedings for the disqualification of directors on the ground of unfitness under section 6 of the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 were inherently regulatory in character, and that for this reason they could not be said to involve the determination of a criminal charge within the meaning of article 6(1) of the Convention.</p>
