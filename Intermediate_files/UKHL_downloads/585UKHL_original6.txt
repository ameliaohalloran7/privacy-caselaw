<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the passages which I have emphasised indicate, Sir James Wigram did not consider that he was laying down a new principle, but rather that he was explaining the true extent of the existing plea of <i>res judicata.  </i>Thus he was careful to limit what he was saying to cases which had proceeded to judgment, and not, as in the present case, to an out of court settlement.  Later decisions have doubted the correctness of treating the principle as an application of the doctrine of <i>res judicata, </i>while describing it as an extension of the doctrine or analogous to it.  In <i>Barrow v. Bankside Members Agency Ltd.</i> [1996]  1 W.L.R. 257, Sir Thomas Bingham M.R. explained that it is not based on the doctrine in a narrow sense, nor on the strict doctrines of issue or cause of action estoppel.  As May L.J. observed in <i>Manson v. Vooght</i> [1999]  B.P.I.R. 376 at p. 387, it is not concerned with cases where a court has decided the matter, but rather cases where the court has not decided the matter.  But these various defences are all designed to serve the same purpose: to bring finality to litigation and avoid the oppression of subjecting a defendant unnecessarily to successive actions.  While the exact relationship between the principle expounded by Sir James Wigram and the defences of <i>res judicata</i> and cause of action and issue estoppel<i> </i>may be obscure, I am inclined to regard it as primarily an ancillary and salutary principle necessary to protect the integrity of those defences and prevent them from being deliberately or inadvertently circumvented.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one respect, however, the principle goes  further than the strict doctrine of <i>res judicata </i>or the formulation adopted by Sir James Wigram V.-C., for I agree that it is capable of applying even where the first action concluded in a settlement.  Here it is necessary to protect the integrity of the settlement and to prevent the defendant from being misled into believing that he was achieving a complete settlement of the matter in dispute when an unsuspected part remained outstanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However this may be, the difference to which I have drawn attention is of critical importance.  It is one thing to refuse to allow a party to relitigate a question which has already been decided; it is quite another to deny him the opportunity of litigating for the first time a question which has not previously been adjudicated upon.  This latter (though not the former) is <i>prima facie </i>a denial of the citizen's right of access to the court conferred by the common law and guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (Rome, 4th. November 1950).  While, therefore, the doctrine of <i>res judicata </i>in all its branches may properly be regarded as a rule of substantive law, applicable in all save exceptional circumstances, the doctrine now under consideration can be no more than a procedural rule based on the need to protect the process of the Court from abuse and the defendant from oppression.  In <i>Brisbane City Council v. A.-G. for Queensland</i> [1979]  A.C. 411 at p. 425 Lord Wilberforce, giving the advice of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, explained that the true basis of the rule in <i>Henderson v</i> <i>Henderson</i> is abuse of process and observed that it</p>
<p></p><ul>". . . ought only to be applied when the facts are such as to amount to an abuse: otherwise there is a danger of a party being shut out from bringing forward a genuine subject of litigation."<p></p></ul>
<p>There is, therefore, only one question to be considered in the present case: whether it was oppressive or otherwise an abuse of the process of the court for Mr. Johnson to bring his own proceedings against the firm when he could have brought them as part of or at the same time as the Company's action.  This question must be determined as at the time when Mr. Johnson brought the present proceedings and in the light of everything that had then happened.  There is, of course, no doubt that Mr. Johnson <i>could</i> have brought his action as part of or at the same time as the Company's action.  But it does not at all follow that he <i>should </i>have done so or that his failure to do so renders the present action oppressive to the firm or an abuse of the process of the court.  As May L.J. observed in <i>Manson v Vooght</i> at p. 387, it may in a particular case be sensible to advance claims separately.  Insofar as the so-called rule in <i>Henderson v. Henderson</i> suggests that there is a presumption against the bringing of successive actions, I consider that it is a distortion of the true position.  The burden should always rest upon the defendant to establish that it is oppressive or an abuse of process for him to be subjected to the second action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rule in <i>Henderson v Henderson</i> cannot sensibly be extended to the case where the defendants are different.  There is then no question of double vexation.  It may be reasonable and sensible for a plaintiff to proceed against A first, if that is a relatively simple claim, in order to use the proceeds to finance a more complex claim against B.  On the other hand, it would I think normally be regarded as oppressive or an abuse of process for a plaintiff to pursue his claims against a single defendant separately in order to use the proceeds of the first action to finance the second, at least where the issues largely overlap so as to form, in Sir James Wigram's words, "the same subject of litigation".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Particular care, however, needs to be taken where the plaintiff in the second action is not the same as the plaintiff in the first, but his privy.  Such situations are many and various, and it would be unwise to lay down any general rule. The principle is, no doubt, capable in theory of applying to a privy; but it is likely in practice to be easier for him to rebut the charge that his proceedings are oppressive or constitute an abuse of process than it would be for the original plaintiff to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Johnson conceded that he and the Company are privies.  He was in a position to decide when to pursue the two claims and whether to pursue them together or separately, and that is enough for present purposes.  But Mr. Johnson and the Company are different legal persons, each with its own creditors, and that is a fact of critical significance.  Mr. Johnson's personal claims raised difficult issues not present in the Company's action: (i) did he retain the firm to act for him personally? (ii) should the firm have foreseen that failure to exercise the option properly would cause loss to Mr. Johnson personally as well as to the Company? (iii) which if any of his personal losses were recoverable (the issues in the cross-appeal)? (iv) quantum.  It was not in the Company's interest for his personal claims to be joined with its own much simpler claim, or for its case to be delayed until Mr. Johnson's own case was ready for trial.  Had the Company been in liquidation and its action brought by the liquidator, he would have been well advised to insist on separate trials and to object to any delay in the trial of the Company's action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these circumstances I am satisfied that Mr. Johnson, who was bound to have regard to the interests of the Company and its creditors, was entitled to defer the bringing of his own claims until after the Company's claim had been resolved.  Even if he had chosen to join the two claims in the same writ, it would have been both possible and appropriate for separate trials to be held of (i) liability (ii) quantum (Company) (iii) Mr. Johnson's title to sue and (iv) quantum (Mr. Johnson); and for (iii) and (iv) to be held over until after (i) and (ii) had been determined.  Even as things are, there is no real question of double vexation.  The firm was always liable to be sued by two different plaintiffs each with its own cause of action and its own heads of loss.  The only area of overlap is in relation to the standard of care which the firm observed.  Given that Mr. Johnson and the Company are privies, neither of them could re-open an adverse judgment on this, being bound by issue estoppel; while the parties could make their own arrangements in the event of a settlement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, I would reject the firm's contention that it was an abuse of process for Mr. Johnson to bring his action after the Company's claim had been resolved.  Even if this were not the case, however, I agree with the trial judge that it would be unconscionable for the firm to raise the issue after the way in which it handled the negotiations for the settlement of the Company's action.  I would not myself put it on the ground of estoppel by convention.  Like the Court of Appeal, I have some difficulty in discerning a common assumption in regard to a matter about which neither party thought at all.  This is not to say that estoppel has no part to play in this field.  I would regard it as operating in the opposite way.  Given that Mr. Johnson was entitled to defer the bringing of his own proceedings until after the Company's claims had been resolved, it would have been unconscionable for him to have stood by without disclosing his intentions and knowingly allowed the firm to settle the Company's action in the belief that it was dealing finally with all liability arising from its alleged negligence in the exercise of the option.  To bring his own claim in such circumstances would, in my opinion, amount to an abuse of the process of the Court.  But nothing like this took place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes it unnecessary to deal with Mr. Johnson's submission that it is too late for the firm to raise the issue.  If necessary, however, I should have regarded the delay as fatal.  Indeed, I should have regarded it as more than delay; I think it amounted to acquiescence.  There is no proper analogy with the case which discloses no cause of action.  Although it is obviously desirable to apply to strike out a claim which is doomed to fail at the earliest opportunity, there is no point in proceeding with a trial which serves no useful purpose.  Even if the point is taken at the trial itself, it is a matter for the trial judge to decide whether to hear the evidence and adjudicate on the facts before deciding whether they give rise to liability, or to assume that the plaintiff will establish his allegations and decide whether, as a matter of law, they give rise to liability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the premise in the present case is that Mr. Johnson has a good cause of action which he should have brought earlier if at all.  I do not consider that a defendant should be permitted to raise such an objection as late as this.  A defendant ought to know whether the proceedings against him are oppressive.  It is not a question which calls for nice judgment.  If he defends on the merits, this should be taken as acquiescence.  It might well be otherwise if the ground on which the proceedings are alleged to be an abuse of process were different.  But in a case of the present kind the Court is not so much protecting its own process as the interests of the defendant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, I would allow Mr. Johnson's appeal on the first question.</p>
<i></i><p><i><i>The firm's cross-appeal: recoverable heads of damage.</i></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its shareholders.  It has its own assets and liabilities and its own creditors.  The company's property belongs to the company and not to its shareholders.  If the company has a cause of action, this represents a legal chose in action which represents part of its assets.  Accordingly, where a company suffers loss as a result of an actionable wrong done to it, the cause of action is vested in the company and the company alone can sue.  No action lies at the suit of a shareholder suing as such, though exceptionally he may be permitted to bring a derivative action in right of the company and recover damages on its behalf: see <i>Prudential Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Newman Industries Ltd. (No. 2)</i> [1982]  Ch. 204 at p. 210.  Correspondingly, of course, a company's shares are the property of the shareholder and not of the company, and if he suffers loss as a result of an actionable wrong done to him, then prima facie he alone can sue and the company cannot.  On the other hand, although a share is an identifiable piece of property which belongs to the shareholder and has an ascertainable value, it also represents a proportionate part of the Company's net assets, and if these are depleted the diminution in its assets will be reflected in the diminution in the value of the shares.  The correspondence may not be exact, especially in the case of a company whose shares are publicly traded, since their value depends on market sentiment.  But in the case of a small private company like this company, the correspondence is exact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This causes no difficulty where the company has a cause of action and the shareholder has none; or where the shareholder has a cause of action and the company has none, as in <i>Lee v. Sheard </i>[1956]  1 Q.B. 192, <i>George Fischer (Great Britain) Ltd. v. Multi Construction Ltd.</i> [1995]  1 B.C.L.C. 260, and <i>Gerber Garment Technology Inc. v. Lectra Systems Ltd.</i> [1997]  R.P.C. 443.  Where the company suffers loss as a result of a wrong to the shareholder but has no cause of action in respect of its loss, the shareholder can sue and recover damages for his own loss, whether of a capital or income nature, measured by the diminution in the value of his shareholding.  He must, of course, show that he has an independent cause of action of his own and that he has suffered personal loss caused by the defendant's actionable wrong.  Since the company itself has no cause of action in respect of its loss, its assets are not depleted by the recovery of damages by the shareholder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position is, however, different where the company suffers loss caused by the breach of a duty owed both to the company and to the shareholder.  In such a case the shareholder's loss, insofar as this is measured by the diminution in value of his shareholding or the loss of dividends, merely reflects the loss suffered by the company in respect of which the company has its own cause of action.  If the shareholder is allowed to recover in respect of such loss, then either there will be double recovery at the expense of the defendant or the shareholder will recover at the expense of the company and its creditors and other shareholders.  Neither course can be permitted.  This is a matter of principle; there is no discretion involved.  Justice to the defendant requires the exclusion of one claim or the other; protection of the interests of the company's creditors requires that it is the company which is allowed to recover to the exclusion of the shareholder.  These principles have been established in a number of cases, though they have not always been faithfully observed.  The position was explained in a well-known passage in <i>Prudential v Newman</i> at p. 222:</p>
<p></p><ul>"But what [the shareholder] cannot do is to recover damages merely because the company in which he is interested has suffered damage  He cannot recover a sum equal to the diminution in the market value of his shares, or equal to the likely diminution in dividend, because such a loss is merely a reflection of the loss suffered by the company.  The shareholder does not suffer any personal loss.  His only loss is through the company, in the diminution of the value of the net assets of the company, in which he has (say) a 3 per cent. shareholding.  The plaintiff's shares are merely a right of participation in the company on the terms of the articles of association.  The shares themselves, his right of participation, are not directly affected by the wrongdoing.  The plaintiff still holds all the shares as his own absolutely unencumbered property.  The deceit practised upon the plaintiff does not affect the shares; it merely enables the defendant to rob the company.  A simple illustration will prove the logic of this approach.  Suppose that the sole asset of a company is a cash  box containing £100,000.  The company has an issued share capital of 100 shares, of which 99 are held by the plaintiff.  The plaintiff holds the key of the cash box.  The defendant by a fraudulent misrepresentation persuades the plaintiff to part with the key.  The defendant then robs the company of all its money.  The effect of the fraud and the subsequent robbery, assuming that the defendant successfully flees with his plunder, is (i) to denude the company of all its assets; and (ii) to reduce the sale value of the plaintiff's shares from a figure approaching £100,000 to nil.  There are two wrongs, the deceit practised on the plaintiff and the robbery of the company.  But the deceit on the plaintiff causes the plaintiff no loss which is separate and distinct from the loss to the company.  The deceit was merely a step in the robbery.  The plaintiff obviously cannot recover personally some £100,000 damages in addition to the £100,000 damages recoverable by the company."<p></p></ul>
<p>It is indeed obvious that (on the given facts, where no consequential losses are stated to have arisen) the defendant cannot be made liable for more than £100,000 in total.  It is equally obvious, however, that if the damages were recoverable by the shareholder instead of by the company, this would achieve the same extraction of the company's capital to the prejudice of the creditors of the company as the defendant's misappropriation had done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has sometimes been suggested (see, for example, <i>George Fisher v Multi Construction</i> at p. 266 g-i) that <i>Prudential v Newman</i> is authority only for the proposition that a shareholder cannot recover for the company's loss, and is confined to the case where the defendant is not in breach of any duty owed to the shareholder personally.  That is not correct.  The example of the safe-deposit box makes this clear.  It is the whole point of the somewhat strained business of the key.  The only reason for this is to demonstrate that the principle applies even where the loss is caused by a wrong actionable at the suit of the shareholder personally.</p>
<i></i><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prudential v Newman</i> was followed in <i>Stein v. Blake</i> [1998] 1 All. E.R. 724, where the facts bore some resemblance to the illustration in the earlier case.  The defendant was a 50% shareholder and the sole director of a group of companies ("the old companies").  The plaintiff, who was the other 50% shareholder, alleged that, in breach of fiduciary duty, the defendant had misappropriated the assets of the old companies by purchasing them at an undervalue and transferring them to other companies in his sole ownership.  The plaintiff, who could have brought a derivative action on behalf of the old companies, chose instead to bring a personal action, claiming that he had been deprived of the opportunity to sell his shares in the old companies at their proper value and had suffered personal loss.  The Court of Appeal set aside an earlier grant of leave to appeal from the Judge's order striking out the plaintiff's action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaintiff sought to distinguish <i>Prudential v Newman</i> by arguing that the defendant was in breach of a duty owed to him personally.  But, as I pointed out, that was not the problem.  The problem was that the only conduct relied upon as constituting a breach of that duty was the misappropriation of assets belonging to the old companies, so that the only loss suffered by the plaintiff consisted of the diminution in the value of his shareholding which reflected the depletion of the assets of the old companies.  The old companies had their own cause of action to recover their loss, and the plaintiff's own loss would be fully remedied by the restitution to the companies of the value of the misappropriated assets.  It was not alleged that the plaintiff had been induced or compelled to dispose of his shares in the companies; he still had them.  If he were allowed to recover for the diminution in their value, and the companies for the depletion of their assets, there would be double recovery.  Moreover, if the action were allowed to proceed and the plaintiff were to recover for the lost value of his shares, the defendant's ability to meet any judgment which the old companies or their liquidators might obtain against him would be impaired to the prejudice of their creditors.  The plaintiff would have obtained by a judgment of the court the very same extraction of value from the old companies at the expense of their creditors as the defendant was alleged to have obtained by fraud.  <i>Heron International Ltd. v. Lord Grade</i> [1983] B.C.L.C. 244 was a case on the other side of the line.  In the course of a contested take-over bid, the directors of the target company who owned a majority of the company's voting shares were alleged, in breach of their duties both to the company and to its shareholders, to have accepted proposals which would reduce the value of the company's assets and hence of its shares and induce the shareholders to accept the lower of two rival offers.  The Court of Appeal granted the shareholders injunctive relief.  It observed out that the decision of the directors, if implemented, would cause loss in two directions.  First, the company would suffer loss to the extent that the value of its assets would be depreciated.  That loss would be borne exclusively by the company.  It was not a loss in respect of which the shareholders could recover, even if the market value of their shares fell in consequence.  The other loss would be to the pockets of the shareholders because they were deprived of the opportunity of accepting the higher offer.  That loss would be suffered exclusively by the shareholders.  It was not a loss to the coffers of the company, which would remain totally unaffected.  That could readily be demonstrated.  If, as a result of the decision of the board which was impugned, the take-over went through and the entire shareholding in the company became vested in one bidder at a lower price than was available from the other, the recovery of damages by the company would not` compensate the former shareholders for their loss.  Only a direct action by those shareholders in their own right, and not in right of the company, could provide the necessary compensation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>R.P. Howard Ltd. v. Woodman Matthews and Co.</i> [1983]  B.C.L.C. 117 a company and its principal shareholder brought an action in negligence against a firm of solicitors, alleging that, as a result of the firm's failure to advise an application for a new tenancy under the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954, the company had been obliged to accept a new lease on terms less favourable than those it would have obtained under the Act.  In addition, the principal shareholder was obliged to agree that he would not sell his controlling interest in the company without the landlord's consent.  The Judge (Staughton J.) distinguished <i>Prudential v Newman</i> on the ground that the shareholder was not seeking to recover a sum which merely reflected the loss suffered by the company but his own independent loss because his shares were less easily saleable and therefore had a lesser market value.  This is capable of being misunderstood, but was correct on the facts, since the shareholder's claim was rightly limited to the loss arising from the requirement to obtain the landlord's consent to any sale of the shares.  This was additional to and did not reflect the loss suffered by the company as a result of the terms of the new lease.  The shareholder made no claim on his own account in respect of the diminution in the value of his shares due to this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Barings plc v. Coopers v. Lybrand</i> [1997]  1 B.C.L.C. 427 a parent company, brought an action in negligence against the auditors of a wholly-owned subsidiary.  Leggatt L.J. correctly distinguished both <i>Prudential v Newman</i>, where the shareholder had no independent cause of action of his own, and <i>George Fisher v Multi Construction</i>, where the company had none.  Here each of them had its own cause of action.  But he  stated (at p. 435b-e) that if the shareholder suffered loss as a result of a breach of duty on the part of the defendant owed to it, it cannot be disentitled from suing merely because the damages claimed would or might include damages for which the defendant was liable to the company.  There was, he said, no legal principle which debarred a holding company from recovering damages for loss in the value of its subsidiaries resulting directly from the breach of a duty owed to the holding company as distinct from a duty owed to the subsidiaries.  I do not accept this as correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Christensen v. </i>Scott [1996]  1 N.Z.L.R. 273 the company carried on the business of potato farming on tenanted land.  The landlord defaulted on a mortgage of the land and the mortgagee entered into possession and exercised its power of sale.  Access to the standing crop was refused and the company was unable to harvest it, with disastrous financial consequences.  The company went into liquidation and receivership, and the receiver and the liquidator brought proceedings for negligence against the company's professional advisers.  The action was settled.  The shareholders, who had guaranteed the company's debts, opposed the settlement, alleging that the sums offered by way of settlement were totally inadequate.  In due course they brought their own proceedings, alleging that the defendants owed duties of care to them personally.  They claimed damages representing the diminution in the value of their shareholdings arising from the defendants' negligence.  The judge held that such damages reflected the company's loss and could not be recovered by the shareholders.  The Court of Appeal of New Zealand allowed the shareholders' appeal.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In giving the judgment of the Court, Thomas J. distinguished <i>Prudential v Newman</i> on the ground that it did not necessarily exclude a claim brought by a shareholder to whom a separate duty was owed and who suffered his own personal loss as a result of that breach of duty.  So far, of course, this is correct: <i>Heron</i> and <i>Howard</i> are just such cases.  The Judge observed that the fact that the loss was also suffered by the company did not mean that it was not also a personal loss suffered by the shareholder.  "Indeed", he added</p>
<p></p><ul>"the diminution in the value of Mr. and Mrs. Christensen's shares in the company is by definition a personal loss and not a corporate loss.  The loss suffered by the company is the loss of the lease and the profit which would have been obtained from harvesting the potato crop.  That loss is reflected in the diminution in the value of Mr. and Mrs. Christensen's shares.  They can no longer realise their shares at the value they enjoyed prior to the alleged default of their accountants and solicitors."<p></p></ul>
<p>I cannot accept this reasoning as representing the position in English law.  It is of course correct that the diminution in the value of the plaintiffs' shares was by definition a personal loss and not the company's loss, but that is not the point.  The point is that it merely reflected the diminution of the company's assets.  The test is not whether the company could have made a claim in respect of the loss in question; the question is whether, treating the company and the shareholder as one for this purpose, the shareholder's loss is franked by that of the company.  If so, such reflected loss is recoverable by the company and not by the shareholders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas J. acknowledged that double recovery could not be permitted, but thought that the problem did not arise where the company had settled its claim.  He considered that it would be sufficient to make an allowance for the amount paid to the liquidator.  With respect, I cannot accept this either.  As Hobhouse L.J. observed in <i>Gerber</i> (at p. 471), if the company chooses not to exercise its remedy, the loss to the shareholder is caused by the company's decision not to pursue its remedy and not by the defendant's wrongdoing.  By a parity of reasoning, the same applies if the company settles for less than it might have done.  Shareholders (and creditors) who are aggrieved by the liquidator's proposals are not without a remedy; they can have recourse to the companies Court, or sue the liquidator for negligence.</p>
