<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;153.&nbsp;&nbsp;The position is in my view different in respect of the period from 13 August 2001 to 18 February 2002 with which the House is concerned. I have in para 123 above summarised the history of the recent changes to United Kingdom law, encompassed by the Civil Partnerships Act 2004. My noble and learned friend, Baroness Hale of Richmond, has said of them that they are "hugely to the credit of the United Kingdom Government and Parliament. They are ahead of much of Europe, although parts of Europe are ahead of them". Such changes required a very careful process of development, consultation and drafting, to achieve a comprehensive legislative picture based on equality of treatment. Baroness Hale of Richmond, has herself observed, in words quoted in para 93 of his speech by my noble and learned friend, Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe, that there is necessarily an evolutionary process, by which the law in this area has adapted to achieve an equality-based treatment of the sexes across the whole legal scene. Because of the front-line importance of a home, the Strasbourg and United Kingdom courts have been active at a relatively early stage to eliminate differences in treatment which were evidently unfair.  The area of law with which the House is concerned is not so front-line. It is one where there are swings and roundabouts, advantages and disadvantages, for same-sex couples in achieving complete equality of treatment. There are many allied areas of legislation that used similar terminology and required close attention, to achieve coherent, comprehensive reform. It is an area in relation to which Parliament and the democratically elected government should be recognised as enjoying a limited margin of discretion, regarding the stage of development of social attitudes, when and how fast to act, how far consultation was required and what form any appropriate legislative changes should take.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;154.&nbsp;&nbsp;In these circumstances, the House has not been shown any basis for criticism of the United Kingdom for delay either in reviewing the law or in moving to alter it in the light of the review. It is said, nonetheless, that this is not a situation where the principle discussed in <i>Petrovic v. Austria </i>33 EHRR 14 and <i>R (Hooper) v. Secretary of State for Work and Pensions </i>[2005] 1 WLR 1681 could have any operation, because unequal or discriminatory treatment of same-sex couples has never been justified. That is how we would now see it from a moral viewpoint. But here we are concerned with the legal position during a particular period in the years 2001 to 2002. If it is right that, until quite recently neither the Strasbourg court nor a United Kingdom domestic court would have regarded a same-sex relationship as involving family life, then it also follows that it was not then unlawful, under articles 8 and 14 of the Convention, to discriminate in domestic legislation between opposite and same-sex couples.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;155.&nbsp;&nbsp;Justification exists where discrimination is prima facie<i> </i>unlawful, but there is a special reason legitimising it - e.g. where (as in probably in <i>Petrovic </i>itself)<i> </i>men and women were treated differently for a reason for which there was historically rational justification but which has now disappeared. In such a case <i>Petrovic </i>accepts, and Lord Hoffmann in para 62 in <i>Hooper </i>agreed, reasonable time may be allowed for legislative change - though it must not be exceeded as it was in relation to transsexuals (cf <i>Goodwin</i>). Here, discrimination was, as a matter of history, not even prima facie<i> </i>unlawful under article 8, because the concept of "family life" did not extend to cover the situation. It cannot have become unlawful so, until a broader understanding of the concept developed. There is in my view no logical or fair distinction between a situation where there once was, but no longer is, justification and this situation. Accordingly, insofar as it may be necessary, I consider that the principle in <i>Petrovic </i>is capable of applying to the present situation, and that it underlines the conclusion that the United Kingdom is not open to criticism for the changes in its internal law, which occurred - both as a result of judicial decision and as a result of legislation - gradually over a period. This process reflected the evolution of society and its attitudes and the unreality of supposing that all aspects of any exercise in achieving complete equality in every area of United Kingdom law could have been addressed by the courts and/or Parliament at one and the same moment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;156.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, I would hold that Mrs M has not established that the child benefit regime as it existed under the MASC Regulations in the United Kingdom in the period from 13 August 2001 to 18 February 2002 was inconsistent with the Convention right to respect for family life introduced into domestic law by the Human Rights Act.</p>
<i>
</i><p><i>Respect for Mrs M's private life </i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;157.&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the third basis on which Mrs M relies on article 8 read with article 14. That is that the MASC Regulations would interfere with her right to respect for her personal life, unless read in one of the ways they were read below. None of the members of the Court of Appeal accepted this submission, although Sedley LJ did no more than express his doubt about it. Neither the child support regime nor those aspects of which Mrs M complains were directed at Mrs M's private life. Any possible effect would appear to me as remote and indeterminate as, if not more so than, that suggested by the complainant in <i>Botta v. Italy </i>(1998) 26 EHRR 241. In my view, any link with Mrs M's private life would be tenuous in the extreme, and quite insufficient for the purposes of bringing the regime and those aspects within the ambit of article 8 read with article 14.</p>
<i></i><p><i>Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and article 14</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;158.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mrs M relies on article 1 of Protocol No. 1 read with article 14. The Commission recalled in <i>Burrows v. United Kingdom </i>(Application No. 27558/95) that the article is primarily concerned with the formal expropriation of assets for a public purpose, and not with the regulation of rights between persons under private law unless the State lays hands - or authorises a third party to lay hands - on a particular piece of property for a purpose which is to serve the public interest. A scheme providing for leasehold enfranchisement falls nonetheless within the scope of article 1 of Protocol 1, although the tenants benefiting from enfranchisement are private individuals, where the scheme as a whole is devised and introduced in the public interest in pursuance of legitimate social policies: <i>James v. United Kingdom </i>(1986) 8 EHRR 123. Possessions may include the notional "proprietary" right conferred on individual citizens by legislation providing for social security and welfare benefits, whether or not these are conditional on the prior payment of contributions: <i>STEC v. United Kingdom </i>(Application Nos. 6573/01 and 65900/01) (admissibility decisions taken on 6 July 2005). The second paragraph of the article provides that the first paragraph "shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary … to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties", but is, as Sedley LJ pointed out, no more than a proviso to the first paragraph. The second paragraph may to some degree have been introduced as a matter of caution, and it certainly cannot expand the scope of the first paragraph.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;159.&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me artificial to treat child support payments as "depriving" the absent parent of "possessions" within the first paragraph. As Sedley and Kennedy LJJ observed, to treat the first paragraph of the article as directed to the level of financial payments between parents which the State enforces by its machinery would carry the scope of the article into every situation where legislation has a net adverse financial impact on a person. The MASC Regulations were not expropriating anything belonging to the absent parent, but seeking to achieve a fair measure of the absent parent's pre-existing obligation to support his or her children. This is so, even though the legislative measure and procedure were no doubt introduced as a matter of legitimate policy, to address a growing social problem. There is still no element of, or resembling, expropriation in the public interest, as there undoubtedly was in the case of leasehold enfranchisement. I agree with the reasoning on this point of all my noble and learned friends, Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe, Lords Bingham of Cornhill and Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead. It follows that neither the child support regime nor the aspects of which Mrs M complains fall within the ambit of article 1 of Protocol No. 1 so as to engage article 14.</p>
<i>
<p>Conclusion</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;160.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the result, I consider that Mrs M has not established that the child support regime during the relevant period from 13 August 2001 to 18 February 2002 was on its face inconsistent with any Convention right. It is therefore unnecessary for me to consider whether any such potential inconsistency could have been avoided or eliminated by the exceptional verbal treatment, or as the Secretary of State would have it mistreatment, prescribed by the Tribunal, the Commissioner or the Court of Appeal. It is also unnecessary for me to express any view on the difficult issue of remedy which would have arisen had I been of a contrary view. I would allow this appeal accordingly.</p>
