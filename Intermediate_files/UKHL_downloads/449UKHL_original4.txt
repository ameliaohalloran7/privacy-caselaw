<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82. The question was raised whether the Convention must be approached on the basis that it is a document of the "always speaking" type described by Lord Steyn in <i>R v Ireland</i> [1998]  AC 147, 158D-159A , whose meaning should be interpreted in the light of the current scientific evidence.  I would answer that question in this way.  The meaning that is to be given to the words used in the Convention must be the meaning which was to be attributed to them when the Convention was entered into in 1929.  But it must always have been intended that the application of that meaning to the facts would depend on the evidence.  The proper approach is to make use of the best current medical and scientific knowledge that is available.  An important question therefore is whether, if the position has now been reached where a physical basis for a mental injury can be demonstrated objectively by the evidence, the framers of the Convention intended to include a condition of that kind within the scope of article 17 when they used the expression "bodily injury".</p>
<i><p><i></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i>Natural meaning</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83. It is necessary to start by considering the natural meaning of the words "any other bodily injury".  At first sight the words "bodily injury" appear to envisage injury of a physical nature, similar in kind to that which is encompassed by the words "death or wounding."  Both phrases may be thought to contemplate some kind of physical injury, some physiological damage to the structure of the body.  While the phrase as a whole seems to have been intended to extend the scope of the article beyond "wounding", the adjective "bodily" appears to have been included to restrict or limit the extent of the word "injury".  The use of this adjective suggests that not everything that might possibly be described as an injury to the passenger which he sustains on board the aircraft or in the course of embarking or disembarking was intended to be covered by article 17.  The possibilities for experiencing emotions such as fear, fright or anxiety due to unexpected events during air travel must have been many in 1929 when the airline industry was in its infancy and the ability of unpressurised aircraft to avoid thunderstorms and other adverse weather conditions was limited.  It is reasonable to think that they were familiar to the draftsmen of the Convention and to the signatories.  But their use of language suggests not only that they did not intend article 17 to apply to emotional reactions of that kind but that they had in mind injuries which were manifestly physical.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84. On the other hand the Lord President said in Mr King's case, 2001 SLT 126, 136B, that he saw no reason why the phrase "any other bodily injury" should be interpreted narrowly; rather that it should be interpreted as covering any injury whatever which can properly be regarded as affecting the body.  So construed, it seemed to him that the phrase was capable of including psychological injury.  Lord Reed recognised, at p 168H, that a wider construction, which would include any impairment to health, was possible.  I agree that the words are sufficiently imprecise to permit that interpretation.  On that approach it would be sufficient to show that the passenger was suffering from a specific mental illness which had diagnostic features that could be objectively demonstrated.  But I think that, in its context, the phrase points to some injury to the body and not to a mental injury.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85. The equivalent phrase in the French text is "de toute autre lésion corporelle".  It follows the word " de mort, de blessure".  "Blessure" is defined by the <i>Le Petit Robert</i> (1970 ed) as "lésion faite aux tissus vivants par une cause extérieure (pression, instrument tranchant ou contondant, arme à feu; chaleur)".  "Lésion" has two meanings, one legal, the other medical.  In the medical sense it is defined as "changement grave dans les caractères anatomiques et histologiques d'un organe sous l'infleunce d'une maladie, d'un accident".  This points to an injury which affects the tissues of the body.  "Corporelle" is defined in the relevant sense as "relatif au corps".  This tends to confirm that the word "lésion" should be interpreted in this context as meaning a physical injury: see Dr Georgette Miller, <i>Liability in International Air Transport </i>(1977), pp 127-128.  The phrase "lésion corporelle" in the French text seems to convey the same meaning as that which I would be inclined to draw from the English text.  It appears to relate to those changes in the tissues of the body which are not covered by the word "blessure".  The word "corporelle" directs attention to physical changes in the body rather than something that affects the mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86. It was suggested that the phrase "bodily injury" was intended to extend to all harm that the passenger might sustain in his person, and to distinguish that kind of injury from an injury to his property or his business.  The Lord President saw this explanation as more plausible: 2001 SLT 126, 144K-L.  This argument is based on the proposition that article 17 must be read in the context of Chapter III of the Convention as a whole.  Article 18 deals with damage to registered baggage.  Article 19 deals with delay.  The juxtaposition of these articles suggests that the intention was to include in article 17 everything that could be regarded as personal injury, while patrimonial loss consisting of damage to property and economic loss was left to be covered by the following articles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87. On the other hand I should have thought that, if this was indeed the intention, the word "lésion" on its own would have done and that the adjective "corporelle" would have been unnecessary.  It would have been plain from its association with the word "blessure", and the reference to presence on board the aircraft and to the actions of embarking and disembarking, that the phrase "toute autre lésion" in article 17 was being used in the sense of an injury to the person of the passenger.  The fact that the word "corporelle" was included appears to me to indicate that the word "lésion" was intended to describe a physical injury to the passenger as distinct from a mental injury.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88. The Lord President recognised that the argument that the word "corporelle" was included to exclude mental as opposed to physical injury had an immediate appeal to the reader of the article: 2001 SLT 126, 135F.  But he said that it would be superfluous to add the word "corporelle" to the word "lésion" if the latter word were to be given a meaning which contains within itself a reference to injury to the body.  In his view therefore the word "lésion" in the relevant phrase must be taken to have been used in the wider legal sense, indicated in the dictionary by the words "dommage, préjudice, tort".  The fact remains however that the adjective "corporelle" was chosen to qualify, and thus to restrict, the meaning of the word "lésion".  Its ordinary meaning tends to exclude any other form of injury to the body other than a physical injury.  And I would hold that the word "lésion" is used in its medical sense in article 17.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89. I would be inclined therefore to read the phrase in a way that would confine its application to an injury to the skin, bones or other tissues of the body and exclude mental injury.  But its meaning is not so clear that that one need look no further.  I turn therefore to see what guidance is available in the other material.</p>
<i><p><i></i></p>
<p><i>The travaux préparatoires</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90. It must be said at once that, despite diligent research, no indication has been found that there was any discussion of the meaning to be attached to the phrase "any other bodily injury" by any of the delegates in the course of their negotiations at the Warsaw Conference.  But there are some points about these negotiations that are of interest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91. As Lord Reed noted 2001 SLT 126, 166H-I, the text of the Convention went through previous drafts before the matter reached the stage of the final negotiations.  They originated in the French Government's Draft Protocol which was circulated prior to the Paris Conference of 1925.  It dealt with liability in extremely general terms, which focused solely on loss, damage and delay without discussing the nature of the accidents which would give rise to liability.  Article 3 of that draft said simply:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Le transporteur est responsable des pertes, avaries et retards qui résultent de ses fautes personelles et du vice propre de l'appareil."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92. Following various modifications a more detailed provision was produced by the Comité International Technique d'Experts Juridiques Aériens ("CITEJA"), which introduced the three categories which were later to appear in the Convention in three separate articles:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Le transporteur est responsable du dommage pendant le transport: a) en cas de mort, de blessures ou de toute autre lésion corporelle subie par un voyaguer; b) en cas de destruction, perte ou avarie de marchandises ou de bagages; c) en cas de retard subi par un voyageur, des marchandises ou des bagages."<p></p></ul>
<p>As Lord Reed said at p 167A-B, it is perhaps easier in this context to appreciate that "lésion corporelle" might be intended to demarcate category (a) from the other two categories. But discussions which then followed during the Warsaw Conference, which are fully described in Lord Reed's speech, focussed on other matters.  There was no discussion of what was meant by the expression "lésion corporelle".  Nor was there a discussion of any issue which could be related in any way to the issue whether it was intended to include mental injury as well as physical injury.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93. The Lord President said in Mr King's case that the court would have to conclude that the travaux préparatoires were of no assistance, as it was accepted by both sides that the question of psychological injury was not discussed in them.  This was the primary conclusion that he too had reached and that he would apply: 2001 SLT 126, 137I-J.  Lord Cameron of Lochbroom said, at p 147E-F, that it was accepted that during the course of the preparatory work which led to the determination of the final text there was no debate minuted which indicated, one way or the other, which meaning the delegates intended to give to the words "toute autre lésion corporelle" as they appeared in the final text.  Lord Reed said, at p 167I-J, that in his opinion the travaux préparatoires did not support any theory that the signatories to the Warsaw Convention had a specific intention either to include or to exclude liability for psychiatric disorders.  But he added that they did, on the other hand, confirm that articles 17, 18 and 19 should be read as a whole, concerned respectively with passengers, goods and delay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94. In Miss Morris's case Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers MR said the court in her case also agreed that the travaux préparatoires did not afford the type of clear indication that enabled them to be used to resolve the ambiguity: [2002] QB 100, 117, para 50.  But he went on to say that the fact that no mention was made of mental injury was not without significance when one came to consider the overall purpose and scheme of the Convention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95. What inference is it proper to draw from the silence?  It is clear that the importance of these articles was not overlooked.  The president of the drafting committee, Mr Giannini, is recorded as having said when he drew attention to article 17, and in particular to the fact that it had been decided to divide what had originally appeared in a single article into three articles setting out the causes for liability for person, goods and baggage and delay:</p>
<p></p><ul>"As our colleagues certainly recall, these are perhaps the most important articles of the Convention."<p></p></ul>
<p>Nevertheless the draft article 17 was approved without discussion (<i>II Conference International de Droit Privé Aérien</i>, Minutes, trans Horner &amp; Legraz (1975), pp 204-205).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96. It seems reasonable to conclude from their silence that the delegates did not feel it necessary to discuss what was meant by the words "lésion corporelle".  None of them appears to have anticipated that there would be any difficulty in applying the wording of article 17 to the facts in practice.  Nor was it suggested that the formula which they were adopting would cause serious concern to the airlines or to their insurers.  This suggests that the meaning which they gave to the words was the simplest and least troublesome meaning that they would ordinarily bear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97. As to the conclusion to be drawn from this material, I can at least say that I have not found anything so far which contradicts the impression which I have already formed on reading the Convention that the word "bodily" restricts the scope of the word "injury" to injuries which are manifestly physical and that it excludes emotional reactions and mental injury.</p>
<i><p><i>Subsequent practice</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98. The search is for the meaning which was to be attributed to the words "bodily injury" in 1929 when the Convention was entered into.  So I think that we should be cautious in the use of subsequent practice.  It would not be right to use subsequent practice to show that the meaning of these words has been changed.  The proper way to change the meaning used in an international convention is by amending the convention.  But it would be helpful if there was some evidence of a settled practice on the part of all the contracting states to show what they have always understood the words to mean.  The point does not appear to have been raised in any reported case until a series of hijackings in the 1970s led to the making of claims in the United States for damages for emotional distress and mental injury.  I shall come back later to the case law.  At this stage however I wish to refer to some other material to which our attention has been drawn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99. The Lord President in Mr King's case drew support for a broader interpretation of the phrase from the fact that from the very beginning in the German-speaking countries the phrase was interpreted in a way that would have permitted recovery for mental injury: 2001 SLT 126, 136C.  An official German language translation was prepared as the result of co-operation among officials of Germany, Austria and Switzerland and published in 1933.  It interprets the phrase "blessure ou toute autre lésion corporelle" as "körperlich verletzt oder sonst gesundheitlich geschädigt".  According to this translation, which uses the adjective "körperlich" to qualify the equivalent to the word "blessure" in the French text rather than the word "lésion", the article applies where the passenger is bodily wounded or otherwise damaged in his health.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100. For the reasons which the Lord President described at p 136E-G, it is thought that one of those who had a hand in the translation was Dr Otto Riese.  He was a member of the German delegation in all the negotiations from the Paris conference in 1925 onwards.  He continued to take an interest in and write about aviation matters after the Warsaw conference.  He had already indicated in an article which he wrote shortly after it ended that the phrase should be given a wide scope.  In subsequent articles he adhered to the view that it applied to damage to health, although he acknowledged in his <i>Luftrecht </i>(1949), p 442 that this was a somewhat free translation of "lésion corporelle".  In a French text which appeared in 1951, Riese and Lacour, <i>Précis de droit Aérien,</i> p 264, para 323, he said that the difference between the words "blessure" and "lésion corporelle" was that the Convention applied not only to wounding properly so called but also to all injury or the health of the passenger, "telles que les conséquences d'un choc psychique ou d'un mal de l'air".  The Lord President said, at p 137C, that he did not think that either the official German translation or Dr Riese's views, which tended to confirm that the expression "lésion corporelle" was not used with the intention of excluding mental or physical injury, could be dismissed lightly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101. Commenting on this chapter of evidence, Lord Reed pointed out, at p 165L, that the official German translation was of no greater weight than the English translation and of less weight than the French text, and he noted Dr Riese's own description of the German version as a somewhat free translation of it.<i> </i> Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers MR made similar comments in Miss Morris's case: [2002] QB 100, 124, para 85.  I also agree with him that caution must be applied to the views expressed subsequently by one delegate, for the reason which the Lord President himself gave, at p 137G, that delegates at a conference may not actually all share a common view on the point at issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102. I can see that there is force in the point which the Lord President made, at pp 136L-137A that it would be surprising if Dr Riese had felt able consistently to advance his interpretation while conscious either that his fellow delegates at Warsaw had chosen the phrase with the settled intention of excluding mental injury or that his interpretation was wholly inconsistent with the meaning of these words.  But the fact remains that, so far as the records show, the question whether the phrase extended to mental injury was simply not discussed at the Warsaw conference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103. CITEJA was dissolved in 1947, and its work was taken over by the International Civil Aviation Organisation ("ICAO").  The legal committee of the IACO met at Madrid in 1951 as part of the programme of work of revision of the Warsaw Convention which led to the Hague Conference in 1955.  The French representative, M Garnault, proposed as an amendment to article 17 the substitution of the words "affection corporelle" for "lésion corporelle".  His reason, as recorded in the minutes, was that the word "lésion" presupposed a rupture in the tissue and that he thought that there could be cases where, without there being a "lésion" in the tissues or a break in their continuity, there could be a mental illness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104. As Lord Reed observed at p 166C, the French representative's explanation adopted the medical, rather than the legal, meaning of the word "lésion" and it indicates that he did not think that the words "lésion corporelle" covered mental illness.  The Lord President agreed, at p 140E, that M Garnault's views do indeed support the narrower interpretation of those words and that, as he would be a native speaker of the language, they must carry a certain weight.  His view was that, taken as a whole, the legal debate at Madrid showed that by 1951 there was no settled view that the words in article 17 were to be interpreted as excluding psychological injury.  I would agree with this assessment.  But it does not persuade me that it was thought in 1929 by the signatories to the Warsaw Convention that the phrase "any other bodily injury" would include cases where the only injury sustained was a mental injury.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105. The Montreal Convention on Air Carrier Liability was signed on 28 May 1999, but it is not yet in force.  One of the issues which was discussed was whether mental injury could be included in any new, revised system of liability.  A document produced under the aegis of the chairman included the following statement with regard to article 17:</p>
<p></p><ul>"With reference to article 17, paragraph 1 of the Convention, the expression 'bodily injury' is included on the basis of the fact that in some states damages for mental injuries are recoverable under certain circumstances, that jurisprudence in this area is developing and that it is not intended to interfere with this development, having regard to jurisprudence in areas other than international carriage by air."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106. The Lord President said, at p 141F, that the delegates' official view showed that they were quite prepared to countenance the situation, which had developed since the Warsaw Convention, where courts of different states deal with damages for psychological harm in different ways.  He said that this seemed to him to be consistent with the intention of the delegates at the Warsaw Conference who did not seek to impose a uniform system of assessing damages, being content that the cap on the recoverable damages provided sufficient uniformity for carriers and their insurers.  On the other hand, as Lord Reed pointed out at p 166F, the position in 1999 was that national courts, including in particular those in the United States where the point was of particular importance in view of the size of its air market, had interpreted the words "any other bodily injury" as excluding mental injury.  This brings me to the relevant case law.</p>
<i><p><i>Decisions of foreign courts</i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
(a) <p><i>United States</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107. The first reported case in the United States which was drawn our attention arose out of an incident when an aircraft en route from Tel Aviv to New York was hijacked, diverted to the Middle East and forced to land in the desert in Jordan: <i>Rosman v Trans World Airlines Inc </i> (1974)  34 NY 2d 385.  The passengers were not struck or personally assaulted by any of the hijackers, but they claimed to have suffered severe psychic trauma during the ordeal.  The question was whether they were entitled to compensation for their psychic trauma under the Convention.  The case came before the Court of Appeals of New York, which held that the defendant was liable for the plaintiff's palpable, objective bodily injuries, including those caused by the psychic trauma of the hijacking, and for the damages flowing from these bodily injuries, but not for the trauma as such or for the non-bodily or behavioural manifestations of the trauma.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108. Delivering the judgment of the majority, Rabin J recognised, at p 397, that the relationship between the mind and the body was a difficult issue.  But he said that it was not one that the court had to decide:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Rather, in seeking to apply the treaty's terms to the facts before us, we ask whether the treaty's use of the word 'bodily', in its ordinary meaning, can fairly be said to include 'mental'.  We deal with the term as used in an international agreement written almost 50 years ago, a term which even today would have little significance in the treaty as an adjective modifying 'injury' except to import a distinction from 'mental'.  In our view , therefore, the ordinary, natural meaning of 'bodily injury' as used in article 17 connotes <i>palpable</i>, <i>conspicuous</i> physical injury, and excludes mental injury with no <i>observable</i> 'bodily', as distinguished from 'behavioural', manifestations." (emphasis added)<p></p></ul>
<p>At p 399, he dealt with the need for a causal connection between the injury and the accident, and with the question whether the expression "bodily injury" could extend to an injury such as a skin rash which was caused or aggravated by fright experienced during the incident.  Disagreeing on this point with Stevens J, who dissented, he said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In our view, this connection can be established whether the bodily injury was caused by physical impact, by the physical circumstances of the confinement or by psychic trauma.  If the accident - the hijacking- caused severe fright, which in turn manifested itself in some objective 'bodily injury', then we would conclude that the Convention's requirement of the causal connection is satisfied."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109. I have quoted these passages from the majority judgment in <i>Rosman</i>, and added emphasis to the words "palpable", "conspicuous" and "observable", because they provide important guidance about the scope, on what it described at p 399 as a liberal interpretation, which can be given to the phrase "any other bodily injury".  As Rabin J put it in a later passage on the same, the predicate of liability is to establish the "bodily injury".  Once this is established, then the damages sustained as a result of the bodily injury can be compensated, including mental suffering.  It treats as "bodily injury" physical injuries consequent upon shock or distress such as heart attacks, rashes and strokes and damage to the brain.  But it excludes manifestations of fear, anxiety or other mental problems which cannot be described as physical injuries, such as sleeplessness, headaches and loss of weight: see Lord Reed's analysis in Mr King's case, 2001 SLT 126, 169C-D.  It also excludes conditions affecting the mind which are not due to a palpable, conspicuous or observable physical injury</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110. The first case to come before the Supreme Court of the United States on this issue was <i>Eastern Airlines Inc v Floyd</i> (1991)  499 US 530.  Passengers on an aircraft which narrowly avoided crashing during a flight between Miami and the Bahamas claimed damages solely for mental distress arising out of the accident.  A conflict had arisen between the decision of the Court of Appeals in that case that the phrase "lésion corporelle" encompasses purely emotional distress and the decision in <i>Rosman</i>.  The Supreme Court held that article 17 does not allow recovery for what it described as mental or psychic injuries unaccompanied by physical injury or physical manifestation of injury.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111. The court used the French text to guide its analysis.  It examined the meaning which was given to the words in the French dictionaries, observed that the phrase was not used in any French legislation in force in 1929, that there were no French court decisions in or before 1929 which explained its meaning or had allowed recovery for injury caused by fright or shock absent an incident in which someone sustained physical injury and that there were no materials in French treatises which indicated that "lésion corporelle" embraced psychic injury.  At p 540, the court observed that the cause of action that evidently was possible in principle under French law in 1929 would not have been recognised in many other countries represented at the Warsaw Convention.  At pp 544-545, the court said that the unavailability of compensation for purely psychic injury in many common and civil law countries at the time of the Warsaw Convention persuaded it that the signatories had no specific intent to include such a remedy in the Convention.  At pp 551-552, it said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Even if we were to agree that allowing recovery for purely psychic injury is desirable as a policy goal, we cannot give effect to such policy without convincing evidence that the signatories' intent with respect to article 17 would allow such recovery.  As discussed, neither the language, negotiating history, nor postenactment interpretations of article 17 clearly evidences such intent…<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Moreover, we believe our construction of article 17 better accords with the Warsaw Convention's stated purpose of achieving uniformity of rules governing claims arising from international air transportation… We have no doubt that subjecting international air carriers to <i>strict</i> liability for purely mental distress would be controversial for most signatory countries. Our construction avoids this potential source of divergence."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112. At pp 552-553, the court summarised the view that it had reached in terms which specifically left open the question whether compensation might be available where mental injury was accompanied by physical injury:</p>
<p></p><ul>"We conclude that an air carrier cannot be held liable under article 17 when an accident has not caused a passenger to suffer death, physical injury, or physical manifestation of injury.  Although article 17 renders air carriers liable for "damage sustained in the event of" ("dommage survenu en cas de") such injuries, we express no view as to whether passengers can recover for mental injuries that are accompanied by physical injuries.  That issue is not presented here because respondents do not allege physical injury or physical manifestation of injury."<p></p></ul>
