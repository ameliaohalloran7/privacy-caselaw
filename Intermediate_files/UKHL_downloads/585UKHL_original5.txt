<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reasons already given, I would allow Mr Johnson's appeal and would dismiss the cross-appeal except as to the two claims identified by Lord Bingham of Cornhill in his head 3 and as to aggravated damages.  In the result the one point on which I differ concerns the claims for damages for financial embarrassment and injury to family relationships: those I would permit to go to trial.   I concur in the order for costs proposed by Lord Bingham of Cornhill.</p>
<p><b>LORD HUTTON</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the advantage of reading in draft the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill.  I am in full agreement with his speech on the subject of abuse of process and I wish to confine my observations to the issue whether the damages claimed by Mr. Johnson are recoverable as a matter of law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case advanced by Mr. Johnson is that he instructed a firm of solicitors, Gore Wood &amp; Co. (GW), to advise him personally as to the conduct of his businesses, including the business of property development which he carried on  through a company Westway Homes Limited (WWH) of which he was the managing director and in which he held the entire shareholding with the exception of two shares, and that acting on behalf of WWH he also instructed GW to advise that company.  He contends that in advising him as to the business affairs of the company, GW owed him a duty of care in contract and tort and in breach of that duty caused him very substantial financial loss.  The question whether the damages claimed are recoverable comes before the House as a preliminary issue and is to be approached on the basis that the facts pleaded by Mr. Johnson are capable of establishing a breach of a duty owed to him which caused him loss.  </p>
<i></i><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>	I consider it to be clear that where a shareholder is personally owed a duty of care by a defendant and a breach of that duty causes him loss, he is not debarred from recovering damages because the defendant owed a separate and similar duty of care to the company, provided that the loss suffered by the shareholder is separate and distinct from the loss suffered by the company.  This principle was recently stated in the judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered by Sir Christopher Slade in <i>Walker and others v. Stones and others</i> [19th July 2000], the court stating that a claimant is entitled to recover damages where:</p>
<p></p><ul>"131.	(a) the claimant can establish that the defendant's conduct has constituted a breach of some legal duty owed to him personally (whether under the law of contract, torts, trusts or any other branch of the law) AND<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>132.	(b) on its assessment of the facts, the Court is satisfied that such breach of duty has caused him personal loss, separate and distinct from any loss that may have been occasioned to any corporate body in which he may be financially interested.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>133.	I further conclude that, if these two conditions are satisfied, the mere fact that the defendant's conduct may also have given rise to a cause of action at the suit of a company in which the claimant is financially interested (whether directly as a shareholder or indirectly as, for example, a beneficiary under a trust) will not deprive the plaintiff of his cause of action; in such a case, a plea of double jeopardy will not avail the defendant."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a more difficult question arises where the shareholder claims a loss which is not separate and distinct from the loss suffered by the company but his loss flows from loss suffered by the company.  In <i>Prudential Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Newman Industries Ltd. (2)</i> [1982] 1 Ch. 204, the claimants sued the directors of the company alleging that they had issued a circular to the shareholders containing a fraudulent misrepresentation concerning the true value of certain assets, and the court stated at pp. 222h and 223a-b:</p>
<p></p><ul>"But what [a shareholder] cannot do is to recover damages merely because the company in which he is interested has suffered damage.  He cannot recover a sum equal to the diminution in the market value of his shares, or equal to the likely diminution in dividend, because such a "loss" is merely a reflection of the loss suffered by the company.  The shareholder does not suffer any personal loss.  His only "loss" is through the company, in the diminution in the value of the net assets of the company, in which he has (say) a 3 per cent. shareholding.  The plaintiff's shares are merely a right of participation in the company on the terms of the articles of association.  The shares themselves, his right of participation, are not directly affected by the wrongdoing.  The plaintiff still holds all the shares as his own absolutely unencumbered property.  The deceit practised upon the plaintiff does not affect the shares; it merely enables the defendant to rob the company."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall call this statement "the Prudential Assurance principle".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In<i> Christensen v. Scott</i> [1996] 1 N.Z.L.R. 273 the Court of Appeal of New Zealand decided that where a plaintiff alleges a breach of duty owed to him personally by accountants and solicitors he is entitled to recover damages notwithstanding that his loss flows from loss suffered by a company in which he is a shareholder through a similar breach of duty owed to the company.  In that case two shareholders claimed damages for the diminution in the value of their shareholding in a company caused by the negligence of their accountants and solicitors.  In delivering the judgment of the court, after setting out part of the above passage in the judgment in <i>Prudential Assurance </i>Thomas J. stated:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It may be accepted that the Court of Appeal was correct, however, in concluding that a member has no right to sue directly in respect of a breach of duty owed to the company or in respect of a tort committed against the company.  Such claims can only be bought by the company itself or by a member in a derivative action under an exception to the rule in <i>Foss v. Harbottle</i> (1843) 2 Hare 461.  But this is not necessarily to exclude a claim brought by a party, who may also be a member, to whom a separate duty is owed and who suffers a personal loss as a result of a breach of that duty.  Where such a party, irrespective that he or she is a member, has personal rights and these rights are invaded, the rule in <i>Foss v. Harbottle</i> is irrelevant.  Nor would the claim necessarily have the calamitous consequences predicted by counsel in respect of the concept of corporate personality and limited liability.  The loss arises not from a breach of the duty owed to the company but from a breach of duty owed to the individuals.  The individuals is simply suing to vindicate his own right or redress a wrong done to him or her giving rise to a personal loss.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"We consider, therefore, that it is certainly arguable that, where there is an independent duty owed to the plaintiff and a breach of that duty occurs, the resulting loss may be recovered by the plaintiff.  The fact that the loss may also be suffered by the company does not mean that it is not also a personal loss to the individual.  Indeed, the diminution in the value of Mr and Mrs Christensen's shares in the company is by definition a personal loss and not a corporate loss."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approach taken by the Court of Appeal of New Zealand has been approved in a number of judgments of the Court of Appeal. In <i>Barings v. Coopers &amp; Lybrand</i> [1997] 1 B.C.L.C. 427 the plaintiff, a company holding shares in a subsidiary company, claimed damages against the defendants, a firm of accountants, in respect of loss it suffered through loss sustained by its subsidiary, BFS, on the ground that the defendants were in breach of duties of care owed both to the plaintiff and to the subsidiary in carrying out an audit of the subsidiary's accounts.  The defendants applied to set aside service of the writ in reliance on the Prudential Assurance principle.  The defendants' application was rejected by the Court of Appeal and Leggatt L.J. stated at p. 435:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The <i>Prudential Assurance</i> case decides that a shareholder in a company has no independent right of action based on an allegation of diminution in the value of his shares occasioned by damage to the company.  Mr. Kentridge seeks to rely on it as authority for the proposition that where a company may have a cause of action for damage caused to it by a tortfeasor, a person who enjoys an independent right of action against the tortfeasor cannot sue him at least in so far as his damages are measured by a diminution in the value of the company's shares.  But in my judgment that is a misapplication of the principle.  If C&amp;LS are in breach of a duty of care owed to Barings in respect of audit information supplied to them and the breach causes damage, Barings cannot be disentitled from suing merely because the damages for which C&amp;LS are said to be liable to Barings would or might include damages for which they are said to be liable to BFS.  For C&amp;LS are also in breach of a different duty, whether contractual or tortious, owed to BFS.  Whereas complications might arise if these claims were made in separate actions, any risk of double jeopardy or of double recovery, such as were envisaged by the New Zealand Court of Appeal in <i>Christensen v. Scott</i> [1996] 1 N.Z.L.R. 273 at 280-281, can be avoided if both claims are made in the same action.  It may be, for instance, that C&amp;LS are not liable to Barings for loss of the value of the shares in either BFS or any company which has a cause of action against C&amp;LS for such loss.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"The present case differs from the <i>Prudential Assurance</i> case because here the person in the position of shareholder, namely Barings, has a right of action independent of the company, BFS.  On the other hand, unlike the situation in the <i>George Fischer</i> case, BFS does have a right of action itself.  As that case shows, there is no legal principle that a holding company is unable to recover damages for loss in the value of its subsidiaries, resulting directly from a breach of duty owed to it, as distinct from a duty owed (or not owed as the case may be) to the subsidiaries."<p></p></ul>
<p>In <i>Gerber Garment Technology Inc. v. Lectra Systems</i> [1997] R.P.C. 443 the plaintiff was entitled to damages for infringement of patent rights held by it and sought to recover damages for losses suffered by subsidiary companies in which it held all the shares, and which themselves had no cause of action, and the defendant contended that the claim was barred by the Prudential Assurance<i> </i>principle.  That argument was rejected by the Court of Appeal and Hobhouse L.J. (as he then was) cited the judgment of the Court of Appeal of New Zealand in <i>Christensen v. Scott</i> and stated at p. 475:</p>
<p></p><ul>"There is no reason to suppose that this case would have been differently decided in England.  The decision helpfully illustrates that, provided that the plaintiff can establish a personal cause of action and can prove a personal loss caused by the defendant's actionable wrong, then the fact that the loss is felt by the plaintiff in the form of the loss of the value of the plaintiff's shares in a company is no answer to the plaintiff's claim.  (In that case, as in the present case, no question of remoteness arose.)"<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judgments in <i>Prudential Assurance </i>and <i>Christensen v. Scott </i>are difficult to reconcile, and it is also difficult to reconcile the judgment in <i>Barings v. Coopers &amp; Lybrand</i> with the judgment in the former case because the ground on which Leggatt L.J. sought to distinguish it, namely, that in <i>Prudential Assurance</i> the shareholders did not have an individual right of action is invalid, the court in <i>Prudential Assurance</i> stating at p. 222g that the defendants owed the shareholders a duty to give sound advice.  <i>Gerber Garment Technology </i>can be distinguished from <i>Prudential Assurance</i> on the ground that the companies in which the plaintiff held shares did not themselves have a cause of action against the defendant.  But I consider that the ruling in <i>Prudential Assurance</i> that the shareholders could not recover damages cannot be explained on the ground of causation, which was the explanation advanced by Hobhouse L.J. at p. 471; I think, in agreement with the Court of Appeal of New Zealand in <i>Christensen v. Scott, </i>that the shareholders can be regarded as suffering a loss caused by breach of duty of the defendant notwithstanding that their loss is reflective of loss suffered by the company.  Therefore I consider that the issue to be decided is whether this House should follow the reasoning set out in <i>Prudential Assurance</i> or the reasoning set out in <i>Christensen v. Scott</i>.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, I consider, with respect, that part of the reasoning in the <i>Prudential Assurance</i> case is open to criticism.  In my opinion the view of the Court of Appeal of New Zealand that the loss suffered by a shareholder through the diminution in the value of his shareholding is a personal loss is a more realistic assessment than the view of the Court of Appeal in <i>Prudential Assurance</i> that the shareholder's loss is merely a reflection of the loss suffered by the company and that the shareholder suffers no personal loss.  This view has been criticised in an article by Mr. M. J. Sterling on <i>"The Theory and Policy of Shareholder Actions in Tort" </i>(1987) 50 Modern Law Review 468 at pp. 470 and 471:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The description of the Court of Appeal is not wrong, in that the value of a share is related to the present and expected future levels of dividend of the company and the right to receive dividends is a right of participation in the company, but it is suspiciously limited because a share is commonly treated as a piece of personal property.  The fact that a share is valuable because it is a right of participation in a company does not preclude one as a matter of logic from regarding it as a piece of property ….<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"The Court of Appeal gave no reason for preferring their description of a share to one which includes its nature as an item of personal property but some good reason is surely necessary to justify exclusion of this obvious characteristic.  It is therefore suggested that, if necessary, a share can be regarded as a piece of personal property and a shareholder could be allowed to sue for injury to it."  <p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my respectful opinion there is force in this criticism.  However, even if this criticism be accepted, there remains the need to ensure that there is no double recovery and that creditors and the other shareholders of the company are protected.  It was this need which was emphasised by Millett L.J. (as he then was) in <i>Stein v. Blake</i> [1998] 1 All E.R. 724, 730a, as the reason why the principle in <i>Prudential Assurance</i> should be followed:</p>
<p></p><ul>"If this action were allowed to proceed and the plaintiff were to recover for the lost value of his shareholding from the first defendant, this would reduce his ability to meet any judgment which might thereafter be obtained by the liquidators, or by any of the old companies which were not in liquidation, to the prejudice of their creditors.  The plaintiff would have obtained by a judgment of the court the very same extraction of value from the old companies at the expense of their creditors that the first defendant is alleged to have obtained by fraud and deceit." <p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Christensen v. Scott</i> the court considered that the problem of double recovery did not arise in that case as the defendants had settled the company's claim with the knowledge that the plaintiffs' claim was outstanding.  But the court recognised that double recovery cannot be permitted and that the interests of the creditors of a company must be protected.  In my opinion the resolution of the conflict between <i>Prudential Assurance</i> and <i>Christensen v. Scott </i>narrows down to the issue whether, as held in the former case, the shareholder is debarred from bringing to trial an action claiming loss where such loss is merely reflective of loss suffered by the company, or whether the shareholder is entitled to proceed to trial on such a claim, it being a matter for the trial judge, if the plaintiff establishes his claim, to ensure that there is no double recovery and that creditors and other shareholders of the company do not suffer loss, which was the course which Pumfrey J. held should be followed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, whilst in a case such as <i>Christensen v. Scott </i>there may be merit in permitting an individual shareholder to sue, the decision in <i>Prudential Assurance</i> has stood in England for almost twenty years and, whilst the decision has sometimes been distinguished on inadequate grounds, it has been regarded as establishing a clear principle which the Court of Appeal has followed in other cases.  I further consider that the principle has the advantage that, rather than leaving the protection of creditors and other shareholders of the company to be given by the trial judge in the complexities of a trial to determine the validity of the claim made by the plaintiff against the defendant, where conflicts of interest may arise between directors and some shareholders, or between the liquidator and some shareholders, the principle ensures at the outset of proceedings that where the loss suffered by the plaintiff is sustained because of loss to the coffers of the company, there will be no double recovery at the expense of the defendant nor loss to creditors of the company and other shareholders.  Therefore whilst I think that this House should uphold the <i>Prudential Assurance</i> principle, I also consider that it is important to emphasise that the principle does not apply where the loss suffered by the shareholder is separate and distinct from the loss suffered by the company.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five heads of claim pleaded by Mr. Johnson have been set out in the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill.  I consider that the losses claimed in heads 1, 2, 4 and 5 are separate and distinct from loss sustained by WWH and that those heads of claim should not be struck out.  In respect of head 3 I am also in agreement with the opinion of Lord Bingham that because it is not a separate and distinct loss, Mr. Johnson cannot claim in respect of the monies which WWH would have paid into a pension fund for him if those monies had been available to it, and that that part of the claim should be struck out, but that Mr. Johnson can claim in respect of enhancement of the value of the pension if the payments had been made.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reasons given by Lord Bingham I would strike out Mr. Johnson's claims for damages for mental distress and anxiety and for aggravated damages.  Accordingly, I would allow Mr. Johnson's appeal and dismiss GW's cross-appeal, save that I would strike out his claim in head 3 for pension payments (or, in the alternative, for the increase in the value of his shareholding if those pension payments had not been made), and for damages for mental distress and anxiety and for aggravated damages.  I would concur in the order for costs proposed by Lord Bingham.</p>
<p><b>LORD MILLETT</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
My noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill has recounted the facts and I need not set them out again at any length.  The Appellant, Mr. Johnson, is an entrepreneur who carried on business through a number of companies which he owned and controlled.  One of them was Westway Homes Limited ("the Company").  Mr. Johnson was its managing director and virtually only shareholder.  The Respondent firm ("the firm") is a firm of solicitors.  Mr. Johnson was in the habit of instructing the firm from time to time to act for him in connection with his personal affairs as well as for his various companies.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1988 the Company held a valuable option to buy land for development.  Mr. Johnson instructed the firm to exercise the option on the Company's behalf.  The firm accepted his instructions and served the appropriate notice, but failed to do so in a manner which was incapable of challenge by the vendor.  The vendor claimed that the option had not been validly exercised, and the Company was obliged to bring proceedings for specific performance against him in the Chancery Division ("the Chancery proceedings").  These were not straightforward, and although the Company was ultimately successful it was unable to obtain title to the land until April 1992, that is to say more than four years after it had exercised the option.  It was awarded damages and costs against the vendor, but these proved to be irrecoverable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The firm's failure to deal with the option in a manner which put its exercise beyond dispute caused the Company substantial loss.  As well as having to bear the costs of the Chancery proceedings, it sustained heavy financial loss as a result of the delay in obtaining title to the land.  This loss was of two kinds.  First, until the Company established its title, it was unable to offer the land as security for its borrowings and so obtain a reduction in the very high interest charges it was paying.  Secondly, delay in obtaining title to the land caused a corresponding delay in the commencement and completion of the development and thus in the time when the Company could hope to realise any profit from the venture.  As it happens, the delay frustrated the development altogether, for the collapse in the property market which took place during the currency of the Chancery proceedings made the venture unprofitable.  But this was obviously not foreseeable in 1988, or Mr. Johnson would not have caused the Company to exercise the option and the vendor would not have resisted its claim to have done so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January 1991 the Company brought proceedings against the firm for professional negligence.  The firm admitted that it had been retained by the Company to exercise the option and that it had owed the Company a duty of care in doing so.  But it denied both liability and quantum.  The action came on for trial in October 1992 and was estimated to last 10-12 days.  In December 1992, after the trial had already lasted for six weeks and evidence was still being given on behalf of the firm, the case was settled upon payment by the firm of £1,480,000 and £320,000 towards the Company's costs.  The sum of £1,480,000 represented the greater part of the damages claimed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Johnson has always claimed that the firm's negligence in the manner in which it exercised the option also caused substantial financial loss to him personally.  In April 1993 he brought his own proceedings against the firm.  This can have come as no surprise.  Mr. Johnson had made no secret of his intention to bring such a claim.  He had indicated as much in January 1991, well before the Company's action came to trial, and his solicitors had been in correspondence with the firm's insurers during 1991-2.  On the eve of the trial his solicitors told those representing the firm that his personal claim would be pursued whether the current proceedings resulted in judgment or settlement.  During the settlement negotiations in December 1992 the parties' respective solicitors discussed the possibility of an overall settlement of both Mr. Johnson's personal claim and the Company's claim, but the paucity of information to enable his personal claim to be quantified made this impossible.  It was left that it was a separate claim which would be a matter for separate negotiation in due course.  In agreeing the terms on which the Company's claim was settled, Mr. Johnson submitted to having most of his personal claim capped at £250,000 excluding interest and costs, and the Company agreed to apply the settlement moneys in the discharge of liabilities of the Company in respect of which Mr. Johnson had given personal guarantees.  This was designed to avoid the possibility of double recovery in respect of these liabilities if Mr. Johnson brought his own proceedings and was successful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the next four and a half years the proceedings brought by Mr. Johnson followed the normal course.  The parties served and  amended their pleadings and exchanged witness statements.  Mr. Johnson served expert evidence.  The firm made a payment into court.  A trial date was obtained.  But then came a sudden change of tack.  The firm instructed fresh Leading Counsel.  In December 1997 the firm's solicitors indicated, for the first time, that it intended to apply <i>inter alia</i> for an order to strike the action out as an abuse of the process of the Court.  In February 1998 the Court ordered the trial of two preliminary issues: (i) whether the proceedings should be struck out as an abuse of the process of the Court; and (ii) to what extent (if at all) and assuming the truth of the facts pleaded the heads of damages pleaded in paragraphs 23 and 24 of the Re-Amended Statement of Claim were irrecoverable by Mr. Johnson as a matter of law by way of damages for the pleaded breaches of duty owed to him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Johnson pleaded his claim in both contract and tort, and alleged that he had retained the firm to act for him personally as well as for the Company in connection with the exercise of the Company's option.  He alleged that the firm had acted negligently in the manner in which it caused the option to be exercised, and that it had from time to time negligently and with unwarranted optimism advised him personally as to the likely duration and outcome of the Chancery proceedings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first question, the Judge (Pumfrey J.) found that the proceedings might well have been an abuse of the process of the Court, but that in the light of the circumstances in which the Company's action had been settled the firm was estopped by convention from contending that they were.  Both parties had acted on the common assumption that Mr. Johnson would bring his own proceedings and that these would be entertained by the Court.  On the second question he ruled that none of the heads of damage pleaded was irrecoverable in law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal (Nourse, Ward and Mantell L.JJ.) allowed the firm's appeal.  It held that there was no excuse for Mr. Johnson's failure to launch his own claims when the Company brought its action.  "If he could have done so", Mantell L.J. said, "he should have done so".  It held that there was no estoppel by convention; the parties shared a common assumption that Mr. Johnson would bring his own proceedings, but they made no assumption one way or the other whether the Court would entertain them; they never thought about the matter.  On the second question the Court differed from the Judge on the authorities, which it agreed were in an unsatisfactory state, but held that, with only one exception, the pleaded heads of damage were arguably recoverable.  Both parties now appeal to the House.  Mr. Johnson appeals on the first question; the firm cross-appeals on the second.</p>
<i></i><p><i><i>Mr. Johnson's appeal: abuse of process.</i></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In describing the proceedings brought by Mr. Johnson as an abuse of the process of the Court, the Court of Appeal was seeking to apply the well-known principle which Sir James Wigram V.-C. formulated in <i>Henderson v Henderson</i> <i>(1843)</i> 3 Hare 100 at p. 114 as follows:</p>
<p></p><ul>". . . I believe I state the rule of the Court correctly when I say that, where a given matter becomes the subject of litigation in, <i>and of adjudication by, </i>a court of competent jurisdiction, the Court requires the parties to that litigation to bring forward their whole case, and will not (except under special circumstances) permit the same parties to open the same subject of litigation in respect of matter which might have been brought forward as part of the subject in contest, but which was not brought forward, only because they have, from negligence, inadvertence, or even accident, omitted part of their case.  <i>The plea of res judicata applies, </i>except in special cases, not only to points upon which the Court was actually required by the parties to form an opinion and pronounce a judgment, but to every point which properly belonged to the subject of litigation, and which the parties, exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time" (my emphasis).<p></p></ul>
