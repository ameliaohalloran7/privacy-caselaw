<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;182.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet these considerations notwithstanding, the Attorney General accepts, as he has throughout this litigation, that the courts are properly seised of this challenge to the 1949 Act, and that the attack upon its validity is in no way foreclosed either by the endorsement upon it of the Speaker's certificate of compliance with the 1911 Act, or by the long passage of time since its enactment, or by its subsequent invocation by both main political parties to enact other legislation too.  Your Lordships must, therefore, cast aside any initial inhibitions about entering upon this unusual challenge.  There is no need here for judicial reticence.  Rather your Lordships must examine the challenge for all the world as if the 1949 Act had only recently received the Royal Assent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;183.&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of the 1949 Act, as several of your Lordships have already made clear, was to amend the terms of the 1911 Act itself.  Its sole purpose, indeed, was to weaken the conditions controlling the use of the 1911 Act.  This it did by reducing from three sessions to two, and from two years to one, the period by which the House of Lords was thereafter able to delay the enactment of legislation promoted by the House of Commons.  The side note to section 2(1) of the 1911 Act, as enacted, described its original purpose as the "Restriction of the powers of the House of Lords as to Bills . . .".  The 1949 Act restricted those powers still further.  That is the long and the short of it.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;184.&nbsp;&nbsp;Was that something which the House of Commons was entitled to achieve by use of the 1911 Act itself?  Was it, in other words, open to the House of Commons to use the 1911 Act (itself of course enacted with the consent of the House of Lords) to overcome the subsequent refusal by the House of Lords in 1949 to consent to the proposed further restriction of their powers?  That is the core question raised in these proceedings. A related question too arises: what, if any, limitations are there upon the use of the 1911 Act to effect constitutional change?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;185.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appellants' objection to the use of the 1911 Act to force through the 1949 Act is an obvious one. Put simply it is this.  Here were the two main constituent elements of Parliament, the House of Commons and the House of Lords (the third, the Monarch, playing only a formal role in the legislative process) agreeing in 1911 to the specific conditions under which the House of Commons would thereafter be able to enact its legislative programme without the consent of the House of Lords.  How could it then be right, thirty-eight years later, for the House of Commons,  without the Lords' consent, to use the 1911 Act procedure to alter those very conditions, making it easier still for future House of Lords' objections to be overridden?  The 1911 Act must be regarded as a "concordat" or "new constitutional settlement" (two of the terms coined by the Court of Appeal below), a consensual arrangement which could not then be changed at the instance of one party only.  And not merely is the point an obvious one; so too are its attractions.  To do as the House of Commons did in 1949 must strike many as quite simply unfair, akin to reneging on a deal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;186.&nbsp;&nbsp;How, then, do the appellants give juridical expression to this central objection to the 1949 Act?  It is their main submission in these proceedings that powers conferred on a body by an enabling Act may not be enlarged or modified by that body unless there are express words authorising such enlargement or modification.  True it is, they must acknowledge, section 2(1) of the 1911 Act refers on its face to "any Public Bill".  But, submits Sir Sydney Kentridge QC, that is not enough: express words were needed to permit the House of Commons to extend its powers still further.  Sometimes (if rarely) legislation contains a Henry VIII clause, a power conferred on a delegate body to amend the enabling Act itself.  But no such clause is to be found in the 1911 Act and without it that Act could not be amended save with the consent of both Houses of Parliament.  The 1911 Act settled the conditions under which in future the House of Commons would be able to override the House of Lords' rejection of its Bills.  Those conditions having been agreed, they could not thereafter be altered save with the further consent of the House of Lords.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;187.&nbsp;&nbsp;Persuasive though I confess to having initially found this argument, I have finally reached the view that it must fail.  Its central plank, the suggested analogy with delegated powers, I now think to be unsustainable.  The 1911 Act was not like a statute by which Parliament as the sovereign legislative body confers, say, regulation-making powers upon a Minister—powers plainly then incapable of enlargement without a Henry VIII clause.  The 1911 Act in truth conferred no further legislative powers upon the House of Commons.  Rather it redefined the sovereign parliament's legislative process by providing in certain circumstances for main legislation without the need for the House of Lords' consent.  Nor was the situation brought about by this re-definition of the legislative process analogous to the establishment of colonial legislatures by an imperial Parliament—the source of much of the case law put before us.  An imperial Parliament conferring powers on a colonial legislature cannot realistically be equated to the House of Lords, under threat in 1911 that enough new Liberal peers would be created to secure the future enactment of the government's Bills, agreeing instead to a weakening of its powers of veto.  The Commonwealth cases were in truth addressed to a very different political reality.  The appellants' main argument must fail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;188.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was, however, as I understood it, a second string to the appellants' bow, Sir Sydney's argument that in any event, even if his principal argument as to the need for express words fails, Parliament cannot have intended the expression "any Public Bill" to be understood to encompass even proposed amendments to the 1911 Act itself so that the expression must be understood as to that extent qualified.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;189.&nbsp;&nbsp;In support of this argument the appellants point to certain extreme possibilities open to the House of Commons if the Attorney General's arguments be right.  Provided only that the 1911 Act procedure was used to achieve it, the House of Commons could have forced through in two years (and, if the 1949 Act is valid, can now force through in one) wholesale amendments to the conditions governing that Act's further use.  For example, the Act could be amended to allow all future Bills to be treated just like money Bills and forced through within one month—see section 1 of the 1911 Act.  Or, indeed, notwithstanding that "a Bill containing any provision to extend the maximum duration of Parliament beyond five years" is on its face excluded from the scope of section 2, that exclusion itself could be removed by amendment and the Act's procedure then be used afresh to extend Parliament's life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;190.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst, therefore, literally construed, the 1911 Act would have permitted its use to amend the very conditions to which that use had been made subject, the court could and should instead construe the phrase "any Public Bill" restrictively so as to guard against such politically unreasonable consequences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;191.&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears to have been this argument which found most favour with the Court of Appeal.  But it was not, of course, accepted in full: the Court of Appeal was not prepared to construe the expression "any Public Bill" in the 1911 Act sufficiently restrictively to preclude any dilution whatever of the conditions governing the Act's future use.  Rather the court held that modest amendments could be forced through but not fundamental ones.  Concluding, however, that the 1949 Act had effected only a modest amendment to the 1911 Act, the appellants' case still failed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;192.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is this argument, of course, which raises the related question mentioned in para 184 above:  what, if any, limitations are there upon the use to which the 1911 Act can be put to effect constitutional change?  The ultimate logic of the Attorney General's argument is that there are no such limitations.  Sir Sydney, for his part, however, must contend that the 1911 Act procedure is certainly not available to abolish the House of Lords: for that would be to destroy the constitutional settlement embodied in the 1911 Act no less completely than any amendment, however fundamental, to the specified conditions governing its use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;193.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not difficult to understand why the Court of Appeal reached the conclusion it did as to the kind of changes achievable by use of the 1911 Act.  And it is easy to understand too why each side rejects that conclusion: Sir Sydney because his argument needs to succeed in full measure; the Attorney General because the Court of Appeal's judgment now casts real doubt over what use can be made of the 1911 Act to effect significant constitutional change in future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;194.&nbsp;&nbsp;In common, I think, with all your Lordships, I would reject the Court of Appeal's approach as unwarranted in law and unworkable in practice.  But in common too, I think, with the majority of your Lordships I am not prepared to give such a ruling as would sanction in advance the use of the 1911 Act for all purposes, for example to abolish the House of Lords, (rather than, say, alter its constitution or method of selection) or to prolong the life of Parliament, two of the extreme ends to which theoretically this procedure could be put.  Although, as I have said, the strict logic of the respondent's position suggests that the express bar on the House of Commons alone extending the life of Parliament could be overcome by a two-stage use of the 1911 Act procedure, the Attorney General acknowledged in argument that the contrary view might have to be preferred.  Let us hope that these issues will never be put to the test.  But if they are, they will certainly deserve fuller argument than time has allowed on the present appeal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;195.&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing, however, remains certain.  There is no proper basis on which a qualification to the wide words "any Public Bill" could be implied into section 2 of the 1911 Act to bar its use to achieve the particular amendments effected by the 1949 Act.  It is unnecessary to resort to Hansard to conclude that both Houses of Parliament must inevitably have recognised in 1911 the real possibility that that Act's procedure would thereafter be used to amend itself.  I too, therefore, would dismiss this appeal.</p>
