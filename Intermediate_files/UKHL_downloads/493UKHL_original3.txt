<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66. It is, therefore, not surprising to find that Article 19(1) of Regulation 3821/85 provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Member states shall, in good time and after consulting the Commission, adopt such laws, regulations or administrative provisions as may be necessary for the implementation of this Regulation.  Such measures shall cover, inter alia, the reorganisation of, procedure for, and means of carrying out, checks on compliance and the penalties to be imposed in case of breach." <p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;67. European Community Regulations have, in general, a direct effect in member states.  But there is, in my opinion, no reason in principle why a provision contained in a Regulation should not be so framed as to invite, or require, individual member states to bring into effect domestic legislation to implement the provision in question.  Regulation 3821 does not contain provision for any criminal sanctions for breach of its provisions.  It has been common ground before your Lordships that provisions for offences and penalties must be made by the domestic legislation contemplated by article 19(1).  The article expressly contemplates, also, domestic legislation relating to checks on compliance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;68. But the express references in article 19(1) to these matters are prefaced by the words "inter alia".  So it is quite clear that the scope of the domestic legislation contemplated by the article is not limited to the matters expressly referred to.  It is a reasonable conclusion, therefore, that one of the things that article 19(1) left it open to member states to provide by supplementary domestic legislation is the detail that the second sentence of article 14(2) so notably omitted.  In the framing of any supplementary domestic legislation a margin of appreciation must be permitted to each member state.  Provided the domestic legislation establishes a regulatory system consistent with the express provisions of Regulation 3821 it is, in my opinion, franked by article 19(1).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;69. Part VI of the Transport Act 1968 established, among other things, a United Kingdom regulatory system for passenger vehicles and goods vehicles that predated by many years the tachograph requirements imposed by Regulation 3820/85.  The domestic legislation contemplated by article 19(1) of Regulation 3821/85 took the form, so far as the United Kingdom was concerned, of amendments to Part VI of the 1968 Act.  The amendments were added by the Community Drivers' Hours and Recording Equipment Regulations 1986 (SI 1986 No 1457).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70. Part VI of the 1968 Act, as amended, commences with a statement of the purpose of the regulatory system:</p>
<p></p><ul>"95(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;This Part of this Act shall have effect with a view to securing the observance of proper hours or periods of work by persons engaged in the carriage of passengers or goods by road and thereby protecting the public against the risks which arise in cases where the drivers of motor vehicles are suffering from fatigue . . . ."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;71. The relevant operative provisions are to be found in section 99, headed "Inspection of records and other documents".  Section 99, as amended, provides, as far as relevant to tachograph records:</p>
<p></p><ul>"(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;An officer may, on production if so required of his authority, require any person to produce, and permit him to inspect and copy—<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>. . . . <p></p></ul>
(bb) <p></p><ul>any record sheet which that person is required by article 14(2) of the Community Recording Equipment Regulation [3821/85/EEC] to retain or by article 15(7) of that Regulation to be able to produce;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>and that record sheet . . . shall, if the officer so requires by notice in writing served on that person, be produced at the office of the traffic commissioner specified in the notice within such time (not being less than 10 days) from the service of the notice as may be so specified.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;An officer may, on production if so required of his authority—<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;at any time, enter any vehicle to which this Part of this Act applies and inspect that vehicle and any recording equipment installed in it and inspect and copy any record sheet on the vehicle on which a record has been produced by means of the equipment or an entry has been made;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;at any time which is reasonable having regard to the circumstances of the case, enter any premises on which he has reason to believe that such a vehicle is kept or that any such record sheets . . . as are mentioned in subsection (1) of this section are to be found, and inspect any such vehicle, and inspect and copy any such record sheet . . . which he finds there.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>. . . <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;Any person who—<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;fails to comply with any requirement under subsection (1) of this section; or<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;obstructs an officer in the exercise of his powers under subsection (2) or (3) of this section,<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>. . . <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;Any person who makes, or causes to be made, any record or entry on a record sheet kept or carried for the purposes of the Community Recording Equipment Regulation or section 97 of this Act or any entry in a book, register or document kept or carried for the purposes of regulations under section 98 thereof or the applicable Community rules which he knows to be false or, with intent to deceive, alters or causes to be altered any such record or entry shall be liable—<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding [the prescribed sum];<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;If an officer has reason to believe that an offence under subsection (5) of this section has been committed in respect of any record or document inspected by him under this section, he may seize that record or document; and where a record or document is seized as aforesaid and within six months of the date on which it was seized no person has been charged since that date with an offence in relation to that record or document under that subsection and the record or document has not been returned to the person from whom it was taken, a magistrates' court shall, on an application made for the purpose by that person or by an officer, make such order respecting the disposal of the record or document and award such costs as the justice of the case may require.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>. . . <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(10)&nbsp;&nbsp;In this section references to the inspection and copying of any record produced by means of equipment installed for the purposes of section 97 of this Act in a vehicle include references to the application to the record of any process for eliciting the information recorded thereby and to taking down the information elicited from it."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72. Subsections (1) to (9) of section 99 as originally enacted were brought into force on 1 March 1970: Transport Act 1968 (Commencement No 6) Order 1970 (SI 1970 No 259).  Oddly, subsection (10) has never been brought into force.  This is, presumably, an oversight.  Nonetheless the contents of subsection (10) can properly be used as an aid to construction of the other provisions of the section that refer to inspection and copying.  Parliament enacted the section as a whole, and it is as a whole that it should be read and construed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73. The issue before your Lordships arises out of a prosecution of the appellant defendant, Cantabrica Coach Holdings Ltd, for an offence under section 99(4)(a).  The facts can be very shortly stated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74. The defendant is a licensed coach operator and, accordingly, under an obligation to comply with Part VI of the 1968 Act.  On 15 September and again on 1 October 1998 an official of the Vehicle Inspectorate attended the defendant's office and requested permission to remove all the defendant's tachograph record sheets in respect of August 1998.  The defendant was willing to produce the sheets and allow the officer to inspect them at the defendant's office.  The defendant was not willing to allow the officer to remove them from the office.  Since, on each occasion, the officer's purpose in attending the defendant's office had been to take away the record sheets, in view of the defendant's refusal to allow this the officer withdrew, and the sheets were, in the event, not produced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75. On 29 January 1999 the defendant was charged in the Watford Magistrates' Court with an offence under section 99(4)(a).  The Information said that the defendant "when asked by an authorised officer to hand over tachograph charts . . . failed to do so contrary to section 99(1)(bb) and 4(a) of the Transport Act 1968".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76. The information was not, in my opinion, strictly accurate.  The defendant had been agreeable to handing over the record sheets so as to enable them to be inspected by the officer at the defendant's office, but had not been willing to hand them over so as to enable the officer to take them away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77. On 10 May 1999 the defendant was convicted by the magistrates.  The conviction was recorded as a conviction for having "failed to produce a record sheet which you were required by article 14(2) of the Community Recording Equipment Regulation [3821/85/EEC] to retain.  Contrary to section 99(4) of the Transport Act 1968 as amended."  This, too, was in my opinion inaccurate.  The defendant's failure was a failure to permit the officer to take the records away.  It was not a failure to produce them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78. The magistrates were requested by the defendant to state a case for the Divisional Court.  The case stated posed the following question for the opinion of the High Court:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Whether an offence under section 99(1)(bb) and 99(4)(a) of the Transport Act 1968 is committed by a refusal on the defendant's part to hand over tachograph records to an authorised officer of the Vehicle Inspectorate upon request in circumstances where:<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;the records are ready and available for production to the officer;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;the officer refuses to accept production (and inspection) at the defendant's premises of the records but requires them to be handed over there and then for the officer to take away;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;the officer has no reason to believe an offence under section 99(5) of the Act has been committed in respect of any record or document inspected by him?"<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79. The magistrates posed also the question whether they were right to conclude on the evidence before them that the defendant had committed an offence in failing to hand over the tachograph records.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80. The reference in the second question to the evidence is important.  The facts found by the magistrates were set out in six short subparagraphs of paragraph 2 of the case stated.  Subparagraphs (a) and (b) relate to the status of the official who visited the defendant's premises and the status of the defendant.  Nothing turns on them.  It is necessary, however, for me to set out the other four subparagraphs:</p>
<p></p><ul>"(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;The senior traffic examiner attended the defendant's company office on Thursday 1 October 1998 and met with the fleet manager, Mr Evans, and the general manager, Mr Collins, and requested permission to remove the tachograph charts in respect of August 1998; having previously made an appointment for the meeting.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;Permission for removal was refused by the fleet manager, Mr Evans.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;The defendant company was prepared to allow the officer to inspect the tachograph charts at their offices.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;The tachograph charts for August 1998 were never produced for inspection or handed over to the Inspectorate."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81. These four subparagraphs show, it is said, that an offence under sections 99(1)(bb) and (4)(a) of the 1968 Act had been committed.  It is important to notice, however, that there was no finding at all about copying;  there was no finding as to whether reasonable facilities for inspection of the records or for copying the records existed at the defendant's offices;  there was no finding as to the purpose of the Inspectorate in wanting to remove the records.  Your Lordships were told by counsel for the Inspectorate, Mr Plender QC, that the purpose was to subject the records to inspection by technologically advanced equipment located at the Inspectorate's own offices.  But the magistrates made no finding about this.  Your Lordships do not know, and there is nothing to suggest that the magistrates knew, whether it would have been practicable for the Inspectorate to have brought the equipment to the defendant's office and operated it there.  There is nothing to show that the defendant was told about the reason why the Inspectorate deemed it necessary, or desirable, to remove the records for inspection at their own office.  There is nothing to indicate for how long the Inspectorate might have needed to retain the records or that any indication about the duration of the retention was given to the defendant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82. On the bare facts as found by the magistrates, the question posed for the Divisional Court was a very stark one:  Is an offence committed simply by an operator's refusal to permit an inspector to remove tachograph records and without regard to whether the request was in the circumstances a reasonable one?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83. Mr Plender's response was that the law provides, by way of judicial review proceedings, a remedy for unreasonable behaviour by officials.  I think that this response is correct.  But its implications need to be followed through.  A remedy in judicial review proceedings for an unreasonable request by an inspector for the removal of documents would have to be based on the premise that the request was in the circumstances an unlawful one in that it went beyond the power conferred by the statute.  In that event the operator would have no obligation to comply with the request and an offence would not be committed by his refusal to comply with it.  It must, therefore, in principle be open to an operator charged with failing to comply with a request made under section 99(1)(bb) to contend that the request was in all the circumstances an unreasonable one.  It does not appear, however, that the defendant did so contend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84. The submissions made, both to your Lordships and in the Divisional Court, about the correct construction to be placed on section 99(1)(bb) of the 1968 Act did not mention at all the need that an inspector's request should not be one that in the circumstances was unreasonable.  Mr Phillips QC, for the defendant, simply submitted that the vehicle operator did not have to comply with a request that the inspector be permitted to remove the records for inspection and copying elsewhere.  If inspection at the Inspectorate's offices was desired, the inspector had to serve a notice of not less than 10 days requiring the vehicle operator to produce the records at the office of the traffic commissioner.  Otherwise, the only obligation placed on the operator was to permit inspection and copying at its own premises.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85. Mr Plender, for the Inspectorate, submitted that section 99(1)(bb) obliged the operator to permit the inspector to remove the records for inspection and copying elsewhere whenever the inspector desired to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86. The Divisional Court [2000] RTR 286 preferred the construction contended for by the Inspectorate, and concluded, at p 304, that "the operator is required to produce and hand over tachograph record sheets on demand at the operator's premises if such a request is made of him" and that "it is within the discretion of the authorised officer whether he chooses to inspect the tachograph sheets at the operator's premises . . . or take the sheets away for more thorough and detailed analysis" (paragraph 36 of Butterfield J's judgment).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87. While the basic approach to construction of Mr Plender is, in my opinion, to be preferred to that of Mr Phillips, Mr Plender's approach omits the limiting requirement that the inspector's request must not be an unreasonable one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88. Section 99(1) starts by saying that "An officer may . . . require any person to produce, and permit him to inspect and copy" the various documents specified.  It is important to notice that this language does not give the officer any positive right other than to make a request.  It places an obligation on the recipient of the request to comply with it.  Failure to comply is an offence under subsection (4)(a).  The officer's request, and the operator's consequent obligation, has two elements to it.  First, the request is for production of the documents.  So the operator must produce them.  Second, the request is for permission to inspect and copy the documents.  So the operator must permit the officer to do so.  As to production of the documents, the operator must be allowed a reasonable time for compliance.  What constitutes a reasonable time will depend upon the content of the request.  Many requests for production of documents could reasonably be expected to be complied with then and there.  In respect of others, some time for compliance might be necessary.  This was not a problem in the present case where the original request was made on 15 September 1998 and the repeat of the request took place on 1 October.  The intervening period of two weeks was plainly ample for the August 1998 tachograph records to have been collected and produced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89. The request to be permitted to inspect and copy the records may present more difficulty.  Both inspection and copying require facilities.  The facilities may be available at the operator's premises or they may not.  The equipment necessary for the inspection and copying, if not already available at the operator's premises, may or may not be able to be brought there.  The statutory obligation on the operator to "permit" the officer to inspect and copy must require the officer to be given a reasonable opportunity to inspect and copy.  What constitutes a reasonable opportunity will depend on the circumstances of the case and the content of the particular request.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90. The memorandum of conviction in the present case was drafted on the footing that a failure to permit records to be taken away constituted a failure "to produce".  This, in my opinion, was an error.  A failure to allow documents to be taken away for inspection and copying may constitute a failure to permit inspection and copying, but does not constitute a failure to produce, particularly where production for inspection on site is offered to the inspector but refused by him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91. Ordinarily, the obligation placed by section 99(1) on an operator "to produce" the records is, in my opinion discharged by their production at the operator's own premises.  But the final four lines of section 99(1), referred to in argument as the "coda", prescribes an alternative form of production if the requisite notice is given by the authorised officer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92. In the submissions to your Lordships both counsel tended to attribute to the word "produced" in the coda a different meaning to that of the word "produce" in the opening lines.  In my opinion there is no difference in meaning.  Both require the documents to be produced in the sense of being made physically available to the inspector.  The only difference is as to the place where this is to happen.  But, whether the production is at the operator's premises or at the traffic commissioner's office, the obligation on the operator to permit inspection and copying still applies.  The coda prescribes a different place for the production but there apart the obligations placed on the person who is to produce the documents are the same.  A reasonable opportunity for the inspector to inspect and copy must be afforded him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93. In summary, section 99(1) on its correct construction requires, in my opinion, that the vehicle operator provide the inspector with a reasonable opportunity to inspect and copy the tachograph records that under article 14(2) of Regulation 3821/85 the operator is required to retain.  A reasonable opportunity may require the inspector to be allowed to remove the records in order to subject them to examination by equipment located elsewhere.  Subsection (10) makes clear that inspection need not be confined to visual inspection.  But if the inspection and copying can be carried out at the operator's premises, if the removal of the records would have a disruptive effect on the operator's business, if the equipment in question can be taken to the operator's premises and operated there without too much difficulty, it may be that the request to be allowed to remove the records for inspection and copying will be an unreasonable one.  If that is so, for those or any other reasons that may apply in a particular case, the operator will, in my opinion, have no obligation to comply with the unreasonable request for the removal of the records.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94. This construction of section 99(1) seems to me consistent with the other subsections.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95. Subsection (2) gives a positive right to an inspector (i) to enter a vehicle and (ii) to enter premises in order to inspect a vehicle and to inspect and copy any records which he finds in the vehicle or the premises.  These rights of inspection and copying are independent of any permission granted by the operator and, in my opinion, would permit the officer to take away the records if it were reasonably necessary for him to do so for the purpose of inspection or copying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96. Subsection (6) confers on an inspector a positive right to seize records or other documents he has inspected under the section if he has reason to believe they have been falsified.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97. The construction accords also with the second sentence of article 14(2).  Article 14(2) requires the records to be "produced or handed over".  One of the unsatisfactory features of the present case, to my mind, is that the verb 'hand over' has been given an extended meaning so as to cover the taking away of the documents and that the verb 'produce' has been given an extended meaning so as to cover the inspection of the documents.  In my opinion these verbs should be confined to their ordinary meaning.  A document is "produced" to an inspector if it is physically presented to him.  A document is "handed over" to an inspector if it is placed for the time being in his possession.  Section 99(1) provides expressly for the production of documents to an inspector and, unless the documents are handed over to the inspector, he cannot very well inspect or copy them.  Neither article 14(2) nor section 99(1) provides any express right for an officer to take away elsewhere documents that have been handed to him for inspection and copying. But subsection (1), in my opinion, requires the operator to permit him to do so, and subsection (2) allows him to do so, unless the officer's decision to take them away is an unreasonable decision in all the circumstances. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98. It appears that, at the trial before the magistrates, neither the appellant nor the Inspectorate directed itself to the reasonableness or otherwise of the inspector's request to be allowed to take the records away in order to subject them to examination at the Inspectorate's own offices.  In my opinion, if an operator charged with an offence under sections 99(1)(bb) and 99(4)(a) wishes to contend that the officer's decision to take away the records for inspection and copying elsewhere was in all the circumstances an unreasonable one, it is for him to say so.  And I think the officer must then be prepared to explain, why the removal of the documents was thought necessary.  That explanation and its adequacy can then be tested.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99. It has been made clear to your Lordships that this is a test case, brought to determine the extent of the obligations cast on vehicle operators by section 99(1)(bb) and of the corresponding legitimate expectations of the Inspectorate.  In striking the balance between an effective regulatory system on the one hand and the interests of vehicle operators in being free of excessive intrusion by officials on the other, the key, in my opinion, is the reasonable requirements of the officials whose duty it is to monitor the regulatory system.   Section 99  contemplates, in my view, that, in general, the inspection and copying should take place where the records are produced and handed over, i e at the operator's premises or, after the requisite notice, at the traffic commissioner's office.  If, however, it is not reasonably practicable in the circumstances for the inspection and copying to take place at the operator's premises, the operator should, in my opinion, permit the records to be taken away for the purpose of inspection and copying elsewhere.  On a prosecution under section 99(4)(a), or for that matter, section 99(4)(b), where the gravamen of the charge is that the operator has not permitted, or has hindered, the removal of the documents, the operator cannot, in my opinion, be convicted if the request to be permitted to remove them was so unreasonable as to be unlawful. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100. It follows that I would deal with the first question posed in the case stated by answering that an offence would be committed in the postulated circumstances unless the request to be permitted to remove the records for inspection and copying to take place elsewhere than at the appellant's premises were unreasonable in all the circumstances.  For the purposes of this answer, "inspection" of a record includes "the application to the record of any process for eliciting the information recorded thereby and . . . taking down the information elicited from it": see section 99(10).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101. As to the second question, I would reply that, on the facts found as recorded in the case stated and in the absence of any contention that the officer's request to be allowed to remove the documents for inspection elsewhere was an unreasonable one, the justices were right to convict.</p>
