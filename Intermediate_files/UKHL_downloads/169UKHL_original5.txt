<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105.&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, by a combination of these provisions, the Scottish Ministers have to exercise their functions under rule 80 of the Prison Rules in a way that is compatible with any relevant Convention rights, including any article 7 and 8 Convention rights.  If they do otherwise, their purported exercise of their functions is ultra vires.  As indeed the parties and intervener all agree.</p>
<i><p><i>The First Issue</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106.&nbsp;&nbsp;The petitions for judicial review are drafted on the basis that both the HRA and the Scotland Act are in play where a decision of the Scottish Ministers is challenged as being incompatible with a Convention right.  Nevertheless, both in the First Division and before your Lordships' House, counsel for the appellants argued that, since the Scotland Act was a discrete constitutional Act applying to the Scottish Parliament and Executive, the Scotland Act alone applied to the functions of the Scottish Ministers.  The Scotland Act was, in effect, a lex specialis which superseded the lex generalis, the HRA, so far as the Scottish Ministers were concerned.  So any challenge to the Scottish Ministers' exercise of their functions as being incompatible with Convention rights had to be brought under the Scotland Act rather than under the HRA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107.&nbsp;&nbsp;The First Division rejected that argument.  They were right to do so.  There can be no doubt that the Scottish Ministers are a public authority in terms of section 6(3) of the HRA and that, accordingly, under section 6(1) it is unlawful for them to act in a way that is incompatible with a Convention right.  If the Ministers' decisions on the segregation of the appellants were indeed incompatible with the appellants' Convention rights, under section 6(1) the Ministers acted unlawfully in taking them.  Equally, as already explained, under the Scotland Act, if the decisions were incompatible with the appellants' Convention rights, the Ministers acted ultra vires in purporting to take those decisions.  Both Acts would apply in the circumstances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, at any time before the time-limit in section 7(5) cuts in, a person who claims that the Scottish Ministers have exercised their statutory functions in a way that is incompatible with any of his Convention rights can raise proceedings on either of two bases.  He can proceed on the basis that the Scottish Ministers' act or failure to act was unlawful in terms of the HRA or on the basis that, by virtue of the Scotland Act, their act or failure to act in the purported exercise of their functions was ultra vires.  Indeed, there is no need for him to choose one basis rather than the other.  He can put his case in both ways.  Even if he chooses to stick to the HRA, however, the question whether the Scottish Ministers' act or failure to act in the purported exercise of their functions was incompatible with any of the Convention rights will still be a devolution issue in terms of para 1(d) of Schedule 6 to the Scotland Act.  The procedural regime in the Schedule will apply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Scottish Ministers accept all that.  But with a caveat.  They say that damages are different.  If the person concerned wishes the court to grant him relief against the Ministers in the shape of damages for the violation of his Convention rights, then he must make that claim under section 8 of the HRA in proceedings brought within the time allowed by section 7(5).  A court has no power, they argue, to award damages for the violation of his Convention rights by virtue of the Scotland Act.  There is, accordingly, no possibility of using proceedings based on the Scotland Act to obtain damages when the time for making a claim against the Ministers for damages under the HRA has passed.  This is said to make sense since the two Acts are intended to work together, not in conflict with one another.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, the argument would be compelling if the time-limit in section 7(5) applied only to claims for damages under the HRA or else if the Scotland Act contained an equivalent of section 7(5), limiting the time within which proceedings could be brought against the Scottish Ministers to challenge the vires of their acts or of their exercise of their functions.  Parliament did not frame the legislation in either of these ways, however.  It chose instead to make the two Acts work differently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 7(1)(a) of the HRA a person who claims that a public authority has acted in a way which is made unlawful by section 6(1) may bring proceedings against the authority under the Act in any appropriate court or tribunal.  The proceedings are described by reference to what the person bringing them says about the way in which the public authority has acted, not by reference to the remedy which he seeks.  If a breach of Convention rights is established, the court or tribunal will find that the act of the public authority was unlawful.  It may then grant the relief that it considers just and appropriate:  section 8(1).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112.&nbsp;&nbsp;The time-limit relating to section 7(1)(a) proceedings in section 7(5) is purely procedural.  As is apparent from both section 7(1)(b) and section 7(5)(b), an unlawful act remains unlawful even after the twelve-month limit for taking proceedings under section 7(1)(a) has expired.  Moreover, the time-limit applies to all proceedings of the kind described in section 7(1)(a), irrespective of the nature of the relief which is sought or which the court may eventually decide should be granted.  So, if a petitioner wishes to bring judicial review proceedings against the Scottish Ministers under the HRA, he must raise those proceedings within the twelve-month period.  That limit applies, irrespective of whether he seeks a mere declarator that the relevant decision was unlawful, reduction of the decision, interdict against the Ministers taking a similar decision in future, or damages under section 8.  The remedy of damages under section 8 is therefore simply one of a number of possible forms of relief that the court may grant against the Scottish Ministers in the proceedings that must be brought within the period allowed by section 7(5).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113.&nbsp;&nbsp;By contrast, the Scotland Act contains no time-limit within which a petitioner or pursuer, who claims that the Scottish Ministers acted in a way that was ultra vires, must bring any proceedings against them.  So someone may bring proceedings for judicial review on the ground that a decision of the Ministers was beyond their competence under the Scotland Act because it was incompatible with his Convention rights at a time when, by reason of section 7(5), he could not bring judicial review proceedings of the same decision under the HRA.  If the court found in favour of the petitioner, it could then grant a decree of declarator, decree of reduction and decree for interdict, as appropriate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike in England, where judicial review proceedings generally have to be started within three months, in Scotland there is no fixed time-limit.  Nevertheless, proceedings should be brought promptly.  If they are not, the court may exercise its discretion to refuse judicial review where that is appropriate, having regard to the public interest in public authorities and third parties not being kept in suspense as to the legal validity of a decision for any longer than is absolutely necessary in fairness to the person affected by it.  See the opinion of the First Division in <i>King v East Ayrshire Council </i>1998 SC 182, 196, referring to the speech of Lord Diplock in <i>O'Reilly v Mackman </i>[1983] 2 AC 237, 280H-281A.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115.&nbsp;&nbsp;The upshot is that, in enacting the two statutes, Parliament has not imposed the same time-limit on proceedings by reference to the Scotland Act as on proceedings under the HRA.  In enacting the Scotland Act, Parliament may well have thought that it would be bad policy to cut off the right to bring proceedings based on violations of Convention rights, while allowing proceedings based on other, more technical, grounds to go ahead.  In any event, it is not for the courts to second-guess Parliament's quite deliberate decision to frame the two statutes differently in this respect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116.&nbsp;&nbsp;The First Division came to a very different conclusion.  On the basis that the HRA and the Scotland Act are to be regarded as closely interdependent, they held, 2007 SC 140, 168, para 55, that:</p>
<p></p><ul>"it is right and proper to conclude that Parliament, in the absence of some compelling reason to the contrary, intended that section 7(5) should apply to limit in terms of time proceedings where a devolution issue arose as well as those where none arose."<p></p></ul>
<p>As they went on to make clear, what they meant was that Parliament intended section 7(5) to apply to limit the time for bringing proceedings with reference to the vires limits in the Scotland Act as well as proceedings under the HRA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117.&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot agree.  Contrary to what their Lordships say, nothing in the relationship between the two Acts would make it "right" or "proper" to conclude that section 7(5) of the HRA should apply to limit any proceedings other than the proceedings which Parliament has chosen, very deliberately, to make it limit.  The First Division's construction flies in the face of the words which Parliament used in enacting section 7(5).  By its express terms, section 7(5) of the HRA applies only to the proceedings "under this Act" specified in subsection (1)(a) - not even to the other cases described in subsection (1)(b).  Given its express terms, section 7(5) cannot possibly apply by implication to other proceedings - least of all, to proceedings brought by reference to a vires limit contained in another Act.  In short, there is absolutely nothing in section 7(5) or any other provision of the HRA, or in any provision of the Scotland Act, which applies the time-limit in section 7(5) to proceedings brought against the Scottish Ministers by reference to the Convention right vires limit in the Scotland Act.  The point does not bear elaboration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not surprisingly, counsel for the Scottish Ministers did not adopt this aspect of the decision of the First Division.  On the contrary, Mr Moynihan accepted that, after the time-limit for proceedings under the HRA had expired, proceedings could be brought for, say, declarator that the Ministers' decisions were ultra vires under the Scotland Act because they were incompatible with Convention rights.  Where appropriate, the court could also grant decree of reduction.  His argument was simply that, because the only vehicle for getting damages for an infringement of Convention rights was proceedings under the HRA, once the time for such proceedings had expired, a prisoner who had been the victim of any infringement could not obtain damages, even though he could obtain the other remedies by reference to the Scotland Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119.&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed Mr Moynihan also accepted that, where appropriate, other private law remedies would still be open where the Scottish Ministers had exercised their functions in a way that was incompatible with someone's Convention rights.  For instance, if they were to institute a charge for some service which only women had to pay, this would involve discrimination on the ground of sex and would be incompatible with article 14.  A woman who had been obliged to pay the charge could bring proceedings to have it declared ultra vires under the Scotland Act - even if the charge had been levied more than a year before.  If she was successful, then at any time within the appropriate prescriptive period she could obtain repetition of the sum that she had paid, on the ground that the Scottish Ministers had been unjustly enriched.  The common law would provide that remedy in the circumstances.  But the court could not give her damages, even if, according to the Strasbourg jurisprudence, damages would be necessary to afford her just satisfaction for, say, her distress in having her Convention right violated in this way.  She could only get the, ex hypothesi necessary, damages by raising proceedings under a different Act with a different time-limit.  I am unable to see what policy objective would be served by a limping arrangement of this kind.  A time-limit cutting off all proceedings for a violation of Convention rights after twelve months would make sense;  a time-limit cutting off only one remedy for that violation makes no sense at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120.&nbsp;&nbsp;The crux of this aspect of the case is section 100 of the Scotland Act which provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;This Act does not enable a person -<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;to bring any proceedings in a court or tribunal on the ground that an act is incompatible with the Convention rights, or <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;to rely on any of the Convention rights in any such proceedings, unless he would be a victim for the purposes of Article 34 of the Convention (within the meaning of the Human Rights Act 1998) if proceedings in respect of the act were brought in the European Court of Human Rights.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection (1) does not apply to the Lord Advocate, the Advocate General, the Attorney General or the Attorney General for Northern Ireland.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;This Act does not enable a court or tribunal to award any damages in respect of an act which is incompatible with any of the Convention rights which it could not award if section 8(3) and (4) of the Human Rights Act 1998 applied.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;In this section 'act' means -<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;making any legislation,<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;any other act or failure to act, if it is the act or failure of a member of the Scottish Executive."<p></p></ul>
<p>In <i>R v HM Advocate </i>2003 SC (PC) 21 I analysed the language of section 100.  That analysis was not necessary for the decision in the case.  The First Division were therefore entitled to depart from it.  Which they did, holding that my construction of the section was erroneous:  2007 SC 140, 176, para 76.  Rather than provide any competing detailed analysis of section 100, their Lordships contented themselves with saying, 2007 SC 140, 168-169, para 56:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Section 100, properly construed, clearly has a purpose.  Its purpose is to ensure that in proceedings in which a devolution issue is raised (1) the victim test is generally applied to the issue of title and interest to sue, (2) the Law Officers do not require to satisfy the victim test and (3) that, in proceedings in which damages are awarded, the fact that the act in question is <i>ultra vires</i> by reason of section 57(2) does not avoid the requirement that the court or tribunal apply to its assessment the just satisfaction test of European jurisprudence.  The purpose of section 100 is, in our view, plain and that purpose is not, with respect to the members of the Judicial Committee who took a contrary view, the purpose favoured by them."<p></p></ul>
<p>Later their Lordships summarised their conclusion on section 100 in this way, 2007 SC 140, 177, para 80:</p>
<p></p><ul>"There is nothing unacceptable about a claimant seeking to raise proceedings under section 7 of the Human Rights Act, and seeking the remedies, including just satisfaction damages, provided for in section 8, provided at the same time he also follows the procedural requirements applicable to a devolution issue.  On that view, there is no need to look for a basis for a claim for damages in the Scotland Act.  Section 100 can be given its natural negative meaning, rather than be distorted into an implied positive assertion of a right to claim damages.  Its purpose is the limited one of making clear, <i>ob majorem cautelam</i>, that the Scotland Act cannot be used as a way of getting round the Human Rights Act requirements (1) that claimants should demonstrate victim status (subsection (1)), and (2) that damages be confined to just satisfaction (subsection (3))."<p></p></ul>
<p>Here too, while saying that section 100 has been "distorted", they do not themselves address and analyse the language of the section.  Without such an analysis, it is impossible to determine the meaning and purpose of the provision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121.&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to the end of the hearing of this appeal, I deliberately refrained from re-reading what I said about section 100 in <i>R v HM Advocate</i>.  Having now read it through in the light of counsel's submissions, I am not persuaded that my interpretation distorted the meaning of the section.  Nevertheless, I think it right to add some further remarks on the section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122.&nbsp;&nbsp;As the side-note indicates, section 100 relates to human rights only.  Subsection (1) does not pose any real difficulties of interpretation but is nevertheless significant for the argument.  Subsection (1) is cast in a negative form.  It explains what the Scotland Act does not enable a person to do, i e, bring proceedings on the ground that an act is incompatible with the Convention rights or to rely on any of them unless he would be a victim for the purposes of Article 34 "if proceedings in respect of the act were brought in the European Court of Human Rights."  Clearly, however, subsection (1) presupposes that the provisions of the Scotland Act relating to incompatibility with Convention rights do enable proceedings to be brought - so long as the pursuer or petitioner qualifies as a victim.  The First Division accept that.  Indeed counsel for the Scottish Ministers rather swept the implication aside as being too obvious to be worth mentioning.  Subsection (1) serves to limit the class of persons who are enabled to bring the proceedings.  To see whether he can bring proceedings, the person concerned has to engage in a hypothetical exercise.  He has to imagine that he had brought proceedings in respect of the same act in Strasbourg and decide whether, in that event, he would be a victim under article 34 of the Convention.  Unless he would, the Act does not enable him to bring proceedings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas subsection (1) deals with who is not enabled to bring proceedings, subsection (3) deals with what damages a court or tribunal is not enabled to award.  Again the provision is cast in the negative and refers to a hypothetical situation.  This time the court must put itself in the situation in which section 8(3) and (4) of the HRA apply.  That is, ex hypothesi, a situation where the court is considering whether to award damages in respect of an act that is incompatible with any of the Convention rights.  The exercise of envisaging that situation only makes sense if, in its actual situation, the court is considering whether or not it is enabled to award damages for an act that is incompatible with Convention rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;124.&nbsp;&nbsp;According to section 100(3), the Scotland Act does not enable the court to award damages in respect of an incompatible act which it could not award under section 8(3) and (4) of the HRA.  This tells the court two things, as a domestic example shows.  If you tell a French girl visiting you on an exchange that she cannot go to a club if her parents would not allow her to go to a similar club in France, you tell her two things:  first, that she cannot go to the club if her parents would not permit her to do so in similar circumstances in France;  but, secondly, that she can go to the club if they would permit it.  Similarly, section 100(3) tells the court both what the Act does not enable it to do and what it does enable it to do.  The court cannot award damages if it could not award them under section 8(3) and (4);  but also the court can award damages if it could award them in respect of the act in question under section 8(3) and (4).  The structure of subsections (1) and (3) is so similar that the First Division and Scottish Ministers cannot, consistently, draw the plain inference from the wording of subsection (1) but refuse to draw it from the wording of subsection (3).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125.&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the First Division, the purpose of section 100(3) is to make clear, ob majorem cautelam, that the Scotland Act cannot be used as a way of getting round the HRA requirement that damages be confined to just satisfaction.  But if that were the purpose of subsection (3), Parliament need only have said that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Act does not enable any damages to be awarded in respect of an act which is incompatible with any of the Convention rights.  The actual wording is much more subtle.  Indeed, leaving other matters aside, the First Division's interpretation is objectionable precisely because it makes this carefully drafted provision superfluous:  on their reading, it exists merely to tell someone suing for damages under the Human Rights Act what that Act already tells him loud and clear - that he cannot get more than section 8(3) and (4) allow.  Why stop there?  Why not also "make clear" that the Scotland Act cannot be used to get round the limitation in section 8(2) of the HRA?  Indeed - on the First Division's approach - why not "make clear" that the Scotland Act cannot be used to get round section 7(5)?  The possibilities for "making clear" are endless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;126.&nbsp;&nbsp;The interpretation of section 100(3) proposed by the Scottish Ministers and interveners is equally problematical.  They suppose a case, for example, where the Scottish Ministers did something to you or your property which would constitute a delict if not authorised by a statutory provision.  If that statutory provision is held to be ultra vires by reason of being incompatible with Convention rights, you can sue the Ministers for the delict.  I assume, for the sake of the argument, that the analysis is correct.  The Ministers then contend that the purpose of section 100(3) is to cap your right to damages for the delict at the amount which could be recovered by way of damages under section 8(3) and (4) of the HRA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;127.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, that construction would pervert the purpose of section 8(3) and (4):  the subsections do not exist to cap other remedies, but to give the court the power to grant further relief by way of damages, if but only if that is necessary to afford just satisfaction.  In other words, section 8(3) presupposes that all the other remedies provided by statute or the common law (including, if appropriate, the law of delict) are available and then allows the court to give an additional remedy by way of damages where that is necessary to afford just satisfaction.  As Lord Bingham of Cornhill observed in <i>R (Greenfield) v Home Secretary </i>[2005] 1 WLR 673, 684, para 19, the HRA "is not a tort statute."  So the damages that a court can award under section 8 have nothing to do with tort or delict:  as section 8(6) says, they are damages for the unlawful act of the public authority.  There is therefore no conceivable reason why section 8(3) or (4) should impinge on any damages for tort or delict that the court would otherwise award.  Equally, there is no warrant for interpreting section 100(3) of the Scotland Act as imposing a restriction on any common law remedy of damages for delict that section 8(3) and (4) of the HRA would not impose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;128.&nbsp;&nbsp;When enacting the Scotland Act, Parliament foresaw that it would be in force before the HRA.  As my noble and learned friend, Lord Hope of Craighead, has shown, Parliament made careful provision in section 129(2) to ensure that the Scotland Act could operate during that period in the same way as it would operate once the HRA was in force.  Two points arise, one involving the First Division's construction of section 100(3), the other involving the respondents' construction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;129.&nbsp;&nbsp;During the interim period when the HRA was not in force, no one could bring proceedings under it.  On the First Division's construction, section 100(3) serves only to make clear to someone bringing proceedings under the HRA that he cannot use the Scotland Act to get round the requirement that damages should be limited to just satisfaction.  So, on that interpretation, section 100(3) could serve no purpose whatever during the interim period.  But section 100 is one of the provisions which Parliament said, in section 129(2), was to have effect during the interim period as it would have have effect after the HRA was in force.  The First Division try to surmount this insuperable barrier by saying that during the interim period "the Human Rights Act … was to be treated as if it were in force":  2007 SC 140, 168, para 54.  It is sufficient to say that this is an impossible construction of section 129(2), which quite explicitly applies only "before the Human Rights Act 1998 has come into force (or come fully into force)" and which deals only with the effect of certain specified provisions of the Scotland Act, not of the HRA, during that period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;130.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 129(2) also causes problems for the respondents' construction of section 100(3).  On their version, Parliament deliberately devised a system for the interim period under which the Scottish courts were powerless to afford just satisfaction to those whose Convention rights were violated by the Scottish Ministers.  Counsel was unable to suggest any reason why Parliament should have adopted such an obviously unsatisfactory approach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;131.&nbsp;&nbsp;By contrast, on a proper interpretation, section 100 completes the coherent scheme of the legislation.  From the outset, the Scotland Act has enabled a victim, who brings proceedings for something which the Scottish Ministers have done or failed to do in breach of his Convention rights, to obtain just satisfaction.  Depending on the circumstances, he can obtain, say, a decree of declarator, a decree of reduction, a decree of repetition of any sum paid over as the result of an ultra vires demand, and a decree of interdict.  In addition, the court can award him damages - but section 100(3) makes sure that, exactly as under section 8(3) and (4) of the HRA, damages cannot be awarded unless the court is satisfied that they are necessary to afford the victim just satisfaction in all the circumstances.  The award of damages involves no breach of principle since it is being made in respect of an act or failure to act that was ex hypothesi unlawful.  By giving the court power to grant the necessary damages, the law provides the effective remedy for the violation of the victim's Convention rights which article 13 of the European Convention requires.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;132.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, as well as those given by Lord Hope of Craighead, I would accordingly hold that the time-limit in section 7(5) of the HRA does not apply to the proceedings brought by Mr Henderson and Mr Blanco by reference to the Scotland Act.  If, but only if, damages were necessary to give the appellants just satisfaction, the court could award them in those proceedings.  In these circumstances I do not need to deal with the arguments about the scope of section 7(1)(a) and (b) of the HRA which Mr O'Neill first advanced in his reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;133.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since a majority of the House agree with that view, it follows that the time-limit in section 7(5) of the HRA does not apply to the proceedings against the Scottish Ministers brought by Mr Henderson and Mr Blanco by reference to the Scotland Act.  This has a bearing on the other issues raised in the appeals.</p>
