<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33. The present appeals raise an obvious and inescapable clash of policy considerations.  On the one hand are the considerations powerfully put by the Court of Appeal ([2002] 1 WLR 1052 at 1080, para 103) which considered the claimants' argument to be not only illogical but</p>
<p></p><ul>"also susceptible of unjust results.  It may impose liability for the whole of an insidious disease on an employer with whom the claimant was employed for quite a short time in a long working life, when the claimant is wholly unable to prove on the balance of probabilities that that period of employment had any causative relationship with the inception of the disease.  This is far too weighty an edifice to build on the slender foundations of <i>McGhee v National Coal Board</i> [1973] 1WLR 1, and Lord Bridge has told us in <i>Wilsher v Essex Area Health Authority</i> [1988] AC 1074 that <i>McGhee</i> established no new principle of law at all.  If we were to accede to the claimants' arguments, we would be distorting the law to accommodate the exigencies of a very hard case.  We would be yielding to a contention that all those who have suffered injury after being exposed to a risk of that injury from which someone else should have protected them should be able to recover compensation even when they are quite unable to prove who was the culprit.  In a quite different context Lord Steyn has recently said in <i>Frost v Chief Constable of Yorkshire</i> [1999] 2 AC 455, 491 that our tort system sometimes results in imperfect justice, but it is the best the common law can do."<p></p></ul>
<p>The Court of Appeal had in mind that in each of the cases discussed in paras 14-21 above (<i>Wardlaw, Nicholson, Gardiner, McGhee</i>) there was only one employer involved.  Thus there was a risk that the defendant might be held liable for acts for which he should not be held legally liable but no risk that he would be held liable for damage which (whether legally liable or not) he had not caused.  The crux of cases such as the present, if the appellants' argument is upheld, is that an employer may be held liable for damage he has not caused.  The risk is the greater where all the employers potentially liable are not before the court.  This is so on the facts of each of the three appeals before the House, and is always likely to be so given the long latency of this condition and the likelihood that some employers potentially liable will have gone out of business or disappeared during that period.  It can properly be said to be unjust to impose liability on a party who has not been shown, even on a balance of probabilities, to have caused the damage complained of.  On the other hand, there is a strong policy argument in favour of compensating those who have suffered grave harm, at the expense of their employers who owed them a duty to protect them against that very harm and failed to do so, when the harm can only have been caused by breach of that duty and when science does not permit the victim accurately to attribute, as between several employers, the precise  responsibility for the harm he has suffered.  I am of opinion that such injustice as may be involved in imposing liability on a duty-breaking employer in these circumstances is heavily outweighed by the injustice of denying redress to a victim.  Were the law otherwise, an employer exposing his employee to asbestos dust could obtain complete immunity against mesothelioma (but not asbestosis) claims by employing only those who had previously been exposed to excessive quantities of asbestos dust.  Such a result would reflect no credit on the law.  It seems to me, as it did to Lord Wilberforce in <i>McGhee</i> [1973] 1 WLR 1 at 7, that </p>
<p></p><ul>"the employers should be liable for an injury, squarely within the risk which they created and that they, not the pursuer, should suffer the consequence of the impossibility, foreseeably inherent in the nature of his injury, of segregating the precise consequence of their default."<p></p></ul>
<i></i><p><i>Conclusion</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;34. To the question posed in paragraph 2 of this opinion I would answer that where conditions (1)-(6) are satisfied C is entitled to recover against both A and B.  That conclusion is in my opinion consistent with principle, and also with authority (properly understood).  Where those conditions are satisfied, it seems to me just and in accordance with common sense to treat the conduct of A and B in exposing C to a risk to which he should not have been exposed as making a material contribution to the contracting by C of a condition against which it was the duty of A and B to protect him.  I consider that this conclusion is fortified by the wider jurisprudence reviewed above.  Policy considerations weigh in favour of such a conclusion.  It is a conclusion which follows even if either A or B is not before the court.  It was not suggested in argument that C's entitlement against either A or B should be for any sum less than the full compensation to which C is entitled, although A and B could of course seek contribution against each other or any other employer liable in respect of the same damage in the ordinary way.  No argument on apportionment was addressed to the House.  I would in conclusion emphasise that my opinion is directed to cases in which each of the conditions specified in (1) - (6) of paragraph 2 above is satisfied and to no other case.  It would be unrealistic to suppose that the principle here affirmed will not over time be the subject of incremental and analogical development.  Cases seeking to develop the principle must be decided when and as they arise.  For the present, I think it unwise to decide more than is necessary to resolve these three appeals which, for all the foregoing reasons, I concluded should be allowed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;35. For reasons given above, I cannot accept the view (considered in the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Hutton) that the decision in <i>McGhee</i> was based on the drawing of a factual inference.  Nor, in my opinion, was the decision based on the drawing of a legal inference.  Whether, in certain limited and specific circumstances, a legal inference is drawn or a different legal approach is taken to the proof of causation, may not make very much practical difference.  But Lord Wilberforce, in one of the passages of his opinion in <i>McGhee</i> quoted in paragraph 20 above, wisely deprecated resort to fictions and it seems to me preferable, in the interests of transparency, that the courts' response to the special problem presented by cases such as these should be stated explicitly.  I prefer to recognise that the ordinary approach to proof of causation is varied than to resort to the drawing of legal inferences inconsistent with the proven facts.</p>
<p><b>LORD NICHOLLS OF BIRKENHEAD</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;36. I have no hesitation in agreeing with all your Lordships that these appeals should be allowed.  Any other outcome would be deeply offensive to instinctive notions of what justice requires and fairness demands.  The real difficulty lies is elucidating in sufficiently specific terms the principle being applied in reaching this conclusion.  To be acceptable the law must be coherent.  It must be principled.  The basis on which one case, or one type of case, is distinguished from another should be transparent and capable of identification.  When a decision departs from principles normally applied, the basis for doing so must be rational and justifiable if the decision is to avoid the reproach that hard cases make bad law.  I turn therefore to consider the departure from the normal, and the basis of that departure, in the present appeals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;37. In the normal way, in order to recover damages for negligence, a plaintiff must prove that but for the defendant's wrongful conduct he would not have sustained the harm or loss in question.  He must establish at least this degree of causal connection between his damage and the defendant's conduct before the defendant will be held responsible for the damage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;38. Exceptionally this is not so.  In some circumstances a lesser degree of causal connection may suffice.  This sometimes occurs where the damage flowed from one or other of two alternative causes.  Take the well-known example where two hunters, acting independently of each other, fire their guns carelessly in a wood, and a pellet from one of the guns injures an innocent passer-by.  No one knows, and the plaintiff is unable to prove, from which gun the pellet came.  Should the law of negligence leave the plaintiff remediless, and allow both hunters to go away scot-free, even though one of them must have fired the injurious pellet?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;39. Not surprisingly, the courts have declined to reach such an unjust decision: see <i>Summers v Tice</i> (1948) 199 P 2d 1, a decision of the Supreme Court of California, and <i>Cook v Lewis</i> [1951] SCR 830, a decision of the Supreme Court of Canada.  As between the plaintiff and the two hunters, the evidential difficulty arising from the impossibility of identifying the gun which fired the crucial pellet should redound upon the negligent hunters, not the blameless plaintiff.  The unattractive consequence, that one of the hunters will be held liable for an injury he did not in fact inflict, is outweighed by the even less attractive alternative, that the innocent plaintiff should receive no recompense even though one of the negligent hunters injured him.  It is this balance ('.. outweighed by ..') which justifies a relaxation in the standard of causation required.  Insistence on the normal standard of causation would work an injustice.  Hunting in a careless manner and thereby creating a risk of injury to others, followed by injury to another person, is regarded by the law as sufficient causal connection in the circumstances to found responsibility. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;40. This balancing exercise involves a value judgment.  This is not at variance with basic principles in this area of the law.  The extent to which the law requires a defendant to assume responsibility for loss following upon his wrongful conduct always involves a value judgment.  The law habitually <i>limits</i> the extent of the damage for which a defendant is held responsible, even when the damage passes the threshold 'but for' test.  The converse is also true.  On occasions the threshold 'but for' test of causal connection may be over-exclusionary.  Where justice so requires, the threshold itself may be lowered.  In this way the scope of a defendant's liability may be <i>extended</i>.  The circumstances where this is appropriate will be exceptional, because of the adverse consequences which the lowering of the threshold will have for a defendant.  He will be held responsible for a loss the plaintiff might have suffered even if the defendant had not been involved at all.  To impose liability on a defendant in such circumstances normally runs counter to ordinary perceptions of responsibility.  Normally this is unacceptable.  But there are circumstances, of which the two hunters' case is an example, where this unattractiveness is outweighed by leaving the plaintiff without a remedy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;41. The present appeals are another example of such circumstances, where good policy reasons exist for departing from the usual threshold 'but for' test of causal connection.  Inhalation of asbestos dust carries a risk of mesothelioma.  That is one of the very risks from which an employer's duty of care is intended to protect employees.  Tragically, each claimant acquired this fatal disease from wrongful exposure to asbestos dust in the course of his employment.  A former employee's inability to identify which particular period of wrongful exposure brought about the onset of his disease ought not, in all justice, to preclude recovery of compensation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;42. So long as it was not insignificant, each employer's wrongful exposure of its employee to asbestos dust and, hence, to the risk of contracting mesothelioma, should be regarded by the law as a sufficient degree of causal connection.  This is sufficient to justify requiring the employer to assume responsibility for causing or materially contributing to the onset of the mesothelioma when, in the present state of medical knowledge, no more exact causal connection is ever capable of being established.  Given the present state of medical science, this outcome may cast responsibility on a defendant whose exposure of a claimant to the risk of contracting the disease had in fact no causative effect.  But the unattractiveness of casting the net of responsibility as widely as this is far outweighed by the unattractiveness of the alternative outcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;43. I need hardly add that considerable restraint is called for in any relaxation of the threshold 'but for' test of causal connection.  The principle applied on these appeals is emphatically not intended to lead to such a relaxation whenever a plaintiff has difficulty, perhaps understandable difficulty, in discharging the burden of proof resting on him.  Unless closely confined in its application this principle could become a source of injustice to defendants.  There must be good reason for departing from the normal threshold 'but for' test.  The reason must be sufficiently weighty to justify depriving the defendant of the protection this test normally and rightly affords him, and it must be plain and obvious that this is so.  Policy questions will loom large when a court has to decide whether the difficulties of proof confronting the plaintiff justify taking this exceptional course.  It is impossible to be more specific.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;44. I should comment briefly on the much discussed case of <i>McGhee v National Coal Board</i> [1973]  1 WLR 1.  As I understand it, the decision of your Lordships' House is an example of the application of the approach discussed above.  In the circumstances of that case the House departed from the usual threshold 'but for' test of causal connection and treated a lesser degree of causal connection as sufficient.  The novelty in the decision lay in the adoption of this approach in this country and, further, in the type of claim to which this approach was applied: there, as with the present appeals, the field of industrial disease.  Given the medical evidence in <i>McGhee</i>, it was not open to the House, however robustly inclined, to draw an inference that the employer's negligence had in fact caused or materially contributed to the onset of the dermatitis in the sense that, but for that negligence, the dermatitis would not have occurred.  Instead, a less stringent causal connection was regarded as sufficient.  It was enough that the employer had materially increased the risk of harm to the employee: see Lord Reid, at page 5, Lord Wilberforce, at page 7, Lord Simon of Glaisdale, at page 8 ('failure to take steps which would bring about a material reduction of the risk'), and Lord Salmon, at pages 12-13.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;45. In an area of the law already afflicted with linguistic ambiguity I myself would not describe this process of legal reasoning as a 'legal inference' or an 'inference of causation'.  This phraseology tends to obscure the fact that when applying the principle described above the court is not, by a process of inference, concluding that the ordinary 'but for' standard of causation is satisfied.  Instead, the court is applying a different and less stringent test.  It were best if this were recognised openly.</p>
<p><b>LORD HOFFMANN</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;46. In one of the three appeals before your Lordships, the appellant Mr Matthews is suffering from a cancer (mesothelioma) caused by exposure to asbestos.  Between 1973 and 1981 he was exposed to substantial quantities of asbestos dust  in the course of successive employments by the two respondents, Associated Portland Cement and British Uralite.  It is accepted that both employers were in breach of duty - the link between asbestos and cancer was well known by the mid 1960s - and that both exposures contributed substantially to the risk that he would contract the disease.  But the precise mechanism by which asbestos causes cancer is unknown. It may be caused by the mutation of a single cell caused by a single asbestos fibre. At any rate, it is impossible to say that it was more likely to have been caused by the exposure to asbestos during employment with the one respondent rather than the other. And on that ground the Court of Appeal has held that Mr Matthews' claim must fail. It was said to be a rule of law that in order to succeed against either respondent, he must prove that, but for its breach of duty, he would not have contracted the disease.  It applied the same rule to the other two appeals before your Lordships, which raise a similar point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;47. My Lords, in my opinion the rule applied by the Court of Appeal is not a correct statement of the causal connection between breach of duty and damage which the law requires in a case such as this. I think it is sufficient, both on principle and authority, that the breach of duty contributed substantially to the risk that the claimant would contract the disease.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;48. I shall first consider the question in principle.  It is axiomatic that the law will not impose liability to pay compensation for damage unless there is a relevant causal connection between the damage and the defendant's tort, breach of contract or statutory duty.  But what amounts to a relevant causal connection?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;49. Everyone agrees that there is no scientific or philosophical touchstone for determining the relevant causal connection in any particular case. The relevance of a causal connection depends upon the purpose of the inquiry. In the present case, the House is required to say what should be the relevant causal connection for breach of a duty to protect an employee against the risk of contracting (among other things) mesothelioma by exposure to asbestos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50. It is frequently said that causation is a question of fact or a matter of common sense.  Both of these propositions are true but they need to be analysed with some care in order to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;51. First, in what sense is causation a question of fact?  In order to describe something as a question of fact, it is necessary to be able to identify the question. For example, whether someone was negligent or not is a question of fact.  What is the question? It is whether he failed to take reasonable care to avoid such damage as a reasonable man would have foreseen might result from his conduct.  That question is formulated by the law.  It is the law which says that failure to take reasonable care gives rise to liability.  And the question is then answered by applying the standard of conduct prescribed by the law to the facts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;52. The same is true of causation.  The question of fact is whether the causal requirements which the law lays down for that particular liability have been satisfied.  But those requirements exist by virtue of rules of law.  Before one can answer the question of fact, one must first formulate the question. This involves deciding what, in the circumstances of the particular case, the law's requirements are.  Unless one pays attention to the need to determine this preliminary question, the proposition that causation is a question of fact may be misleading.  It may suggest that one somehow knows instinctively what the question is or that the question is always the same.  As we shall see, this is not the case.  The causal requirements for liability often vary, sometimes quite subtly, from case to case.  And since the causal requirements for liability are always a matter of law, these variations represent legal differences, driven by the recognition that the just solution to different kinds of case may require different causal requirement rules.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;53. Then there is the role of common sense.  Of course the causal requirements for liability are normally framed in accordance with common sense. But there is sometimes a tendency to appeal to common sense in order to avoid having to explain one's reasons.  It suggests that causal requirements are a matter of incommunicable judicial instinct.  I do not think that this is right.  It should be possible to give reasons why one form of causal relationship will do in one situation but not in another.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;54. In my opinion, the essential point is that the causal requirements are just as much part of the legal conditions for liability as the rules which prescribe the kind of conduct which attracts liability or the rules which limit the scope of that liability.  If I may repeat what I have said on another occasion, one is never simply liable, one is always liable <i>for</i> something - to make compensation for damage, the nature and extent of which is delimited by the law.  The rules which delimit what one is liable for may consist of causal requirements or may be rules unrelated to causation, such as the foreseebility requirements in the rule in  <i>Hadley v Baxendale</i> (1854)  9 Exch 341.  But in either case they are rules of law, part and parcel of the conditions of liability.  Once it is appreciated that the rules laying down causal requirements are not autonomous expressions of some form of logic or judicial instinct but creatures of the law, part of the conditions of liability, it is possible to explain their content on the grounds of fairness and justice in exactly the same way as the other conditions of liability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;55. In the law of negligence, for example, it has long been recognised that the imposition of a duty of care in respect of particular conduct depends upon whether it is just and reasonable to impose it.  Over vast areas of conduct one can generalise about the circumstances in which it will be considered just and reasonable to impose a duty of care: that is a consequence of <i>Donaghue v Stevenson</i> [1932]  AC 562.  But there are still situations in which Lord Atkin's generalisation cannot fairly be applied and in which it is necessary to return to the underlying principle and inquire whether it would be just and reasonable to impose liability and what its nature and extent should be: see <i>Caparo Industries plc v Dickman</i> [1990]  2 AC 605. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;56. The same is true of causation. The concepts of fairness, justice and reason underlie the rules which state the causal requirements of liability for a particular form of conduct (or non-causal limits on that liability) just as much as they underlie the rules which determine that conduct to be tortious.  And the two are inextricably linked together: the purpose of the causal requirement rules is to produce a just result by delimiting the scope of liability in a way which relates to the reasons why liability for the conduct in question exists in the first place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;57. Across most grounds of liability, whether in tort, contract or by statute, it is possible to generalise about causal requirements. These generalisations are explored in detail by Hart and Honoré (<i>Causation in the Law</i>, 2nd ed 1985).  They represent what in ordinary life would normally be regarded as the reasonable limits for attributing blame or responsibility for harm: for example, that the defendant's conduct was a necessary condition for the occurrence of the harm (the "but for" test), that it was not caused by the informed and voluntary act of another responsible human being and so on.  To that extent, these causal requirements are based upon common sense.  But, as Hart and Honoré also point out, there are situations in which these generalisations would fail to give effect to the reasons why it was thought just and reasonable to impose liability.  For example, if it is thought just and reasonable to impose a duty to take care to protect someone against harm caused by the informed and voluntary act of another responsible human being, it would be absurd to retain a causal requirement that the harm should not have been so caused.  An extreme case of this kind was <i>Reeves v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis </i>[2000]  1 AC 360, in which the defendant accepted that in the circumstances of the case, he owed a duty to take reasonable care to prevent a responsible human being from causing injury to himself.  Your Lordships decided that in those circumstances it would be contradictory to hold that the causal requirements of the tort excluded liability for harm so caused.   Thus the causal requirements are always adapted to conform to the grounds upon which liability is imposed.  Again, it may be said that this is no more than common sense.  But it is capable of rational explanation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;58. The same link between the grounds of liability and the causal requirements can be seen in cases of statutory liability.  Sometimes the causal requirements are expressly stated; if not, the courts will construe the statute as requiring the causal connection which best gives effect to its policy.  In <i>Environment Agency (formerly National Rivers Authority) v. Empress Car Co. (Abertillery) Ltd.</i> [1999] 2 AC 22 this House decided that the causal requirements of a statutory duty not to "cause ... polluting matter … to enter any controlled waters" did not exclude liability in cases in which the immediate cause of the pollution was the deliberate act of a responsible third party.  It based this conclusion on the policy of the statute to impose a strict liability for the protection of the environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;59. My Lords, even the much derided "last opportunity rule" which was applied in cases of contributory negligence before the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945 was in my opinion a perfectly rational attempt by the courts to fashion the causal requirements of the tort of negligence so as best to achieve a just and fair result in a situation in which the law insisted that any contributory negligence was a complete bar to recovery.  To say that it was illogical or inelegant seems to me neither here nor there.  If it is recognised that the causal requirements are a matter of law and that the last opportunity rule was a development of the common law to mitigate the rigour of the contributory negligence rule, there was nothing illogical about it.  As for inelegance, it was the best which could be done in the circumstances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60. The problem in this appeal is to formulate a just and fair rule. Clearly the rule must be based upon principle. However deserving the claimants may be, your Lordships are not exercising a discretion to adapt causal requirements to the individual case. That does not mean, however, that it must be a principle so broad that it takes no account of significant differences which affect whether it is fair and just to impose liability. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;61. What are the significant features of the present case?  First, we are dealing with a duty specifically intended to protect employees against being unnecessarily exposed to the risk of (among other things) a particular disease.  Secondly, the duty is one intended to create a civil right to compensation for injury relevantly connected with its breach.  Thirdly, it is established that the greater the exposure to asbestos, the greater the risk of contracting that disease.  Fourthly, except in the case in which there has been only one significant exposure to asbestos,  medical science cannot prove whose asbestos is more likely than not to have produced the cell mutation which caused the disease.  Fifthly, the employee has contracted the disease against which he should have been protected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;62. In these circumstances, a rule requiring proof of a link between the defendant's asbestos and the claimant's disease would, with the arbitrary exception of single-employer cases, empty the duty of content.  If liability depends upon proof that the conduct of the defendant was a necessary condition of the injury, it cannot effectively exist.  It is however open to your Lordships to formulate a different causal requirement in this class of case. The Court of Appeal was in my opinion wrong to say that in the absence of a proven link between the defendant's asbestos and the disease, there was no "causative relationship" whatever between the defendant's conduct and the disease.  It depends entirely upon the level at which the causal relationship is described.  To say, for example, that the cause of  Mr Matthews' cancer was his significant exposure to asbestos during two employments over a period of eight years, without being able to identify the day upon which he inhaled the fatal fibre, is a meaningful causal statement.  The medical evidence shows that it is the only kind of causal statement about the disease which, in the present state of knowledge, a scientist would regard as possible.  There is no a priori reason, no rule of logic, which prevents the law from treating it as sufficient to satisfy the causal requirements of the law of negligence. The question is whether your Lordships think such a rule would be just and reasonable and whether the class of cases to which it applies can be sufficiently clearly defined.</p>
