<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;61.&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of the Home Secretary counsel pointed out that the ECtHR has relied upon the fact of the involvement of individuals in a terrorist bombing conspiracy as a good reason for not awarding compensation for established breaches of article 2 of the ECHR (right to life), even though its usual practice would be to award monetary compensation in such case: <i>McCann v UK</i> (1996)  21 EHRR 97 para 219 (the "Death on the Rock" case); see also <i>McKerr v UK</i> (2002)  34 EHRR 20, paras. 180-181.  By analogy the Home Secretary cannot be said to have been irrational in deciding to exercise his discretion as he did.  I would accept that it was open to the Home Secretary to conclude, in his discretion, that he should not pay public monies in respect of the quashing of the conviction, where the appeal proceeded on the basis that if it had been fair to try Mr Mullen, he had been properly convicted.  This further reinforces the view that the argument that the Home Secretary acted irrationally must be rejected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;62.&nbsp;&nbsp;The alternative argument under the ex gratia scheme must be rejected.</p>
<i>
</i><p><i>XIV.  </i>DISPOSAL.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;63.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would allow the appeal of the Home Secretary.</p>
<p><b>LORD SCOTT OF FOSCOTE</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;64.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the advantage of reading in advance the opinions of my noble and learned friends, Lord Bingham of Cornhill and Lord Steyn. Both have concluded that the appeal of the Home Secretary should be allowed but, in coming to that conclusion, have expressed different views as to the correct scope to be given to the words " … a miscarriage of justice … " in section 133(1) of the Criminal Justice Act, 1988. Lord Steyn would allow the words to extend only to "clear cases of miscarriage, in the sense that there would be acknowledgment that the person concerned was clearly innocent" (see para 56 of his opinion). Lord Bingham, on the other hand, would give a wider scope to the words and allow them to cover "failures of the trial process" (see para 8 of his opinion).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;65.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords I, too, would allow this appeal for the reasons given by my noble and learned friends. Even if the wider scope which Lord Bingham would allow to section 133(1) is correct, nonetheless the respondent is unable to bring his claim for compensation within the section. The reason his conviction was reversed by the Court of Appeal was not because there had been any failure in the trial process. It was because, prior to the commencement of the trial process, there had been a serious abuse of executive power which had led to the removal of the respondent from Zimbabwe to this country and had thus enabled his trial to take place. I agree with my noble and learned friends that the respondent's conviction was not reversed on the ground that there had been a "miscarriage of justice" within the meaning of those words in section 133(1) of the 1988 Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is strictly unnecessary for the disposal of this appeal for your Lordships to express a concluded view as to whether section 133(1) does have the wider scope suggested by Lord Bingham and I shall not do so. It should be borne in mind, however, that the failure of a claimant for compensation to bring his claim within section 133(1), and thereby to establish his entitlement to compensation, will not necessarily lead to the failure of the claim. The claimant may, as a second string to his bow, seek to persuade the Home Secretary to make a discretionary payment of compensation pursuant to the ex gratia scheme. In most, if not all, of the miscarriage of justice cases in which Lord Steyn would refuse but Lord Bingham would allow a section 133 claim, the facts would be likely to be such as to attract a discretionary payment of compensation by the Home Secretary. So I doubt whether there would be much practical difference in result between the two rival views.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;67.&nbsp;&nbsp;As Lord Bingham has noted in paragraph 11 of his opinion, the Home Secretary accepted in correspondence that the respondent's conviction resulted from serious improprieties on the part of British Secret Intelligence agents and police officers and that the case would, under the terms of the ex gratia scheme as expressed on 29 November 1985 in the House of Commons by the then Home Secretary, have been one in which ex gratia compensation would have been payable. But the Home Secretary took the view that the facts of the present case were exceptional and that it would be "an affront to justice" (his letter of 6 March 2000) if the respondent were to be the recipient of ex gratia compensation. In my opinion, the Home Secretary was fully entitled in the exercise of his discretion to decline for the reasons he gave to make an ex gratia payment of compensation to the respondent. But it would be a very unusual case in which the "serious default" on the part of the British authorities that had led to the compensation claim had been part of the trial process and had fallen within the terms of the ex gratia scheme but had nonetheless been such as to lead the Home Secretary to conclude that he ought not to make an ex gratia payment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;68.&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as the present appeal is concerned, however, I would allow the appeal for the reasons given by Lord Bingham and Lord Steyn.</p>
<p><b>LORD RODGER OF EARLSFERRY</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;69.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the privilege of reading the speeches of my noble and learned friends, Lord Bingham of Cornhill and Lord Steyn, in draft.  I agree that the appeal can be decided on the basis put forward by Lord Bingham, with which I agree.  While it is not, therefore, necessary to go further for the decision of the appeal, for my part, I would also accept the arguments advanced by Lord Steyn.  I would accordingly allow the appeal.</p>
<p><b>LORD WALKER OF GESTINGTHORPE</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the great advantage of reading in draft the speeches of my noble and learned friends Lord Bingham of Cornhill and Lord Steyn.  Lord Steyn has set out powerful reasons for his conclusion as to the autonomous meaning of the expression "miscarriage of justice" in article 14 (6).  But for my part I would go no further than the limited ground for allowing the appeal identified by Lord Bingham.  On that limited ground I too would allow this appeal.</p>
