<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107. In so far as the question raised by this issue relates to a breach of Convention rights by the prosecuting authority, I would answer it in the affirmative.  I consider that an accused whose trial took place before the coming into force of the 1998 Act is entitled to rely in an appeal after the coming into force of that Act on an alleged breach of his Convention rights by the prosecuting authority.  But that is not the situation in the present case.  The proceedings were brought by a public authority, but it is not the bringing of those proceedings nor any other act on its part that is said to have led to the alleged incompatibility.  The appellant's case is that it was the directions that the trial judge gave in his summing up which were incompatible with his article 6(2) Convention right.  That was an act of the court.  It was not an act of the prosecuting authority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108. The appellant's alternative argument based upon section 22(4) and section 7(1)(b) seeks to apply those provisions to enable effect to be given to the obligations in sections 3(1) and 6(1) retrospectively to the acts of the trial judge when he was delivering his summing up in the trial court, or alternatively to the acts of the appeal court when it was considering the safety of the appellant's conviction in the light of that summing up.  Section 6(3)(a) provides that in that section "public authority" includes a court or tribunal.  There is no doubt therefore that, if section 6(1) of the Act had been in force at the time of the trial, the obligation which is set out in that subsection would have been binding on the trial judge.  He would also have been obliged by section 3(1) to read and give effect to section 28 of the 1971 Act in a way which was compatible with Convention rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109. I am unable to construe section 22(4) read with section 7(1)(b) in this way.  I do not have any difficulty in reading the expression "public authority" in these provisions as including a court or tribunal.  The meaning which is given to that expression for the purposes of section 6 by section 6(3) must be read in to sections 7(1) and 7(6) and section 22(4), as all these provisions are interlinked.  But a court or tribunal is not a public authority by or at the instigation of which proceedings are brought.  Section 7(1) contemplates proceedings to which a public authority is a party.  A court or tribunal is not a party to the proceedings which are brought before it in its judicial capacity.  In my opinion the words of the statute are incapable of supporting this part of the appellant's argument.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110. Mr Starmer said that the interpretative obligation in section 3(1) applies to the provisions of the 1998 Act in exactly the same way as it applies to any other statute.  I agree.  Section 3(2)(a) provides that the section applies to primary legislation whenever enacted.  So it applies to the 1998 Act, even although that Act was enacted before section 3 itself was brought into force on 2 October 2000.  Where section 3(1) applies it may have the effect of altering the effect of prior legislation retrospectively.  But the obligation which section 3(1) lays down is to read and give effect to legislation compatibly with Convention rights "so far as it is possible to do so".  This will not be possible if the legislation expressly contradicts the meaning which it would have to be given if it is to be made compatible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111. Section 22(4) provides expressly that subsection 7(1)(b) does not apply to an act taking place before the coming into force of that section "otherwise" than in the case of proceedings "brought by or at the instigation of" a public authority.  I would hold that this provision expressly contradicts Mr Starmer's argument.  In any event I am unable to identify any respect in which it is incompatible with any of the Convention rights mentioned in section 1(1) of the 1998 Act.  A deliberate choice was made by Parliament as to the extent to which section 7(1)(b) could be given effect to retrospectively in order to provide a person whose Convention rights have been violated with an effective remedy.  But article 13 of the Convention, to which section 7 gives effect, is not one of the Convention rights mentioned in section 1(1).  I do not think that it is open to the court to make a different choice from that which was made by Parliament.  To do so would not be to construe the enactment in the way which section 3(1) contemplates.  It would be to do something which it does not permit, which is to legislate.</p>
<i><p><i>(c) the second argument - section 6(1)</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112. The appellant's second alternative argument on retrospectivity is based entirely upon the provisions of section 6(1).  His proposition is simply this.  Section 6(1) provides that it is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way that is incompatible with a Convention right.  A court, including an appellate court, is a public authority: see section 6(3)(a).  The House of Lords is a public authority when it is acting in its judicial capacity: see section 6(4).  It is unlawful for the House of Lords in that capacity to act in a way that is incompatible with the appellant's article 6(2) Convention right.  Section 6 is now in force.  This means that the House must give effect to that Convention right in the hearing of any appeal.  Giving effect to it involves examining the question whether the summing up by the trial judge was incompatible with the Convention right, irrespective of the question whether section 3(1) of the 1998 Act was in force at the time of the summing up.  If it is found that the summing up was incompatible the House must take account of that fact in its consideration of the question whether the appellant's conviction was unsafe.  In my opinion this argument is inconsistent with the scheme of the 1998 Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113. What section 6(1) declares to be unlawful is an "act" of a public authority.  The 1998 Act tells us that an act for this purpose includes a failure to act: section 6(6).  In contrast to section 3(1) which is expressed in terms of an obligation, section 6(1) is expressed in terms of a prohibition.  It imposes a duty on a public authority not to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right.  The word "act" suggests that the prohibition is concerned with conduct.  Conduct by a public authority is usually preceded by some process of reasoning or decision-taking, but it is the act rather than the decision which precedes it which is the subject of the prohibition.  When the word is applied to things done by a court, it is not difficult to apply the prohibition to the conduct of the proceedings.  They must not be conducted in a way which is incompatible with the article 6 Convention right to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal.  But what of the court's decision-taking function and the process of reasoning that leads up to it?  Peter Mirfield, Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (2): Evidential Aspects [2001] Crim L R 91, 92-93 has suggested that it is open to question whether these aspects of what a court does are included within the word "act".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114. I would be inclined to give the word "act" a broad and purposive meaning in this context, for the reasons indicated by Lord Wilberforce in <i>Minister of Home Affairs v Fisher</i> [1980]  AC 319, 328E-329A.  It seems to me that, it is not only the manner of the decision-taking exercise that is brought under scrutiny.  I would hold that the prohibition applies also to the interpretative obligation in section 3(1).  The court is prohibited from carrying out the "act" of statutory construction otherwise than in accordance with that obligation.  A decision which is based on the application and development of the common law also is an act by the court, so I think that it must follow that this too is subject to the prohibition in section 6(1).  Thus it is unlawful for a court to conduct a hearing in a way which is incompatible with a person's article 6 Convention rights.  But the prohibition in section 6(1) also affects matters of substance.  So it will be unlawful within the meaning of section 6(1) for a court to determine a criminal charge on an interpretation of a statute which ignores the interpretative obligation in section 3(1), or on a proposition of law which is incompatible with a Convention right.  It will be unlawful in the Convention sense for an appellate court to do likewise.  The remedy for decisions of that kind lies in the domestic law which provides for, or sets limits to, an appeal against or the review of decisions of  the lower courts: see section 9(1).  The defendant's Convention rights are protected so long as the basis upon which the appeal process itself is conducted is not incompatible with the Convention rights.  Thus far I am at one with the appellant's argument.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115. The appellant maintains that it would be incompatible with his article 6(2) Convention right for an appellate court not to read and give effect to section 28 of the 1971 Act in a way that was compatible with it.  As soon as section 3(1) was brought into force the interpretative obligation was binding on all courts irrespective of the date when the legislation was enacted.  I agree that it would have been binding on the trial court had the section been in force at the date of the trial.  But there is nothing in the 1998 Act to indicate that that subsection is to be applied retrospectively to acts of courts or tribunals which took place before the coming into force of section 3(1).  The provisions of section 22(4) are to the contrary.  There would have been no point in enacting that section 7(1)(b) was to have retrospective effect in the way which that subsection provides <i>but</i> <i>not otherwise</i> if appellate courts were to be obliged by section 6(1) to give retrospective effect to that subsection in all cases where they were required to adjudicate upon acts by courts or tribunals as public authorities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116. In my opinion the position was correctly stated by Sir Andrew Morritt V-C in <i>Wilson v The First County Trust Limited (No 2)</i> (Case No B2/1999/1073), 2 May 2001, when he said in paragraph 20:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The effect of section 22(4) is not in doubt.  It provides (by the second limb of the section) that, in general, section 7(1) does not apply to an act taking place before 2 October 2000.  So, for example, a person who claims that a public authority has acted in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right (contrary to section 6(1) of the Act) cannot bring proceedings against the authority under the Act (pursuant to section 7(1)(a)) if the unlawful act took place before 2 October 2000.  Nor, it seems, can a person who claims that a court or tribunal has acted in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right (contrary to section 6(1) of the Act) rely on that as a ground of appeal against the decision of that court or tribunal in a case where the decision complained of was made before 2 October 2000 - see section 7(1)(b) and section 7(6)(b) of the Act." <p></p></ul>
<p>I agree with the Vice-Chancellor that the answer to this argument is to be found in section 22(4).  Parliament made its choice as to the extent to which the 1998 Act should have effect retrospectively.  It did so by express enactment, and in my opinion no other reading of section 22(4) than that which I have indicated is possible.  I would not base my decision on this point on any views one might have as to whether or not the right choice was made.  Our function is to construe the statute.  For the reasons which I have given I would hold that the appellant's argument fails on this point.  I would therefore answer the question whether an accused whose trial took place before the coming into force of the 1998 Act is entitled to rely in an appeal after the coming into force of that Act on an alleged breach of his Convention rights by the trial court in the negative.</p>
<i><p><i>Conclusion</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117. I would hold that the trial judge was right to tell the jury that it was not necessary for the prosecution to prove that the appellant knew that the thing that was in the bag was a controlled drug.  I would also hold that a direction that it is for the accused to prove his defence of lack of knowledge under section 28 of the 1971 Act on the balance of probability is not compatible with the article 6(2) Convention right.  But this finding does not provide the appellant with a remedy under section 6(1) of the 1998 Act, as the relevant provisions of that Act were not in force at the time of his trial.  Had it been necessary to do so, I would have held that his conviction was not unsafe on the ground that the jury would have reached the same result if a direction had been given to them which was compatible with the Convention right.  I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p><b>LORD CLYDE</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118. The appellant was convicted of an offence under section 5(3) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.  That section provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Subject to section 28 of this Act, it is an offence for a person to have a controlled drug in his possession, whether lawfully or not, with intent to supply it to another in contravention of section 4(1) of this Act."<p></p></ul>
<p>Section 28 of the Act provides in subsection (2) that subject to subsection (3):</p>
<p></p><ul>"it shall be a defence for the accused to prove that he neither knew of nor suspected nor had reason to suspect the existence of some fact alleged by the prosecution which it is necessary for the prosecution to prove if he is to be convicted of the offence charged."<p></p></ul>
<p>Subsection (3) deals with the situation where in order for a conviction to be obtained the prosecution has to prove that:</p>
<p></p><ul>"some substance or product involved in the alleged offence was the controlled drug which the prosecution alleges it to have been, and it is proved that the substance or product in question was that controlled drug."<p></p></ul>
<p>The subsection then proceeds to detail one case in which the accused is not to be acquitted, namely where he proves that he did not know, suspect nor have reason to suspect that the substance or product was the particular controlled drug, and two cases where he shall be acquitted. The first of these is "if he proves that he neither believed nor suspected nor had reason to suspect that the substance or product in question was a controlled drug."  The second deals with the case, far removed from the present, where a person may lawfully possess certain controlled drugs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119. The appeal raises firstly a question about the essential elements of the offence of possession of a controlled drug, and secondly certain questions relating to the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the Human Rights Act 1998. I turn first to the construction of sections 5 and 28 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.</p>
<i><p>Possession</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120. The focus of the argument in relation to the statutory offence contained in section 5(3) has been on the element of possession.  In that respect the argument may also extend to the offence set out in section 5(2), simple possession of a controlled drug.  But what is exactly comprehended in the concept of possession may vary in accordance with the context in which the word is used.  It may be accompanied by other expressions which may colour the substance of what is intended, as for example the expression "possession, custody or power" (<i>B v B</i> [1979]  1 All ER 801).  There may be some qualification, adjectival or adverbial, attached to the language, such as for example "actual" possession, or "knowingly" possess, which may attract a particular meaning.  But even if the word stands alone it does not necessarily follow that the meaning is in every context identical or that precisely the same elements have to be proved in order to establish possession of the thing with which the offence is concerned.  The context may well colour the meaning.  In the present case it is the analysis of the concept of possession under section 5 of the 1971 Act which is essentially in issue.  While it may well be safe to state in a general way that possession in the context of the criminal law comprises the elements of control and knowledge, the critical question of the substance of the knowledge which is one of the ingredients of the offence may not be open to the same answer in the context of different statutory provisions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121. This observation relates particularly to the existence of any mental element in the offence.  Some care may have to be taken in the present context with the use of the expression "mens rea".  While the label is convenient as referring to the mental element or elements which may be comprised in any particular offence it may be difficult to find any single common definition of it applicable to all cases.  It may indeed, as Sir J.F.Stephen (<i>History of the Criminal Law</i> , 1883 Vol 2, 95, quoted in Gordon, Criminal Law 3rd ed. 7.08) observed, mean:</p>
<p></p><ul>"no more than that the definition of all or nearly all crimes contains not only an outward and visible element , but a mental element, varying according to the different nature of different crimes." <p></p></ul>
<p>The precise substance of the mental element in the offences involving possession under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 may not necessarily be the same as the mental element in other statutory offences involving possession.  So I would restrict the scope of the present decision to the statute with which we are concerned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122. The first of the certified questions asks whether it is an essential element of the offence of possession of a controlled drug that the accused knows that he has a controlled drug in his possession.  This question requires consideration of the ingredients of possession for the purposes of section 5(2) and (3).  In my view the word has the same meaning which it has always had in the context of the legislation relating to controlled drugs, that is to say that the accused has control of the thing and knows that he has it in his control.  That these two elements are necessary can be found in the decision in <i>Reg v Warner</i> [1969]  2 AC 256 which concerned the Drugs (Prevention of Misuse) Act 1964 and there is nothing to show that Parliament intended any other meaning to be given to the word in the later legislation (<i>Reg v Ashton</i>-<i>Rickhardt</i> [1978]  1 WLR 37, 42).  The meaning of possession for the purposes of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 is now well established.  The first of the two elements, control, involves a physical control.  The concept is enlarged by section 37(3) of the Act which states that "things which a person has in his possession shall be taken to include any thing subject to his control which is in the custody of another".  The second element involves that the defendant knows that the thing in question is under his control.  He need not know what its nature is, but so long as he knows that the thing, whatever it is, is under his control, it is in his possession (<i>Reg v Ashton-Rickardt</i> [1978]  1 WLR 37).  The prosecution requires to prove that the defendant had control of the thing, that he knew he had control of it, and that the thing was the controlled drug which the prosecution allege it to have been.  In addition, of course, for section 5(3) the prosecution must prove that the defendant had the intent to supply the thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123. The particular question is whether it is necessary for possession of a controlled drug that the accused knows that the thing is of the nature which it is alleged to be.  The answer to that question is in my view evident from other provisions of the Act, in particular sections 5(4) and 28(3)(<i>b</i>)(i).  Section 5(4) applies to proceedings for an offence under section 5(2) where "it is proved that the accused had a controlled drug in his possession".  The offence under section 5(2) is one of having a controlled drug in his possession unlawfully, that is to say, contrary to any regulations under section 7 authorising the possession of controlled drugs (see section 5(1)).  The defence which is made available by section 5(4) expressly includes the ingredient that the accused knew or suspected that what he possessed was a controlled drug.  It deals with cases where it is proved that the accused had a controlled drug in his possession but that "knowing or suspecting it to be a controlled drug" he possessed it for certain specified purposes.  That that fact may come in after it has been proved that he had a controlled drug in his possession demonstrates that such knowledge or suspicion is not an ingredient of possession.  The words which I have quoted would be unnecessary if the knowledge or suspicion was already an ingredient of the possession which has been proved.  Section 28(3)(<i>b</i>)(i) deals with cases where the accused neither believed nor suspected nor had reason to suspect that the substance or product in issue was a controlled drug.  In such a case he is to be acquitted.  But that provision would be unnecessary if proof of possession of a controlled drug necessarily entailed proof of knowledge that the thing in question was a controlled drug.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;124. The matter is one of the construction of the particular legislation. A contrast may be made with <i>DPP v Brooks</i> [1974]  AC 862.  That case concerned a statutory provision in Jamaica which provided that "every person who…has in his possession any…ganja;…shall be guilty of an offence".  The Privy Council held that the prosecution had to prove that the defendant knew that the thing which he had in his van was ganja. That view was reached in light of long-standing authority on the meaning of the provision and the particular wording of the Jamaican statute.  There the statute was silent on the matter of the precise knowledge of the accused. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125. I note that the word "knowingly" is not found in section 5(3). It is a word expressly used in section 8 and I believe that its absence in section 5(3) does have some significance.  In <i>Sweet v Parsley</i> [1970]  AC 132, 149, Lord Reid observed that it is:</p>
<p></p><ul>"firmly established that the fact that other sections of the Act expressly require mens rea, for example because they contain the word 'knowingly', is not in itself sufficient to justify a decision that a section which is silent as to mens rea creates an absolute offence." <p></p></ul>
<p>But in the context of offences of possession the matter is somewhat more delicate in so far as the substance of the knowledge involved may be of different kinds of things.  Knowingly to possess something seems to my mind to require that there is knowledge of what the thing is, at least in its general nature, which one has in possession.  The offence of knowingly possessing explosives implies knowledge that the things in possession are explosives (<i>R v Hallam</i> [1957]  1 QB 569.  The distinction between that case and possession of drugs where the word "knowingly" does not occur was noted in <i>Lockyer v Gibb</i> [1967]  2 QB 243, where it was held that it did not have to be proved that the accused knew that what she had in her hold-all was a drug.  The absence of the word "knowingly" in section 5(3) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 fits with the understanding that the word "possession" does not involve knowledge of the nature of the thing possessed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;126. In some cases the drug may be found on the accused's person or in his house in a state or situation from which it is immediately obvious that it is a controlled drug.  In such cases it may well be that that no question about the accused's knowledge of the nature of the substance may arise.  A more difficult problem arises where the drug in question is within some container, such as a box or a bag. But the law here is clear to the effect that if the defendant is in possession of the container and knows that there is something in it, he will be taken to be in possession of the contents of the container.  That was clearly affirmed in McNamara ([1988]  87 Cr App R 246)).  Where the drug is in a container, it is sufficient for the prosecution to prove that the defendant had control of the container, that he knew of its existence and that there was something in it, and that the something was in fact the controlled drug which the prosecution alleges it to be.  The prosecution does not require to prove that the accused knew that the thing was a controlled drug.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;127. The appellant placed some reliance upon in <i>B (A Minor) v Director of Public Prosecutions</i> [2000]  AC 428.  In that case this House affirmed that mens rea was an essential element of every criminal offence unless Parliament expressly or by necessary implication provided to the contrary.  The case was one of an alleged breach of section 1(1) of the Indecency with Children Act 1960.  In <i>B</i> what was required to be proved by the prosecution was the absence of a genuine belief on the part of the defendant that the victim was 14 years old or more.  The section was silent on the matter of knowledge or belief, and the House held that the offence must be taken to include the mental element of genuine belief.  The importance of the decision to my mind is that it has affirmed a rule of general application to all statutory offences, not simply to statutory sexual offences.  One must then approach statutory offences with the understanding that there is necessarily a mental element in the offences there contained, unless there is a clear indication to the contrary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;128. But I do not consider that B is of particular assistance in the present case.  The mental element of the offence under section 5(3) is partly built into the concept of possession and the element of the intent to supply, and partly set out in section 28 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.  The mental element respecting knowledge or suspicion of the nature of the thing has been expressly catered for in section 28.  It only arises for consideration on the assumption that the facts which the prosecution requires to prove in order to obtain a conviction have been proved.  If the accused did not know or suspect or have reason to suspect any of those facts, then section 28(2) provides him or her with a defence.  I entirely agree with the recognition by the High Court of Justiciary in <i>Salmon v HM Advocate</i> 1999  JC 67 of the priority to be given to subsection (2) of section 28 over subsection (3). Subsection (3) expressly only comes into play if it is proved that the substance or product in question was the controlled drug which it was necessary for the prosecution to have proved it to have been.  Section 28 provides an escape for the defence by adding a qualification to the strict operation of the definition of possession.  It affords a defence to an accused person where no defence had previously existed under the earlier legislation (<i>Reg v Ashton-Rickardt</i> (1978) 1 WLR 37, 43).  If knowledge or ignorance of the accused is brought into issue, section 28 opens up that further mental element in the possession in the particular case.  But when notice is taken of all these elements in the statute there is no room to infer any additional element of guilty intention in section 5(3).</p>
<i><p>The Burden of Proof</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;129. The second of the certified questions asks whether section 28(3) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 is compatible with Article 6(2) of the Convention.  This question raises in the first place a consideration of the nature of the burden of proof imposed on the accused by section 28 of the Act.  It should be noticed at the outset that in some cases this problem may not arise at all since no question of the accused's knowledge or ignorance that the thing was a controlled drug may be put in issue.  To prove the possession of a controlled drug it is sufficient for the prosecutor to prove that the defendant had control of a thing, that he knew of the existence of the thing, and that the thing was in fact a controlled drug.  The evidence may stop at that point and the offence, so far as possession is concerned, may be thereby established.  In such a case there is no question of any burden on the accused under section 28. But in some cases more elaboration may be required.  That is the qualification upon the scope of section 5(3) which is imported by the words "subject to section 28".  In cases where section 28 arises the offence is not established simply by proof of possession.  These more elaborate cases may arise particularly where the drug is within a container and, while it is clear that the container contains something, it is not evident from looking at the container what its contents may be. </p>
