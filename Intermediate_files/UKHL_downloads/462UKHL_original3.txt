<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;57. There is no doubt that this rule was extended in <i>In re Poh</i> 1983]  1 WLR 2 when it was applied to an appeal from a refusal of leave to apply for judicial review.  I also think that Lord Diplock's observation, at p 3, that this House is not concerned with the procedure by which the application in question moved to the Court of Appeal is difficult to reconcile with what was said in E<i>x p Stevenson</i>.  The fact that the Court of Appeal granted permission to the applicants to appeal from the decision of Richards J shows that the decision of the judge to refuse permission was not treated as final and conclusive and without appeal in that court.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;58. For these reasons I do not think that there is any sound basis for holding that, where the Court of Appeal has granted leave to appeal against a refusal of permission to apply for judicial review and then heard the appeal, this House has no jurisdiction to entertain a further appeal against a refusal of permission by the Court of Appeal.</p>
<i><p><i>Promptitude</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;59. I share my noble and learned friend's doubt as to whether the provision in CPR r 54.5(1) that the claim form must be filed "promptly" is sufficiently certain to comply with the right to a fair hearing within a reasonable time in article 6(1) of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (1953) (Cmd 8969) and, in that respect, also with European Community law.  But, as his point may have some implications for the law and practice of judicial review in Scotland and as the current state of the law and practice in Scotland might be of some interest if rule 54.5(1) were to be reformulated, I should like to add these comments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60. The principle of legality, which covers not only statute but also unwritten law, requires that any law or rule which restricts Convention rights must be formulated with sufficient clarity to enable the citizen to regulate his conduct: <i>Sunday Times v United Kingdom</i> (1979)  2 EHRR 245, 270-271, paras 47, 49.  He must be able, if need be with appropriate advice, to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail.  The problem is that the word "promptly" is imprecise and the rule makes no reference to any criteria by reference to which the question whether that test is satisfied is to be judged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;61. As Lord Clyde and Denis Edwards, <i>Judicial Review </i>(W Green, 2000), para 13.14 point out, there is no specific time-limit for the making of an application for judicial review in Scotland nor is it thought that there is any need for one.  The explanation for the absence of a specific statutory time limit is to be found in the history of the supervisory jurisdiction of the Court of Session which preceded the introduction of a new procedure for judicial review by rule of ourt 260B of the Rules of the Court of Session 1965 (SI 1965/321).  A full account of it is set out in the opinion of the court in <i>West v Secretary of State for Scotland</i> 1992  SC 385, 393-401.  It had long been recognised that the Court of Session had jurisdiction to control any excess or abuse of power or a failure to act by an inferior body or tribunal.  But this jurisdiction was of little use in practice, as it took so long under the existing procedure to obtain a decision from the court.  What was needed, as Lord Fraser of Tullybelton pointed out in <i>Brown v Hamilton District Council</i> 1983  SC (HL) 1, 49, was a reform of the procedure for obtaining judicial review of decisions by public bodies which would provide litigants in Scotland with ready access to the court for the obtaining of the appropriate remedies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;62. The reforms introduced by rule 260B of the 1965 Rules are now to be found in Chapter 58 of the Rules of the Court of Session 1994 (1994 No 1443 (s 69)).  They were essentially procedural in nature.  It was not the intention to narrow the supervisory jurisdiction from what it had previously been. One aspect of that jurisdiction was that it had never been subject to any specific statutory time limit.  A research study was carried out into the operation in practice of judicial review of administrative action in Scotland by staff at the School of Law at the University of Glasgow.  They concluded that there was no case for the introduction of a strict time limit within which a petition must be brought: "Judicial Review Research", 1996 SLT (News) 164-165.  Rule 58.3 of the 1994 Rules, which provides for the making of applications for judicial review, says nothing about the time within which such applications must be made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;63. The principal protection against undue delay in applying for judicial review in Scotland is not to be found therefore in any statutory provision but in the common law concepts of delay, acquiescence and personal bar: see <i>Clyde and Edwards,</i> <i>Judicial Review, </i>para 13.20.  The important point to note for present purposes is that there is no Scottish authority which supports the proposition that mere delay (or, to follow the language of CPR r 54.5(1), a mere failure to apply "promptly") will do.  It has never been held that mere delay is sufficient to bar proceedings for judicial review in the absence of circumstances pointing to acquiescence or prejudice: <i>Singh v Secretary of State for the Home Department</i> 2000  SLT 533, 536, para 8, per Lord Nimmo Smith; <i>Uprichard v Fife Council</i> 2000  GWD 14-514, per Lord Bonomy (Transcript; para 16) <i>Bett Properties v Scottish Ministers</i> 2001  SLT 1131, 1136G-1137A, paras 9-10, per Lord Macfadyen, although he reserved his opinion on this point, at p 1137E.  As Lord Nimmo Smith said in the <i>Singh</i> case, at p 536I, none of the cases in Scotland provide support for a plea of unreasonable delay, separate and distinct from a plea of mora, taciturnity and acquiescence, in answer to an application for judicial review.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;64. On the other hand it has repeatedly been acknowledged that applications in such cases should be brought as speedily as possible.  Ample support for this approach is to be found in the well-known observations of Lord Diplock in <i>O'Reilly v Mackman</i> [1983]  2 AC 237, 280-281 to the effect that the public interest in good administration requires that public authorities and third parties should not be kept in suspense for any longer period than is absolutely necessary in fairness to the person affected by the decision; see also <i>R v Dairy Produce Quota Tribunal for England and Wales, Ex p Caswell</i> [1990]  2 AC 738.  But decisions as to whether a petition should be dismissed on the ground of delay are made in the light of the circumstances in which time was allowed to pass.  As Lord President Rodger put it in <i>Swan v Secretary of State for Scotland</i> 1998  SC 479, 487:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is, of course, the case that judicial review proceedings ought normally to be raised promptly and it is also undeniable that the petitioners let some months pass without starting these proceedings.  None the less, in considering whether the delay was such that the petitioners should not be allowed to proceed, we take into account the situation in which time was allowed to pass."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;65. In <i>Ex p Caswell</i> [1990]  2 AC 738, 749-750 Lord Goff of Chieveley said that he did not think that it would be wise to attempt to formulate any precise definition or description of what constitutes detriment to good administration.  As he pointed out, the interest in good administration lies essentially in a regular flow of consistent decisions and in citizens knowing where they stand and how they can order their affairs.  Matters of particular importance, apart from the length of time itself, would be the extent of the effect of the relevant decision and the impact which would be felt if it were to be reopened.  These observations, which were made in the context of an application to extend the period under RSC Ord 53, r 4(1), are consistent with the Scottish approach to the question whether the application should be allowed to proceed.  The question whether the delay amounts to acquiescence or would give rise to prejudice such as to bar the remedy is inevitably one of fact and degree.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66. There is clearly much force in the point which my noble and learned friend makes that the obligation to apply "promptly" is, without more, too uncertain to satisfy the requirements of Convention law.  But in my opinion the factors which are relevant to a plea of mora, acquiescence and taciturnity in Scottish practice provide an appropriate context for the taking of decisions on this point.  They provide a sufficiently clear and workable rule for the avoidance of undue delay in the bringing of these applications, as experience of the operation of judicial review in Scotland has shown.  I do not think that it would be incompatible with his Convention rights for an applicant who must be taken to have acquiesced in the decision which he seeks to bring under review, or whose delay has been such that another interested party may be prejudiced, to be told that his application cannot proceed because he has delayed too long in bringing it.</p>

<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;67. I have had the advantage of reading in draft the speeches of my noble and learned friends, Lord Slynn of Hadley and Lord Steyn.  For the reasons they give I too would allow the appeal.</p>
