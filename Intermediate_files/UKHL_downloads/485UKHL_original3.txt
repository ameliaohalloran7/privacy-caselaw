<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;62. Lord Hoffmann drew a distinction between "a duty to <i>provide</i> <i>information</i> for the purpose of enabling someone else to decide upon a course of action and a duty to <i>advise</i> someone as to what course of action he should take." [1997] AC 191, 214 This has been widely misunderstood. Lord Hoffmann was not distinguishing between a duty to provide information and a duty to give advice. That is a distinction without a difference, for the terms are interchangeable. He was distinguishing between a duty to provide particular information or advice on request and a duty to advise generally when it is left to the adviser to decide what matters he should consider. Even where the defendant assumes responsibility for advising generally "whether or not a course of action should be taken" it is still necessary to identify the particular course of action in question.  Where the question is whether to enter into a particular transaction, it is necessary to identify the relevant transaction, for the defendant is not responsible for loss arising from any other transaction. The warning given by Lord Roskill in <i>Caparo v Dickman</i> to which I have already referred is particularly apposite when there are separate but interdependent transactions as in <i>Skandia</i> and the <i>Superhulls Cover</i> cases. In the former, it would have made no difference to the result if the broker had advised generally in relation to the credit insurance, so long as he had left the decision whether to accept the fraud exclusion to his principals, since the loss arose on the transaction of loan. In the latter, the concession would be correct only if the broker had assumed responsibility for advising what action should be taken in relation to the underlying insurance.  It is never enough to say: the defendant was responsible for advising the plaintiff what action he should take.  It is necessary to ask:  in relation to what?  His liability is limited to losses arising from the particular transaction in relation to which the advice was given.  Where the defendant gave professional advice, his profession will usually supply the answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;63. In <i>Nyekredit Mortgage Bank Plc v Edward Erdman Group Ltd </i>[1997] AC 191 ("Nyekredit"), which was heard at the same time as <i>SAAMCO</i>, the valuers were specifically asked to advise not only on the value of the property, which was a development site, but also on the projected rental value of the completed development and its lettabilty in the open market. The advice which the valuers gave under each of the specified heads was wrong. The lenders claimed that if the valuers had given them the correct figures they would have appreciated, not only that the security was insufficient, but that the development project was not viable and default was inevitable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;64. The House rejected this as a distinguishing factor which imposed a different liability from that in the other cases. There were two reasons for this. First, the argument was based on what would have happened if the valuers had provided accurate information. As Lord Hoffmann observed, at p 223, that is not the basis of their liability. They are not liable for the loss which is due to the fact that they failed to give correct valuations, but for the loss which is due to the fact that the true values were not as they represented them to be. Secondly, the detailed figures had been requested merely as component elements in the valuation of the security. In other words, the valuers had been asked to advise on the value of the security and not on the viability of the project. As always, in Lord Roskill's words in <i>Caparo</i>, [1990] 2 AC 605, 628 it is necessary to determine "for what purposes and in what circumstances the information in question is to be given".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;65. The <i>SAAMCO</i> principle is not confined to valuers. Lord Hoffmann gave an imaginary example of a doctor. In <i>Bristol and West Building Society v Fancy &amp; Jackson</i> [1997]  4 All ER 582 it was applied to a number of cases against solicitors who acted for proposed mortgage lenders. In some cases they were held responsible for the whole of the loss on the transaction; in others they were not. In <i>Fancy &amp; Jackson</i> itself they were held not to be responsible for any part of the loss. They ought to have reported that they did not have an official search certificate. If they had done so, the society would not have authorised the advance. But the loss which the society suffered was not due to the absence of a search certificate, for the title was clear. The society obtained what it intended to obtain when it decide to enter into the transaction. The loss which occurred would have occurred even if the solicitor was in possession of an official search certificate, as he said he was.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66. The law can be summarised as follows:</p>
(1). Where a plaintiff enters into a loss-making transaction in reliance on the defendant's negligent advice, he is not entitled to recover the whole of the loss on the transaction merely because the defendant was aware that he would not have entered into it but for the advice he received. He is liable only for the loss which is due to the advice being wrong. As Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead said in <i>Nyekredit Mortgage Bank Plc v Edward Erdman Group Ltd (No 2) </i>[1997]  1 WLR 1627, 1631, the defendant
"is not liable for all the consequences which flow from [the plaintiff] entering into the transaction. He is not even liable for all the foreseeable consequences. He is not liable for consequences which would have arisen even if the advice had been correct. He is not liable for these because they are the consequence of the risks [the plaintiff] would have taken upon himself even if the … advice had been sound. As such they are not within the scope of the duty owed to [the plaintiff] by [the defendant]".
(2). The court does not ask what would have happened if the defendant had performed his duty and stated the true facts (in which event the transaction would not have gone ahead at all). This is not the basis of the defendant's liability.
(3). The correct measure of damages is not the difference between the loss which has in fact occurred (the loss on the transaction) and the loss which would have occurred if the defendant had performed his duty and stated the facts correctly (which would have been zero since the transaction would not have gone ahead). This would not exclude the loss which ought to be irrecoverable. They are measured by the difference between the loss on the transaction and the loss which would have been sustained if the facts had been as the defendant represented them to be (when the transaction would still have gone ahead).
(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;The case is different where the defendant assumed responsibility for advising generally what course of action to take in relation to a particular transaction.  But it is necessary to identify the transaction in question, for he is not liable for loss arising from some other transaction even though it may be linked with it, particularly if it called for the exercise of a different professional judgment.  A broker should not lightly be assumed to undertake responsibility for an underwriting decision.
<p>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;The defendant's liability is measured by the scope of his duty.  Accordingly, where the complaint is that he failed to report or give any advice at all on a particular matter, the plaintiff must prove that he was under a legal obligation to do so.  It is not enough that he would probably have volunteered the information if asked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;67. I shall return to points (2) and (3) when considering the second of the two questions to which I have referred: whether the measure of damages for the appellants' advice that the desired reinsurance had been obtained (and therefore implicitly that it was available) is greater if the reinsurance was in fact not available in the market than if it was.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;68. The appellants Johnson &amp; Higgins Ltd are insurance and reinsurance brokers. Mr Forster was a broker in their employ. Mr Bullen was the underwriter of four syndicates at Lloyd's which wrote marine excess of loss business. This is a form of reinsurance which is intended to cover particularly catastrophic losses due to hurricanes, oil rig disasters and the like.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;69. On 15 November 1988, acting as broker to Mr Bullen, Mr Forster wrote to Mr Crawley, Aneco's underwriter, offering Aneco a share of the syndicates' marine excess of loss account.  On 18 November         Mr Forster followed this up by a letter giving more information about the account, and adding</p>
"Would suggest you buy XL [excess of loss] protection for up to 10 times [premium] income and would envisage comprehensive protection being available at between 30% and 40% of NPI [net premium income]"
<p>While Mr Forster was here volunteering advice to Mr Crawley, he was still acting as Mr Bullen's broker. He had not yet been instructed by Aneco, and was not assuming a responsibility to Aneco for the level of reinsurance which Aneco ought to obtain; and the contrary has not been suggested. Rather he was touting for business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70. What was envisaged was a proportional treaty under which the Bullen syndicates as insurer/reinsured and Aneco as reinsurer agreed to share risks within the limits of the treaty. Such treaties are of two kinds: quota share and facultative/obligatory (known as "fac/oblig"). Under a quota share treaty, the insurer is obliged to cede to the treaty a fixed proportion of every risk which falls within the limits of the treaty. Under a fac/oblig treaty the insurer has a choice whether to cede any given risk to the treaty. He cannot cede it unless it falls within the limits of the treaty, but he is not obliged to cede it if it does. The reinsurer has no choice; he cannot insist on a risk being ceded, and cannot refuse to accept his share of a ceded risk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;71. Fac/oblig treaties are naturally less attractive to reinsurers than quota share treaties. They are subject to the obvious risk that the insurer will retain good business for his own account and cede poor business to the treaty. There is, or at least is assumed to be, no obligation of good faith on the part of the ceding party when exercising his discretion whether to cede or retain a risk. The only constraint upon him is that he must exercise some restraint if he wishes to maintain a good reputation in the market and any hope of doing future business with existing and prospective reinsurers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72. Mr Crawley was aware that the Bullen treaty was a fac/oblig treaty. As Evans LJ accepted [2000] 1 All ER (Comm) 129, 156, para 79, it was necessary for Mr Crawley to form his own view of the prospects for business of the kind which the Bullen treaty represented. The availability of sufficient excess of loss protection was a major factor, but there were others and Mr Forster was not concerned with them. Mr Crawley had decided to participate in the London market excess of loss business because he believed (correctly) that premium rates were rising as a result of the Piper Alpha disaster and (incorrectly) that the likelihood of another catastrophe coming so soon afterwards was remote. The Bullen treaty marked Mr Crawley's first foray into this market, but it was to be expected that he would write further business from time to time. He made his own enquiries about Mr Bullen and his reputation in the market and came to London in late November 1988 in order to meet Mr Bullen and size him up. He made his own assessment of Mr Bullen's reasons for wanting the treaty and what use he was likely to make of it. He negotiated the finer points of the treaty, such as overriding commission, directly with Mr Bullen. He was not deterred by the fact that the Bullen treaty was a fac/oblig treaty.  Aneco's potential exposure under the Bullen treaty was not predictable with any degree of certainty. There were several reasons for this; it is sufficient to mention two of them. First, although there was a limit on the size of any one contract which Mr Bullen could cede to the treaty, there was no limit on the number of contracts which he could cede. Secondly, Aneco's exposure depended on the average rate on line of the business which was ceded to the treaty. (The rate on line is the proportion which the premium payable bears to the cover. The lower the rate on line for a given premium the greater the exposure.)  Under the treaty Mr Bullen could cede business which had an original rate on line of between 2% and 20%.  Mr Crawley estimated that the average rate on line of business ceded to the treaty would be 10%, but Mr Bullen was not bound to maintain any  particular average rate on line.  In the event his rate on line was very much lower than 10%.  The combination of these two factors meant that Aneco's exposure under the Bullen treaty was far higher than Mr Crawley had envisaged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73. Mr Crawley was willing to enter into the Bullen treaty without any limitation on the number of contracts which Mr Bullen could cede, without any obligation on Mr Bullen's part to maintain a minimum average rate on line, and without any limit on Aneco's aggregate exposure. He was, however, not willing to enter into the treaty without  reinsurance protection, even though, for the reasons already stated, he could not predict how much cover was needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74. Mr Crawley applied a rule of thumb of his own that he should buy reinsurance for 60-70% of his total aggregate exposure. This involved his estimating the amount of the aggregate exposure. He did this by taking an estimated average rate on line of 10%, even though    Mr Bullen had not bound himself to such an average and Mr Crawley had not stipulated for it as he could have done. He then multiplied the exposure produced by that rate on line by the estimated premium income, even though there was no contractual ceiling on this either.    Mr Crawley did not seek advice on the adequacy of the reinsurance protection which his calculations indicated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75. On 30 November, at a meeting in the Captain's Room at Lloyd's attended by Mr Crawley, Mr Bullen and Mr Forster, Mr Crawley agreed to participate in the Bullen treaty on the basis of an estimated (but not guaranteed) premium income.  At the meeting Mr Crawley made it clear that Aneco's willingness to participate on the lines discussed was subject to Mr Forster being able to obtain the excess of loss protection for Aneco which Mr Crawley wanted. Mr Crawley confirmed this by fax dated 5 December to Mr Forster which contained the statement</p>
<p></p><ul>"Our participation must be subject to your obtaining satisfactory XOL terms for our net account excess of hopefully not more than $100,000."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two things were now clear to every one concerned. First, Aneco would not enter into the Bullen treaty unless excess of loss reinsurance on terms acceptable to Aneco was obtained. Secondly, Mr Forster was to act as Aneco's broker in order to obtain the reinsurance cover which Aneco required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76. Mr Forster then approached Mr King, a leading underwriter at Lloyd's and asked him to quote for six layers of excess of loss protection for Aneco's whole marine excess of loss account. On 5 December he sent a fax to Mr Crawley. The fax was in two parts, corresponding to the two roles in which Mr Forster was acting. The first, headed "N.T.Bullen - Special Priority Treaty", dealt with revisions to the proposed Bullen treaty.  The second, headed "Your Excess of Loss Protections", contained the quotations he had obtained from Mr King for the four bottom layers of cover. He added that he would expect to obtain the further cover required and that </p>
<p></p><ul>"In the current Marine Excess of Loss on Excess of Loss Market we feel that paying 42% of income is not unreasonable for coverage of 3.3 times income excess of 16.6% of income."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 6 December Mr Forster sent Mr Crawley Mr King's quotations for the two top layers. Mr Crawley now telexed Mr Forster, saying that he thought that Mr King's rates were exorbitant, and asking him to see what he could do to obtain improved terms.  Mr Forster returned to     Mr King and obtained revised quotations which he relayed to              Mr Crawley.  The six layers of excess of loss protection provided cover of up to $7,800,000 excess of $200,000 with two reinstatements at a total cost of 51% of the estimated premium income. Mr Forster added:</p>
<p></p><ul>"We will contact Bullen tomorrow and get some idea of aggregate exposure from business written at 1 Jan. This will give us a more accurate idea as to how much protection you should purchase at this time with a view to perhaps buying more as and when aggregates increase throughout the year."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77. On 7 December Mr Forster telexed Mr Crawley again. Ominously, perhaps, he reported that Mr Bullen was unable to provide accurate information regarding his aggregates. Mr Forster added:</p>
"As advised although maximum exposure will not occur until at least midway through the year we would recommend you buy up to the $8,000,000 coverage we have quoted now as feel retro market is likely to contract even further during the year and may mean if we stagger placements there will not be any capacity available at a later date."
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aneco relies on this telex as representing that reinsurance was available when, if the risk were fairly presented, it was not. The context, however, is important. Mr Foster was advising Aneco as to the desirability of taking out reinsurance (for Aneco's whole account) sooner rather than later, and <i>in that context</i> advising that cover was available now though it might not be available later. He was saying nothing about the merits of the Bullen treaty or the market's assessment of them. He had not been asked to advise on either, and could not have advised on the former without finding himself in an impossible position.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78. Mr Crawley accepted Mr Forster's advice. By telex of the same day he agreed that Aneco would participate in the Bullen treaty to the extent proposed and confirmed a firm order to place the reinsurance to the extent and on the terms indicated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79. Mr Foster returned to Mr King who subscribed lines on all six layers of reinsurance.  Mr Foster then broked the six layers to the following market, both at Lloyd's and the London and overseas companies markets. By 30 December the placing of the six layers was all but complete and Mr Forster so informed Aneco by telex of the same date.  On receiving this information Aneco signed the slip for its participation in the Bullen treaty.  By 19 January 1989 all six layers were fully subscribed.  Aneco relies on the telex of 30 December as a further representation that reinsurance, if properly broked, was available. The actual representation was that such reinsurance had been or would shortly be obtained; but it is implicit in such a representation that the reinsurance is available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80. Again, however, the context is critical. Mr Crawley had not asked Mr Forster to report on the market's assessment of the Bullen treaty.  He did not ask to see Mr Forster's marketing sheets which contained the notes of the responses of the underwriters who declined to subscribe for any of the six layers ("no way"; "not now"; "next year"; "thanks but"; "no new XL"; "not this layer"; "needs like a hole in the head"); and    Mr Forster did not show them to him.  Had Mr Crawley asked for them he would have discovered that market sentiment generally was distinctly unfavourable.  Many underwriters did not want to write any more marine excess of loss business, irrespective of the quality of the business or the identity of the syndicate's underwriter. Some underwriters did not like the quality of Mr Bullen's business; others did not relish having Aneco, a foreign company and unknown in the marine market, as a counterparty. Significantly, those underwriters who realised or suspected that the Bullen treaty was a fac/oblig treaty declined participation on that account. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81. Aneco subsequently became insolvent and is now in liquidation. It suffered a loss on the Bullen treaty of more than $35m.  It would have suffered the greater part of this loss even if the reinsurance which Aneco had ordered and the appellants had obtained had been effective.  The reason for the loss is not controversial. It had nothing to do with the broking of the reinsurance for which the appellants were responsible. It arose because Mr Bullen ceded much more business and at lower rates on line than Mr Crawley expected, and because it was a heavily loss-making business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82. The Lloyd's underwriters repudiated liability under the reinsurance contracts for non-disclosure, and their right to do so was upheld by a Lloyd's tribunal chaired by Sir Michael Kerr. Some but not all of the companies which subscribed to the reinsurance contracts have also avoided them on the same grounds. Nine of the reinsurers have affirmed the contracts and have paid claims amounting (in round figures) to a total of $4.6m.  Aneco has given credit for this sum in formulating its claim.</p>
<i><p>The proceedings</p>
</i>
The pleadings
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83. Aneco sued the appellants for negligence. It pleaded that the appellants had acted as Aneco's brokers</p>
(i) in obtaining quotes for excess of loss reinsurance;
(ii) in advising Aneco as to the available excess of loss reinsurance; and
(iii) &nbsp;&nbsp;in subsequently placing the reinsurance.
It pleaded that the appellants owed Aneco a duty to exercise reasonable skill and care
(i) in the placement of the reinsurance;
(ii) in advising Aneco of the reinsurance available; and
(iii) &nbsp;&nbsp;in advising Aneco of the reinsurance obtained. 
<p>It pleaded the following breaches of duty on the part of the appellants:</p>
(i) they failed to exercise due skill and care  (a) in the placement of the excess of loss reinsurance; (b) in advising Aneco of the reinsurance available; and (c) in advising Aneco of the excess of loss reinsurance obtained;
(ii) they ought to have advised Aneco that excess of loss protection was either not available or was not available at a recommendable price.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84. The allegation that the appellants negligently advised on the availability of reinsurance was clearly pleaded.  Aneco did not allege that the appellants had any duty to advise it (i) on what course of action to take in relation to the Bullen treaty or the wisdom of its decision to participate in the Bullen treaty (whether as a fac/oblig treaty or otherwise); (ii) as to the amount of the reinsurance protection which it should obtain (both of which would have called for an exercise of underwriting judgment); or (iii) as to the market assessment of the risks inherent in the Bullen treaty. It did not allege any duty on the part of the appellants to report the comments made by underwriters who declined the business or their reasons for doing so.</p>
<i><p>The evidence</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85. In his evidence Mr Crawley did say that he sought Mr Forster's advice on the level of reinsurance that Aneco should obtain and that     Mr Forster recommended buying up to 10 times premium income. But Aneco's claim to the $24m was neither pleaded nor put on the basis that Mr Forster had given negligent advice that the level of reinsurance protection which Aneco asked for was sufficient. In cross-examination Mr Crawley said that, with hindsight, they had got the amount of vertical cover wrong, but he agreed that at the time he thought that it was adequate.  Aneco's claim to the $24m was put fairly and squarely on the simple ground that Aneco would not have entered into the Bullen treaty in the absence of effective reinsurance in the amount which it required, and that Mr Forster knew this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86. In his evidence Mr Crawley did not suggest that he was intending to rely on Mr Forster for the market's assessment of the merits of the Bullen teaty. There is only one passage in Mr Crawley's evidence which bears on this. It occurs in his cross-examination:</p>
Q. <p>Suppose Mr Forster had come back and said to you: "My belief is that if the reinsurance protection that you need to obtain is broked correctly - which of course I will broke correctly - I believe it will be unplaceable"; what would you have done?</p>
<p></p><ul><ul>A.  I would have said: "<i>That</i> is a pity, but we will not be able to participate in the inwards Bullen treaty" (emphasis added).<p></p></ul></ul>
This gives the impression that Mr Crawley would have felt disappointment at his inability to enter into a profitable transaction, not relief at being saved from a disastrous one. He would not have regarded the unavailability of reinsurance as indicating the undesirability of entering into the Bullen treaty.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87. In cross-examination Mr Forster accepted that he had a responsibility (in counsel's words) "for protecting Aneco's <i>interests with regard to the outwards reinsurance protection</i>" (emphasis added.) In this context he agreed that he was advising Aneco of the reinsurance which was available and the state of the (reinsurance) market at the time. He agreed that he had advised Mr Crawley that reinsurance protection for the layers and at the rates on line indicated could probably be obtained, that he knew that Aneco's willingness to enter into the Bullen treaty was entirely dependent on the availability of reinsurance, and that if he had been unable to obtain the required reinsurance protection "the whole thing would have collapsed." <i></i></p><i>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88. It was not put to Mr Forster that he had any responsibility to advise Aneco what course of action he should take in relation to the Bullen treaty, or to advise not only of the availability of the reinsurance protection which Aneco required, but of the market's assessment of the risks inherent in the Bullen treaty.  Nor was it put to him that he had a duty to report the comments of those underwriters who had declined to subscribe or their reasons for doing so. The only breaches of duty put to him were his failure to present the risk fairly to the reinsurers (with the result that the reinsurance which he was asked to obtain was ineffective) and his advice that such reinsurance was available and had been obtained when it was neither (with the result that Aneco entered into the Bullen treaty and the reinsurance contracts). <i></i></p><i>
</i>
<i><p>The judgments: first instance</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89. Cresswell J [1998] 1 Lloyd's Rep 565 found that, in breach of their duty of care as Aneco's brokers, the appellants were negligent in presenting the risk to the reinsurers by failing to disclose material facts, principally (though not exclusively) that the Bullen treaty was a fac/oblig treaty. On the basis of expert evidence, the judge found that, if the risk had been fairly presented, it would have been possible to find reinsurance on terms not greatly differing from those obtained by        Mr Forster.  On this view of the facts Mr Forster's advice that reinsurance was available in the market was not incorrect (let alone negligent). The judge awarded damages of $11m as representing the value of the reinsurance cover which was lost by Mr Forster's negligence.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90. The Court of Appeal [2000] 1 All ER (Comm) 129 unanimously reversed the judge's finding that it would have been possible to obtain reinsurance on comparable terms if the risk had been properly broked.  The court found that on the balance of probabilities it would not have been possible for the appellants to find alternative leaders to Mr King or sufficient following underwriters to subscribe to the risk if it had been fairly presented.  They would not have been willing to subscribe to an excess of loss protection of Aneco as a fac/oblig reinsurer of the Bullen Syndicates or would not have been willing to do so on terms which would have been commercially acceptable to Aneco. In arriving at this conclusion the Court of Appeal took into account the (differing) expert evidence dealing with alternative security, the materiality of the underlying nature of the business, and the response of potential excess of loss underwriters recorded in Mr Forster's marketing sheets which effectively covered the whole of the London market where reinsurance of the kind in question might be placed.  There is no appeal from this part of the Court of Appeal's judgment. It follows that Mr Forster's advice that such reinsurance was available must be taken to be incorrect. It does not, of course, follow that it must be taken to have been negligent, but that is another story.</p>
