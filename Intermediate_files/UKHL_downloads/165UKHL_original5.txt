<p align="right"><a href="homejj-4.htm">(back to preceding text)</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to understand, however, that the Court was not there holding that only treatment resembling detention in an open prison or committal to a disciplinary unit <i>can</i> amount to deprivation of liberty.  On the contrary, notwithstanding its recognition that there were clear differences between Mr Guzzardi's treatment and "classic detention in prison or strict arrest imposed on a serviceman" - most notably that for fifteen hours a day he was free to leave and return to his dwelling as he wished, that his wife and son lived with him for fourteen of the sixteen months of his confinement, "the inviolability of his home and of the intimacy of his family life, two rights that the Convention guaranteed solely to free people", and with regard to "his social relations" - the Court nevertheless continued:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Deprivation of liberty may, however, take numerous other forms.  Their variety is being increased by developments in legal standards and in attitudes; and the Convention is to be interpreted in the light of the notions currently prevailing in democratic States."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court also echoed (at para 92) what had been said in <i>Engel </i>as to the focus of article 5 being on "physical liberty" and "the starting point [being the applicant's] concrete situation and account must be taken of a whole range of criteria such as the type, duration, effects and manner of implementation of the measure in question."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95.&nbsp;&nbsp;By "manner of implementation of the measure in question", the Court indicated (para 94), as indeed was already apparent from para 88, that it was concerned not with the Italian legislation authorising Mr Guzzardi's confinement but rather with his "actual position" during it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Guzzardi</i>, of course, was decided over a quarter of a century ago.  But subsequent cases, whilst establishing certain parameters beyond which it is now clear one way or the other whether article 5 applies, afford little additional assistance.  The borderline between deprivation of liberty and restriction upon liberty remains indistinct and around it decisions necessarily remain "a matter of pure opinion."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97.&nbsp;&nbsp;One parameter is represented by a series of Italian Mafia cases where the applicants were subject to internal exile regimes much like Mr Guzzardi's but in larger areas and communities than Mr Guzzardi on Asinara.  One such case, indeed, was that of Mr Guzzardi himself when, after Asinara, he was required to live in the small, remote mainland district of Force.  Other such cases are <i>Ciancimino v Italy</i> (1991) 70 DR 103, <i>Raimondo v Italy</i> (1994) 18 EHRR 237 and <i>Labita v Italy</i> (6 April 2000, App No 26772/95).  All involved curfews of between nine and eleven hours.  All (save <i>Labita</i> where no article 5 complaint was even made) were summarily ruled inadmissible either by the Commission or the Court.  So too was <i>Trijonis v Lithuania</i> (17 March 2005, at App No 2333/02) where for sixteen months the applicant was subject to a 12 hour nightly curfew during weekdays and an entire weekend curfew (60 hours from 7 pm Friday to 7 am Monday).  He, however, lived in his own house (which was inviolable) and was free from all restraints outside his home and so was able mid-week, to work or meet people as he wished.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98.&nbsp;&nbsp;The other end of the spectrum is represented by the "house arrest" cases in which the respective applicants were required (sometimes as a "less restrictive" measure than pre-trial detention) to remain at home at all times save by prior permission of the authorities.  These cases include <i>NC v Italy </i>(11 January 2001 App No 24952/94), <i>Mancini v Italy</i> (12 December 2001 App. No. 44955/98), <i>Vachev v Bulgaria</i> (8 October 2004), <i>Nikolova (No 2) v Bulgaria</i> (30 December 2004) and <i>Pekov v Bulgaria</i> (30 June 2006).  All were accepted or held to involve a deprivation of liberty.  In <i>Pekov </i>the Government had argued that because in fact the applicant could have left his house with impunity (the monitoring authorities being based elsewhere) he was not deprived of his liberty.  Unsurprisingly the argument failed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99.&nbsp;&nbsp;Plainly the present cases fall comfortably within the wide spectrum between those parameters.  These 18-hour curfews (not to mention the additional constraints placed upon the respondents whether at home or away from it) are substantially more restrictive than those imposed in the Italian Mafia cases, or even those imposed in <i>Trijonis</i>.  But they certainly do not amount to around the clock house arrest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor is the direct comparison with the facts of <i>Guzzardi</i> (itself plainly a borderline case) especially helpful.  In certain respects the respondents have greater physical liberty than Mr Guzzardi on Asinara: in the non-curfew period they can move around in a larger area with greater facilities and a better opportunity of meeting people (subject, of course, to clearance).  But in other respects they have less physical liberty, most notably in their confinement to their small flats for all but six hours a day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101.&nbsp;&nbsp;My noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill warned in <i>R (Gillan) v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis</i> [2006] 2 AC 307, 342,  of the dangers of attempting to apply Strasbourg judgments as factual precedents:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The Strasbourg jurisprudence is closely focused on the facts of particular cases, and this makes it perilous to transpose the outcome of one case to another where the facts are different."(para 23)<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warning is salutary.  To my mind no real assistance here can be gained from other such very different cases as <i>X v Austria</i> (1979) 18 DR 154 (forcible submission to a blood test), <i>X v Federal Republic of Germany</i> (1981)  24 DR 158 (a ten year old girl's detention for two hours in a police station for questioning) and <i>Bozano v France</i> (1986)  9 EHRR 297 (enforced travel by car for some twelve hours handcuffed to policemen for several hundred kilometres to the Swiss border).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, therefore, these appeals fall to be decided as "a matter of pure opinion" with little further guidance than that deprivation of liberty is concerned with "physical liberty", that it can take "numerous other forms", [other, that is, than "classic detention in prison or strict arrest imposed on a serviceman"], and that it is to be distinguished from mere restriction upon liberty as a question of "degree or intensity", starting with the applicants' "concrete situation" and then by reference to "a whole range of criteria such as the type, duration [and] effects" of that situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103.&nbsp;&nbsp;Plainly there must come a point at which a daily curfew (itself clearly a restriction upon liberty of movement) shades into a regime akin to house arrest, where so little genuine freedom is left that the line is crossed into deprivation of liberty.  The 2005 Act itself recognises that control orders could be made that are so onerous as to cross that line and require derogation from article 5 - and it recognises too that physical liberty is so important a freedom that not only must there then be derogation but also a substantially higher threshold for the imposition of such deprivation: proof that the person concerned actually is or has been involved in terrorist-related activity, rather merely than that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104.&nbsp;&nbsp;At what point, then, is the line crossed?  The question plainly is one for the courts, not for the Secretary of State.  She understandably wants to impose in these cases the longest curfews consistent with non-derogation - doubtless to reduce so far as possible the need for surveillance (a scarce and now presumably over-stretched resource) and the suspects' opportunity to engage in terrorist-related activity.  She contends for 18 hours.  But there is no particular logic in this.  Why not 20 hours, or 22?  No useful comparison can be made with actual imprisonment.  Indeed, conditions of imprisonment vary hugely.  Some of those in open prisons daily go out to work unsupervised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105.&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking account of all the other conditions and circumstances of these control orders - broadly similar not only in these six cases but in the other cases heard with them - and not least the length of time for which they are imposed, I have reached the clear conclusion that 18 hour curfews are simply too long to be consistent with the retention of physical liberty.  In my opinion they breach article 5.  I am equally clear, however, that 12 or 14-hour curfews (those at issue in two of the related appeals before the House) <i>are</i> consistent with physical liberty.  Indeed, I would go further and, rather than leave the Secretary of State guessing as to the precise point at which control orders will be held vulnerable to article 5 challenges, state that for my part I would regard the acceptable limit to be 16 hours, leaving the suspect with 8 hours (admittedly in various respects controlled) liberty a day.  Such a regime, in my opinion, can and should properly be characterised as one which restricts the suspect's liberty of movement rather than actually deprives him of his liberty.  That, however, should be regarded as the absolute limit.  Permanent home confinement beyond 16 hours a day on a long-term basis necessarily to my mind involves the deprivation of physical liberty. And, although naturally I recognise that this cannot be the touchstone for the distinction, I think that any curfew regime exceeding 16 hours really <i>ought</i> not to be imposed unless the court can be satisfied of the suspect's actual involvement in terrorism, the higher threshold that would apply to the making of a derogating control order.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would add just this.  I have given anxious thought to what Lord Bingham of Cornhill said in <i>R (Ullah) v Special Adjudicator</i> [2004]  2 AC 323, 350  (para 20) about not construing the Convention as conferring greater rights than the Strasbourg jurisprudence itself establishes—something upon which, indeed, I myself commented in <i>R (Al-Skeini) v Secretary of State for Defence</i> [2007]  3 WLR 33, 71-72  (paras 105-106).  But whereas the issue in <i>Al-Skeini</i> was as to the reach of article 1 itself—an issue to which the ECtHR in <i>Bankovic v Belgium</i> (2001) 11 BHRC 435 (at paras 64 and 65) had made plain that the "living instrument" approach does not apply—here by contrast the Court recognised in <i>Guzzardi</i> (at para 95 in the passage already quoted in para 94 above) that developing legal standards and attitudes will further increase the variety of forms of deprivation of liberty.  I think that nowadays a longer curfew regime than 16 hours a day (with the additional restraints imposed in these cases) would surely be classified in Strasbourg as a deprivation of liberty.  It may be, indeed, that 16 hours itself is too long.  I would, however, leave it to the Strasbourg Court to decide upon that, were any such argument to be addressed to it.  (The government itself, of course, cannot complain to Strasbourg about adverse decisions of your Lordships' House.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally I would say this.  The borderline between deprivation of liberty and restriction of liberty of movement cannot vary according to the particular interests sought to be served by the restraints imposed.  The siren voices urging that it be shifted to accommodate today's need to combat terrorism (or even that it be drawn with such need in mind) must be firmly resisted.  Article 5 represents a fundamental value and is absolute in its terms.  Liberty is too precious a right to be discarded except in times of genuine national emergency.  None is suggested here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since writing the paragraphs set out above I have had the advantage of reading in draft the opinions of each of the other members of the Committee.  Despite the explicit reluctance of several of your Lordships to suggest the point at which curfews would, by virtue of their length, involve the deprivation of liberty, I remain unrepentant for doing so.  I recognise, of course, that "situations may be many and various" (Baroness Hale of Richmond at para 63), that "the overall factual matrix" is important (Lord Carswell at para 84) and that the decision whether or not a particular non-derogating control order involves a deprivation of liberty is one for the judge, appealable only for error of law.  As mentioned, however, the other conditions and circumstances of these six control orders (and, indeed, those under consideration in the related appeals) are all broadly similar and, as Lord Bingham points out in para 11 of his opinion in the <i>E &amp; S</i> appeal [2007] UKHL 47, what principally must be focused on is the extent to which the suspect is "actually confined": "other restrictions (important as they may be in some cases) are ancillary" and "[can] not of themselves effect a deprivation of liberty if the core element of confinement . . . is insufficiently stringent."  Just so that there is no mistake about it, my view is that, taking account of the conditions and circumstances in all these various control order cases, provided the "core element of confinement" does not exceed sixteen hours a day, it is "insufficiently stringent" as a matter of law to effect a deprivation of liberty.  Beyond sixteen hours, however, liberty is lost.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109.&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows that I respectfully agree with Lord Bingham and Baroness Hale that in the <i>JJ</i> appeal Sullivan J and the Court of Appeal were right to hold that these six control orders involved a deprivation of liberty having regard to their "type, duration, effects and manner of implementation."  That being so, I respectfully agree also (with each of your Lordships save for Lord Hoffmann, and for the reasons given by Lord Bingham) that there was no alternative here but to quash the orders in their entirety rather than strike down part of them only or direct their modification by the Secretary of State.</p>
