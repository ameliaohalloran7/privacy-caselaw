<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;130. In this case there was a trial which was not confined to a simple claim by the bank against the wife; it involved also her husband (who in addition counterclaimed against the bank) and third parties joined by the wife.  With some reluctance I agree that the wife's appeal should be dismissed.  This is not because of any inherent lack of merit in her case; she has been appallingly badly served.  It is because to set aside the judgments entered against her below would be contrary to the grounds upon which her case was conducted at the trial and in the Court of Appeal.  The wife and her husband were members of the Hasidic Jewish community.  This factually involved a relationship of complete trust and confidence between the wife and her husband in relation to financial matters.  I agree with Lord Scott that it is a case where, having drawn the appropriate inferences, actual undue influence was in fact established.  The wife was being asked to charge her home to secure advances to her husband for the purpose of enabling him to engage in property speculation, he being unable to offer the bank adequate other security.  It was also a case where the bank was clearly put on enquiry.  The relevant point which should have been considered was therefore whether the bank took steps of the kind referred to by Lord Nicholls (para 79) (or in the National Westminster document) in order to protect itself from being affected by any such undue influence.  But at the trial the dealings between the bank and the wife and the solicitor were not covered by documentary evidence and seem not to have been the subject of direct oral evidence either.  The wife simply said that she went to the solicitor's office at the request of her husband and that all the managing clerk, whom they saw there, did before witnessing her signature was to ask her in the presence of her husband if he, her husband, had explained the documents to her.  Her account (which the judge accepted) gives a pertinent reminder of the gap between theory and reality and illustrates the type of charade which, as Sir Peter Millett has observed (<i>sup</i>), lenders well know may occur and should not be tolerated or sanctioned by equity.  However, at the trial, the wife's case was that the elderly solicitor for whom the managing clerk worked was acting as her solicitor.  She joined what she thought were the appropriate persons as third parties suing them for breach of professional duty.  The elderly solicitor had died.  The trial judge dismissed her claim against the third parties holding that she had sued the wrong persons.  There was a further unusual feature of the case.  The bank had asked for a certificate in the unusual terms: "I confirm that this document was signed in my presence and that the full effect of its contents have been explained to and were understood by Miriam Mara Coleman, <i>and she has signed this document of her own free will."</i> (<i>emphasis supplied.</i>)  It was this certificate that the managing clerk signed.  If the bank were entitled to believe that this certificate was supplied by the wife's own solicitor instructed by her, the bank might have had a basis for believing that the wife's consent had been properly obtained.  I venture to doubt whether any reasonable banker would have put this construction upon the available evidence but in view of the course of the proceedings before the trial judge and the basis upon which the wife's case was then put it would not be permissible now to allow this appeal upon an inconsistent and untested basis.  The greater part of the time at the trial seems to have been taken up with the dispute between the husband and the bank.  As between the wife and the bank, the judgments in the courts below were primarily concerned with aspects of the problem of <i>presumed</i> undue influence which do not now arise and with the question of the adequacy of a certificate signed by a legal executive as opposed to a solicitor which must depend on the facts of each case.</p>
<i><p>Bennett:</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;131. I agree that this appeal should be allowed.  The existence of the ranking agreement was important and qualified the transaction as it was disclosed to the surety.  I do not wish to add anything to what is to be said about this point by Lord Scott.  This suffices for the allowing of the appeal.  It is accordingly unnecessary to say anything about the undue influence issues.  </p>

<p><b>LORD SCOTT OF FOSCOTE</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<i><p><i>Introduction</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;132. Eight appeals have been heard together.  In seven of these appeals, the appellant is a wife who agreed to subject her property, usually her interest in the matrimonial home, to a charge in favour of a bank in order to provide security for the payment of her husband's debts, or the debts of a company by means of which her husband carried on business.  In each of these cases the bank has commenced proceedings for possession of the mortgaged property with a view to its sale and the wife has defended the claim by alleging, first, that her agreement to grant the charge to the bank was brought about by undue influence or misrepresentation, or both, on the part of her husband, and, secondly, that, in the circumstances, the chargee bank ought not to be allowed to enforce the charge against her.  In each of these cases the question has been raised whether the bank should be treated as having had notice of the impropriety, or alleged impropriety, of the husband.  In each of these cases the bank has had some reason to believe that a solicitor had acted for the wife in the transaction in question.  So the question has arisen as to the extent to which the solicitor's participation, or believed participation, has absolved the bank of the need to make any further inquiries about the circumstances in which the wife was persuaded to agree to grant the charge, or to take any further steps to satisfy itself that her consent to do so was a true and informed consent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;133. Four of these seven cases, <i>Etridge, Gill, Coleman </i>and<i> Bennett</i> went to a full trial, with evidence and cross-examination.  The other three, <i>Harris</i>, <i>Wallace</i> and <i>Moore</i>, have come to your Lordships' House as a result of interlocutory applications;  in <i>Harris</i> and in <i>Moore,</i> an application to strike-out the relevant parts of the wife's defence;  in <i>Wallace</i>, an application by the bank for summary judgment for possession. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;134. In each of these seven cases, the submissions on behalf of the wife have been based upon the principles expressed by Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <i>Barclays Bank Plc v O'Brien </i> [1994]  1 AC 180 and, to a lesser extent, in <i>CIBC Mortgages Plc v Pitt </i> [1994]  1 AC 200.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;135. The eighth appeal before the House, <i>Kenyon-Brown v Desmond Banks &amp; Co</i>, is a case in which the wife is suing the solicitor who acted for her in such a transaction as I have described.  She alleges breach of duty by the solicitor.  One of the issues in the seven <i>wife v bank</i> appeals that your Lordships are invited to consider relates to the extent of the duty lying upon a solicitor who acts for a wife who is proposing to grant a charge over her property as security for her husband's, or his company's, debts.  It was, therefore, thought convenient to add the <i>Kenyon-Brown</i> appeal to the seven other appeals so that all could be heard together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;136. Five of the seven <i>wife v bank</i> appeals, namely, <i>Etridge</i>, <i>Harris</i>, <i>Moore</i>, <i>Wallace</i> and <i>Gill</i>, were heard together by the Court of Appeal (Stuart-Smith, Millett and Morritt LJJ).  In each, the Court of Appeal dismissed the wife's appeal against the order for possession made by the Court below  (see <i>Royal Bank of Scotland Plc v Etridge (No 2) </i> [1998]  4 All ER 705).  In <i>Bennett</i>, the Court of Appeal (Auld, Chadwick LJJ and Sir Christopher Staughton) allowed the bank's appeal against the judgment below in favour of the wife and made an order for possession (see [1999] 1 FLR 1115).  The Court of Appeal placed strong reliance on passages in  the judgment of the court given by Stuart-Smith LJ in <i>Etridge</i> <i>(No 2)</i>.  In <i>Coleman</i>, the Court of Appeal (Nourse, Pill and Mummery LJJ) [2001] QB 20 dismissed the wife's appeal against the possession order made below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;137. In <i>Kenyon-Brown v Desmond Banks &amp; Co</i>, the Court of Appeal (Peter Gibson and Mance LJJ, Wilson J dissenting) [2000] PNLR 266 allowed the wife's appeal and, in expressing the extent of the defendant solicitor's duty to her, placed strong reliance on <i>Royal Bank of Scotland Plc v Etridge (No 2).</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;138. In deciding these appeals it is necessary in my opinion, first, to analyse and explain the principles formulated by Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <i>O'Brien.</i>  The case law since <i>O'Brien</i> has, in my view, disclosed some misconceptions about these principles.</p>
<i><p><i>The O'Brien principles</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;139. It is convenient to start with a look at the problems that had to be addressed in <i>O'Brien</i> and at Lord Browne-Wilkinson's solution to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;140. There had been an increasing number of cases in which wives had sought to avoid the charges they had given to banks or finance houses in support of their husbands' debts.  In many, probably in most, of the cases that had come to court, the wives had not read, or, if they had, had not understood the document they had signed.  Many of the wives protested that they had signed because excessive pressure to do so had been brought to bear on them by their husbands;  others said that their husbands had misrepresented the amount of the secured debts, the time during which the charge would remain in force or some other material matter.  In most cases the wife emphasised, in explaining her willingness to sign the charge, the trust and confidence she had had in her husband.  This trust and confidence, it was said, had led her to succumb to his pressure to sign and to be the more easily misled by his misrepresentations.  Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <i>O'Brien</i> said, at p 188:</p>
<p></p><ul>"although the concept of the ignorant wife leaving all financial decisions to the husband is outmoded, the practice does not yet coincide with the ideal.  In a substantial proportion of marriages it is still the husband who has the business experience and the wife is willing to follow his advice without bringing a truly independent mind and will to bear on financial decisions.  The number of recent cases in this field shows that in practice many wives are still subjected to, and yield to, undue influence by their husbands.  Such wives can reasonably look to the law for some protection when their husbands have abused the trust and confidence reposed in them."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;141. Lord Browne-Wilkinson emphasised, however, the importance of keeping a sense of balance in deciding what degree of protection should be afforded.  He pointed out that "a high proportion of privately owned wealth is invested in the matrimonial home . . . ." and referred to "the need to ensure that the wealth currently tied up in the matrimonial home does not become economically sterile".  He added, at p 188:</p>
<p></p><ul>"If the rights secured to wives by the law renders vulnerable loans granted on the security of matrimonial homes, institutions will be unwilling to accept such security, thereby reducing the flow of loan capital to business enterprises.  It is therefore essential that a law designed to protect the vulnerable does not render the matrimonial home unacceptable as security to financial institutions."<p></p></ul>
<p>Each of these considerations is as relevant and important today as it was when <i>O'Brien</i> was decided.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;142. One of the difficulties is that the protection the wife needs in these cases is a remedy against the bank, or other lender, to whom she is offering the suretyship security.  It is not protection against her husband, who has allegedly procured her to do so by some wrongdoing, that is the problem.  The law has no difficulty in providing an oppressed or deceived wife with a remedy against the wrongdoing husband.  But, in most of the cases with which the House is now concerned, the husband is supporting his wife in her attempt to prevent the bank from enforcing its security.  They stand together in attempting to save the family home.  In these circumstances, Lord Browne-Wilkinson held that the requisite protection for wives against the banks should be provided by the application of the doctrine of constructive notice.  He had in mind that in certain circumstances constructive notice of the husband's impropriety towards his wife could be imputed to the bank.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;143. The doctrine of notice is a doctrine that relates primarily and traditionally to the priority of competing property rights.  Lord Browne-Wilkinson described the operation of the doctrine in this way, at pp 195-196:</p>
<p></p><ul>"the earlier right prevails against the later right if the acquirer of the later right knows of the earlier right (actual notice) or would have discovered it had he taken proper steps (constructive notice).  In particular, if the party asserting that he takes free of the earlier rights of another knows of certain facts which put him on inquiry as to the possible existence of the rights of that other and he fails to make such inquiry or to take such other steps as are reasonable to verify whether such earlier right does or does not exist, he will have constructive notice of the earlier right and take subject to it."<p></p></ul>
<p>This is a classic statement of the operation of the doctrine of notice in order to determine the priority of property rights.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;144. Banks and other lenders who take charges from surety wives are certainly purchasers of property rights.  But they acquire their rights by grant from the surety wives themselves.  The issue between the banks and the surety wives is not one of priority of competing interests.  The issue is whether or not the surety wife is to be bound by her apparent consent to the grant of the security to the bank.  If contractual consent has been procured by undue influence or misrepresentation for which a party to the contract is responsible, the other party, the victim, is entitled, subject to the usual defences of change of position, affirmation, delay etc, to avoid the contract.  But the case is much more difficult if the undue influence has been exerted or the misrepresentation has been made not by the party with whom the victim has contracted, but by a third party.  It is, in general, the objective manifestation of contractual consent that is critical.  Deficiencies in the quality of consent to a contract by a contracting party, brought about by undue influence or misrepresentation by a third party, do not, in general allow the victim to avoid the contract.  But if the other contracting party had had actual knowledge of the undue influence or misrepresentation the victim would not, in my opinion, be held to the contract (see <i>Commission for the New Towns v Cooper (Great Britain) Ltd </i> [1995]  Ch 259, 277-280 and <i>Banco Exterior Internacional SA v Thomas</i> [1997]  1 WLR 221, 229).  But what if there had been no actual knowledge of the third party's undue influence or misrepresentation but merely knowledge of facts or circumstances that, if investigated, might have led to actual knowledge?  In what circumstances does the law expect a contracting party to inquire into the reasons why the other party is entering into the contract or to go behind the other party's apparent agreement, objectively ascertained, to enter into the contract?  These are the questions that Lord Browne-Wilkinson had to answer in <i>O'Brien</i>.  They are contractual questions, not questions relating to competing property interests.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;145. Care must, in my opinion, be taken in applying principles evolved in cases in which the issue has been whether a purchaser was bound by some pre-existing equitable interest in the purchased property to cases in which the issue is whether a contracting party can safely rely on the other contracting party's apparent consent.  Among other things, the onus is different.  If a purchaser acquires property over which there is an existing equitable interest, for example, an equitable charge, it is up to the purchaser to show that he is a purchaser without notice and so is not bound by the equitable interest.  He must show that his conscience is clear.  But if a contracting party, A, acquires an interest under a contract with another contracting party, B, and B wishes to escape from the contract on the ground that his consent to it was procured by the undue influence or a misrepresentation of a third party, A can rely on B's apparent consent to the contract and it is for B to show that A had actual or constructive notice of the undue influence or misrepresentation.  It is, in my opinion, important to recognise that constructive notice, in cases such as those now before the House, is serving a different function from that served by constructive notice in its traditional role and is not necessarily subject to the same rules.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;146. In particular, it must be recognised that in the <i>bank v surety</i> <i>wife</i> cases the constructive notice that is sought to be attributed to the bank is not constructive notice of any pre-existing prior right or prior equity of the wife.  The husband's impropriety, whether undue influence or misrepresentation, in procuring his wife to enter into a suretyship transaction with the bank would not entitle her to set it aside unless the bank had had notice of the impropriety.  It is notice of the husband's impropriety that the bank must have, not notice of any prior rights of the wife.  It is the notice that the bank has of the impropriety that creates the wife's right to set aside the transaction.  The wife does not have any prior right or prior equity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;147. In a case where the financial arrangements with the bank had been negotiated by the husband, no part in the negotiations having been played by the wife, and where the arrangements required the wife to become surety for her husband's debts, the bank would, or should, have been aware of the vulnerability of the wife and of the risk that her agreement might be procured by undue influence or misrepresentation by the husband.  In these circumstances the bank would be "put on inquiry", as Lord Browne-Wilkinson put it.  But "on inquiry" about what?  Not about the existence of undue influence, for how could any inquiry reasonably to be expected of a bank satisfy the bank that there was no undue influence? "On inquiry", in my opinion, as to whether the wife understood the nature and effect of the transaction she was entering into.  This is not an "inquiry" in the traditional constructive notice sense.  The bank would not have to carry out any investigation or to ask any questions about the reasons why the wife was agreeing to the transaction or about her relationship with her husband.  The bank would not, unless it had notice of additional facts pointing to undue influence or misrepresentation, be on notice that undue influence or misrepresentation was to be presumed.  It would simply be on notice of a risk of some such impropriety.  What Lord Browne-Wilkinson had in mind was that the bank should be expected to take reasonable steps to satisfy itself that she understood the transaction she was entering into.  If the bank did so, no longer could constructive notice of any impropriety by the husband in procuring his wife's consent be imputed to it.  The original constructive notice would have been shed.  If, on the other hand, a bank with notice of the risk of some such impropriety, failed to take the requisite reasonable steps, then, if it transpired that the wife's consent had been procured by the husband's undue influence or misrepresentation, constructive knowledge that that was so would be imputed to the bank and the wife would have the same remedies as she would have had if the bank had had actual knowledge of the impropriety.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;148. Under Lord Browne-Wilkinson's scheme for the protection of vulnerable wives it is the bank's perception of the risk that the wife's consent may have been procured by the husband's misrepresentation or undue influence that is central.  The risk must be viewed through the eyes of the bank.  Some degree of risk can, usually, never be wholly eliminated.  But it can be reduced to a point at which it becomes reasonable for the bank to rely on the apparent consent of the wife to enter into the transaction and to take no further steps to satisfy itself that she understood the transaction she was entering into. Lord Browne-Wilkinson thought that, in order to reach this point, the bank should itself give the wife an explanation of the nature and effect of the proposed transaction and should advise her to take independent legal advice.  The function of these steps would be to try and ensure that the wife understood what she was doing in entering into the proposed transaction and that her consent to do so was an informed consent.  But whether these steps would always be necessary, or would always be sufficient, would depend on the facts of the particular case.  Lord Browne-Wilkinson was not legislating; he was suggesting steps that, if taken, would in the normal case entitle a bank to rely on the wife's apparent consent, evidenced by her signature to the document or documents in question.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;149. In each of the <i>wife v bank</i> appeals now before your Lordships, the transactions pre-dated <i>O'Brien</i> and the bank did not have the advantage of the guidance provided by Lord Browne-Wilkinson.  The question to be asked in each of these cases, therefore, is whether at the time the security was granted to the bank, the bank's perception of the risk that the grant might have been procured by the husband's impropriety was such as to have required the bank to take some additional steps to satisfy itself that she understood the nature and effect of the transaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;150. Since Lord Browne-Wilkinson's constructive notice route for providing protection to vulnerable wives who agree to become sureties for their husband's debts was substantially based on the risk that the wife might have been subjected to undue influence by her husband, it is necessary to review the principles of undue influence on which he built that protection.</p>
<i><p><i>Undue influence</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;151. Undue influence cases have, traditionally, been regarded as falling into two classes, cases where undue influence must be affirmatively proved (Class 1) and cases where undue influence will be presumed (Class 2).  The nature of the two classes was described by Slade LJ in<i> Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA </i> [1990]  1 QB 923,  at p 953:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Ever since the judgments of this court in <i>Allcard v Skinner</i> . . . . a clear distinction has been drawn between (1) those cases in which the court will uphold a plea of undue influence only if it is satisfied that such influence has been affirmatively proved on the evidence (commonly referred to as cases of 'actual undue influence . . . ' 'Class 1' cases);  (2) those cases (commonly referred to as cases of 'presumed undue influence . . . ' 'Class 2' cases) in which the relationship between the parties will lead the court to presume that undue influence has been exerted unless evidence is  adduced proving the contrary, eg by showing that the complaining party has had independent advice". <p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;152. This passage provides, if I may respectfully say so, an accurate summary description of the two classes.  But, like most summaries, it requires some qualification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;153. First, the Class 2 presumption is an evidential rebuttable presumption. It shifts the onus from the party who is alleging undue influence to the party who is denying it.  Second, the weight of the presumption will vary from case to case and will depend both on the particular nature of the relationship and on the particular nature of the impugned transaction.  Third, the type and weight of evidence needed to rebut the presumption will obviously depend upon the weight of the presumption itself.  In <i>Allcard v Skinner</i> (1887)  36 Ch D 145 the presumption was a very heavy one.  Correspondingly strong evidence would have been needed to rebut it.  Even independent legal advice would not necessarily have sufficed.  Lindley LJ, at p 184, made clear his view that without legal independent advice the presumption could not have been rebutted but went on to doubt whether independent legal advice would have sufficed "unless there was also proof that she was free to act on the advice which might be given to her".  And in <i>Inche Noriah v Shaik Allie Bin Omar </i> [1929]  AC 127 Lord Hailsham LC said, at p 135:</p>
<p></p><ul>"their Lordships are not prepared to accept the view that independent legal advice is the only way in which the presumption can be rebutted . . ."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;154. The onus will, of course, lie on the person alleging the undue influence to prove in the first instance sufficient facts to give rise to the presumption.  The relationship relied on in support of the presumption will have to be proved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;155. In <i>National Westminster Bank v Morgan</i> [1985]  AC 686, 704 Lord Scarman, referring to the character of the impugned transaction in a Class 2 case, said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"it must constitute a disadvantage sufficiently serious to require evidence to rebut the presumption that in the circumstances of the relationship between the parties it was procured by the exercise of undue influence".<p></p></ul>
<p>Lord Scarman went on:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In my judgment, therefore, the Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that the presumption of undue influence can arise from the evidence of the relationship of the parties without also evidence that the transaction itself was wrongful in that it constituted an advantage taken of the person subjected to the influence which, failing proof to the contrary, was explicable only on the basis that undue influence had been exercised to procure it."<p></p></ul>
<p>With respect to Lord Scarman, the reasoning seems to me to be circular.  The transaction will not be "wrongful" unless it was procured by undue influence.  Its "wrongful" character is a conclusion, not a tool by which to detect the presence of undue influence.  On the other hand, the nature of the transaction, its inexplicability by reference to the normal motives by which people act, may, and usually will, constitute important evidential material.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;156. Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <i>CIBC Mortgages Plc v Pitt</i> [1994]  1 AC 200 pointed out, plainly correctly, that if undue influence is proved, the victim's right to have the transaction set aside will not depend upon the disadvantageous quality of the transaction. Where, however a Class 2 presumption of undue influence is said to arise, the nature of the impugned transaction will always be material, no matter what the relationship between the parties.  Some transactions will be obviously innocuous and innocent.  A moderate gift as a Christmas or birthday present would be an example.  A solicitor who is appointed by a client as his executor and given a legacy of a moderate amount if he consents to act, is not put to proof of the absence of undue influence before he can take the legacy.  If the nun/postulant/novice in <i>Allcard v Skinner </i>had given moderate Christmas presents to the Mother Superior, or to the Sisterhood, no inference that the gifts had been procured by undue influence could be drawn and no presumption of undue influence would have arisen.  It is, in my opinion, the combination of relationship and the nature of the transaction that gives rise to the presumption and, if the transaction is challenged, shifts the onus to the transferee.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;157. In <i>Aboody</i> [1990]  1 QB 923 Slade LJ split the Class 2 cases into two sub-divisions.  He categorised, at p 953, the "well established categories of relationships, such as a religious superior and inferior and doctor and patient where the relationship as such will give rise to the presumption" as Class 2A cases, and confirmed that neither a husband/wife relationship nor a banker/customer relationship would normally give rise to the presumption.  (See also <i> National Westminster Bank Plc v Morgan</i> [1985]  AC 686, 703 and <i>O'Brien </i> [1994]  1 AC 180, 190).  He continued, at p 953:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Nevertheless, on particular facts (frequently referred to in argument as 'Class 2B' cases) relationships not falling within the 'Class 2A' category may be shown to have become such as to justify the court in applying the same presumption."  <p></p></ul>
<p>In <i>O'Brien</i> Lord Browne-Wilkinson adopted Slade LJ's Class 2B category for the purpose of the surety wife cases that he was considering.  He said, at pp 189-190:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Even if there is no relationship falling within Class 2(A), if the complainant proves the de facto existence of a relationship under which the complainant generally reposed trust and confidence in the wrongdoer, the existence of such relationship raises the presumption of undue influence.  In a Class 2(B) case, therefore, in the absence of evidence disproving undue influence, the complainant will succeed in setting aside the impugned transaction merely by proof that the complainant reposed trust and confidence in the wrongdoer without having to prove that the wrongdoer exerted actual undue influence or otherwise abused such trust and confidence in relation to the particular transaction impugned."  <p></p></ul>
