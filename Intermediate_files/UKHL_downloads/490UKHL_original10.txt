<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;283. The relationship between Mr Coleman and Mrs Coleman is of significance.  They are Hassidic Jews.  Mrs Coleman's upbringing and education in a Hassidic community in the United States prepared her to expect and to accept a position of subservience and obedience to the wishes of her husband.  The judge put it thus, at p 24 of his judgment:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The upbringing and education of Mrs Coleman prepared her principally for marriage within her own religious community and for a life of subservience to the wishes of her husband.  I do not mean this in any derogatory sense.  Hers may well have been a happy state, but it was one in which her husband's wishes and judgment in matters of finance and business were to be followed without question."<p></p></ul>
<p>So it seems that the trust and confidence of a wife in her husband, which, notably in relation to family finances and family business matters, is a feature of very many marriages, is accentuated in a Hassidic marriage.  It would, it seems, have been very difficult for Mrs Coleman to have questioned her husband's business or financial decisions or to have declined to comply with his wishes on such matters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;284. In 1989 Mr Coleman, having been made redundant from his job as a diamond cutter, began to carry on business on his own account as a property broker.  Towards the end of 1990 he approached the bank for a loan to enable him to purchase two commercial properties in Uxbridge Road, Hayes.  He already had some £200,000 on deposit with the bank and sought a loan from the bank to assist him in funding a purchase price of £250,000 for the Hayes properties.  At about the same Mr Coleman became interested in buying a half-share in an apartment building in Brooklyn, New York.  He wanted a US$ loan from the bank to assist him in financing this acquisition.  The bank agreed in principle to make the loans but required a charge over 52, Ashtead Road as security.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;285. In January 1991 the bank's security department prepared the form of legal charge and a certificate of occupancy that Mr and Mrs Coleman would be asked to sign.  Mr Coleman informed the bank that Reuben Gale &amp; Co would be the solicitors for them acting in the transaction.  So the bank sent the documents to Reuben Gale &amp; Co and Mr Coleman made an appointment for himself and his wife to attend at Reuben Gale &amp; Co's offices.  They went to the offices on a date somewhere between 9 and 15 January 1991.  They were attended to not by a solicitor but by a legal executive, Mr David Spring, an employee of the firm.  The legal charge was ready to be signed.  Each of them signed it and Mr Spring witnessed each of their signatures.  Mr Spring, in witnessing the signatures, signed above a stamp bearing the legend "D. Spring, Legal Executive, 240 Stamford Hill, London N16."  On the page following the signature page there was a typed endorsement which read:</p>
<p></p><ul>"I confirm that this document was signed in my presence and that the full effect of its contents have been explained to and were understood by Miriam Mara Coleman, and she has signed this document of her own free will."<p></p></ul>
<p>Mr Spring signed his name below this typed endorsement.  Beneath his signature was placed the same stamp as had appeared beneath the signatures on the previous page.  Below this stamp Mr Spring wrote "with R. Gale, 240 Stamford Hill, London N16.  Solicitor."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;286. The significance of these details is threefold.  First, it would have been clear to the bank that Mr Spring was a legal executive and not a qualified solicitor.  Second, it was clear that Mr Spring was purporting to act on behalf of Reuben Gale &amp; Co, the firm of solicitors whose name had been given to the bank by Mr Coleman.  Third, the endorsement entitled the bank to believe that a sufficiently qualified person had explained the contents of the legal charge to Mrs Coleman and that there had been no apparent reluctance on her part to sign.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;287. Mr and Mrs Coleman also signed the certificate of occupancy, showing themselves as the only occupiers of the property.  Here, too, Mr Spring counter-signed the document in confirmation that Mr and Mrs Coleman had signed in his presence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;288. In fact, Mr Spring had given Mrs Coleman no explanation whatever of the contents of the legal charge.  The evidence at trial was that he had simply asked Mr Coleman if he, Mr Coleman, had explained the documents to his wife.  The meeting had lasted only a few minutes.  The bank's internal notes disclose the bank's own understanding of what had taken place at the meeting with Mr Spring.  The relevant note reads:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Prior to the signing of the … documentation with regard to [the mortgaged property] Mrs Coleman attended a local firm of independent solicitors, whereby she received legal advice, as to the bank's Charge Forms content.  Her signature was witnessed by those solicitors who confirmed that the document was signed of her own free will."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;289. Mr Coleman's property speculations for which he had sought the bank's assistance turned out to be financially disastrous.  He was unable to repay his borrowing from the Bank and proceedings by the Bank for possession of 52, Ashtead Road with a view to its sale followed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;290. Notwithstanding Mr Jarvis' concession to which I have already referred, I should, I think, make one or two comments about the undue influence issue.  First, I agree that this was a case in which the relationship between Mr Coleman and Mrs Coleman, in the cultural context of the Hassidic community of which they formed a part, raised a serious question whether Mrs Coleman's consent to the granting of the legal charge was a true consent.  She gave evidence that if she had had the content and effect of the legal charge explained to her, she might have declined to sign it.  I doubt this.  The thrust of her evidence as to her relationship with her husband was that she was bound to defer to him in the judgment of what should or should not be done about family finances or with family assets.  It is not consistent with that evidence to suppose that a better understanding of the nature and effect of the legal charge would have brought her to refuse to comply with her husband's request that she sign.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;291. I think the Court of Appeal was quite right in regarding this as a case in which there was a presumption of undue influence.  But the presumption was not, in my opinion, attributable to the "manifest disadvantage" to Mrs Coleman of the legal charge.  The legal charge, supporting her husband's business ventures on which he engaged in order to support his family, was no more disadvantageous to her than any transaction in which a wife agrees to become surety in order to support her husband's commercial activities. The presumption arose, in my opinion, out of their relationship, in which Mrs Coleman was not merely disinclined to second-guess her husband on matters of business, but appears to have regarded herself as obliged not to do so.  In such a case, in my opinion, the rebuttal of the presumption would have needed legal advice from someone independent of the husband who could have impressed upon her that she should not sign unless she truly wanted to do so.  In the circumstances, I agree with the Court of Appeal that a presumption, or inference, of undue influence arose and was not rebutted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;292. But in considering the issue of constructive notice, the question is not how the case appeared to Mrs Coleman, or to the person purporting to have given her the legal advice;  it is how the case appeared to the bank.  There was no evidence to show that the bank had knowledge of any greater risk of undue influence than might be present in any case in which a wife was apparently agreeing to become surety, or give security, for her husband's business debts.  It would reasonably have appeared to the bank, from the typed endorsement on the legal charge, that Mrs Coleman had received advice from a legally qualified person acting for her, so as to enable her to understand the contents and effect of the document she was signing.  The fact that the advice had been given by a legal executive and not by a qualified solicitor is not, in my opinion, material.  An experienced legal executive in a firm with a conveyancing practice is well able to give full and adequate advice as to the contents and effect of a straightforward legal charge.  The bank were entitled to believe that Reuben Gale &amp; Co would not entrust such a task to a legal executive with insufficient experience to carry out the task properly.  The bank had no reason to think that any special precautions needed to be taken in Mrs Coleman's case than would be requisite in any other case of a wife giving security for her husband's debts.  In my opinion, the bank, having read the endorsement on the legal charge, was entitled to hold the reasonable belief that Mrs Coleman's consent to the granting of the legal charge had not been improperly obtained.  There were no other steps that the bank could reasonably be required to have taken.  Constructive notice of Mr Coleman's undue influence cannot, in my opinion, be imputed to the bank.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;293. I would, therefore, dismiss Mrs Coleman's appeal.</p>

<p><i>UCB Home Loans Corporation Ltd v Moore</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;294. This case comes to your Lordships' House on an appeal by Mrs Moore against an order striking-out her Defence to UCB's claim to possession of Pangbourne Lodge, Tidmarsh Road, Pangbourne, Berkshire.  The relevant facts, therefore, must be taken to be those pleaded by Mrs Moore, supplemented by such facts as are common ground between the parties.  Mrs Moore and her husband, Mr Moore, were, in 1988, the joint owners of Pangbourne Lodge, their matrimonial home.  Mr Moore carried on business through the medium of a company, Corporate Software Ltd.  The company had 5000 issued shares of which 2557 were held by Mr Moore and 2443 by Mrs Moore.  They were both directors.  The conduct of the business, however, was under his control and although Mrs Moore worked for the company in a secretarial and administrative capacity, she did so under her husband's direction.  Mrs Moore has pleaded that she was "accustomed to obey [Mr Moore's] directions in relation to the company's affairs . . . ."  It is implicit in her pleading that she reposed trust and confidence in her husband in relation to financial and business matters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;295. In 1988 Mr Moore was seeking additional finance for the company and for that purpose enlisted the services of a Mr Zerfahs.  Mr Zerfahs, who traded as Southern Assurance Services, was a registered insurance broker and had been the company's pension adviser for the past four years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;296. At the insistence of Mr Moore, and induced by his representations that the proposed mortgage transaction related to a "risk free" loan to the company, Mrs Moore signed in blank a mortgage application form.  The details in this form were added without her knowledge and after she had signed.  So she has pleaded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;297. The details contained in, or added to, the signed form included the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The amount of the desired loan was £300,000;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) The solicitors acting for Mr and Mrs Moore would be Quiney &amp; Harris of 117 High Street, Wootton Bassett, Swindon;  Mr Nigel Whittaker was named as the member of the firm who would be dealing with the matter;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Pangbourne Lodge would be offered as security for the loan;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) The loan was required partly to re-finance existing borrowings charged on Pangbourne Lodge and partly for the business purposes of Corporate Software Ltd;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) Mr Moore was managing director of Corporate Software Ltd.  His annual income was £106,000.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) Mrs Moore was "Secretary/PA" of Corporate Software Ltd.  Her annual income was £18,000.</p>
<p>The original amount entered on the form as Mr Moore's annual income appears to have been £36,000.  The £36,000 had been altered to £106,000, a grossly inflated figure.  That there had been some alteration to the original figure was apparent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;298. The mortgage application form, carrying both Mr and Mrs Moore's signatures, was sent to UCB.  UCB agreed to make the loan on the security of a first charge over Pangbourne Lodge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;299. On 14 March 1989 Mr Zerfahs told Quiney &amp; Harris that Mr and Mrs Moore wanted the firm to act for them in connection with the proposed transaction.  Mr Zerfahs had no authority from Mrs Moore to do so.  She never instructed the firm to act for her and at no stage did she meet or speak to any member of the firm about the proposed transaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;300. On 14 March Quiney &amp; Harris wrote to Southern Assurance Services saying, amongst other things, that they had written to Mr and Mrs Moore thanking them for their instructions.  Mrs Moore's case is that she never saw any such letter.  Quiney &amp; Harris corresponded directly with Mr Moore and had several telephone conversations with him about the proposed transaction.  They never received any confirmation from Mrs Moore of their instructions to act for her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;301. UCB, of course, believed from the contents of the mortgage application form that Quiney &amp; Harris had been instructed by, and were acting for, both Mr and Mrs Moore.  So, in a letter dated 5 May 1989, UCB asked Quiney &amp; Harris to act for UCB in arranging for the legal charge to be executed.  UCB did not ask the solicitors to give any advice to Mrs Moore.  Quiney &amp; Harris' letter to UCB in response referred to Mr and Mrs Moore as "our clients".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;302. The legal charge was in due course executed and the £300,000 loan was made.  £154,338 odd was applied in redeeming an existing first charge over Pangbourne Lodge held by BNP Mortgages Ltd.  £52,925 odd was applied in discharging the company's overdraft liability to National Westminster Bank.  The overdraft had been secured by a second charge over Pangbourne Lodge.  The balance of the £300,000 loan was paid to the company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;303. The company was unsuccessful and went into liquidation in January 1992.  In February 1994 UCB brought possession proceedings in the Reading County Court.  Mrs Moore's defence alleged that her signature to the mortgage application form and her consent to the grant of the legal charge to UCB had been obtained by the undue influence of and misrepresentations made by Mr Moore.  She gave further and better particulars of these allegations.  UCB applied, on 30 May 1996, to strike-out those parts of the defence that resisted a possession order.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;304. UCB contended that even if there had been undue influence or misrepresentation they had had no notice of it.  The district judge dismissed the strike-out application.  UCB appealed and Judge Holden allowed the appeal.  He accepted, for the purposes of the strike-out, that Quiney &amp; Harris had never been instructed by Mrs Moore and had given her no advice.  He said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"For the purposes of the appeal before me I must accept [Mrs Moore's] version of the facts and assume that there was undue influence and that she received no advice from the solicitors and did not instruct them."<p></p></ul>
<p>But he accepted UCB's case that they had had the reasonable belief, via the mortgage application form signed by Mrs Moore, that Quiney &amp; Harris were acting for her and would give her whatever advice she needed.  He said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"[UCB] reasonably believed that [Mr and Mrs Moore] had their own solicitors who were dealing with the transaction and it was quite reasonable for them to assume that in carrying out that function those solicitors would give proper advice to [Mrs Moore]."<p></p></ul>
<p>In effect, he held that constructive notice of Mr Moore's undue influence or misrepresentation could not be imputed to UCB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;305. The Court of Appeal agreed with Judge Holden that Quiney &amp; Harris' knowledge that they had given Mrs Moore no advice about or explanation of the legal charge could not be imputed to UCB.  They agreed that there was nothing, in the circumstances, to put UCB on  enquiry : per Stuart-Smith LJ [1998] 4 All ER 705, 731:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It was not necessary for [UCB] to give instructions to the solicitors to do what was already their duty;  nor was it necessary to require certification that that has been done."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;306. I have some sympathy with these conclusions but I do not think they could safely be reached on the striking out application.  UCB knew that Mrs Moore was offering her share in the matrimonial home, Pangbourne Lodge, as security for the £300,000 loan to the company.  But over two-thirds of the loan was to be applied in discharging existing indebtedness charged on Pangbourne Lodge.  The balance was to go to the company in whose business Mrs Moore, as well as Mr Moore, played a part.  UCB was, or should have been, aware of a risk that Mrs Moore's apparent consent might be tainted by undue influence or misrepresentation, but the risk would not have appeared to be a very great one.  And the information that Mr and Mrs Moore had solicitors acting for them reduced the risk.  It is not to the point that Mrs Moore had never instructed Quiney &amp; Harris.  UCB were not to know that that was so.  They had been misled by the contents of the mortgage application form that Mrs Moore had signed in blank.  It would be possible to argue that Mrs Moore, by signing in blank, had given an implied authority to her husband, or to his agent Mr Zerfahs, to complete the form on her behalf.  It is enough, however, to conclude that UCB were entitled to take the mortgage application at its face value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;307. But the problem is that UCB did not know what Quiney &amp; Harris' instructions were and had no reason to assume that their instructions extended to giving Mrs Moore advice about the nature and effect of the legal charge.  The instructions may have been no more than to agree the form of the security documents and make arrangements for them to be executed.  Quiney &amp; Harris gave UCB no indication that they had given Mrs Moore any such advice and in fact they had not done so.  In my opinion, therefore, on the evidence as it now stands UCB failed to take reasonable steps to satisfy itself that Mrs Moore understood the nature and effect of the legal charge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;308. Mr Sher QC, counsel for Mrs Moore, suggested that UCB should have been put on enquiry by the apparent alteration to the stated amount of Mr Moore's annual income.  This, to my mind, is very much an after-the-event point.  If there had been some other reason to question the genuineness of the mortgage application, the alteration of the annual amount would, I agree, have added to the suspicion.  But there was no other reason and the alteration was, in my opinion, a long way below the threshold at which an intending lender is put on enquiry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;309. In my opinion, however, for the reason I have given Mrs Moore's appeal should be allowed.  This case must go to trial.</p>
<i><p><i></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i>The Bank of Scotland v Bennett</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;310. This is another case which comes to the House after a full trial.  The bank is seeking to enforce its charge over the matrimonial home, 15, Elthiron Road, Fulham.  The property was acquired by Mr and Mrs Bennett in May 1986 and transferred into their joint names.  At all material times it has been subject to a first charge in favour of Halifax Building Society.  On 5 September 1990, the property was transferred into Mrs Bennett's sole name.  The bank's charge, a second charge, was dated 1 October 1991.  The purpose of the charge was to secure the liabilities of Mr and Mrs Bennett under a guarantee dated 12 August 1991.  The guarantee guaranteed payment to the bank, up to a limit of £150,000, of the sums owing to the bank by Galloway Seafood Co Ltd (the company).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;311. In October 1993 the bank made a formal demand for payment by the company of the sums it owed the bank and, on failing to receive payment, appointed receivers of the company.  The sum owed by the company to the bank was £270,000 or thereabouts.  The bank followed up these steps by calling on Mr and Mrs Bennett for payment under the guarantee of the £150,000 with interest of £3,522 odd.  Payment was not made and on 11 April 1994 the bank commenced proceedings for payment and for possession of 15, Elthiron Road with a view to its sale.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;312. Mrs Bennett's defence to the bank's claims was that her signature, both to the guarantee and to the legal charge, had been procured by her husband's undue influence and that, in the circumstances, the bank must be taken to have had constructive notice of that impropriety.  The trial judge, Mr James Munby QC, sitting as a deputy judge in the Chancery Division, found in Mrs Bennett's favour on the undue influence issue.  He found, first, that Mrs Bennett had established actual undue influence [1997] 1 FLR 801, 827:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In my judgment the pressure and influence which, as I have found, Mr Bennett exerted on his wife both to procure her signature to the guarantee and to procure her signature to the charge was undue.  This is a case in which, in my judgment, there was moral blackmail amounting to coercion and victimisation.  Mrs Bennett was not, it seems to me, acting as a free and voluntary agent".   <p></p></ul>
<p>On appeal, the Court of Appeal refused to disturb the deputy judge's conclusion on undue influence [1999] 1 FLR 1115, 1134.  Chadwick LJ said that to reverse the judge's conclusion "would . . . be to give insufficient weight to the advantage which the judge had (and which this court does not have) of hearing the evidence given by the witness in person".  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;313. The deputy judge went on to consider, as an alternative to actual undue influence, Mrs Bennett's case based on presumed undue influence.  He held that both the guarantee and the legal charge were manifestly disadvantageous to Mrs Bennett and that the relationship between her and her husband was one of sufficient trust and confidence to raise a presumption of undue influence in relation to both transactions ([1997] 1 FLR 801, 828-830).  He held that the presumption had not been rebutted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;314. On this aspect of the case, Chadwick LJ commented, at [1999] 1 FLR 1115, 1135, on the paradox that Mrs Bennett was contending, on the one hand, that she had signed the two documents because her will to resist had been overborne by her husband but, on the other hand, that her trust and confidence in her husband was such that if he asked her to sign she would do so.  The point is the same as that to which I have referred in <i>Coleman</i> (see para 290 above).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;315.  The discussion about the presumption of undue influence was unnecessary.  Once actual undue influence has been found at trial, the question whether, if the evidence had been confined to the relationship between the parties and the nature of the impugned transaction, undue influence would have been presumed and, if it would, whether it had been rebutted, becomes irrelevant.  And if, after a full trial, the judge concludes that undue influence has not been established, that conclusion means either that there never was a presumption of undue influence or, if there was, that it has been rebutted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;316. The deputy judge's and the Court of Appeal's conclusions on the undue influence issue had the result that the outcome of the case appeared to depend on the constructive notice issue.  It was accepted that the bank had had no actual notice of the undue influence.  Should constructive notice be imputed to the bank?  The deputy judge, after considering the facts of the case, concluded that the bank had been put on enquiry as to the circumstances in which Mrs Bennett had agreed to sign the guarantee and the legal charge and had failed to take reasonable steps "to satisfy itself that Mrs Bennett's agreement . . . was properly obtained" ([1997] 1 FLR 801, 807).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;317. On this issue the Court of Appeal disagreed.  Chadwick LJ said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"I am satisfied that the bank was entitled to take the view, on the totality of the facts known to it, that there was no real risk that Mrs Bennett's apparent consent to the transaction and, in particular, to the charge— had been obtained by improper conduct on the part of her husband." ([1999] 1 FLR 1115, 1143).<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Bennett's appeal to the House challenges this conclusion.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;318. I must now refer to the facts of the case relevant to the constructive notice issue.  They are set out in detail in the judgments below.  It is not necessary for present purposes to refer to more than the most important of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;319. In 1990 Mr Bennett decided to purchase a fish processing business in south-west Scotland.  He caused the company, Galloway Seafood Co Ltd, to be incorporated for that purpose.  The initial capital of the company was £150,000, provided as to £50,000 by Mr Bennett and £100,000 by South West Scotland Investment Fund Ltd (SWIFT).  Shares in the company were issued to SWIFT, Mr Bennett and Mrs Bennett.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;320. Additional capital was needed in order to finance the purchase of the fish processing business and to provide the company with working capital.  The bank agreed to allow the company overdraft facilities up to £100,000, supported by a guarantee from Mr Bennett.  This guarantee, and Mr Bennett's potential liability under it, was the reason why the matrimonial home, formerly in joint names, was transferred into Mrs Bennett's sole name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;321. Mr Bennett had solicitors acting for him in connection with the transfer of the property to Mrs Bennett.  They were Dickinson, Manser &amp; Co of Poole.  Mr Parkyn, a partner, dealt with the matter.  The deputy judge's judgment records telephone conversations between Mr Parkyn and Mrs Bennett regarding the transfer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;322. Over a period from the end of 1990 to July 1991 Mr Bennett negotiated an arrangement with the bank under which the bank would increase the company's overdraft facility to £380,000.  Mr Bennett intended that the money would be used to build a new factory on land which the company was to purchase or lease from Dumfries and Galloway Regional Council.  The company's bank overdraft was to be secured by a fixed and floating charge over the company's new factory and business and by a joint and several guarantee of the company's debts to the bank, up to a limit of £150,000, to be given by Mr and Mrs Bennett.  Their liability under this guarantee was to be secured by a second charge over 15, Elthiron Road.  In addition, SWIFT agreed to advance £275,000 to the company.  The advance was to be secured by a fixed charge over the company's new factory.  Mr Bennett, SWIFT and the bank agreed that SWIFT's charge was to rank ahead of the bank's fixed and floating charges for a sum not exceeding £250,000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;323. Mr Bennett instructed Mr Parkyn to act in connection with the grant by Mrs Bennett of the second charge over 15, Elthiron Road.  The instructions were given by telephone.  Mr Parkyn's attendance note records:</p>
<p></p><ul>"(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;The seafood company in Scotland is on the threshold of building a new factory.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;We can expect to hear from the Bank of Scotland in Dumfries (John Martin) who are looking for additional security of £150,000 on their home.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;Confirm we would be willing to act."<p></p></ul>
<p>It is to be noted that Mr Parkyn did not receive instructions to act in connection with the guarantee to be given by Mr and Mrs Bennett.  It appears that he knew nothing about that transaction.  Nor did he know anything about the financial arrangements between the company, the bank and SWIFT.</p>
