<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Third Civil Section of the Court of Appeal of Bucharest gave a careful and detailed decision on the content of the rights of the respondent father in the present case.  It held unequivocally that the parent to whom custody was not awarded only acquired the right (under the law at the material time when the child was removed) to visit the child and to watch over his upbringing, education and professional training, none of which rights grants him the power to make any decisions concerning the person of the child, therefore he is not entitled to decide upon his dwelling place or upon changing this.  It accordingly upheld the decision of the Fourth Civil Section of the Court of Appeal that the removal of the child was not illegal, because the father did not have rights of custody.  Given the clear exposition of the fasciculus of rights vested in the father, the English court should in my opinion have proceeded to consider the determination of rights of custody expressed by the Romanian court, which, although not conclusive, should have carried substantial weight.  It was quite wrong to permit the father to adduce further expert evidence from Dr Mihai which challenged not only the conclusion but the statement of the content of the father's rights set out in the judgment of the Romanian court.  The English court should have considered the terms of the judgment itself, without any subsequently obtained expert evidence.  If it had done so it could only have come to the same conclusion as the Romanian court, even without applying any presumption in its favour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73.&nbsp;&nbsp;I accordingly consider that the respondent father did not have rights of custody within the meaning of the Hague Convention and that the child was not wrongfully removed from the Romanian jurisdiction.  The conclusion reached by Hogg J and the Court of Appeal was incorrect and the appeal should be allowed on this ground.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lady Hale and Lord Hope have discussed in some detail the effect of rights of access, rights to determine the child's place of residence and rights to object to the removal of a child from the jurisdiction.  They have pointed up the conflict between the line of authority represented by such cases as <i>Croll v Croll </i>229 F 3d 113 (2d Cir 2000) and the prevailing English and Scottish decisions.  They both favour the conclusion that a ne exeat<i> </i>clause gives rights of custody.  I appreciate the cogency of the reasons which they give in support of that conclusion, but I should prefer to reserve my opinion on the issue until it falls directly for decision in a case before the House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75.&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge in the Family Division and the Court of Appeal also rejected the mother's case advanced under article 13 of the Convention.  In view of the conclusion reached by the House on rights of custody, it is not necessary for us to consider the article 13 case, but I should be slow to reverse the concurrent findings of two lower courts on such an issue.  Hogg J gave a reasoned decision under the intolerable situation limb of article 13(b) and the Court of Appeal upheld it.  Unless that decision was plainly wrong - and while I have considerable sympathy for the position in which the child would be placed if returned to Romania, I could not so regard the decision - the House would not be justified in reversing it.  Nor should it readily upset the decision to refuse to allow the child to be represented.  I would only observe that although the child in this case is much more mature than when the proceedings began, some care has to be taken in deciding on the weight to be given to the views expressed by a child of seven years, bearing in mind the misapprehensions which children can entertain and the limited extent of such a child's insight into his own best interests.  Courts would, however, do well to take careful account of the factors now favouring hearing the child's views which Lady Hale has set out in paragraphs 57 to 62 of her opinion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reasons which I have given I would allow the appeal and dismiss the originating summons whereby the father applied for the return of the child to Romania.</p>
LORD BROWN OF EATON-UNDER-HEYWOOD
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an extraordinary case.  It is, we are told, unique in the length of time which elapsed before the judge's order for the child's summary return to Romania (over three years after the commencement of Hague Convention proceedings); and unique too in being the only case in which a United Kingdom court has rejected a foreign court's article 15 determination that the child's removal was not in the event wrongful within the meaning of article 3.  It is solely upon the article 15 aspect of the case that I wish to add a short judgment of my own, gratefully adopting the detailed exposition of the law and facts to be found in the speech of my noble and learned friend Baroness Hale of Richmond.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78.&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 15 itself I should for convenience set out again:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The judicial or administrative authorities of a contracting state may, prior to the making of an order for the return of the child, request that the applicant obtain from the authorities of the state of the habitual residence of the child a decision or other determination that the removal or retention was wrongful within the meaning of article 3 of the Convention, where such a decision or determination may be obtained in that state.  The central authorities of the contracting states shall so far as practicable assist applicants to obtain such a decision or determination."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79.&nbsp;&nbsp;The courts in this country, I may note, are themselves able to make article 15 determinations with regard to children removed from, or retained outside, the UK by virtue of section 8 of the Child Abduction and Custody Act 1985:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The High Court or Court of Session may, on an application made for the purposes of article 15 of the Convention by any person appearing to the court to have an interest in the matter, make a declaration or declarator that the removal of any child from, or his retention outside, the United Kingdom was wrongful within the meaning of article 3 of the Convention."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, we are told, no article 15 determination has ever been requested from a UK court although from time to time our courts do, it appears, make declarations purportedly under section 8 for all the world as if pursuant to an article 15 application.  Holman J's grant of an ex parte application for such a declaration in <i>In re H (Child Abduction) (Unmarried father: rights of custody)</i> [2003]  EWHC 492 (Fam) [2003] 2 FLR 153 is a case in point:</p>
<p></p><ul>"At first glance, article 15, when read alone, may suggest that the trigger for a decision or other determination under that article has to be a request from the judicial or administrative authorities of a contracting state.  But it has been well established for several years here, by authority of the Court of Appeal, that it is not necessary for someone in the position of this father to await or seek a formal request from the judicial or administrative authorities of another contracting state; and that article 15 of the Hague Convention and the wider terms of section 8 of the 1985 Act, when taken together, contemplate and empower this court to make such a declaration even before there are any proceedings in, or any request from, a foreign contracting state.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>I should stress, however, that it is a strong thing for any court to make a declaration of this kind on a without notice application and in circumstances in which the court has heard no argument to the contrary of that submitted by the applicant.  In my view, a court should only make a declaration of this kind on a without notice basis if it is satisfied that the circumstances are so clear as not to admit of any real argument." (p 156)<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80.&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming (without deciding) that such declarations may properly be made, in my judgment it is plain that they should carry altogether less weight than true article 15 determinations, ie determinations made in response to a foreign state's request.  A true article 15 determination will almost certainly have been made following the full inter partes<i> </i>argument.  Quite possibly, as here, it will have been appealed and become final and binding between the parties.  For the very reason that the process must inevitably take an appreciable time (and thus delay what is intended to be an essentially summary process) it will presumably only have been requested in the first place because no other means of answering the critical questions appeared satisfactory.  The questions are first, what are the rights of the left behind parent under the law of his or her home country and, secondly, are those rights "rights of custody" within the meaning of article 5 of the Convention.  The other possible means of answering these questions—in particular the first—are by way of a certificate or affidavit such as may accompany or supplement the initiating application for the child's return pursuant to article 8(f) or, pursuant to article 14, evidence as to the foreign country's law (including any relevant judicial or administrative decisions), ordinarily adduced by expert witnesses.  It was only because the judge here felt unable to resolve the conflict between the rival expert witnesses on Romanian law that he felt the need for "an authoritative decision as to whether or not [the child's removal] was, for the purpose of the Hague Convention, in breach of the father's rights of custody under the Convention" to be "increasingly plain", and therefore asked the father to obtain an article 15 determination which in the event was only finally communicated two years later on 9 June 2005.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81.&nbsp;&nbsp;In circumstances like these it seems to me almost inconceivable that the court requesting the article 15 determination would then not simply accept it.  Certainly there would need to be some compelling reason to reject it such as a flagrant breach of the rules of natural justice in the foreign judicial process or a manifest misdirection as to the autonomous meaning of the Convention term "rights of custody".  There is nothing of that sort here.  On the contrary, the judge—neither Johnson J (who had requested the determination) nor Hogg J (who later ordered the child's return to Romania)—on 1 August 2005, acting merely on the father's request, ordered that an expert in Romanian law be jointly instructed by both parties to cover exactly the same ground as the Romanian Appeal Courts had themselves just covered.  This decision seems to me incomprehensible unless perhaps it is to be explained by reference to the Court of Appeal's judgments in <i>Hunter v Murrow (Abduction: Rights of Custody)</i> [2005] EWCA Civ 976 [2005] 2 FLR 1119 which had been handed down just three days previously on 28 July 2005.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lady Hale has indicated the substance of <i>Hunter v Murrow</i> at paragraph 42 of her opinion and at paragraph 43 has explained why the Court of Appeal understandably felt able to reject the New Zealand court's article 15 determination in the particular circumstances of that case. What concerns me, however, about <i>Hunter v Murrow</i> (and what may possibly have misled the judge in our case) is what I understand to be the Court of Appeal's view as to the weight to be attached to an article 15 declaration.  That, it appears from paragraphs 53-55 of Dyson LJ's judgment, is no more than such respect as comity requires to be given to any foreign judgment, which in turn is no more than the respect afforded by an appellate court to a judgment on the law by an experienced first instance judge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83.&nbsp;&nbsp;I profoundly disagree with this approach which seems to be based on demonstrably false reasoning.  It rests above all on the judgments  both of the Court of Appeal and this House in <i>In re J (A Minor) (Abduction: Custody Rights)</i> [1990]  2 AC 562 which, as Lady Hale points out, was not an article 15 case at all.  <i>In re J</i> was rather, just like Holman J's case of <i>In re H</i> to which I referred at paragraph 79 above, a case where, on a father's ex parte application following the child's removal to England, and without any request for an article 15 determination, the judge declared the removal wrongful.  Quite why Lord Donaldson of Lymington MR, in the only reasoned judgment in the Court of Appeal, referred to article 15 at all (least of all as a provision akin to article 14) is unclear.  Certainly Lord Brandon of Oakbrook, in the only reasoned speech in this House, made no mention of it.  <i>In re J</i> in my judgment provides no authority whatever for treating an article 15 determination as one deserving only of respect.  I repeat, on the rare occasions on which such determinations may be expected to be sought, they should to my mind be treated almost invariably as conclusive on both limbs of the issue to which they are ultimately directed: "whether the removal or return was wrongful within the meaning of article 3 of the Convention."  Certainly that was so here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, which are not, I think, materially different from those given on this central issue by Lord Hope of Craighead and by Lady Hale, with both of whose opinions on all issues I am in respectful agreement, I too would allow the appeal.</p>
