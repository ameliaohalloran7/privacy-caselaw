<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;155.&nbsp;&nbsp;What the argument comes to is this.  All that can be disregarded is, first, "the effect on land's value of a power of compulsory acquisition" and, second, "the actual carrying out of the works".  As to the first, the valuer must disregard the fact that, in the hands of a purchaser with powers of compulsory acquisition, the land will be more valuable because of that purchaser's power both to acquire such other land as is necessary to develop the order land's potential and also to do so more speedily than would be achievable by a purchaser without such powers.  As to the second, the valuer must not assume that the proposed works have already been carried out in pursuance of the scheme (whether on the order land itself or on any other land comprised within the scheme), but only that there is now the potential to carry them out.  That potential, however, <i>is</i> to be brought into account in assessing the open market value of the land.  It would only fall to be disregarded if rule 3 were to apply.  It is not to be disregarded under the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> rule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;156.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would firmly reject the argument.  If correct, it would emasculate the no-scheme rule to the point of extinction.  Of course it is right to disregard those particular matters which Mr Holgate recognises must be disregarded.  But they would surely fall to be disregarded in any event and without reference to the no-scheme rule:  indeed, I find it difficult to see them as enhancing the land's open market value in the first place, particularly in the light of rules 1 and 2.  The <i>potential</i> of the land as a result of the scheme (including any key value it may have) is, however, as I readily accept, a factor which enhances the land's open market value and something, therefore, which either is, or is not, to be disregarded under the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> rule.  In my judgment it is and there is nothing in the Indian case, on which the appellants' arguments so strongly relies, to gainsay this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;157.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point to be made is this.  The relationship between the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> principle and <i>Stokes v Cambridge Corporation</i> 13 P &amp; CR 77 was considered, apparently for the first time, in <i>Batchelor v Kent County Council</i> 59 P &amp; CR 357 and on this issue certainly I find Mann LJ's judgment, at p 361,  entirely convincing:</p>
<p></p><ul>"I find no difficulty with the relationship.  If a premium value is 'entirely due to the scheme underlying the acquisition' then it must be disregarded.  If it was pre-existent to the acquisition it must in my judgment be regarded.  To ignore the pre-existent value would be to expropriate it without compensation and would be to contravene the fundamental principle of equivalence (see <i>Horn v Sunderland Corporation</i>)."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;158.&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming, however, that any premium value, or indeed any other particular value, of the land <i>were</i> "entirely due to the scheme underlying the acquisition" (or, if one prefers, Lord Nicholls' formulation in <i>Director of Buildings and Lands v Shun Fung Ironworks Ltd</i> due to the "very scheme of which the [acquisition] forms an integral part"), then in my judgment, notwithstanding that it represents the land's "unrealised potentiality" (to use Mr Holgate's expression), it clearly falls to be disregarded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;159.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 6 of the 1961 Act, which is clearly related to the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> rule, has as its sidenote: "Disregard of actual or prospective development in certain cases", and, where it applies, it requires the disregard of "any increase … in … value … attributable to the carrying out or the prospect of so much of the development mentioned … as would not have been likely to be carried out if … the acquiring authority had not acquired and did not propose to acquire any of that land".  The Law Commission's proposed new rule 13 (4) (b) (ii), it may be noted, would similarly require in respect of the order land the disregard of "the prospect of" the relevant project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;160.&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach is entirely consistent too with that adopted in the New South Wales legislation (see para 138 above), requiring as it does the disregard of any increased value in the land "caused by the carrying out of, <i>or the proposal to carry out</i>, the public purpose for which the land was acquired" (emphasis added).</p>
<i>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;161.&nbsp;&nbsp;What, then, of the Indian case?  Can this avail the appellants?  In my judgment not.  If the Indian case is properly to be characterised as a two-scheme case—"the acquisition . . . of the shallow basin forming the catchment area of the spring, the site of the spring itself, and a narrow strip of land below the spring" (as Lord Romer described it) being separate from the harbour project—then plainly there could be no disregard of the enhanced value of the water supply through its proximity to the harbour which Lord Romer rightly recognised the acquired land to have.  I have no doubt that Carnwath LJ was right to regard the Indian case in that way—see para 93 of his judgment—and note that his approach precisely mirrors that adopted by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in <i>Perry</i> 116 LGERA 244 .  As Handley JA said at p 256, para 59:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The distinction between [the Indian case] and <i>Pointe</i> <i>Gourde</i> therefore is that in the former there were two schemes and in the latter only one."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;162.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hodgson JA added at p 262, para 96:</p>
<p></p><ul>"[The Indian case] can then be reconciled with the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> principle on the basis that the scheme for the purposes of which the acquisition was made in [the Indian case] was a scheme for the provision of water to land to the south of the harbour which was being developed, and not the original scheme for the development of the harbour and adjacent land.  Accordingly, compensation could be assessed on the basis of potentialities arising from the original scheme."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;163.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, accordingly hold that, once the scheme under which the land is being compulsorily acquired has been identified to include some wider project (as here and as in <i>Pointe Gourde</i> but not in the Indian case), the "unrealised potentiality" of the order land due to the scheme falls to be disregarded no less than its "realised potentiality".  That, indeed, is why the Law Commission's proposed new rule 13 (4) (a) requires the valuer to assume the scheme's cancellation.  The appellants' contrary case as to the true nature of the disregard could succeed only if the <i>Pointe Gourde </i>rule was henceforth to be applied altogether more restrictively than ever before (or, indeed, as Lord Scott would hold, if it were to be found not to have survived the 1961 Act), <i>and</i> if rule 3 (which, of course, Mr Holgate recognises <i>does</i>, where it applies, require unrealised potentiality to be disregarded) was as impotent as for many years it has been thought to be (although which, on Lord Scott's approach, would now be revivified).  That the appellants should be right on both limbs of the argument cannot be countenanced.  For my part I would hold that their argument fails on the first limb.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;164.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the result I would dismiss this appeal.  In doing so, however, I would acknowledge the present highly unsatisfactory state of the law and echo Carnwath LJ's plea in the court below for fresh parliamentary consideration of this important area of the law.  There can be, as he put it at p 414, para 116, "few stronger candidates on the statute-book for urgent reform, or simple repeal, than section 6 and Schedule 1 of the 1961 Act".  It is to be hoped that your Lordships' opinions on this appeal coupled with the Law Commission's exemplary report may pave the way for further legislation.</p>
