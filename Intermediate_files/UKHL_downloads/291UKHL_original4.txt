<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74.&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the Act was designed to improve the enforcement of the children's civil right. That must be a legitimate aim. But was it a proportionate response to that legitimate aim to remove the right of the parent with care to enforce the substantive obligation directly? I do not find that an easy question to answer. The comparative study prepared for this case by Professor Wikeley shows that it is not a necessary feature of comparable child support schemes elsewhere in the common law world. While the child support scheme was under review in the late 1990s, there was considerable debate about whether the courts should regain their power to make the basic award on the application of the parent with care. The formula would remain the same in all cases, but parents who were not receiving means-tested benefits would be able to apply to the courts rather than the Agency to award it. This was, however, rejected after careful consideration by the Government (their final conclusions on the role of the courts can be seen in <i>A new contract for welfare: Children's rights and parents' responsibilities</i>, 1999, Cm 4349, chapter 8). One can see why. The Government did not want to create 'one law for the rich and one for the poor'. It would be difficult to apply to the common case where the parent with care is sometimes in receipt of relevant benefits and sometimes not. The families who can be sure that they will never claim such benefits can still, with careful planning and advice, make use of the courts' residual powers to avoid the Agency if that is what they wish to do. Contrary to popular belief, there are many separating parents who are not at loggerheads with one another and who both want to do the best they can for their children. Sensible parents who know that they will have to go on co-operating in bringing up their children for some time to come may well prefer to make their own arrangements. Others may prefer the arm's-length intervention of the Agency, together with its enhanced collection and enforcement powers, to the face to face confrontation in court.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just the sort of policy choice in a socio-economic field which the courts are usually prepared to leave to the judgment of Parliament. Parliament, with the guidance of Government, is better able to make the decision as to which scheme will most effectively secure the recognition and enforcement of the children's rights generally. It would be difficult to hold that the scheme as a whole is incompatible with the children's rights to a speedy determination and enforcement of their claims. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76.&nbsp;&nbsp;But if I am right that the children's civil rights to be properly maintained by their parents are engaged, it follows that the public authority which is charged by Parliament with securing the determination and enforcement of their rights is under a duty to act compatibly with their article 6 right to the speedy determination and effective enforcement of those rights. Indeed, Mr Jay did not seek to argue that they were not. He accepted, for the sake of the issue before the House, that if article 6 was engaged in this case, the claim under section 7 of the Human Rights Act 1998 for failing to act in compliance with those rights should proceed.  It stands to reason that if the state is going to take over the enforcement of a person's civil rights it has a duty to act compliantly with article 6 in doing so.  Just as the courts, as public authorities, have to act compliantly with the Convention rights, so does the Agency. The remedies, however, may be different if they do not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77.&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows that I have reached the same conclusion, albeit by a slightly different route, as Wall J in the Administrative Court. This comes as no surprise. I would allow this appeal and restore the order that he made. </p>
<p><b>LORD BROWN OF EATON-UNDER-HEYWOOD</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78.&nbsp;&nbsp;The critical question for your Lordships' decision is whether Mrs Kehoe's (or indeed her children's) article 6 rights were engaged whilst the Child Support Agency (CSA), pursuant to the Child Support Act 1991 (the 1991 Act), were charged with the enforcement of her ex-husband's assessed maintenance obligation.  Did she (or the children) have a civil right, akin to the engineer's undoubted right to his fees in <i>Philis v Greece</i> (1991)  13 EHRR 741, thwarted here as there by an enforcement scheme which denied to the claimants themselves any direct access to the courts?  In my judgment she did not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having now had the advantage of reading in draft the opinions of all my noble and learned friends, I find myself in agreement with the majority.  The 1991 Act introduced, for all those voluntarily or compulsorily seeking the CSA's help, an entire scheme, substituting for whatever rights the parent with care (or, indeed, qualifying children) might otherwise have had, the benefit of the scheme itself (with, necessarily, any incidental dis-benefits).  The only right now enjoyed by those in Mrs Kehoe's position is to look to the CSA for the proper discharge of its public law obligations under the statute, a right which of course is itself sustainable under the courts' supervisory jurisdiction.</p>
