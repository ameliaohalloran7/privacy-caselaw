<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is common ground that DMG has a cause of action in tort for compensation for the loss caused by the breach of Community law found by the ECJ in the <i>Hoechst</i> case to be inherent in the ACT tax regime. It is also common ground that for Limitation Act purposes time began to run when each payment of ACT was made. The details of the payments are set out in paragraph 111 of Lord Walker's opinion. Section 32 (1) (c) applies where an action is brought "for relief from the consequences of a mistake". In <i>Phillips-Higgins v. Harper</i> [1954] 1 QB 411 Pearson J expressed the view at p 419 that section 26 (c) of the Limitation Act 1939 (the statutory predecessor of section 32 (1) (c) of the 1980 Act)</p>
<p></p><ul>" … applies only where the mistake is an essential ingredient of the cause of action …"<p></p></ul>
<p>If it is right, as I think it is, that when the ACT was paid by DMG the ACT was due, DMG's cause of action is an action for compensation for tort. It is not, in my opinion, an action for restitution based on the payment of money under a mistake. An allegation of a mistake but for which the ACT would not have been paid is not an essential ingredient in DMG's cause of action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would accordingly dismiss this appeal albeit for reasons different to those of the Court of Appeal. </p>
<i><p>The other issues</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93.&nbsp;&nbsp;In each of the other issues I am in respectful agreement with the opinions of my noble and learned friends, and accordingly, if it were relevant to do so, would dismiss the Revenue's cross-appeal.</p>
<p><b>LORD WALKER OF GESTINGTHORPE</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94.&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 43 (formerly 52) of the EU Treaty, headed 'Right of Establishment' provides as follows:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Within the framework of the provisions set out below, restrictions on the freedom of establishment of nationals of a Member State in the territory of another Member State shall be prohibited. Such prohibition shall also apply to restrictions on the setting-up of agencies, branches or subsidiaries by nationals of any Member State established in the territory of any Member State.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Freedom of establishment shall include the right to take up and pursue activities as self-employed persons and to set up and manage undertakings, in particular companies or firms within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 48, under the conditions laid down for its own nationals by the law of the country where such establishment is effected, subject to the provisions of the chapter relating to capital."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95.&nbsp;&nbsp;Several different statutory provisions relating to United Kingdom corporation tax (in particular, as it applies to multi-national groups or consortia of companies) have been successfully challenged, or are at present under challenge, as infringing Article 43. The challenges have been so numerous that litigation is proceeding under several different group litigation orders ("GLOs") made in the Chancery Division, and some appeals have already reached this House: <i>Pirelli Cable Holding NV v Inland Revenue Commissioners </i>[2006] UKHL 4; [2006] 1 WLR 400 and (as to procedural matters) <i>Autologic Holdings plc v Inland Revenue Commissioners</i> [2005] UKHL 54; [2006] 1 AC 118. At the end of 2005 the Court of Justice of the European Communities (the "ECJ") gave judgment on a reference made by the Chancery Division in litigation of this type (though not proceeding under a GLO): <i>Marks &amp; Spencer plc v Halsey</i> (Case C-446/03), [2006] Ch 184.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96.&nbsp;&nbsp;The particular focus of the present appeal is on limitation of actions - in practical terms, the length of time during which the premature payment of advance corporation tax ("ACT") by the appellant company Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Group plc ("DMG") gives rise to a remedy enforceable in the national court. DMG's claim has been selected (under a GLO made on 26 November 2001) as a suitable test case for the determination of what are defined (in a further order made on 12 March 2002) as "EU issues (i) Limitation (A) and (B)." DMG was successful before Park J (whose judgment given on 18 July 2003 is reported at [2003] 4 AER 645, [2003] STC 1017) but on 4 February 2005 the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue ([2006] 2 WLR 103, [2005] STC 329). Her Majesty's Attorney General is also a party to the proceedings but I shall refer to the respondents simply as "the Revenue".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97.&nbsp;&nbsp;The issues summarised above may appear fairly narrow and very technical, and on one possible view this appeal could be disposed of as a relatively short point of construction on section 32(1)(c) of the Limitation Act 1980. But it has produced some complex and sophisticated arguments from counsel. The decisions of Park J and the Court of Appeal have also led to some stimulating and far-reaching comments from legal scholars, including Professor Andrew Burrows, "Restitution in respect of Mistakenly Paid Tax", (2005) 121 LQR 540, Professor Steve Hedley, "Tax<i> </i>Wrongly Paid - Basis of Recovery - Limitation" [2005] CLJ 296, Robert Stevens, "Justified Enrichment" (2005) 5 OUCLJ   141, Graham Virgo, "<i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell: </i>the right to restitution of tax paid by mistake rejected"<i> </i> [2005]  BTR 281, Sir Jack Beatson, Chapter 9 ("Unlawful Statutes and Mistake of Law") in Burrows and Rodger (Eds), <i>Mapping the Law </i>(to be published shortly) and two articles by Dr James Edelman,  "Limitation Periods and the Theory of Unjust Enrichment" (2005) 68 MLR 848 and "The Meaning of 'Unjust' in the English Law of Unjust Enrichment" (2006) 3 ERPL 309. I shall return to some of these at a later stage in this opinion, but I wish to acknowledge at once my debt to these commentators and to other academic writers, including of course the most recent work of the late Professor Peter Birks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98.&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall begin with a brief summary of the relevant statutory provisions relating to ACT, followed by a rather fuller summary of the decision of the ECJ in the important joined cases of <i>Metallgesellschaft Ltd and others v Inland Revenue Commissioners and another </i>and <i>Hoechst AG and another v Inland Revenue Commissioners and another </i>(Joined Cases C-397 and C-410/98) [2001] Ch 620 ("<i>Hoechst</i>"). Then I will come to the facts of the test case, the pleadings and the course of the litigation on its way to your Lordships' House. Then it will be necessary to look in some detail at the very important decisions of this House in <i>Woolwich Equitable Building Society v Inland Revenue Commissioners </i>[1993] AC 70 ("<i>Woolwich</i>") and <i>Kleinwort Benson Limited v Lincoln City Council </i>[1999] 2 AC 349 ("<i>Kleinwort Benson</i>"), both majority decisions in which the leading speech was given by Lord Goff of Chieveley.</p>
<i>ACT</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99.&nbsp;&nbsp;The relevant statutory provisions are very clearly described in the judgment of Park J (paras 6 and 7) and a brief summary will therefore suffice. Corporation tax was first introduced by the Finance Act 1965. The structure of the tax was radically altered by the Finance Act 1972 with the introduction of ACT, which was in force from 1973 until its abolition (probably hastened by the oncoming wave of litigation based on Article 43) in 1999. From 1988 until 1999 the relevant provisions were to be found in a consolidating statute, the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 ("ICTA"). The political and economic background to these changes has been described by Professor John Tiley, <i>Revenue Law</i> 4th ed (2000), pp 758-762.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100.&nbsp;&nbsp;When a company paid a dividend to its shareholders it was required to pay to the Revenue (within 14 days from the end of the quarter in which the dividend was paid) an amount of ACT equal (for most of the relevant period) to 25% of the dividend (ICTA section 14). The ACT paid in this way was later set off against the company's liability for mainstream corporation tax ("MCT") if (as happened in this case) the company made sufficient taxable profits to be liable to pay at least as much MCT as it had paid ACT. The payment of MCT would thus be accelerated by a period of between 8½ and 17½ months (depending on the timing of the dividend payment). A subsidiary company paying a dividend to its parent company could however avoid liability to pay ACT if both companies made a group income election ("GIE") under ICTA section 247. The GIE had to be made at least three months in advance of payment of the dividend. This relief was however available only if both companies were for tax purposes resident in the United Kingdom. So a dividend paid by a British subsidiary to a German parent company was not (on the face of the United Kingdom corporation tax legislation) able to make a GIE and so obtain relief under section 247. In <i>Hoechst </i>[2001] Ch 620 the ECJ declared that part of the corporation tax legislation to be unlawful under EU law. The judgment of the ECJ also deals with the consequences of the infringement in terms of remedies in the national courts.</p>
<i><p>Hoechst</p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101.&nbsp;&nbsp;The claimants in these two joined cases were two or more companies in groups which had a German parent company and one or more United Kingdom subsidiaries.  In actions against the Revenue (in which the Attorney General was also made a defendant) the claimants sought damages or compensation for loss (during the period until they would have been set off against MCT) of sums paid in ACT by the English subsidiaries in respect of dividends paid to the German parent companies. The complaint was that these losses were caused by the discriminatory and unlawful character (under EU law) of the ACT regime under which GEIs were not available to these multinational groups, but would have been available if all the relevant members of the group had been United Kingdom companies. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102.&nbsp;&nbsp;Claims were brought in 1995 in respect of ACT paid (in one case) between 1974 and 1995 and (in the other case) between 1989 and 1994. In 1998 the Chancery Division made references to the ECJ for preliminary rulings. Advocate General Fennelly delivered his opinion on 12 September 2000 and the ECJ gave its judgement on 8 March 2001. The latter date has come to be seen as being of considerable importance in these proceedings, so far as they turn on mistake of law. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first referred question (paras 35-76 of its judgment) the ECJ concluded (para 76)</p>
<p></p><ul>"that it is contrary to article 52 [now 43] of the Treaty for the tax legislation of a member state, such as that in issue in the main proceedings, to afford companies resident in that member state the possibility of benefiting from a taxation regime allowing them to pay dividends to their parent company without having to pay advance corporation tax where their parent company is also resident in that member state, but to deny them that possibility where their parent company has its seat in another member state"<p></p></ul>
<p>In reaching that conclusion the ECJ rejected the argument (put forward by the United Kingdom and some other member states) that the difference in tax treatment was objectively justified by the differing circumstances of national and multinational groups, and in order to preserve the coherence of the United Kingdom's tax system. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question (set out in para 33(2) of the ECJ's judgment) was whether EU law gave rise to a restitutionary right to claim a sum of money by way of interest, or whether the claimant was limited to an action for damages, and </p>
<p></p><ul>"in either case is the national court obliged to grant a remedy even if under national law interest cannot be awarded (whether directly or by way of restitution or damages) on principal sums which are no longer owing to the claimants?"<p></p></ul>
<p>The rule of national law alluded to was that upheld by this House in <i>President of India v La Pintada Compania Navigacion SA</i> [1985] AC 104, mentioned in para 12 of the opinion of the Advocate General. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105.&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole of the ECJ's answer to the second question (paras 77-96) is set out in full in the judgment of Jonathan Parker LJ (para 45) and it is unnecessary to repeat it in full. The crucial passages (in the text as slightly edited in the Law Reports, [2001] Ch 620, 663-664), are as follows: </p>
<p></p><ul>"81.&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be stressed that it is not for the Court of Justice to assign a legal classification to the actions brought by the claimants before the national court. In the circumstances, it is for the claimants to specify the nature and basis of their actions (whether they are actions for restitution or actions for compensation for damage), subject to the supervision of the national court. …<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>83.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to bear in mind in this regard that what is contrary to Community law, in the disputes in the main proceedings, is not the levying of a tax in the United Kingdom on the payment of dividends by a subsidiary to its parent company but the fact that subsidiaries, resident in the United Kingdom, of parent companies having their seat in another member state were required to pay that tax in advance whereas resident subsidiaries of resident parent companies were able to avoid that requirement. <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>84.&nbsp;&nbsp;According to well-established case law, the right to a refund of charges levied in a member state in breach of rules of Community law is the consequence and complement of the rights conferred on individuals by Community provisions as interpreted by the court: <i>Amministrazione delle Finanze dello Stato v Sp A San Giorgio</i> (Case 199/82) [1983] ECR 3595, 3612, para 12 [etc]… The member state is therefore required in principle to repay charges levied in breach of Community law…<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>85.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absence of Community rules on the restitution of national charges that have been improperly levied, it is for the domestic legal system of each member state to designate the courts and tribunals having jurisdiction to lay down the detailed procedural rules governing actions for safeguarding rights which individuals derive from Community law, provided, first, that such rules are not less favourable than those governing similar domestic actions (principle of equivalence) and, secondly, that they do not render practically impossible or excessively difficult the exercise of rights conferred by Community law (principle of effectiveness)…<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>86.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is likewise for national law to settle all ancillary questions relating to the reimbursement of charges  improperly levied, such as the payment of interest, including the rate of interest and the date from which it must be calculated…<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>87.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the main proceedings, however, the claim for payment of interest covering the cost of loss of the use of sums paid by way of [ACT] is not ancillary, but is the very objective sought by the claimants' actions in the main proceedings. In such circumstances, where the breach of Community law arises, not from the payment of the tax  itself but from its being levied prematurely, the award of interest represents the 'reimbursement' of that which was improperly paid and would appear to be essential in restoring the equal treatment guaranteed by article 52 [now 43] of the Treaty. <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>88.&nbsp;&nbsp;The national court has said that it is in dispute whether English law provides for restitution in respect of damage arising from loss of the use of sums of money where no principal sum is due. It must be stressed that in an action for restitution the principal sum due is none other than the amount of interest which would have been generated by the sum, use of which was lost as a result of the premature levy of the tax."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth question, though phrased in abstract terms, asked in effect whether the United Kingdom could rely on the defence that the two groups of companies did not seek to make GIE's and (para 98)</p>
<p></p><ul>"did not therefore make use of the legal remedies available to them to challenge the refusals of the tax authorities, by invoking the primacy  and direct effect of the provisions of Community law, where on any view national law denied resident subsidiaries and their non-resident parent companies the benefit of that taxation regime".<p></p></ul>
<p>In rejecting this argument the ECJ invoked the principle of effectiveness (para 106): </p>
<p></p><ul>"The exercise of rights conferred on private persons by directly applicable provisions of Community law would, however, be rendered impossible or excessively difficult if their claims for restitution or compensation based on Community law were rejected or reduced solely because the persons concerned had not applied for a tax advantage which national law denied them, with a view to challenging the refusal of the tax authorities by means of the legal remedies provided for that purpose, invoking the primacy and direct effect of Community law"<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Revenue's position before your Lordships is to concede that the ECJ expects DMG to be entitled to a restitutionary remedy, but only (as Mr Glick QC put it) by analogy with the remedy in <i>Woolwich</i> [1993] AC 70 (and, crucially, subject to the usual 6-year limitation period). The Revenue contend that DMG is trying to obtain a concurrent domestic remedy in circumstances where, if the case were purely domestic, it would get nothing. This is of course only a brief summary of its argument on an important point to which it will be necessary to return. </p>
<i><p>The facts </p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108.&nbsp;&nbsp;As just noted, DMG is seeking a concurrent domestic remedy based on mistake of law, because it wishes to rely on section 32(1)(c) of the Limitation Act 1980. Section 32(1) provides that (subject to immaterial exceptions)</p>
<p></p><ul>"…where in the case of any action for which a period of limitation is prescribed by this Act, either - <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;the action is based upon the fraud of the defendant; or<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;any fact relevant to the plaintiff's right of action has been deliberately concealed from him by the defendant; or <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;the action is for relief from the consequences of a mistake; <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>the period of limitation shall not begin to run until the plaintiff has discovered the fraud, concealment or mistake (as the case may be) or could with reasonable diligence have discovered it." <p></p></ul>
<p>It was therefore necessary for Park J to make findings of fact relevant to this issue, and he heard oral evidence from Mr Peter Thomason, DMG's Head of Taxation, who was cross-examined by Mr Glick. Mr Glick took your Lordships through quite a lot of his oral evidence but before coming to the judge's findings on the issue of mistake I should record the undisputed facts about DMG, the group of which it came to form part, and the relevant payments of ATC. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109.&nbsp;&nbsp;DMG (formerly Morgan Grenfell Group Plc) was established in 1971 as a holding company for Morgan Grenfell &amp; Co Limited, a long-established merchant bank. DMG was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1986. Deutsche Bank AG ("DBAG"), a well-known German bank, had acquired a 5% stake in DMG in 1984 and in 1989 it made a successful takeover bid. DBAG became the direct holder of about 14% of the shares in DMG and the remainder (about 86%) were held through another United Kingdom subsidiary of DBAG, DB Investments (GB) Limited ("DBI"). At first DMG continued to operate in a fairly independent way, despite the takeover, but in October 1994 DBAG decided to adopt a more integrated approach and to consolidate all its investment banking opportunities in London. But the integration was not fully achieved, as far as the tax departments were concerned, until May 1996. Until then Mr Thomason has responsibility for the tax affairs of DMG but not for those of DBI (or, of course, DBAG). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110.&nbsp;&nbsp;I gratefully adopt Park J's summary of the history of the dividend payments: </p>
<p></p><ul>"10.&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the terms of ICTA, section 247, group income elections could not have been made between DMG and DBAG or between DBI and DBAG because DBAG was not a company resident in the United Kingdom. A group income election could have been made between DMG and DBI (because both companies were resident in the United Kingdom), but no such election was made. The reason was that, although an election would have enabled dividends to flow from DMG to DBI without ACT, onward dividends from DBI to DBAG would have had to be paid subject to a liability on the part of DBI to pay ACT: or at least that was how the matter appeared on the terms of the domestic United Kingdom legislation. In the circumstances DMG paid ACT by reference to all its dividends - the 86% of them paid to DBI as well as the 14% of them paid to DBAG - and DBI did not pay ACT when it paid onward dividends to DBAG. DBI did not have to pay ACT on those onward dividends because of the rules about franked investment income in ICTA, sections 238 and 241. <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;DMG has pleaded in this case, and the Revenue admit, that, if section 247 had permitted group income elections to be made between a United Kingdom subsidiary and a parent company in another member state, elections would have been made between DMG and DBI, between DMG and DBAG and between DBI and DBAG. The corollary is that, because section 247 appeared clearly not to permit group income elections to which a parent company in another member state was a party, the companies did not attempt to make group income elections. There is no doubt that, if they had attempted to make them, the Revenue would have rejected the elections and pointed to the clear terms of the United Kingdom statute in justification of the rejection."<p></p></ul>

<p>These figures have however emerged by a surprisingly laboured process. There has been more than one amendment of the particulars of claim. Further discussion of this point is best deferred until I come to the last issue in the appeal, the pleading point. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112.&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge accepted that at the time of the ACT payments in October 1993 and February 1995 DMG (primarily in the person of Mr Thomason) knew nothing about the argument which was ultimately successful in <i>Hoechst</i>. But by July 1995 DMG knew about the <i>Hoechst</i> litigation, which received a good deal of publicity in the financial press. There was some discussion at DMG about the possibility of a 'protective GIE' (Mr Thomason was cross-examined about this) but in fact nothing was done before a dividend was paid on 17 July 1995 (giving rise to the ACT payment in January 1996). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113.&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge's main findings of fact on this point are set out in para 27 of his judgment: </p>
<p></p><ul>"Before I move on I wish to record the evidence which Mr Thomason (the Head of Taxation at DMG) gave about his state of mind when he learned of the <i>Hoechst</i> argument. In his witness statement he said this: <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>'At all times prior to the determination of the European Court in the <i>Hoechst</i> case, I believed that the United Kingdom statute denying the ability to make a group income election was the law and I was bound to act in accordance with this law…It did not occur to me that I could ignore the law as it stood for the simple reason that the law is the law. Just because another taxpayer challenged the law that did not mean that I could or should ignore it.'<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Mr Thomason was cross-examined, but I do not believe that the foregoing passage was challenged or affected by his answers on other points. He added the general point (obvious but plainly relevant) that it was not clear in 1995 what would be the outcome of the <i>Hoechst</i> case (or, as it turned out, of the <i>Metallgesellschaft/Hoechst</i> conjoined cases). He also said that there were more arguments being advanced by <i>Hoechst</i> in 1995 than the one which eventually succeeded in the [ECJ]."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114.&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge concluded (paras 30-31) that all three relevant payments of ACT were made under a mistake of law and that DMG did not discover its mistake until the decision of the ECJ on 8 March 2001, after DMG had commenced proceedings against the Revenue (it did so shortly after delivery of the opinion of Advocate General Fennelly). </p>
<i><p>The Pleadings </p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115.&nbsp;&nbsp;DMG issued its claim form on 18 October 2000, describing the claim as "for damages for breach of European Community law". In its original particulars of claim (served on 9 February 2001) it pleaded that ICTA sections 14 and 247 and Schedule 13 ("the statutory provisions") were contrary to EU law. It pleaded (paras 9 and 11) that from time to time DMG paid dividends to DBAG and DBI (which passed them on to DBAG). Para 9 (but not para 11 in its original form) pleaded that ACT was paid in respect of these dividends "pursuant to the unlawful statutory provisions and to unlawful demands made by the First and/or Second Defendant and further and/or alternatively under a mistake of law as to the validity of the statutory provisons". Para 11 was later amended to bring it into line with para 9. By para 13 DMG claimed to be entitled to "restitution of, and further and/or alternatively compensation for, and further and/or alternatively compensation for the loss of use of, monies paid on account of ACT pursuant to unlawful demands by the First and/or Second Defendant and/or under a mistake of law and pursuant to the statutory provisions in respect of the DBAG dividends" (later amended to both sets of dividends), compensation for loss of use of the monies to be calculated "from the dates of payment until set-off against mainstream corporation tax or other repayment or utilisation".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116.&nbsp;&nbsp;Paras 9 and 11 each ended with an averment that the amounts of ACT "include, but are not limited to, payments of ACT made by the Claimant as specified in the [First or Second] Schedule hereto." Both Schedules (giving dates and amounts of ACT payments) were substantially amended on various later dates. The pleading issue is whether these amendments added or substituted a new cause of action outside the category permitted by section 35(5)(a) of the Limitation Act 1980 ("if the new cause of action arises out of the same facts or substantially the same facts as are already in issue on any claim previously made in the original action.")</p>
<i></i><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issues</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before your Lordships, as in the courts below, there have been six issues in dispute. Drawing on both the agreed statement of facts and issues and the competing version in para 5 of DMG's printed case (but finding the latter rather more helpful) I would summarise them as follows.</p>
