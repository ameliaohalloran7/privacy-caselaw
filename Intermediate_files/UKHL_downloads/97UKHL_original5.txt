<p class="para">109.&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming, then, that Her Majesty’s constituent power can properly be described as a power to make “laws for the peace, order and good government of the Territory", such a power is equal in scope to the legislative power of Parliament.  As the statements in <i>Riel v The Queen</i>, <i>Chenard and Co v Arissol</i> and <i>Union Steamship Company of Australia Pty Ltd v King</i> show, it is not open to the courts to hold that legislation enacted under a power described in those terms does not, in fact, conduce to the peace, order and good government of the Territory.  Equally, it cannot be open to the courts to substitute their judgment for that of the Secretary of State advising Her Majesty as to what can properly be said to conduce to the peace, order and good government of BIOT.  This is simply because such questions are not justiciable.  The law cannot resolve them:  they are for the determination of the responsible ministers rather than judges.  In this respect, the legislation made for the colonies is in the same position as legislation made by Parliament for this country, as the High Court of Australia pointed out.  In both cases, the sanction for inappropriate use of the legislative power is political, not judicial.  The difference - and it is, of course, very important - is that orders in council are made without the concurrence of Parliament or of any other representative legislature and so the political control is less direct.  That lack of direct political control over them may well be considered undesirable in today’s world.  If so, the appropriate remedy is for Parliament, not the courts, to get involved in scrutinising the substance of such orders in council.</p>
<p class="para">110.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 9 of the Constitution Order removes any right of abode on the Chagos Archipelago which the claimant or anyone else may have had.  It is a stark provision.  But the Secretary of State’s decision to have it enacted and the effect of that decision have to be judged against the circumstances at the time it was taken.  No-one was then actually living on the outer islands and, even though the islanders had enjoyed a right to return since November 2000, none of them had done so.  They were “instead seeking support from the UK and US Governments to financially assist their return or alternatively to provide compensation":  <i>Feasibility Study Phase 2B</i>, Executive Summary, para 1.1.  More importantly, there was no prospect that anyone would be able to live on the outer islands, except on a subsistence basis, in the foreseeable future:  <i>Feasibility Study Phase 2B</i>, Executive Summary, para 1.11.  Sir Sydney did not dispute this, but contended that it was irrelevant.  In other words, the position was just the same as if people had actually been living on the islands when the Orders were made.  I am unable to accept that submission.  The impact of the legislation on the people concerned would be very different in the two situations.  In my view, in reviewing the Secretary of State’s decision to remove the right of abode, it is relevant that there was actually no prospect of the Chagossians being able to live on the outer islands in the foreseeable future.  The Government accepts, of course, that they can apply for permits to visit the islands and that an unreasonable refusal could be judicially reviewed.  Such visits have taken place in the past.</p>
<p class="para">111.&nbsp;&nbsp;Against that background, can it be said that no reasonable Secretary of State could have decided to have section 9 enacted?</p>
<p class="para">112.&nbsp;&nbsp;On 15 June 2004 a junior minister, Mr Rammell, made a written statement to Parliament.  His good faith has not been impugned by the respondent.  The statement shows that, in deciding to legislate to prevent people resettling on the outer islands, the Government took into account the fact that the economic conditions and infrastructure which had once supported the way of life of the Chagossians had ceased to exist.  Something new would have to be devised.  The advice was that the cost of providing the necessary support for permanent resettlement was likely to be prohibitive and that natural events were likely to make life difficult for any resettled population.  Human interference within the atolls was likely to exacerbate stress on the marine and terrestrial environment and would accelerate the effects of global warming.  Flooding would be likely to become more frequent and would threaten the infrastructure and the freshwater aquifers and agricultural production.  Severe events might even threaten life.  The minister recorded that, for these reasons, the Government had decided to legislate to prevent resettlement.  Although he made no mention of it, the decision to legislate and to introduce immigration controls at that particular time appears to have been prompted by the prospect of protesters attempting to land on the islands.  In addition, Mr Rammell said that restoration of full immigration control over the entire Territory was necessary to ensure and maintain the availability and effective use of the territory for defence purposes.  He referred to recent developments in the international security climate since November 2000 when such controls had been removed.</p>
<p class="para">113.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ministerial statement indicates that a decision to legislate was taken on the basis of the experts’ (second) report on the difficulties and dangers of resettling the islands - these difficulties and dangers being dangers and difficulties which would affect the Chagossians themselves, if they were to try to live on the outer islands.  Given the terms of that report alone, it could not, in my view, be said that no reasonable Government would have decided to legislate to prevent resettlement.  In particular, the advice that the cost of any permanent resettlement would be “prohibitive” was an entirely legitimate factor for the Government - which is responsible for the way that tax revenues are spent - to take into account.  In addition, the Government had regard to defence considerations, the views of its close ally, the United States, and the changed security situation after 9/11.  These additional factors reinforce the view that the decision to legislate was neither unreasonable nor irrational.</p>
<p class="para">114.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the decision was adverse to the claim of the Chagossians to return to settle on the outer islands.  But that does not mean that their interests had been ignored:  a realistic assessment of the long-term position of any potential Chagossian settlers on the outer islands was central to the expert report on which the Government relied.  In addition, the Government considered the overall interests of the United Kingdom.  It was entitled to do so.  There is no support whatever for a proposition that, as a matter of English law, in legislating for a colony, either Parliament or Her Majesty in Council must have regard only, or even predominantly, to the immediate interests of the population of the colony.  On the contrary, the authority of Parliament and the Crown could always be exercised on “trade, shipping, or matters of law and policy affecting the whole empire":  Jenkyns, <i>British Rule and Jurisdiction beyond the Seas</i>, p 22.  Since most colonies had legislatures, these wider interests were usually given effect by making an order in council disallowing offending statutes rather than by enacting legislation.  But, in crucial areas, such as the abolition of slavery, or the regulation of merchant shipping, Parliament would enact legislation for Her Majesty’s possessions as a whole.  The underlying assumption was, of course, that the policies in question were for the ultimate benefit of all those possessions.  Similarly, assuming, of course, that the Government had to take account of the interests of the islanders, it was nevertheless entitled to give appropriate weight to the wider, economic, foreign affairs and defence interests of the United Kingdom when it decided whether to enact the orders in council.  In the absence of any relevant legal criteria, judges are not well placed to second-guess the balance struck by ministers on such a matter.</p>
<p class="para">115.&nbsp;&nbsp;The final major submission on behalf of the respondent was that, by enacting the Constitution Order and the Immigration Order, the Government had breached a promise made by the then Foreign Secretary, Mr Cook, following the judgment in <i>Bancoult 1</i>, when the Immigration Ordinance 2000 was made by the Commissioner.  This submission was accepted by all the members of the Court of Appeal.  Nevertheless, for the reasons given by Lord Hoffmann, I would reject it.  In substance, what is in dispute is a right for the Chagossians to return and live permanently on the outer islands.  Unquestionably, the Foreign Secretary said that, while observing its Treaty obligations, the Government would put in place a new Immigration Ordinance which would allow the Ilois to return to the outer islands.  But the Foreign Secretary had already referred to the work which the Government was doing on “the feasibility” of resettling the Ilois and which now took on a new importance.  In other words, the Government had still to complete its work to see whether or not resettlement would be possible, “feasible".  For that reason I am unable to spell out of the statement, or the Government’s action in putting the Immigration Ordinance in place, a clear and unambiguous promise that the Chagossians would be allowed to return and settle permanently on the outer islands.</p>
<p class="para">116.&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with what Lord Hoffmann says about the two remaining grounds of challenge, based on the Human Rights Act and international law.</p>
<p class="para">117.&nbsp;&nbsp;For all these reasons I am satisfied that the Constitution Order and the Immigration Order are not invalid and therefore form part of the law of BIOT.  It follows that, assuming that chapter 29 of Magna Carta is part of the law of BIOT, it does not make any banishment of the Chagossians by virtue of these Orders unlawful.</p>
<p class="para">118.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons I would allow the appeal.</p>
<p class="lawlord">LORD CARSWELL</p>
<p class="mylords">My Lords,</p>
<p class="para">119.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chagos Islands are an archipelago of low-lying coral atolls in the middle of the Indian Ocean, over 1000 miles from Mauritius.  In 1965 they were formed into a separate colony or dependent territory, under the name of the British Indian Ocean Territory (“BIOT”).  Unhappily for the inhabitants, that very remoteness gave the islands a geopolitical importance.  In the 1960s the United States Government desired to establish a secure defence facility on the island of Diego Garcia, the largest and most populated of the Chagos Islands.  Agreement was reached with HM Government and between 1968 and 1973 the Chagossians were in effect uprooted and removed from the islands to Mauritius.  The unhappy story of their removal and the consequences has been told at length in the judgments given in the previous proceedings and summarised by my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann in his opinion in this appeal.  I can only echo the distress and indignation expressed by those who have given these previous judgments about the way that the Chagossians were treated.</p>
<p class="para">120.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the advantage of reading in draft the opinions prepared by my noble and learned friends Lord Hoffmann and Lord Rodger of Earlsferry.  I agree with their conclusions and, with very little qualification, with their reasoning, and I can accordingly shorten this opinion considerably.</p>
<p class="para">121.&nbsp;&nbsp;The respondent Louis Olivier Bancoult is the standard bearer for the campaign promoting the expressed wish of many of the Chagossians to return to what they regard as their homeland in the Chagos Islands.  That wish, they claim, has been frustrated by the passing in 2004 of the British Indian Ocean Territory (Constitution) Order and the British Indian Ocean Territory (Immigration) Order.  It is put on an abstract basis by their counsel, for it is quite clear that for them to resettle in the islands is wholly impracticable without very substantial and disproportionate expenditure.  They are not in a position to meet such a cost.  It could only be shouldered by the British Government, which has made it clear that it is willing to permit and fund from time to time short visits to the outlying islands, but not to support a large-scale permanent resettlement.  One might ask the question why this campaign is being pursued, for the Chagossians already can pay visits and there is no realistic prospect of resettlement unless it is funded for them at huge expense.  I do not find it necessary to seek an answer to that question, but the practical difficulties in the way of resettlement are in my view relevant to the rationality of the Government’s decision to make the 2004 Orders in Council.</p>
<p class="para">122.&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sides have, as Lord Hoffmann has said, put forward in argument extreme and incompatible propositions.  Like him, I am unable to accept either in its unqualified form.  I would reject the appellant’s submission that the validity of an Order in Council made under the prerogative legislating for a colony cannot be reviewed by the courts.  I agree with the reasons which Lord Hoffmann has given for this conclusion and do not need to add anything to them.</p>
<p class="para">123.&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposing contention, persuasively advanced by Sir Sydney Kentridge QC, requires a little more discussion.  The desire to be able to remain in one’s homeland is so deeply ingrained in the human psyche that the right not to be exiled could readily be regarded as fundamental.  Given its high importance, the issue is how near it is to being an inalienable constitutional right.  </p>
<p class="para">124.&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been part of the law of England at least since Magna Carta, chapter 29 of which provides that no freeman shall be exiled otherwise than by the lawful judgment of his peers or by the law of the land.  Historically this was no doubt aimed at preventing the King from arbitrarily banishing his more important subjects, in particular the barons, but it has come to be accepted as a right possessed by every citizen, which Blackstone said could only be removed by the authority of Parliament (<i>Commentaries, </i>15th ed, 1809, p 137, the same wording also appearing in the 11th edition, published in 1791 and containing Blackstone’s <i>ipsissima verba</i>).  Since the Crown has plenary legislative authority over a ceded colony, there appears to be no compelling reason why an Order in Council should not validly have the same effect in a Crown colony as an Act of Parliament would have in the United Kingdom.  </p>
<p class="para">125.&nbsp;&nbsp;In contending that the inhabitants of a colony could not lawfully be exiled by an Order in Council Sir Sydney relied on a statement of Lord Mansfield CJ in <i>Campbell v Hall </i>(1774) 1 Cowp 204.  The action concerned a challenge by the plaintiff to the validity of a duty upon goods exported from Grenada, which had been imposed by letters patent some months after an earlier proclamation providing for the constitution of assemblies with power to pass laws for Grenada.  The Court of King’s Bench held in favour of the plaintiff, who sued for the recovery of duty paid, on the ground that the King had by the proclamation divested himself of legislative authority over Grenadan affairs.  In the course of his judgment Lord Mansfield enunciated six general propositions concerning the law governing colonies.  The sixth of these propositions read:</p>
<p class="qt">“ … if the King (and when I say the King, I always mean the King without the concurrence of Parliament) has a power to alter the old and to introduce new laws in a conquered country, this legislation being subordinate, that is, subordinate to his own authority in Parliament, he cannot make any new change contrary to fundamental principles: he cannot exempt an inhabitant from that particular dominion; as for instance, from the laws of trade, or from the power of Parliament, or give him privileges exclusive of his other subjects; and so in many other instances which might be put.”</p>
<p class="paraleft">Like Lord Rodger, I think that too much has been read into this statement.  It was made in the context of the imposition of taxes, and is primarily directed to the possibility of the exemption of particular persons from taxes or the granting of the type of valuable privilege given in earlier times.  I share the doubt expressed by the Privy Council in <i>Liyanage v The Queen </i>[1967] AC 259, 285, whether Lord Mansfield intended to say that what was not repugnant to English law might yet be repugnant to fundamental principles, which it categorised as “some vague unspecified law of natural justice".  </p>
<p class="para">126.&nbsp;&nbsp;Doubts of this kind did not prevent the emergence of the view in the 19th century that colonial laws could be struck down as null and void if their provisions were contrary to such “fundamental principles", notwithstanding the clear contrary view expressed in 1834 by Sir James Stephen, quoted by Lord Rodger at para 93.  The problem became acute when Boothby J of the Supreme Court of South Australia exercised this supposed jurisdiction with great freedom.  In order to deal with it Parliament passed the Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865, designed to remove the possibility of such challenges to the validity of colonial laws.  I agree with the reasons set out by Lord Rodger in paras 96 to 101 of his opinion and his conclusion that the question of the inviolability of fundamental principles is put beyond doubt by the 1865 Act.  I therefore am of the same view that none of the provisions of the 2004 Orders in Council is open to challenge in the English courts on the ground of repugnancy to any fundamental principle relating to the rights of abode of the Chagossians as “belongers” in the Chagos Islands.</p>
<p class="para">127.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was argued on behalf of the respondent that the provisions of the Orders in Council were not for the “peace, order and good government” of the Chagos Islands, a proposition which had been accepted by the Divisional Court in relation to the Ordinance in the case which has been termed <i>Bancoult 1 </i>and by Sedley LJ in the Court of Appeal in the present case.  The Orders in Council, unlike the Ordinance, were made in right of the United Kingdom, not in right of the BIOT.  Mr Crow QC for the appellant advanced the proposition that the very familiar trilogy of objects of legislation, if it be a limitation on the plenitude of legislative power, does not apply to Orders in Council made under Her Majesty’s prerogative power to establish laws for a Crown colony.  He pointed out that there is a complete dearth of authority for the application of the phrase to the prerogative power.  Nevertheless it is found in the British Indian Ocean Territory Orders of 1965 and 1976 and the British Indian Ocean Territory (Constitution) Order 2004.  In each Order the Commissioner is given power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Territory, which is a standard provision when legislative power is devolved.  More significantly, however, in each Order there is reserved to Her Majesty “full power to make laws for the peace, order and good government” of the Territory.  This throws more than a little doubt on the correctness of Mr Crow’s proposition, as it is apparent that the draftsman of each Order considered that this was the correct definition of the Crown’s law-making power.  I am therefore willing to accept, as does Lord Rodger, that the Orders had to be laws made for the “peace, order and good government” of the colony.  </p>
<p class="para">128.&nbsp;&nbsp;That ritual phrase does not, however, permit a court to strike down a provision in such an order on the ground that it does not consider that it furthered that object.  The <i>locus classicus </i>for this proposition is in the decision of the Privy Council in <i>Riel v The Queen </i>(1885) 10 App Cas 675.  Lord Halsbury LC, giving the judgment of the Board, said in a well known sentence at page 678, referring to the British North America Act 1871, giving the Canadian Parliament authority to make laws for the administration, peace, order and good government of territories not yet included in any province:</p>
<p class="qt">“The words of the statute are apt to authorize the utmost discretion of enactment for the attainment of the objects pointed to.”</p>
<p class="paraleft">In the previous paragraph he specifically rejected the suggestion that </p>
<p class="qt">“if a Court of law should come to the conclusion that a particular enactment was not calculated as matter of fact and policy to secure peace, order and good government, that they would be entitled to regard any statute directed to those objects, but which a Court should think likely to fail of that effect, as ultra vires and beyond the competency of the Dominion Parliament to enact.”</p>
<p class="paraleft">The High Court of Australia confirmed the application in Australia of the same principle in <i>Union Steamship Company of Australia Pty Ltd v King </i>(1988) 166 CLR 1, 9-10:</p>
<p class="qt">“These decisions and statements of high authority demonstrate that, within the limits of the grant, a power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of a territory is as ample and plenary as the power possessed by the Imperial Parliament itself.  That is, the words ‘for the peace, order and good government’ are not words of limitation.  They did not confer on the courts of a colony, just as they do not confer on the courts of a State, jurisdiction to strike down legislation on the ground that, in the opinion of a court, the legislation does not promote or secure the peace, order and good government of the colony. Just as the courts of the United Kingdom cannot invalidate laws made by the Parliament of the United Kingdom on the ground that they do not secure the welfare and the public interest, so the exercise of its legislative power by the Parliament of New South Wales is not susceptible to judicial review on that score.”</p>
<p class="para">129.&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue received some consideration in Northern Ireland, where section 4 of the Government of Ireland Act 1920 conferred upon the Parliament of Northern Ireland power to make laws for “the peace, order,  and good government of … Northern Ireland", except for certain specified objects.  This provision was considered in several decided cases, but without any resolution of the plenitude of the power conferred by it.  In <i>Gallagher v Lynn </i>[1937] AC 863 the House of Lords considered the Milk and Milk Products Act (Northern Ireland) Act 1934, but the decision turned upon the issue whether the Act was a law in respect of trade (an excepted object) or in respect of precautions taken to secure the health of the inhabitants by protecting them from the dangers of an unregulated supply of milk.  The House did not pronounce upon the appellant’s argument that the power to make laws for the peace, order and good government was limited.  Nor did the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland rule upon the extent of the power in <i>Ulster Transport Authority v James Brown &amp; Sons Ltd </i>[1953] NI 79, where it was not disputed that legislation in respect of transport came within the power.  In <i>Duffy v Ministry of Labour and National Insurance</i> [1962] NI 6<i> </i>legislation to safeguard the employment of Northern Ireland workers (to the detriment of others who did not so qualify) was held by Lord MacDermott LCJ in the Court of Appeal to be clearly a matter within the power.  It is notable that there was no successful challenge during the period (some 50 years) of existence of the Parliament of Northern Ireland to any statutory provision on the ground that it fell outside the general power conferred by section 4 of the 1920 Act.  It is suggested in Calvert, <i>Constitutional Law in Northern Ireland </i>(1968), pp 170-172 that such a challenge might nevertheless succeed in an appropriate case, but its absence is at least negative evidence against the correctness of the suggestion.</p>
<p class="para">130.&nbsp;&nbsp;I accordingly agree with Lord Rodger in holding that it is not for the courts to substitute their judgment for that of the Secretary of State advising Her Majesty as to what can properly be said to conduce to the peace, order and good government of BIOT.  A court might understandably be strongly attracted to the view that a law which removes the Chagossians from their homeland cannot be said to be for the peace, order and good government of the colony.  But it is not for the courts to declare the law invalid on that ground.  Once they enter upon such territory they could very easily get into the area of challenging what is essentially a political judgment, which is not for the courts of law.  However distasteful they may consider a provision such as those under consideration in the present case, I think that the rule of abstinence should remain unqualified and the courts should not pronounce on the validity of such a provision on the ground that it is not for the peace, order and good government of the colony in question.</p>
<p class="para">131.&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn then to the question of the rationality of the 2004 Orders in Council.  It must be borne in mind that it is the <i>Wednesbury </i>standard which must be applied to the Secretary of State’s decision to have the Orders in Council enacted.  The Human Rights Act 1998 and the European Convention on Human Rights do not apply to BIOT - see Lord Hoffmann’s opinion at paras 64-65 - and therefore the applicable standard is not that of proportionality in the Convention context.  I think that it may be appropriate, however, to adopt the approach set out by Sir Thomas Bingham MR in <i>R v Ministry of Defence, Ex p Smith </i>[1996] QB 517, 554:</p>
<p class="qt">“The court may not interfere with the exercise of an administrative discretion on substantive grounds save where the court is satisfied that the decision is unreasonable in the sense that it is beyond the range of responses open to a reasonable decision-maker.  But in judging whether the decision-maker has exceeded this margin of appreciation the human rights context is important.  The more substantial the interference with human rights, the more the court will require by way of justification before it is satisfied that the decision is reasonable in the sense outlined above.”</p>
<p class="paraleft">The time at which the factors governing reasonableness have to be assessed is, self-evidently, the time of making the decision called into question.  One must therefore look at the situation obtaining at the time when the Orders in Council were made and consider whether it was reasonable in the <i>Wednesbury </i>sense, as qualified by <i>Smith</i>, to prohibit the Chagossians from returning to their homeland.  Could it be said, as Lord Rodger asks, that no reasonable Secretary of State could have so decided?</p>
