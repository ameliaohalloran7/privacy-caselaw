<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77. I also consider that the fact that Parliament made provision in section 7 of the 1990 Act for a justice of the peace to issue a search warrant in respect of a foreign offence does not point to the conclusion that it was the view of Parliament that there was no common law power to search and seize after an arrest for an extradition offence.  The issuing of a search warrant in relation to a foreign offence by a justice of the peace can only take place if particular premises are specified to the justice of the peace by the police and if a direction to apply for a search warrant has been given by the Secretary of State after he has received a request from a foreign court or authority (see section 7(4)).  But the power to seize and search to prevent the disappearance of material evidence is needed where the police pursuant to a provisional warrant arrest a suspect whose address in this country had been unknown to them until they located and arrested him (which appears to have been the position in this case) and where, prior to finding and arresting the suspect, it was not possible to apply for a search warrant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78. Nor do I consider that the fact that the common law power would not have attached to it any of the disciplines created by section 18 of PACE or PACE Code of Practice B is a reason for concluding that the existing common law power was extinguished by PACE.  I am of this opinion because the exercise of the power does have the discipline attached to it that it can only be exercised after a metropolitan magistrate or a justice of the peace is of the opinion from evidence supplied to him that the alleged conduct of the suspect would constitute an extradition offence and that the issue of a warrant for his arrest would be justified if the conduct had taken place within his jurisdiction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79. In paragraph 53 of its judgment the Divisional Court states that nothing in its judgment must be taken as negativing any power of the police to seize articles found in the possession of the person they are arresting.  But as I have observed, if the police have power at common law to search the person of the individual whom they have arrested under a warrant issued pursuant to section 8(1)(b), it seems contrary to common sense to hold that they do not have power to seize material evidence present in the room where he is arrested and also to search other rooms in his house and seize material evidence found in them.  Accordingly I would hold that the common law power of search and seizure after the execution of a warrant of arrest issued pursuant to section 8(1)(b) was not extinguished by PACE and that the police officers were entitled to exercise that power after the arrest of the respondent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80. Article 8 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or  the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others."<p></p></ul>
<p>I am unable to accept the respondent's submission that the common law power of search and seizure after arrest constitutes a violation of his rights under article 8.  The search and seizure was in accordance with the law which was clearly stated by Lloyd LJ in <i>Osman</i> [1990] 1 WLR 277.  The law was also clearly set out at p 175 of the well-known text book on extradition published in 1995 by Mr Alun Jones QC.  The power has the legitimate aim in a democratic society of preventing crime, and is necessary in order to prevent the disappearance of material evidence after the arrest of a suspect.  The power is proportionate to that aim because it is subject to the safeguards that it can only be exercised after a warrant of arrest has been issued by a magistrate or a justice of the peace in respect of an extradition crime and where the evidence placed before him would, in his opinion, justify the issue of a warrant for the arrest of a person accused of a similar domestic offence.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81. Accordingly I would answer the certified question "Yes, a police officer who has arrested a person in or on his premises pursuant to a warrant of arrest issued under section 8 of the Extradition Act 1989 has power to search those premises for, and to seize, any goods or documents which he reasonably believes to be material evidence in relation to the extradition crime in respect of which the warrant was issued".  I would allow the appeal and would set aside the order of the Divisional Court.</p>
<p><b>LORD RODGER OF EARLSFERRY</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82. I have had the advantage of considering the speech of my noble and learned friend, Lord Hutton in draft.  I agree with it and would accordingly allow the appeal.  In view of the careful submissions of counsel, and because my noble and learned friend, Lord Hope of Craighead is dissenting on certain points, I add some observations of my own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83. The provisional warrant for the respondent's arrest was addressed to each and all of the constables of the Metropolitan Police Force.  It required them "to arrest the defendant and bring the defendant" before the court.  In its terms the warrant did not give the officers express authority either to enter premises and search for the respondent in order to arrest him, or to enter premises and search for items which might be material evidence relating to the extradition offence for which he was to be arrested.  But, in the light of the observations of my noble and learned friend, Lord Hoffmann giving the unanimous views of the House in <i>R v Governor of Brixton Prison, Ex p Levin</i> [1997] AC 741, 746F - 747A, it was common ground that the officers executing the warrant for the respondent's arrest in connection with the extradition proceedings were indeed executing a warrant of arrest in connection with "criminal proceedings" in terms of section 17(1)(a)(i) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 ("PACE").  They accordingly had power under that provision to enter and search the respondent's premises for the purpose of executing the warrant by arresting the respondent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84. On behalf of the Crown Mr Perry submitted that not only did PACE give the officers executing the warrant this power, but it also gave them powers under sections 18 and 19, after arresting the respondent on the driveway of his house, to enter the house and search for and seize items of various kinds, especially those which they had reasonable grounds for believing were evidence in relation to the extradition offence.  For the reasons given by Lord Hutton I consider that these statutory powers do not apply where someone is arrested under a warrant for an extradition offence.  That, in a sense, is all that needs to be decided.  Nevertheless, despite the submissions of both counsel that sections 18 and 19 were the appropriate ones to consider and despite the decision of the Administrative Court on the point, I am far from satisfied that this is in fact correct.  The problem is that their approach does not have sufficient regard to the structure of the Act and places an unduly narrow construction on section 32.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85. Part I of PACE deals with "Powers to Stop and Search" and is not relevant for present purposes.  Part II, comprising sections 8 to 23, is entitled "Powers of Entry, Search and Seizure" and contains a wide range of provisions giving the police powers to enter premises and to search them.  These powers include the power to enter for the purposes of arresting someone (section 17), and the power "after arrest" to enter and search premises "occupied or controlled by a person who is under arrest for an arrestable offence" (section 18).  This is, of course, the power which Mr Perry sought to invoke on behalf of the Crown in this case.  Section 19 contains a general power for a constable "who is lawfully on any premises" to seize various items and to require the production of information in a computer (section 20), the power being in addition to any power otherwise conferred (section 19(5)).  Section 22 allows items seized under sections 19 and 20 to be retained as long as is necessary in all the circumstances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86. Then comes Part III which is headed "Arrest" and which runs from section 24 to section 33.  These sections contain wide-ranging provisions dealing with what is to happen when - if need be, after a search under section 17 - the individual is arrested.  Among these provisions is section 32, with the side-note title "Search upon arrest".  Section 32(1) gives a constable power to search an arrested person who "has been arrested at a place other than a police station" and subsections (8) and (9) provide for the seizure and detention of items found during the course of that kind of search.  Subsection (2)(b), which also applies when someone has been arrested other than at a police station, gives a police officer power:</p>
<p></p><ul>"to enter and search any premises in which he was when arrested or immediately before he was arrested for evidence relating to the offence for which he has been arrested."<p></p></ul>
<p>Section 32 contains no provisions dealing with the seizure and detention of any property which may be found during such a search, the reason plainly being that the necessary authority for seizure is to be found in sections 19 and 20, while section 22 gives the necessary power to retain items.  By contrast, since these sections deal only with searches of premises and not with searches of the person, it was necessary to include subsections (8) and (9) giving the specific powers of seizure and retention of property found during the search of the arrested person.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87. My Lords, but for counsel's insistence that section 32 had no bearing on this case, I should readily have concluded from its terms that it was indeed the section which dealt with any situation where the police arrested someone away from a police station, whether the arrest took place at the person's home or elsewhere.  In that situation section 32 would give the police officers power to search his person (subsection (1)) and power to enter and search any premises where he was when he was arrested or in which he had been immediately before his arrest (subsection (2)(b)).  These are powers which a constable can use in all such cases without any particular authorisation.  Miss Montgomery QC argued strenuously, however, that where, as here, someone was arrested at his home, section 18 rather than section 32 applied since the police would be entering and searching premises "<i>occupied or controlled</i> by a person who is under arrest for an arrestable offence" (emphasis added).  But, in truth, section 18 appears to be dealing, primarily at least, with a situation where the person is under arrest for an arrestable offence at a police station and the police wish to search premises to look for evidence.  In these circumstances section 18(1) gives a power to enter and search premises occupied or controlled by the person who is under arrest and subsection (2) gives power to seize and retain what is found.  Significantly, however, these powers to enter and search under subsection (1) are subject to certain safeguards, as envisaged in the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure referred to in paragraph 17 below.  In addition the powers cannot usually be exercised unless an officer of the rank of inspector or above has authorised them (subsection (4)).  This is similar to the requirement that applied under section 42 of the Larceny Act 1916 and section 26 of the Theft Act 1968.  These safeguards and limitations are consistent with the greater caution that the law has tended to show with regard to searches of premises other than those where the person was arrested (<i>Jeffrey v Black</i> [1978] QB 490).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88. Had it been necessary to decide the point, I should therefore have been inclined to hold that the powers of a constable to enter and search the premises where someone was arrested, or where he had been immediately before his arrest, were to be found in section 32, even though the premises in question were the person's home.  In other words, if the respondent had been arrested in relation to domestic proceedings, I should have held that the police officers' powers to search for evidence were to be found in section 32 rather than in section 18 and that their powers of seizure and retention of any items were to be found in sections 19, 20 and 22 rather than in sections 18(2) and 20.  It is, however, unnecessary to decide the point in this case since the power in section 32(2)(b) is to enter and search for evidence relating to "the offence" for which the person has been arrested.  For the reasons given by Lord Hutton in paragraph 26 of his speech, in relation to section 19(3)(a), I am satisfied that in section 32(2)(b) the term "offence" is confined to domestic offences and that the provision does not, accordingly, cover the situation where the respondent was being arrested in connexion with offences under German law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89. Since, then, PACE does not provide the authority for the search for evidence that the officers carried out in this case, two questions remain to be decided: first, whether before the enactment of PACE police officers would have had a common law power to search the respondent's premises when arresting him for an extradition crime under a warrant from the chief metropolitan stipendiary magistrate;  and, secondly, whether any such common law power of search had in any event been extinguished by the enactment of PACE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90. So far as the first question is concerned, Mr Perry submitted that authority for the existence of such a power of search in domestic cases was to be found in the opinion of Lord Denning MR in <i>Ghani v Jones</i> [1970] 1 QB 693, 706A - C:</p>
<p></p><ul>"I would start by considering the law where police officers enter a man's house by virtue of a warrant, or arrest a man lawfully, with or without a warrant, for a serious offence.  I take it to be settled law, without citing cases, that the officers are entitled to take any goods which they find in his possession or in his house which they reasonably believe to be material evidence in relation to the crime for which he is arrested or for which they enter.  If in the course of their search they come upon any other goods which show him to be implicated in some other crime, they may take them provided they act reasonably and detain them no longer than is necessary.  Such appears from the speech of Lord Chelmsford LC, in <i>Pringle v Bremner and Stirling</i> (1867) 5 Macph HL 55, 60 and <i>Chic Fashions (West Wales) Ltd v Jones</i> [1968] 2 QB 299."<p></p></ul>
<p>As the opening words of the third sentence show, in the previous sentence Lord Denning was holding that police officers arresting an individual have a power to search for goods in his possession or in his house and not merely a power to seize those which they happen to come across.  It is this proposition of settled law that is of importance for present purposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91. Mr Perry went on to point out that in <i>R v Governor of Pentonville Prison, Ex p Osman</i> [1990] 1 WLR 277, 311G - H, Lloyd LJ, giving the judgment of the Divisional Court, held that a police officer executing a provisional warrant under section 6 of the Fugitive Offenders Act 1967 enjoyed the same common law powers of search and seizure as in the case of domestic proceedings.  That approach should, Mr Perry submitted, be applied to police officers executing an arrest warrant under section 8 of the Extradition Act 1989 ("the Extradition Act").</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92. On the other hand Miss Montgomery argued that the House should not endorse Lord Denning's statement of the common law:  it contained an unduly expansive version of a police officer's powers of search.  In particular, the statement of the law was not supported by the authorities which Lord Denning cited.  In making this submission she was in effect adopting the criticism made by Professor David Feldman in <i>The Law Relating to Entry, Search and Seizure</i> (1986), pp 241-242, para 9.37.  In any event, she argued, Lloyd LJ had been wrong in <i>Osman</i> to hold that the same common law powers would apply to a constable executing an arrest warrant for an extradition offence: with a few exceptions, the common law was concerned only with crimes committed in England and Wales and it could not be used to give police officers acting in extradition proceedings a power that Parliament had not seen fit to bestow on them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93. Not the least remarkable feature of the common law on powers of search is the relative paucity of authority.  At the beginning stands the constitutional rock of <i>Entick v Carrington</i> (1765) 19 State Tr 1029 but then almost 90 years go by before Lord Campbell CJ's footnote in <i>Bessell v Wilson </i>(1853) 20 LT (OS) 233.  Thirty years later there is <i>Dillon v</i> <i>O'Brien and Davis</i> (1887) 16 Cox CC 245 but little of importance thereafter until <i>Elias v Pasmore</i> [1934] 2 KB 164.  Finally, come <i>Chic Fashions (West Wales) Ltd v Jones</i> [1968] 2 QB 299 and <i>Ghani v Jones</i>.  The decisions are not only few in number:  for the most part, the reasoning of the judges in the older cases is limited to the particular facts and illuminates only a small part of the landscape, so leaving the reader uncertain how the law applies just outside that area.  In practice, of course, police officers and those advising them had to decide what their lawful powers were, even in situations where the courts had not given guidance.  By 1929 and the report (Cmd 3297, Chapter IV, para 33) of the Royal Commission on Police Powers and Procedure chaired by Viscount Lee of Fareham, it had long been the practice of the police:</p>
<p></p><ul>"to search the dwelling of a person for whose arrest a warrant has been issued, and, in cases of arrest without warrant, to search premises as well as the arrested person, in cases of serious crime whenever it seems likely that any material evidence can be obtained.  In normal cases , the police obtain the consent of the occupiers before carrying out a search in such circumstances.  But it appears that, in the event of a refusal of consent, the police, if they proceed with the search, may be faced with the risk of a subsequent action for trespass.  This is a risk which is commonly taken by the police and the practice seems to have had the tacit approval of the courts for so long that, in the opinion of the Home Office, it has become part of the common law."<p></p></ul>
<p>The matter is restated in Chapter IV, para 120, where the Commission repeat the Home Office view that the police practice "had, by long use, become part of the common law".  The Royal Commission were themselves satisfied (para 121) that:</p>
<p></p><ul>"the existing practice of the police as to the search of premises is, in the main, necessary and proper in the interests of justice and cannot be regarded as in any way an undue infringement of the rights and liberties of the subject."<p></p></ul>
<p>The Royal Commission accordingly recommended that the existing police practice should be put on a statutory basis, "authorising them to search without a warrant the premises of persons who have been arrested."  See also Chapter XII, para 301(xxx). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94. The practice of police officers searching for material evidence in the home of a person for whom an arrest warrant had been issued was thus well established more than 70 years ago - despite there being no case in which the point had needed to be decided.  Moreover, the Royal Commission found the power to be acceptable and not to be in any way an undue infringement of the rights and liberties of the subject.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95. Of course, police practice does not make law, even when it is known to the courts.  None the less, in the absence of any challenge to that practice over many years, it is hardly surprising that in <i>Ghani v Jones</i> "without citing cases" Lord Denning could regard it as settled law that the police could carry out a search of this kind.  Starting from there he went on to deal with a different point:  if, in the course of the lawful search, the police officers came across items which showed that the arrested person was implicated in some other crime, they were entitled to take these items too, provided that they acted reasonably and detained them no longer than was necessary.  Lord Denning cited <i>Pringle v Bremner and Stirling</i> and <i>Chic Fashions (West Wales) Ltd v Jones </i>as authority for this second proposition.  There is no reason to suppose that he proceeded under some misapprehension as to the relevance of these cases to the proposition of settled law that he had already stated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96. Subsequent events have only served to confirm that the proposition itself was sound.  In <i>Jeffrey v Black</i> [1978] QB 490, 496F - 497C and 499C both Lord Widgery CJ and Forbes J appear to have proceeded on the basis that, so far as affirming a right to search the premises where an accused was arrested, Lord Denning's formulation of the law was not open to question.  Similarly, when it had stood for a further 11 years, in <i>R v Governor of Pentonville Prison, Ex p Osman</i> [1990] 1 WLR 277 Lloyd LJ regarded the point as being "beyond dispute".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97. The line of cases stops here.  To judge from them, until the present proceedings the power of a police officer to search the house of someone arrested under a warrant had never been challenged in the courts since the days of crinolines and Palles B.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98. The scope of the power of police officers to search people whom they have arrested also came under the notice of the Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure chaired by Sir Cyril Philips.  Their Report was published in two volumes in 1981:  <i>Report</i> (Cmnd 8092) and <i>The Investigation and Prosecution of Criminal Offences in England and Wales:  The Law and Procedure</i> (Cmnd 8092-1).  In <i>The Investigation</i>, p 12, para 34, the Commission accepted as accurate the statement of the law in <i>Archbold Pleading, Evidence and Practice in Criminal Cases,</i> 40th ed (1979), para 1410, which was based, almost word for word, on the passage in Lord Denning's judgment in <i>Ghani v Jones</i>.  The Commission noted (<i>Report</i>, para 3.119) that the police had power to search the arrested person's "immediate surroundings" but that there was doubt about whether the power extended to the premises of a person arrested elsewhere.  They therefore recommended that a statutory power with suitable safeguards should be introduced (paras 3.120 - 122).  There was, however, no suggestion that the accepted common law powers of search on arrest should be abridged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99. Miss Montgomery may well be right, of course, to say that Lord Denning formulated the common law powers of search on arrest more widely than had been done in earlier cases.  What was novel, however, was not the understanding of the law as such but the fact that it had finally been stated by a court.  As <i>Chic Fashions (West Wales) Ltd v Jones</i> [1968] 2 QB 299, 312 - 313 shows, Lord Denning had been concerned to draw together the earlier sparse authorities and to restate the law in a more systematic way, that took account of the circumstances of the day.  <i>Ghani v Jones</i> is an example of the same approach.  The real question for your Lordships in the present case, accordingly, is not whether in 1969 the pre-existing authorities technically justified Lord Denning's statement of the law in this passage in <i>Ghani v Jones</i> but whether the common law today should be regarded as conferring on police officers executing a warrant for the arrest of an individual such powers to search for evidence as Lord Denning described.  I am satisfied that it should.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100. To insist on a narrow interpretation of the earlier scattered case law and to confine the police officers' power to searching the accused's person and seizing articles in the room where he happens to be when arrested would make it a matter of chance whether potentially important evidence was recovered or lost.  By contrast, Lord Denning's (by no means expansive) rationalisation of the law at one and the same time removes the element of chance and confirms the legality of what had been, to the knowledge of the courts, the practice of the police for decades.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101. Moreover, whether one has regard to section 32 or section 18 of PACE, along with sections 19, 20 and 22, their effect is to give police officers powers that are certainly subjected to certain refinements, particularly in relation to legal professional privilege, but that do not otherwise differ greatly in scope from the common law powers as stated by Lord Denning.  By enacting these provisions, Parliament followed the course recommended by the two Royal Commissions and clarified the law.  In doing so Parliament broadly endorsed the well-established policy enshrined in Lord Denning's statement that police officers should be entitled to search the home of someone arrested by virtue of a warrant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102. I note, moreover, that the practical effect of Lord Denning's approach is to produce a situation which corresponds broadly to that in Scotland where a sheriff grants a warrant for someone's arrest on a serious charge.  In that jurisdiction the modern case law contains no equivalent of the debate in England about the powers of search of police officers executing an arrest warrant.  This is because of the practice of the sheriff court when granting such warrants.  The procurator fiscal asks for a warrant not simply to apprehend the accused person but "to <i>search for</i> and apprehend" him (emphasis added).  So the police officers executing the warrant are given express authority from the court to search for the person in order to arrest him.  More importantly for present purposes, the procurator fiscal's petition always goes on to ask the sheriff:</p>
<p></p><ul>"to grant warrant to search the person, repositories, and domicile of said accused, and the house or premises in which he may be found, and to secure for the purpose of precognition and evidence all writs, evidents, and articles found otherwise tending to establish guilt or participation in the crime foresaid, and for that purpose to make patent all shut and lockfast places."<p></p></ul>
<p>(See the petition set out in form 1 in Appendix I to Renton and Brown's <i>Criminal Procedure,</i> 3rd ed (1956), p 455, unfortunately omitted from later editions.)  Therefore, when the sheriff grants a warrant to search for, and to arrest, the accused, as a matter of routine he also grants a warrant to search for evidence relating to the crime, including the warrant to search the house or premises where the accused is found.  The result is that, when a person is arrested at his home under a search warrant, the officers carrying out the arrest are authorised to search his home - just as Lord Denning held that they could under English law.  The fact that sheriffs in Scotland regularly grant this (not dissimilar, though rather wider) power of search when they grant an arrest warrant tends to confirm that Lord Denning's view of the policy underpinning the English common law was sound and not unduly generous to the police.  The House should not now question that view or this aspect of the common law as he stated it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103. In <i>Ghani v Jones</i> [1970] 1 QB 693 Lord Denning was not dealing with arrest warrants in extradition proceedings.  For the reasons given by Lord Hutton, however, I am satisfied that there is no reason to criticise the Divisional Court's decision, in <i>Osman</i> [1990] 1 WLR 277 that police officers should have the same common law powers when executing an arrest warrant relating to extradition proceedings.  As the court recognised, the same considerations as make those powers appropriate in a domestic case make them appropriate in an extradition case.  The recognition that those powers are available in extradition proceedings does not contradict or cut across any provision of the extradition legislation;  rather it supports the policy of that legislation.  The days are long gone when the common law could be blind to everything occurring outside the realm.  Where Parliament has enacted extradition legislation with a view to assisting the forces of justice, law and order in certain other countries, there can be no legitimate objection in principle to the common law developing in a manner that promotes rather than hinders that objective.</p>
