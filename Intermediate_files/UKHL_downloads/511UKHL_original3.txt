<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Ex p Postlethwaite</i> [1988]  AC 924, 947 referring to the judgment of Lord Russell of Killowen CJ in <i>In re Arton (No 2)</i> [1896]  1 QB 509, Lord Bridge of Harwich stated:</p>
<p></p><ul>"I also take the judgment in that case as good authority for the proposition that in the application of the principle the court should not, unless constrained by the language used, interpret any extradition treaty in a way which would 'hinder the working and narrow the operation of most salutary international arrangements'.  The second principle is that an extradition treaty is 'a contract between two sovereign states and has to be construed as such a contract.  It would be a mistake to think that it had to be construed as though it were a domestic statute': <i> R v Governor of Ashford Remand Centre, Ex p Beese</i> [1973]  1 WLR 969, 973, per Lord Widgery CJ.  In applying this second principle, closely related as it is to the first, it must be remembered that the reciprocal rights and obligations which the high contracting parties confer and accept are intended to serve the purpose of bringing to justice those who are guilty of grave crimes committed in either of the contracting states.  To apply to extradition treaties the strict canons appropriate to the construction of domestic legislation would often tend to defeat rather than to serve this purpose."<p></p></ul>
<p>I have no doubt that at the end of the penultimate sentence of that passage Lord Bridge would have added "or within the extra-territorial jurisdiction of either of the contracting states" if the House had been considering an extra-territorial crime in that case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;65. I further consider that there are provisions in the 1870 Act which support the argument advanced on behalf of the government of the United States by Mr Lewis.  First, section 26 of the Act defines an "extradition crime" as a crime which "if committed in England or within English jurisdiction" would be one of the crimes described in the first Schedule to the Act.  The implicit distinction between a crime committed in England and a crime committed within English jurisdiction points to the Act having an extra-territorial effect.  Secondly, piracy by law of nations is one of the extradition crimes described in the first Schedule to the Act and shows that the term "jurisdiction" in the Act is not restricted to territorial jurisdiction.  Thirdly, section 6 of the 1870 Act provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Where this Act applies in the case of any foreign state, every fugitive criminal of that state who is in or suspected of being in any part of Her Majesty's dominions, or that part which is specified in the order applying this Act (as the case may be), shall be liable to be apprehended and surrendered in manner provided by this Act, whether the crime in respect of which the surrender is sought was committed before or after the date of the order, and whether there is or is not any concurrent jurisdiction in any court of Her Majesty's dominions over that crime."<p></p></ul>
<p>The recognition that a number of courts in Her Majesty's Dominions may have jurisdiction over the same crime suggests an extra-territorial jurisdiction in one of those courts.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66. Moreover article I of the 1972 treaty between the United Kingdom and the United States of America provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Each contracting party undertakes to extradite to the other, in the circumstances and subject to the conditions specified in this treaty, any person found in its territory who has been accused or convicted of any offence within article III, committed within the jurisdiction of the other Party."<p></p></ul>
<p>Again the implied distinction between the "territory" of the requested state and the jurisdiction of the requesting state suggests that the concept of "jurisdiction" is wider than territory.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;67. I consider that the fact that section 2 of the 1989 Act includes certain extra-territorial offences in the definition of "extradition crime", but that section 2 does not extend to Schedule 1, does not advance the appellants' case, as in my opinion Parliament recognised that the extradition crimes referred to in Schedule 1 (the provisions of which derive from the 1870 Act) already included extra-territorial offences by virtue of the provisions of the 1870 Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;68. Article IX of the treaty is concerned with the sufficiency of the evidence before the magistrate of the requested state to permit him to make an order leading to the extradition of the accused person.  In my opinion the reference in article IX to "if the offence of which he is accused had been committed in the territory of the requested party" relates only to the sufficiency of the evidence and is not intended to restrict the jurisdiction of the magistrate to a hypothetical crime committed in the territory of England and Wales.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;69. Nor do I think that the provision in paragraph 15 of Schedule 1 to the 1989 Act that certain extra-territorial crimes be deemed to be committed within the jurisdiction of certain states points to the conclusion that without that provision extra-territorial crimes would not be within the scope of the extradition procedures to which Schedule 1 applies.  I consider that paragraph 15 is intended to simplify the task of the magistrate and to obviate the need for him to decide the issue whether, when a person is accused of an offence outside the territory of the requesting state, that state has extra-territorial jurisdiction over that offence.  As Lord Ackner stated in <i>R v Governor of Pentonville Prison, Ex p Sinclair </i> [1991]  2 AC 64, 91F:</p>
<p></p><ul>"I cannot accept that the legislature intended that it was to be part of the function of the police magistrate to preside over lengthy proceedings occupying weeks, and on occasions months, of his time hearing heavily contested evidence of foreign law directed to whether there had been due compliance with the many and varied obligations of the relevant treaty."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70. Whilst there is no case which is decisive on the issue now before your Lordships, I think that the authorities give more support to the submissions of the Government of the United States of America than to the submissions of the appellants.  The appellants relied upon passages in the judgments in <i>R v Governor of Brixton Prison, Ex p Schtraks</i> [1964]  AC 556 and <i>R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p Rees</i> [1986]  AC 937.   They relied on the statement by Lord Reid in <i>Ex p</i> <i>Schtraks</i> at p 579B:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In my judgment neither the Extradition Act, 1870, nor the Order to which I have referred is concerned with sovereignty;  they are concerned with territory in which territorial jurisdiction is exercised."<p></p></ul>
<p>However the issue before the House in that case related to the wording of article I of the Extradition Treaty between the United Kingdom and Israel and the relevant article did not contain the word "jurisdiction" but rather the word "territory".  Article I provided:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The contracting parties agree to extradite to each other, in the circumstances stated in the present agreement, those persons who, being accused or convicted of any of the offences enumerated in article 3 and committed within the territory of the one party, or on the high seas on board a vessel registered in the territory of that party, shall be found within the territory of the other party."<p></p></ul>
<p>One of the offences of which the prisoner was accused was alleged to have been committed in Jerusalem.  The United Kingdom did not recognise the Israel government as having <i>de jure</i> sovereignty in Jerusalem but only <i>de facto</i> authority.  Therefore the question before the House was whether Jerusalem was within the "territory" of Israel.  I consider that Lord Reid's observation must be read in that context and was not intended as a definitive statement that the Extradition Act 1870 could not apply to extra-territorial crimes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;71. In <i>Ex p Rees</i> [1986] AC 937 the requesting state was the Federal Republic of Germany and the crime of which the prisoner was accused was the detention of a hostage (a West German national) in Bolivia.  Lord Mackay of Clashfern stated, at p 955F:</p>
<p></p><ul>"When the Act of 1870 was passed it dealt only with crimes committed within the territorial jurisdiction of a state with whom an extradition arrangement had been made:  see, for example, <i>R v Governor of Brixton Prison, Ex p Schtraks</i> [1964] AC 556, per Lord Reid, at p 579."<p></p></ul>
<p>However it is apparent that Lord Mackay's statement was based upon Lord Reid's observation and, with respect, is difficult to reconcile with the fact that piracy by the law of nations was an extradition crime within the ambit of the 1870 Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72. I consider that the judgment of the Privy Council delivered by Lord Griffiths in <i>Liangsiriprasert v Government of the United States of America</i> [1991]  1 AC 225 does give considerable support to the submissions of the Government of the United States of America.  In that case the accused conspired in Thailand to import heroin into the United States.  He then went to Hong Kong and the United States of America requested his extradition from there.  The extradition procedures in Hong Kong were governed by the terms of the Extradition Acts 1870-1935 (see p 241C).  The law of conspiracy in Hong Kong was the same as the common law of conspiracy in England, and the accused argued that a conspiracy entered into abroad is not a common law crime unless either some overt act pursuant to the conspiracy takes place in England, or alternatively at least the impact of the conspiracy is felt in England.  This argument was rejected by the Privy Council.  Lord Griffiths stated, at p 241G, that the task of the magistrate was to apply Hong Kong law and to consider whether the evidence disclosed a prima facie case against the accused upon the assumption that the drugs were to be imported into Hong Kong rather than into the United States, and he stated, at p 251C:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Unfortunately in this century crime has ceased to be largely local in origin and effect.  Crime is now established on an international scale and the common law must face this new reality.  Their Lordships can find nothing in precedent, comity or good sense that should inhibit the common law from regarding as justiciable in England inchoate crimes committed abroad which are intended to result in the commission of criminal offences in England.  Accordingly a conspiracy entered into in Thailand with the intention of committing the criminal offence of trafficking in drugs in Hong Kong is justiciable in Hong Kong even if no overt act pursuant to the conspiracy has yet occurred in Hong Kong."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73. Therefore it is clear that the Privy Council proceeded on the basis that "jurisdiction" in the 1870 Act was not confined to the territory of the requesting state and to the territory of the requested state.  But it is not entirely clear whether this point was raised for decision by the Board because Mr Martin Thomas QC, counsel for the accused, stated at p 229A that the principles related to extradition were not in dispute and Mr Alun Jones QC, for the requesting government, also stated at p 231G that there was no issue between the appellant and the respondents about the extradition aspects of the case and at p 241G Lord Griffiths stated that it was common ground that the crimes were all extradition crimes.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74. However, even if, as the Administrative Court stated in its judgment, the Privy Council assumed, rather than decided, the point, it is clear that the Privy Council was content to accept that "jurisdiction" in the 1870 Act was not confined to territory, and I consider that the judgment does provide strong support for the argument advanced by the respondent and that the effect of the decision was correctly stated by <i>Jones on Extradition</i> (1995), p 88, para 3-023:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Although the point was not argued, <i>Liangsiriprasert</i> is to be taken as clear authority for the proposition that the word 'jurisdiction' in the definition of the words 'extradition crime' in section 26 of the 1870 Act and paragraph 20 of Schedule 1 to the 1989 Act is not limited to 'territory'."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75. Therefore for the reasons which I have stated I would reject the argument on behalf of the appellants that in the 1870 Act, the Order in Council and Schedule 1 to the 1989 Act "jurisdiction" is limited to the territory of the state, and in my opinion the Administrative Courts were in error in so holding.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76. In <i>R v Governor of Pentonville Prison, Ex p Osman</i> [1990]  1 WLR 277 the Divisional Court gave consideration to section 7(5) of the Fugitive Offenders' Act 1967 (a provision similar to Article IX of the treaty with the United States of America) under which the magistrate must consider whether there is sufficient evidence against the accused person to warrant his trial if the offence had been committed "within the jurisdiction" of the magistrate.  Lloyd LJ referred to the difficulty in relation to transposition which he described as follows, at p 290C:</p>
<p></p><ul>"However, a difficulty arises when the act or omissions constituting the offence take place in two or more countries.  Does one assume that all the acts or omissions constituting the offence took place within the United Kingdom?  Or only those which in fact took place within the territorial limits of the requesting country?"<p></p></ul>
<p>He then stated that in the light of the authorities only the acts or omissions which took place in the requesting state are to be treated as having taken place in England.  All else remains as it in fact happened.  But I think it is important to note that Lloyd LJ was considering the issue of transposition on the basis that the English magistrate was considering a case where the offence alleged was not an extra-territorial offence and where the English magistrate would only have jurisdiction over the offence if it had been committed within his territorial jurisdiction.  Thus in commencing his consideration of the subject Lloyd LJ stated, at p 289E:</p>
<p></p><ul>"But if the defendant is alleged to have committed an offence outside the territorial jurisdiction of the court, then unless the offence is an extra-territorial one, he has committed no offence against English law."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77. In the present case it is common ground that the United States of America has extra-territorial jurisdiction over the alleged offence and that the United Kingdom also has extra-territorial jurisdiction over the alleged offence.  Therefore, in my opinion, no difficulty arises in respect of transposition.  The offence is triable within the jurisdiction of the United States of America and, as transposed, is triable,  as section 26 of the 1870 Act requires, "within English jurisdiction".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78. Mr Fitzgerald submitted that the magistrate had to be satisfied that the United States of America had jurisdiction to try the alleged offence and that there was also jurisdiction in England to try the alleged offence.  In this case where both the United States of America and the United Kingdom have extra-territorial jurisdiction over the alleged offence that requirement is clearly satisfied.  And, as I have already stated, I consider that the purpose of paragraph 15 of Schedule 1 to the 1989 Act is to ensure that in respect of the offences specified in it the magistrate will not have to embark on a lengthy hearing to determine whether under the law of the requesting state it had extra-territorial jurisdiction over the alleged offence.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79. Accordingly for the reasons which I have stated I consider that as both the United States of America and the United Kingdom have extra-territorial jurisdiction to try the alleged conspiracy there was jurisdiction for the magistrate to commit the appellants to prison to await the warrants of the Secretary of State for their surrender to the United States of America.  Therefore it is unnecessary to consider the ground on which the Administrative Courts held that the magistrate had jurisdiction, namely that overt action pursuant to the conspiracy had been carried out in the United States of America.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80. The appellants raised other issues before the two Administrative Courts which were also raised before this House.  </p>
<i><p><i>The admissibility of the evidence of the anonymous witness CS/1</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81. The evidence of CS/1 was described as follows by Buxton LJ in the judgment of the Administrative Court in the case of <i>Al-Fawwaz </i> [2001]  1 WLR 1234, 1246G:</p>
<p></p><ul>"CS/1 claims to have been directly involved in the conspiracy and to be in mortal fear by reason of his co-operation with the authorities.  He needs anonymity at this stage to protect himself, though it is envisaged that he will give evidence revealing his identity at the trial in the United States of America.  His evidence is of the first importance, because it directly involves Mr Al-Fawwaz in the conspiracy.  Mr Fitzgerald was careful not to concede that CS/1's evidence, if admitted, concluded the issue of whether there was a prima facie case, since he said that the evidence was open to criticism on grounds of imprecision.  In reality, however, it is impossible to conclude that a magistrate who acted on the evidence of CS/1 to commit Mr Al-Fawwaz, as the magistrate acted in this case, would be acting irrationally in <i>Ex p Osman</i> terms".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82. The three appellants submitted that the magistrate was wrong in law and/or acted irrationally in admitting the evidence of CS/1.  They relied on the judgment of the Court of Appeal in <i>R v Taylor (Gary)</i> (The Times, 17 August 1994) where at the trial of the appellant, who had been convicted of perverting the course of justice by being involved in the disposal of the body of a murder victim, the judge permitted a witness to give corroborative evidence behind the screen without revealing her name and address.  The defendant appealed on the ground that he had a fundamental right to see and hear the identity of the witness called against him save in rare or exceptional circumstances.  The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal.  In delivering the judgment of the court Evans LJ stated:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In so far as counsel for the appellant submitted that it was a fundamental right of a defendant to see and know the identity of his accusers, including witnesses for the Crown, which should only be denied in rare and exceptional circumstances, their Lordships agreed with him.  The matter was pre-eminently one for the exercise of the judge's discretion, and the following factors were relevant to the exercise of that discretion:<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"1.&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be real grounds for fear of the consequences if the evidence were given and the identity of the witness revealed.  In practical terms it might well be sufficient to draw a parallel with section 23(3)(b) of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, which concerned the admissibility of statements where the witness did not wish to give oral evidence through fear, but in principle it might not be necessary for the witness himself to be fearful or to be fearful for himself alone.  There could be cases where concern was expressed by other persons, or where the witness was concerned for his family rather than for himself.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence must be sufficiently relevant and important to make it unfair to make the Crown proceed without it.  A distinction could be drawn between cases where the creditworthiness of the witness was in question rather than his accuracy.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"3.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Crown must satisfy the court that the creditworthiness of the witness had been fully investigated and disclosed.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"4.&nbsp;&nbsp;The court must be satisfied that there would be no undue prejudice to the accused, although some prejudice was inevitable, even if it was only the qualification placed on the right to confront a witness as accuser.  There might also be factors pointing the other way, for example as in the present case where the defendants could see the witness on a video screen.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"5.&nbsp;&nbsp;The court could balance the need for protection of the witness, including the extent of that protection, against unfairness or the appearance of unfairness.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"It seemed to their Lordships that there was no reason in principle why the same considerations should not apply to a witness for the defence.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"The judge's ruling in the present case was detailed and referred to the factors listed above.  The law gave the trial judge the power to make an order that a witness remain anonymous in the exercise of his discretion, and the present case was not one where there were any grounds for supposing that the witness was not impartial or had an axe to grind.  In their Lordships' view the judge was entitled to conclude that the witness be allowed to give her evidence anonymously."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83. In the course of giving his decision in the case of Mr Al-Fawwaz the magistrate considered the judgment in <i>R v Taylor</i> and said this:</p>
<p></p><ul>"I am satisfied that there are real grounds for fear of the consequences if the identity of the witnesses were revealed.  The evidence, particularly that of CS/1, is sufficiently important to make it unfair to make the Government proceed without it . . . .the Government seeks to satisfy this court that the creditworthiness of CS/1 has been fully investigated and disclosed.  I am not so satisfied.  Perhaps that is because no attempt was made in the preparation of this extradition request to focus on that one issue.  The time when it is most important that the court is so satisfied on these issues is at the effective trial.  No doubt more information will be put before the trial judge in the event of extradition taking place.  I know nothing to the detriment of CS/1's creditworthiness.  What I do know is that the cumulative effect of all the circumstantial evidence is such that CS/1's evidence can not be described as so inherently incredible that no jury properly directed could convict on it. The remaining evidence is exactly what one would expect to find if all that CS/1 says is true.  The facts in [<i>US v Tomlins</i> (unreported) 18 November 1994] are unusual.  It is rare for a defendant to be in a position where he is able to discredit a prosecution witness to the extent that a committal court will conclude that a witness's evidence is worthless.  The fact that one of the 'principles' (<i>R v Taylor</i> The Times, 17 August 1994) to be followed in this situation may not be satisfactorily met does not mean that this court, exercising its functions in extradition proceedings, is automatically bound to rule the evidence inadmissible.  These are rare and exceptional circumstances in existence in this case.  In all the circumstances, I am satisfied that there would be no undue prejudice to Mr Al-Fawwaz by my admitting the evidence of CS/1 and CS/2.  Accordingly I rule that evidence admissible in these committal proceedings."<p></p></ul>
<p>It is relevant to note that the United States government has now decided and confirmed that the identity of CS/1 would be disclosed in America.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84. Further guidance as to the approach to be taken by a court hearing a challenge by an accused to the decision of a magistrate or judge to admit the evidence of an anonymous witness is given in the judgments delivered in <i>R v D J X</i> (1989)  91 Cr App R 36 and <i>R v Watford Magistrates Court, Ex p Lenman</i> [1993]  Crim LR 388.  In the former case Lord Lane CJ stated at p 40:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The learned judge has the duty on this and on all other occasions of endeavouring to see that justice is done.  Those are high sounding words.  What it really means is, he has got to see that the system operates fairly:  fairly not only to the defendants but also to the prosecution and also to the witnesses.  Sometimes he has to make decisions as to where the balance of fairness lies.  He came to the conclusion that in these circumstances the necessity of trying to ensure that these children would be able to give evidence outweighed any possible prejudice to the defendants by the erection of the screen."<p></p></ul>
<p>Although the judgment related to the anonymity of child witnesses the statement is of general application.  In the latter case the court constituted by Beldam LJ and Laws J held: </p>
<p></p><ul>"If a magistrate was satisfied that there was a real risk to the administration of justice, because a witness on reasonable grounds feared for his safety if his identity were disclosed, it was entirely within the powers of the magistrate to take reasonable steps to protect and reassure the witness so that the witness was not deterred from coming forward to give evidence.  If, however, the rights of an accused, particularly his ability to prepare and conduct his defence were thereby prejudiced, justice required the court to balance the prejudice to him and the interests of justice.  It might well be that on substantial grounds being shown justice would require the witness's identity to be disclosed.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"It was difficult to think of a decision more dependent on the exercise of discretion than the magistrate's decision in this case.  The court would not interfere with such a decision unless it was shown that it was so unreasonable that no magistrate properly considering it and properly directing himself, could have reached that conclusion."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85. Therefore the authorities emphasise that the decision whether to admit evidence from an anonymous witness is a matter of deciding where the balance of fairness lies between the prosecution and the accused and that it is pre-eminently a matter for the discretion of the magistrate or judge conducting the hearing.  I would reject the submission that the magistrate erred in law or acted irrationally in admitting the evidence of CS/1 where he was not satisfied that the United States government had fully investigated and disclosed the creditworthiness of the witness.  This was one of the factors to be put into the balance when the magistrate was deciding how he would exercise his discretion and it is clear that he did take account of this factor.  I consider that it cannot be said that his decision was so unreasonable that no magistrate properly considering the matter and properly directing himself could have reached the conclusion that he did.  The magistrate was making a decision as to where the balance of fairness lay and he was entitled to find as he did.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86. I would add that there is a degree of inconsistency between the statement of the Court of Appeal in <i>R v Taylor (Gary) </i>The Times, 17 August 1994 that the accused has a fundamental right to see and know the identity of his accusers save in rare and exceptional circumstances and its statement of the factors which the judge should balance in the exercise of his discretion, some of which point to the preservation of the anonymity of a witness.  The later judgments in <i>R v D J X</i> 91 CrAppR 36 and <i>Ex p Lenman</i> [1993] Crim LR 388 lay emphasis on the magistrate or judge having to strike a balance of fairness between the prosecution and the accused, in which process the importance of the accused knowing the identity of his accuser is a factor of great weight, but I think that in some cases the balance of fairness may come down in favour of the prosecution notwithstanding that the circumstances could not be described as rare and exceptional.  However in the case of a trial, as opposed to committal proceedings, account  must now be taken of the Strasbourg jurisprudence relating to article 6 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87. The appellants also submitted that the admission of the evidence of the anonymous witness CS/1 was in breach of article 6(3)(d) of the European Convention which provides that anyone charged with a criminal offence has the right to examine or have examined witnesses against him.  The appellants recognised that they faced the difficulty that there is no provision for cross-examination in committal proceedings on an application for extradition, but they submitted that their inability to cross-examine made it important that the defence should not be deprived of information as to the identity of a witness when knowledge of his identity might enable them to demonstrate that his evidence was unreliable because he was actuated by malice or hostility.  In my opinion the two Administrative Courts were right to reject this argument as it is clear from the decision of the European Commission of Human Rights in <i>Kirkwood v United Kingdom</i> (1984)  37 DR 158 that the provisions of article 6 do not apply to a committal hearing on an application for extradition, the Commission stating, at p 191, para 9 of its decision:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Nevertheless, the Commission concludes that these proceedings did not in themselves form part of the determination of the applicant's guilt or innocence, which will be the subject of separate proceedings in the United States which may be expected to conform to standards of fairness equivalent to the requirements of article 6, including the presumption of innocence, notwithstanding the committal proceedings.  In these circumstances the Commission concludes that the committal proceedings did not form part of or constitute the determination of a criminal charge within the meaning of article 6 of the Convention."<p></p></ul>
