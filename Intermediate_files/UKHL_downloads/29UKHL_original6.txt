<p class="para">130.&nbsp;&nbsp;However that may be, I do not find in <i>Geerings </i>any support or coherent justification for Mr Owen’s submission to the House that so long as what is being confiscated are “assets clearly shown to have been in the possession of the accused in circumstances where the accused fails to establish their lawful origin, then the fact that any confiscation order is based on a finding of criminal conduct beyond the index offence will not offend either article 6(1) or 6(2)", but that where <i>“no </i>suspicious assets are capable of being identified so as to require an explanation from the accused, then an order which necessarily <i>assumes</i> the existence of suspicious assets going beyond those obtained by the index offence will violate article 6” (Case par. 6.18). The submission seeks to derive European conclusions from particular assumptions forming part of the United Kingdom’s domestic legislation. It attaches an irrational magic to the possession of assets (over a period which under English law stretches back at least six years prior to the criminal proceedings). </p>
<p class="para">131.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the domestic legislation, the possession of such assets (consisting of property or evidenced by expenditure) is no more than the trigger to the transfer of the onus of proof on the overall issue whether and what benefit and proceeds existed to the defendant to disprove assumptions that particular property or expenditure reflects the benefit and proceeds of drug trafficking. The assumptions are legislative features introduced to counteract the difficulty of establishing drug trafficking, its benefits and proceeds. The best form of proof of drug trafficking and of its benefits and proceeds is direct evidence, including (as here) admissions by the defendant. If article 6(2), which enshrines the presumption of innocence in respect of criminal charges, has any application to confiscation order proceedings, one would expect it to apply more, not less, readily to proceedings where assumptions were made against a defendant. But it is accepted that article 6(2) of the Convention has no application to the confiscation order procedure where the Crown relies on assumptions derived from the possession of property or making of expenditure over the last six years and on that basis shifts to the defendant an onus of proof to disprove his assumed drug trafficking to a civil standard. I see no logic in, and no justification in Strasbourg jurisprudence for, a conclusion that article 6(2) becomes applicable to a confiscation order procedure where the Crown cannot or does not rely on the statutory assumptions and so has itself to accept the onus of proving the relevant benefit from drug trafficking to a civil standard by more direct means (here, admissions). If the former exercise involves the “kind or level of punishment” (see <i>Engels</i>, paragraph 14 above) and is “part of the sentencing process under domestic law", as the European Court of Human Rights stated in <i>Phillips</i> and <i>van Offeren</i>, then so too does the latter. I would only add that Richards LJ summarised most of the above points very neatly in a way with which I agree in paragraphs 43-44 of his judgment in the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p class="para">132.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of your Lordships take the view that, where the statutory assumptions are not deployed, then the prosecution must prove any relevant drug trafficking on which reliance is placed (other than that consisting in the offences of which the defendant has been convicted) to the criminal standard (although, if I have understood correctly, any benefit resulting from such trafficking would still only need to be proved to the civil standard). There is, in my view, no basis under article 6(1) or (2) for such distinctions. They would be inconsistent with the unitary nature of the scheme which I have explained in paras 103-106 above. The standard of proof of every aspect of benefit by drug trafficking is in my view the civil standard, whether such benefit is established by direct or indirect evidence. The indirect route provided by the assumptions merely involves a shifting of the onus of proof. Further, as I have explained in para 117 above, any suggestion that such a distinction exists by reason of the requirement of a “fair hearing” under article 6(1) is inconsistent with the clear reasoning of the European Court of Human Rights under that article in <i>Phillips</i>. </p>
<p class="para">133.&nbsp;&nbsp;The most recent Strasbourg authority is <i>Grayson &amp; Barnham v. United Kingdom </i>(Application nos. 19955/05 and 15085/06) decided 23rd September 2008. In each of the two cases involved, the English court had, following convictions of drug offences (consisting in Mr Grayson’s case of an unsuccessful attempt to supply heroin which the police seized and in Mr Barnham’s case of two unsuccessful conspiracies to import drugs), concluded in later confiscation proceedings that the defendants had benefited by and received the proceeds of extensive drug trafficking over the six year period preceding the proceedings (in Mr Barnham’s case evidenced by, inter alia, the £840,000 cost of two cannabis consignments, the purchase of which he had admitted to an undercover police officer, but had <i>not </i>been charged with). The statutory assumptions were applied. Complaints were made of violation of article 6(1) as well as of article 1 of the first protocol, both of which the Court rejected.  The Court recited its reasoning on the similar complaints made in <i>Phillips</i>, and noted once again that “the making of a confiscation order under the 1994 Act was analogous to a sentencing procedure", but remained subject to article 6 § 1 “which applies throughout the entirety of proceedings for ‘the determination of ... any criminal charge', including proceedings whereby a sentence is fixed” (para. 37). After further detailed analysis of the scheme and procedure, the court concluded that there had been no breach of either article 6(1) or the first protocol, despite the reversal of the onus of proof where the assumptions applied.</p>
<p class="para">134.&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary:</p>
<p class="qt">“(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;The jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights has clearly accepted the legitimacy of a confiscation order based on conclusions about drug trafficking other than that of which the defendant was convicted, and has held that the making of such an order does not of itself involve a charge within article 6(2). </p>
<p class="qt">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather, such an order is regarded as part of the sentencing process, designed and permitted in order to strip from the defendant benefit in the form of proceeds of his own or other’s offending, at least to the extent that he has current assets sufficient in value to cover the amount of such benefit. </p>
<p class="qt">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Strasbourg case-law also shows the European Court of Human Rights taking a similar approach to the United Kingdom courts in this regard, without drawing any distinction between cases of confiscation orders based on direct proof of the benefit made and proceeds received and cases where they are based on assumptions drawn from the possession at some time of unexplained assets (see the analysis above of the reasoning and decisions in <i>van Offeren</i>,<i> Phillips </i>and <i>Grayson and Barnham</i>). </p>
<p class="qt">(4)<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Geerings </i>stands for a possible exception, in the case of an order based on benefit and proceeds from an offence with which the defendant was charged and of which he was acquitted, although it is in apparent, unremarked conflict on this point with the previous decision of an almost identically constituted chamber in <i>van Offeren</i>. </p>
<p class="qt">(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;That possible exception has no relevance in this case. Here the fact that the appellant had benefited was established beyond doubt as the judge said by his own admissions adduced in evidence at trial. He had the opportunity then and again during the confiscation procedure to explain or dispel such admissions, but chose not even to give evidence during the latter procedure. There was in these circumstances no breach of article 6(2.)</p>
<p class="qt">(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;I see no basis for complaint about the fairness of the present confiscation order procedure in terms of article 6(1). The fact that the assumptions were not made makes any such complaint even weaker here than it was in <i>Phillips </i>and <i>Grayson and Barnham</i>.”</p>
<p class="para">135.&nbsp;&nbsp;None of the Strasbourg authority to which the House has been referred on article 6(2) involves a Grand Chamber decision and it may be that one day the Grand Chamber will have a look at its application in the context of confiscation orders. But I certainly do not think that such a re-examination would be likely to lead, still less that the House can or should now anticipate that it would lead, to any revision of the basic principles established by <i>Benjafield</i>, <i>Phillips</i>, <i>van Offeren</i> and <i>Grayson and Barnham</i>. The not entirely easy authority of <i>Geerings </i>fails to persuade that the House should, in pursuance of its duty to “take account” of the Strasbourg case-law, conclude that clear domestic legislation requires any qualification or reformulation in the way for which Mr Owen contends. Mr Owen’s submission is that the House should, in the light of the Convention rights as incorporated and to some complicated and undefined extent, “read down” the clear scheme of the 1994 Act to render illegitimate what occurred, or alternatively declare the scheme incompatible with such rights in so far as it permitted the making of the present confiscation order. But, in my judgment, there is nothing inconsistent with the Convention rights in the scheme of the 1994 Act and I would decline both invitations. For these reasons I would dismiss this appeal.</p>

<p class="lawlord">LORD NEUBERGER OF ABBOTSBURY</p>
<p class="mylords">My Lords,</p>
<p class="para">136.&nbsp;&nbsp; This appeal raises two questions in connection with the interpretation of Part I of the Drug Trafficking Act 1994. First, its meaning and consequent effect disregarding section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998; secondly, the impact of article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights on that meaning and effect.</p>
<i><p class="para">The background</p></i>
<p class="para">137.&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of the 1994 Act and the history of these proceedings are fully set out in the opinion of my noble and learned friend, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, which I have had the privilege of reading in draft. I gratefully adopt what he says in that connection. It is nonetheless appropriate to summarise the effect of section 2 of the 1994 Act, as it is so central to this appeal.</p>
<p class="para">138.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, by section 2(1), when a defendant falls to be sentenced for a “drug trafficking offence", then, if (a) the prosecution asks or (b) even if the prosecution does not ask, the court considers it appropriate, the court must follow the procedure under that section. Secondly, by section 2(2), if the court proceeds under section 2, it must determine whether the defendant has “benefited” from “drug trafficking". Section 2(3) provides that a person has so benefited if “at any time” he has received “any payment or other reward” in connection with drug trafficking. Thirdly, if the defendant has so benefited, section 2(4) requires the court to “determine in accordance with section 5 …. the amount to be recovered …". Section 5(1) provides that that amount is to be “the value of the defendant’s proceeds of drug trafficking", as assessed by the court, albeit that, by section 5(3), this is to be adjusted if the defendant’s realisable assets are less than that that amount. Fourthly, by section 2(5)(a), the defendant is to be required to pay “that amount” “in respect of the offence or offences” for which he is to be sentenced. Fifthly, by section 2(8), the civil burden of proof is to be applied to the questions to be determined under the section.</p>
<p class="para">139.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also appropriate to refer to sections 3 and 4 of the 1994 Act. Section 3(1) provides that where the court needs further information, it may postpone the determination of whether the defendant has benefited from drug trafficking or the amount to be recovered “for the purpose of enabling the information to be obtained". Section 4(1) states that “any payments or other rewards received by a person at any time” in connection with drug trafficking are “his proceeds of drug trafficking".  When determining whether a person has benefited from drug trafficking, and, if so, the value of his proceeds there from, section 4(2) requires the court to make the assumptions set out in section 4(3), subject to section 4(4). There are two principal assumptions in section 4(3). First, by paragraph (a), any property held by the defendant since his conviction or transferred to him within the period beginning six years before the institution of the proceedings are assumed to be proceeds of drug trafficking. Secondly, section 4(3)(b) provides that any expenditure by the defendant in that period is assumed to be from such proceeds. However, by section 4(4), those assumptions are not to be adopted (a) if the defendant shows them to be incorrect or (b) if making them would involve “a serious risk of injustice in the defendant’s case".</p>
<i><p class="para">The 1994 Act disregarding section 3 of the 1998 Act</p></i>
<p class="para">140.&nbsp;&nbsp;Three arguments were raised by the appellant. First, that section 4 represents the exclusive basis upon which the court must assess whether a defendant has benefited from drug trafficking, and, if so, the amount he should be ordered to pay, so that the failure in this case to invoke that “mandatory regime” invalidates the confiscation order. The appellant’s second argument was that, even if section 4 does not have to be invoked in every case in which the court makes a confiscation order, there was a failure of procedure in this case in not proceeding under section 4, which vitiated the confiscation order. The third argument was that the procedure adopted in this case was unfair, as the confiscation order was based on alleged drug trafficking which was the subject of evidence, but not of any charge, in the criminal proceedings which led to the conviction which triggered the confiscation procedure.</p>
<p class="para">141.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not accept the contention that section 4 represents an exclusive code governing the exercise to be carried out by the court under section 2. Such a contention flies in the face of the general words of subsections (2) to (5) of section 2, which make it clear that the purpose of Part I of the 1994 Act is to confiscate any sums which represent the proceeds of drug trafficking. In other words, once a defendant is convicted of a drug trafficking offence, section 2 envisages that the court should ascertain whether, and if so to what extent, he has profited from drug trafficking generally, as it were, as opposed to ascertaining merely whether he had profited from the specific offence of which he has just been convicted. This is a potentially wide-ranging enquiry, and, if section 4 was intended to be the sole statutory basis upon which the payment under section 2(5)(a) was to be assessed, much of sections 2 and 5 would be otiose. In contrast with section 5, which is an integral part of the exercise mandated by section 2 and hence its incorporation in section 2(4), section 4 merely introduces a presumption (albeit a rebuttable one) which is to be made when carrying out that exercise.</p>
<p class="para">142.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appellant’s case is also in conflict with his concession that the court can assess the extent of any benefits received by the defendant from the drug trafficking offence(s) for which he is to be sentenced. That (plainly correct) concession is logically irreconcilable with the notion that section 4 contains an exclusive formula for the purposes of subsections (2) and (4) of section 2. The appellant’s case runs into further problems with the temporal limits in section 4(3) - (a) since conviction and (b) from six years before institution of proceedings - given that  sections 2(3) and 4(1) apply to drug trafficking “at any time". Finally, it would appear little short of absurd if a defendant could escape liability under section 2(5)(a) by relying on section 4(4), which would be the consequence of section 4 representing an exclusive method of assessing a defendant’s proceeds of drug trafficking. </p>
<p class="para">143.&nbsp;&nbsp;In  my opinion, therefore, section 4 is a tool, which is presumptively to be used, but is neither mandatory nor exclusive for assessing whether, and if so to what extent, a defendant has benefited from drug trafficking. Having said that I agree with the view of my noble and learned friend Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, whose opinion I have seen in draft, that it should only be in exceptional cases that the section 4(3) assumptions are not pressed by the prosecution, at least where it is apparent that the defendant has assets. This opinion seems to be plainly consistent with the terms of sections 4(2) and 4(4) of the 1994 Act.</p>
<p class="para">144.&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the appellant’s second argument, I do not consider that a defendant can challenge a confiscation order on the ground that section 4 ought to have been relied on by the court, but was not. It seems plain that the purpose of section 4(2) and (3) is to require the court to make certain assumptions against a defendant when considering whether, and if so to what extent, he has received, or currently retains, any proceeds from drug trafficking. It would therefore seem little short of absurd if a defendant could object to a confiscation order on the ground that those assumptions were not made against him. The effect of the prosecution’s approach in this case was as if it had been determined that section 4(4) applied. If section 4(4) would have applied after evidence and argument, then the concession was rightly made. If it would not have applied, then the appellant would not have been better off, as the figures produced by making the assumptions would not have been the only permissible basis for assessing the sum to be confiscated.</p>
<p class="para">145.&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the provisions of section 4(4), I do not consider that there was any failure in the procedure adopted by the prosecution in relation to section 4. In their skeleton argument in the confiscation procedure, prosecution counsel specifically accepted Mr Briggs-Price’s submission that “the presentation of a case based on the assumptions would involve extremely difficult accountancy issues and would be lengthy and expensive". In practice, that meant that the prosecution (a) was not prepared to incur the cost and risk of meeting Mr Briggs-Price’s case that he had evidence which enabled him to rebut the assumptions, and/or (b) considered that it would be disproportionate to put Mr Briggs-Price to the expense and effort of rebutting the assumptions. In other words, the prosecution accepted that section 4(4)(a) and/or section 4(4)(b) applied.  In those circumstances, the court was, at least on the face of it, entitled not to make the assumptions required by section 4(3).</p>
<p class="para">146.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a mistake was made in that, in the light of the closing words of section 4(4), it ought to have pointed out to the Judge that he was obliged to state his reasons for not making the assumptions. I suspect that another, connected and more significant, mistake was made: even where the prosecution concedes that section 4(4) applies and the assumptions need not be made, the court should satisfy itself of the correctness of that concession, and it does not appear that the Judge investigated the concession in this case. Section 4(4) has the important effect of emphasising that it is the court, rather than the prosecution, which is to decide whether to disapply the assumptions. That is consistent with the provisions of section 2(1)(b), and, indeed, with the notion that a confiscation order is part of the sentencing process. However, for the reasons already given, these mistakes did not invalidate the confiscation order.</p>
<p class="para">147.&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn to the appellant’s third argument. As already mentioned, it is plain that a confiscation order under Part I of the 1994 Act is not to be limited to the proceeds obtained by the defendant from the drug trafficking offence(s) for which he is to be sentenced: it can, indeed it must, be based on any drug trafficking proceeds which the defendant has obtained. Accordingly, it is hard to see why, when proceeding under Part I of the 1994 Act, the court should not be able to rely on evidence given during the trial, even if it related to alleged drug trafficking activities of the defendant which were not the subject of any charge.</p>
<p class="para">148.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, that does not mean that, where such evidence has been given at trial, the Judge must take it into account in the confiscation procedure without giving the defendant any opportunity to rebut that evidence, or any inference which may be drawn from it. The court must plainly conduct the confiscation procedure in a manner which is fair to the defendant, and in many cases that may well include giving him an opportunity, or a further opportunity, to deal with evidence given at the trial which is relevant in the confiscation issue. That is no doubt one of the principal reasons for including section 3(1) and section 4(4)(b).</p>
<p class="para">149.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, there was evidence given at the trial relating to the appellant’s alleged trafficking in cannabis, although he was only charged and convicted for conspiring to import diamorphine. The Judge was entitled, indeed, I think, required, to take into account the evidence relating to the trafficking in cannabis. However, he would have been obliged to consider any application by the appellant for an opportunity to deal further with that allegation: the fact that the appellant had had a chance to deal with the allegation at trial would by no means automatically mean that he should not have a further opportunity to deal with it during the confiscation procedure. Whether to accord a defendant such an opportunity, and if so the nature of the opportunity and the terms on which it is accorded, must depend very much on the facts of the particular case.</p>
<p class="para">150.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have some sympathy with the argument, developed more fully by Lord Rodger, that it was surprising that the prosecuting authorities decided to charge the appellant only with the diamorphine conspiracy if evidence of his cannabis trafficking was intended to be given at trial, and then invoked for the purposes of any subsequent confiscation order. However, I would not want to say much about that aspect, as the detailed facts and implications of that issue were not debated before your Lordships. Indictments should not be overloaded, and it would be more than unfortunate if any criticism of the course taken in this case led to the prosecuting authorities feeling obliged to charge a defendant with every conceivable drug-trafficking offence they might be relying on in any contingent confiscation proceedings. Such a course would be inappropriate and inconsistent with the purpose of the 1994 Act. All I would say is that, without suggesting that I think that there would have been anything in the argument, it would have been open to Mr Briggs-Price to argue either that he should be charged with cannabis trafficking if it was to be relied on in any subsequent confiscation procedure, or that the cannabis trafficking should not be relied on in any such procedure. If such an argument had been raised, the Judge no doubt would have considered it on its merits.</p>
<i><p class="para">Part I of the 1994 Act and article 6 of the Convention</p></i>
<p class="para">151.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having ascertained the meaning and effect of Part I of the 1994 Act disregarding section 3 of the 1998 Act, it is necessary to consider whether its provisions, as so interpreted conflict with article 6 of the Convention, as the appellant has suggested. His argument amounts to this, that his article 6 rights were infringed by his assets being confiscated by reference to a crime of which he had not been convicted, namely trafficking in cannabis. The approach adopted by the Crown Court in this case in relation to the confiscation procedure is said by the appellant to amount to inappropriately convicting him of a fresh charge, upon which the confiscation order was based.  </p>
<p class="para">152.&nbsp;&nbsp;On this aspect of the appeal, I had prepared some observations of my own to explain why I do not accept the appellant’s case. However, having read what Lord Rodger says, I do not think there is anything I can usefully add to what he says in paras 62 to 81 of his opinion, with which I fully agree.</p>
<i><p class="para">Conclusion</p></i>
<p class="para">153.&nbsp;&nbsp;In these circumstances, I agree that this appeal should be dismissed. </p>
