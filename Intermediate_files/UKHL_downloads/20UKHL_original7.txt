<p class="para">162.&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle of the “sole actor” is more fully developed in United States case law.  In his printed case Mr Sumption referred to a number of United States authorities (not cited to the Court of Appeal) while accepting that they have to be treated with caution, both because of variations between state laws and because of the rather different basis of the public policy defence in the United States (which inclines to <i>in pari delicto potior est conditio defendentis</i> as the guiding principle).  I accept that caution is needed, but I find the general reasoning in these cases persuasive and in line with the English authorities just mentioned.</p>
<p class="para">163.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>The Mediators Inc v</i> <i>Manney</i> 105 F 3d 822 (1997), a decision of the Second Circuit of the United States Court of Appeals, applying the law of New York, the court upheld the rejection (on grounds of illegality) of a claim on behalf of a company’s unsecured creditors against bankers, lawyers and accountants said to have assisted Mr Manny, the company’s president and sole shareholder, in breach of fiduciary duties to the company.  The court stated the principle as follows  (at p 827, omitting references):</p>
<p class="qt">“Second, the adverse interest exception does not apply to cases in which the principal is a corporation and the agent is its sole shareholder.  As noted, the adverse interest exception is to a presumption that an agent has discharged the duty of disclosing material facts to the principal.  Under New York law, where the agent is defrauding the principal, such disclosure cannot be presumed because it would defeat—or have defeated—the fraud.  However, where the principal and agent are one and the same, the adverse interest exception is itself subject to an exception styled the ‘sole actor’ rule.  This rule imputes the agent’s knowledge to the principal notwithstanding the agent’s self-dealing because the party that should have been informed was the agent itself albeit in its capacity as principal.  Where, as here, a sole shareholder is alleged to have stripped the corporation of assets, the adverse interest exception to the presumption of knowledge cannot apply.”</p>
<p class="para">164.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors v R F Lafferty &amp; Co Inc</i> 267 F 3d 340 (2001) the Third Circuit of the United States Court of Appeals, applying the law of Pennsylvania, reached a similar conclusion.  Two companies, Walnut and its wholly-owned subsidiary ELCOA, were run and owned by Mr William Shapiro and other members of the Shapiro family, assisted by various professionals.  The two companies ran a fraudulent Ponzi scheme.  The court decided (at p357) that it must evaluate the <i>in pari delicto</i> defence without regard to whether the Committee was an innocent successor.  On that basis the court applied the sole actor exception (treating the Shapiro family as a single entity) and held the companies to be <i>in pari delicto</i> (at p 359, references omitted):</p>
<p class="qt">“The second part of the imputation test—whether fraudulent conduct was perpetrated for the benefit of the debtor corporation—is often analysed under the ‘adverse interest exception.’  Under this exception, fraudulent conduct will not be imputed if the officer’s interests were adverse to the corporation and ‘not for the benefit of the corporation.’</p>
<p class="qt">The Committee argues that the Shapiro family’s fraud was adverse to the interests of the Debtors, and indeed, caused damage to them through ‘deepening insolvency.’  Thus, the Committee maintains that the Shapiros did not act for the benefit of the Debtors and their fraudulent conduct cannot be imputed to those corporations.  However, even assuming that the Shapiros’ interests were adverse to the Debtors’ interests, the Committee cannot prevail because the ‘adverse interest exception’ is itself subject to an exception—the ‘sole actor’ exception.  The general principle of the ‘sole actor’ exception provides that, if an agent is the sole representative of a principal, then that agent’s fraudulent conduct is imputable to the principal regardless of whether the agent’s conduct was adverse to the principal’s interests.  The rationale for this rule is that the sole agent has no one to whom he can impart his knowledge, or from whom he can conceal it, and that the corporation must bear the responsibility for allowing an agent to act without accountability.”</p>
<p class="para">165.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a very interesting discussion of these problems in the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Canadian Dredge &amp; Dock Co Ltd v The Queen</i> (1985) 19 DLR (4th) 314.  It was the final appeal in a major criminal trial of both corporate and individual defendants for bid-rigging of tenders in the dredging industry.  Top executives had conspired together and companies which had won contracts by illegal means divided their ill-gotten gains, some of which ended up in the hands of individual executives.  The whole judgment (given by Estey J) deserves study.  Its general conclusion (at the end of the headnote on p316) is this:</p>
<p class="qt">“The corporation could not be said to have been defrauded in any relevant sense when the only thing of which it was deprived was part or indeed all of the product of the crime with which it was charged.  It was no defence that some of the illegal compensation was diverted to the individuals.”</p>
<p class="para">166.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rimer LJ did not accept Mr Sumption’s submissions on this point (and did not, as I have noted, have the United States and Canadian authorities cited to him).  He did so primarily in reliance on the statement in <i>Attorney General’s Reference (No 2 of 1982)</i> that the principle in <i>Belmont</i> can apply even though it was true of the two controlling directors (p 642) “that their acts are necessarily the company’s acts; that their will, knowledge and belief are those of the company, and that their consent necessarily implies consent by the company.”  But the Court of Appeal rejected that reasoning, as I see it, only because it could not be reconciled with the words “the other” in section 2(1)(b) of the Theft Act 1968.  The Court of Appeal felt itself compelled by the wording of the statute to look for a <i>separate </i>will as it had in <i>R v McDonnell</i>, the case about conspiracy.  </p>
<p class="para">167.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no special statutory context of that sort here.  On this point I respectfully disagree with Rimer LJ and the other members of the Court of Appeal.  In the case of a one-man company (in the sense indicated above) which has deliberately engaged in serious fraud, I would follow <i>Royal Brunei</i> (and the strong line of United States and Canadian authority) in imputing awareness of the fraud to the company, applying what is referred to in the United States as the “sole actor” exception to the “adverse interest” principle.</p>
<p class="para">168.&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular I would apply the “sole actor” principle to a claim made against its former auditors by a company in liquidation, where the company was a one-man company engaged in fraud, and the auditors are accused of negligence in failing to call a halt to that fraud.  Here I return to Mr Brindle’s point (para 132 above) about the need to decide any question of attribution by reference to its context.  Looking at the context, I cannot accept his submission that a claim against auditors is a context in which S &amp; R should not be treated as primarily (or directly) liable for its fraud against KB, and so disabled by the <i>ex turpi causa</i> principle.  Mr Sumption conceded, in line with the pleadings, that the auditors did owe a duty of care to S &amp; R, although Mummery LJ (with whom, as with Rimer LJ, Keene LJ agreed) considered (para 115) that </p>
<p class="qt">“the firm did not owe a duty of care to the company, which was a fraudster in the total grip of another fraudster.”</p>
<p class="para">On the assumption that the auditors did owe a duty of care to S &amp; R, it was a duty owed to that company as a whole, not to individual shareholders, or potential shareholders, or current or prospective creditors, as this House decided in <i>Caparo Industries plc v Dickman</i> [1990]  2 AC 605.  If the only human embodiment of the company already knew all about its fraudulent activities, there was realistically no protection that its auditors could give it.  In <i>Caparo</i> this House approved the decision of Millett J in <i>Al Saudi Banque v Clarke Pixley </i> [1990] Ch 313, the facts of which were comparable to those of the present case.</p>
<p class="hditl">Discussion of secondary victims</p>
<p class="para">169.&nbsp;&nbsp;In para 73 of his judgment Rimer LJ set out his conclusions on what he called the <i>Hampshire Land</i> issue:</p>
<p class="qt">“In these circumstances I am of the opinion that this is not a case in which the <i>Hampshire Land</i> principle has any application.  The essence of the case is that it is one in which the sole directing mind and will of the company procured it to enter into fraudulent transactions with banks.  It was the company that dealt with the banks and, so it seems to me, clear that, as between the company and the banks, the principles of attribution require the dishonesty of the company’s sole human agent to be imputed to the company.  Mr Sumption’s submissions satisfied me that this is a case in which such an imputation should be made and that the company should therefore <i>itself</i> be liable for the frauds.  Whilst, as I have said, Mr Brindle did not accept that this is the correct analysis, he did not argue against it and he was prepared to accept it for the purposes of the present debate.  It is not therefore a case in which the company was the target, or the victim, of its agent’s dishonesty.  It was itself the fraudster, and it was not the target of the fraud, and in my view it can make no difference that its frauds were likely, when and if found out, to result in the incurring of liabilities by the company itself.”</p>
<p class="para">170.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have mentioned (para 147 above), at the beginning of this passage Rimer LJ seems to be showing some sympathy for the one-man company approach which he had earlier rejected.  In the latter part of the passage he draws a clear distinction between a company as victim and a company as villain.  Where a company has carried out large-scale frauds it is likely to end up in insolvent liquidation, and facing claims from those whom it has defrauded.  It can therefore be regarded as a sort of secondary victim.  But in the last sentence of the passage quoted Rimer LJ (without using that term) discounts the “secondary victim” theory as not material to the rules of attribution which he has been considering. </p>
<p class="para">171.&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression “secondary victim” seems to have originated (at any rate in this context) in <i>Brink’s-Mat</i>.  That case was concerned with large-scale, flagrant, organised crime.  From beginning to end legal title in the stolen bullion was shared between Brink’s-Mat as bailee and Johnson Matthey as owner.  But if it is necessary to construct a sort of parallel universe in which the conspirators’ activities are supposed to have been lawful, I can see no reason to suppose that Scadlynn would have been the owner of the bullion.  The bullion would surely have belonged to the conspirators as a sort of partnership.  Scadlynn (with a small capital and only two of the conspirators as shareholders) would have been a bailee for reward, entrusted with the task of recasting the bullion and selling it as an agent.  The directors of Scadlynn would have expected remuneration for their services.  In short I can see no basis for the assumption by Mustill LJ that Scadlynn was “the victim of wrongful arrangements to deprive it improperly of a large part of its assets.”  I do not think that the decision can be given much weight; as my noble and learned friend Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers observes in para 5 of his opinion, “if a person starts with nothing and never legitimately acquires anything he cannot realistically be said to have suffered any loss.” </p>
<p class="para">172.&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar point may arise in the present case, since it is pleaded that money fraudulently obtained by S &amp; R became the subject of “numerous fraudulent and/or irregular payments out by S &amp; R to entities controlled by Mr Stojevic and his associates.”  Any contractual arrangements between S &amp; R and BCL (or similar companies) for division of the fruits of their fraud would of course have been void for illegality.  To describe such arrangements as fraudulent and/or irregular does not to my mind turn S &amp; R into a victim in any ordinary sense.  Mr Sumption’s submissions on this point, which I am inclined to accept, are recorded in para 49 of Rimer LJ’s judgment.</p>
<p class="para">173.&nbsp;&nbsp;However it is unnecessary to speculate further about the commercial terms on which gangs of robbers or fraudsters might be expected to organize their criminal activities.  There is in my opinion a clearer and firmer basis on which to determine what (if any) significance to give to the notion of a company being the secondary victim of the fraud (aimed at a third party) of one or more of its directors.  It is necessary to keep well in mind why the law makes an exception (the adverse interest rule) for a company which is a primary victim (like the <i>Belmont </i>company, which was manipulated into buying Maximum at a gross overvaluation).  The company is not fixed with its directors’ fraudulent intentions because that would be unjust to its innocent participators (honest directors who were deceived, and shareholders who were cheated); the guilty are presumed not to pass on their guilty knowledge to the innocent.  But if the company is itself primarily (or directly) liable because of the “sole actor” rule, there is <i>ex hypothesi</i> no innocent participator, and no one who does not already share (or must by his reckless indifference be taken as sharing) the guilty knowledge.  That is consistent with the analysis by Rix J in <i>Arab Bank</i>.  In that case Mr Browne was not the directing mind of JDW, which was not a one-man company; Rix J accepted that the position might have been different if it had been.</p>
<p class="para">174.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore limit my ground of decision in this appeal to the proposition that one or more individuals who for fraudulent purposes run a one-man company (in the sense described above) cannot obtain an advantage by claiming that the company is not a fraudster, but a secondary victim.  <i>McNicholas </i>and <i>Bank of India </i>may be best analysed as depending on a special rule of attribution required by the scheme of the legislation relating to VAT or fraudulent trading (as the case may be).  It is not necessary to the disposal of this appeal, or prudent, to address every situation that may be described as involving a secondary victim.</p>
<p class="hditl">Three cases relied on by S &amp; R</p>
<p class="para">175.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Brindle argued that if an <i>ex turpi causa</i> defence is available in this case, it must have been overlooked in other well-known cases conducted by skilled and experienced counsel and solicitors.  In particular, he referred to three pieces of litigation which he had cited to the Court of Appeal, but which had not been mentioned in the judgment of Rimer LJ: <i>Barings, BCCI</i> and <i>Sasea</i>.  The actual decisions cited to the Court of Appeal are listed as <i>Bank of Credit and Commerce International (Overseas) Ltd v Price Waterhouse</i> 24 March 1998, Laddie J, <i>Barings plc v Coopers &amp; Lybrand</i> [2003]  1 Lloyd’s Rep IR 566 and <i>Sasea Finance Ltd (in liquidation) v KPMG</i> [2000]  1 All ER 676,  but there were some other strands in the litigation about <i>Barings</i>, and many other strands in the <i>BCCI</i> litigation (Mr Brindle’s printed case refers in particular to the judgment of Lightman J in <i>Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA (in liquidation) v Ali (No 2)</i>[2000] ICR 1354, [1999]  4 All ER 83 and to <i>Bank of Credit and Commerce International (Overseas) Ltd v Price Waterhouse</i> [1998] BCC 617, the judgment of the Court of Appeal reversing Laddie J).</p>
<p class="para">176.&nbsp;&nbsp;In an earlier draft I commented on these cases at some length.  I have omitted that passage because it is not necessary, I think, or helpful, to try to reach any firm conclusion about these other litigious struggles.  Mr Brindle is right to say that S &amp; R’s public policy defence is novel (at least in England).  Mr Sumption’s comments on <i>Barings, BCCI</i> and <i>Sasea</i> do suggest that there may have been good reasons why skilled and experienced counsel and solicitors did not attempt to deploy the public policy defence in those cases.  But however novel the issues in this appeal, they must be decided on their merits, and not by reference to other cases in which (for whatever reason) they were not raised.</p>
<p class="hditl">The ‘very thing’ issue</p>
<p class="para">177.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the context of ‘the very thing that the defendant was under a duty to take care to prevent’ the phrase the ‘very thing’ may first have been used over sixty years ago by the unnamed County Court judge whose judgment was upheld by the Court of Appeal in <i>Stansbie v Troman</i> [1948] 2 KB 48.  That was the case of the decorator who left the door of his client’s house unlocked when he went out to buy more wallpaper, with the result that some of the client’s jewellery was stolen by an opportunistic thief.  What the County Court judge actually said (see at p 51) was that the decorator failed to take reasonable care “to guard against the very thing that happened” and the decorator’s counsel argued (unsuccessfully) that his job was to decorate his client’s house, and not to look after its security.  But the phrase has come to be used as a convenient label for the principle that if there is a duty (in contract or tort) to prevent harm caused by a third party, the person under that duty may be liable for the loss, and cannot excuse himself by saying that it was caused by the third party (though the third party will normally be concurrently liable).  <i>Reeves v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis</i> [1999] QB 169, [2000] 1 AC 360 and <i>Corr v IBC Vehicles Ltd</i> [2008] AC 884 (both concerned with suicide, though in a context of different duties of care) are extreme illustrations of this principle, where the (self-) harm was caused not by a third party but by the person to whom the duty was owed.</p>
<p class="para">178.&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle is therefore a principle of causation.  Mr Brindle accepts that, but submits that it is also a wider principle (he calls it a principle of logic) capable of excluding the public policy defence in a case where fraud on the part of a company is the very thing that it is the auditors’ duty to detect (and so prevent for the future).  He submits that a point made by Lord Hoffmann in <i>Reeves</i> (at p 372) applies to all defences, and not just causation defences:</p>
<p class="qt">“[W]hatever views one may have about suicide in general, a 100 per cent apportionment of liability to Mr Lynch gives no weight at all to the policy of the law in imposing a duty of care upon the police.  It is another different way of saying that the police should not have owed Mr Lynch a duty of care.”</p>
<p class="para">In <i>Reeves</i> illegality was run as a defence in the Court of Appeal, but not in this House.  On the other hand <i>volenti non fit injuria</i> was run in this House, and was rejected.  Mr Brindle submits (on the strength of <i>Smith v Baker &amp; Sons</i> [1891] AC 325, 360) that that is not a principle of causation.  The <i>volenti</i> principle is far from precise and it may sometimes operate not as a principle of causation, but to negative any duty (or any breach).  But in this context it operates as an element in causation.  As Lord Hoffmann said in <i>Reeves</i> [2000] 1 AC 360, 367: </p>
<p class="qt">“In the present case, volenti non fit injuria can only mean that Mr Lynch voluntarily caused his own death to the exclusion of any causal effect on the part of what was done by the police.  So I think it all comes to the same thing: was the breach of duty by the police a cause of the death?” </p>
<p class="para">179.&nbsp;&nbsp;Checking for fraud is part of an auditor’s task, but it is not his sole or primary task (for a reputable auditor to discover that the client company’s business is wholly fraudulent and criminal must be quite unusual).  But suppose for the sake of argument that a trader engages an accountant for the primary and express purpose of preparing financial statements that comply with all the requirements of company law and tax law, so that the lawfulness of the financial statements is the very thing that the accountant undertakes to do; and suppose that the accountant negligently fails to perform this task, and the trader is in consequence liable to some penalty or criminal sanction.  Could the accountant meet a claim for professional negligence by pleading the <i>ex turpi</i> <i>causa</i> defence?  It is obviously impossible to answer that question without knowing more about the facts.  If the trader had honestly supplied information which he believed to be correct and complete, and the accountant had negligently failed to notice that the information could not be correct and complete, it seems unlikely that such a regulatory breach, not involving dishonesty, would bring the <i>ex turpi causa</i> principle into play.</p>
<p class="para">180.&nbsp;&nbsp;That seems to have been the principle of the decision of the Court of Appeal of Singapore in <i>United Project Consultants Pte Ltd v Leong Kwok Onn</i> [2005]  SLR 214 (paras 55 to 57), where the claimant trading company had been fined for incorrect tax returns prepared by the defendant.  The court went on (paras 58 to 62) to express the view that the “very thing” principle would have excluded the <i>ex turpi causa </i> defence even if the facts had been serious enough to be capable of attracting it (para 60):</p>
<p class="qt">“The respondent, however, alleged that the commission by the appellant of a statutory offence constituted an illegal act that disentitled the latter from pursuing its claim in tort.  This argument placed the proverbial cart before the horse.  On a proper appreciation of the facts, the appellant’s running afoul of the Act could be attributed solely to the fact that the respondent had failed in his duty to warn.  To allow the respondent to rely upon a consequence that was directly caused by his own failings and to absolve him from liability, would be to reward the wrongdoer and punish the innocent party.”</p>
<p class="para">In my opinion that shows confusion of thought, since if the trader had been convicted of the more serious offence under section 96 of the Singapore Income Tax Act it would have been guilty of deliberate and dishonest tax evasion and could not have been described as an innocent party.</p>
<p class="para">181.&nbsp;&nbsp;In that situation the law would not permit the trader to claim against the accountant, not because there was no fault on the part of the accountant, but because public policy requires the dishonest trader to be denied a remedy.  It is not a matter of rewarding a wrongdoer. To repeat the words of Lord Mansfield CJ in <i>Holman v Johnson</i> (1775) 1 Cowp. 341, 343 “It is upon that ground the court goes; not for the sake of the defendant, but because they will not lend their aid to such a plaintiff.”</p>
<p class="para">182.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>United Project Consultants</i> the Singapore Court of Appeal referred to the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Reeves</i> [1999] QB 169 as supporting their view on the “very thing” point.  But as I read that case only Buxton LJ (at para 185) relied on that point as one of his reasons for rejecting <i>ex turpi causa.</i>  Lord Bingham of Cornhill CJ and Morritt LJ relied on the simple ground that suicide is no longer a crime.  As already note, illegality was not an issue when <i>Reeves</i> came on further appeal to this House.</p>
<p class="para">183.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rimer LJ considered this point at length (paras 75 to 105) and rejected it (paras 106 to 110).  In my opinion he was right to do so.  His reasoning was, I think, essentially the same as mine.  The essential point is that a principle of causation cannot, as Rimer LJ put it, trump <i>ex turpi causa</i> where the latter principle applies, however short of merits the defendant may be. </p>
<p class="hditl">The effect of liquidation</p>
<p class="para">184.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was argued for the appellants that the public policy defence should not bar claims brought by a company in insolvent liquidation, where the creditors were innocent parties who had been defrauded by Mr Stojevic.  If that were right, it would create a very large gap in the public policy defence, since most fraudsters (individual and corporate) become insolvent sooner or later and have liabilities to those whom they have defrauded.  Mr Brindle conceded that if Mr Stojevic had carried out his frauds directly (and not through a one-man company) neither he nor his trustee in bankruptcy could have resisted the public policy defence.  That conclusion was reached by Langley J. (para 65(2)) and is clearly correct (see Fry LJ in <i>Cleaver v Mutual Reserve Fund Life Association</i> [1892] 1 QB 147, 156).  There is no good reason to apply a different rule to a company in liquidation.  Apart from special statutory claims in respect of misfeasance, wrong trading and so on, it cannot assert any cause of action which it could not have asserted before the commencement of its liquidation, as Mr Brindle concedes.  That is especially true in the context of the duties of an auditor, which are not owed to a company’s creditors.</p>
<p class="hditl">Contributory negligence</p>
<p class="para">185.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Brindle put in the forefront of his case the general submission that <i>ex turpi causa</i> is a blunt instrument, and that a more satisfactory tool for doing justice would be the doctrine of contributory negligence.  The <i>ex turpi causa</i> principle is indeed a blunt instrument.  Rimer LJ referred to it, quoting Langley J at first instance, as “unforgiving and uncompromising.”  That is its nature.  But I am far from convinced that (if the public policy defence were not available) contributory negligence would provide a more sensitive or effective tool, any more than it does in the suicide cases: see <i>Reeves</i>, especially Lord Hoffmann at pp 371-372. A company’s fraud and its auditors’ negligence are incommensurable in terms of blameworthiness and causal potency, just as lethal self-harm and negligent custody are incommensurable in those terms.</p>
