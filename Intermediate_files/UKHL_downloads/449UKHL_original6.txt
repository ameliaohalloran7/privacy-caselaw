<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;136. Each side preferred the extreme form of its argument and in so doing had received support from one or other of the courts below.  Thus, they variously argued as to the meaning of <i>bodily injury</i> (using the term "flight" as including embarkation and disembarkation and including the carriers' causation arguments) -</p>
(1) Only a palpable physical injury inflicted during the flight by some physical impact upon the passenger would suffice, <i>eg</i> a crash injuring the passenger, a bag falling on the head of the passenger; <i>the impact test</i>; 
(2) The physical infliction of some such physical injury during the flight and palpably in existence at the conclusion of the flight whether or not any actual impact was involved, <i>eg</i> anoxia and immediate brain damage caused by the failure of the pressurisation system or carbon monoxide poisoning; <i>in-flight injury without impact;</i> 
(3) Any palpable injury physically caused during the flight, <i>ie</i>, an injury caused by some direct physical cause, not being an injury caused through the senses like a fatal or non-fatal heart attack or stroke caused by observing a highjacking or experiencing a sudden loss of altitude; the physical <i>causation</i> test; 
(4) A physical injury which does not have any mental aspect or mental manifestations: not a 'mental injury' (the Court of Appeal view);  
(5) The physical infliction of physical injury during the flight even though not already manifested at the conclusion of the flight, for example, (a) a heart attack suffered after having disembarked, (b) a disease or illness contracted upon the plane say through the contamination of the plane's air supply or on-flight food; <i>the delayed effect injury</i>;<i> </i>
(6) An injury, even if it was caused through the senses, which has physical consequences or physical manifestations, even if they are not already manifest at the conclusion of the flight. 
(7) Any injury which could properly be described as a personal injury; 
(8) Any emotional upset or reaction - distress, fright, mental anguish, anxiety, grief, <i>etc</i>. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;137. The majority of the First Division preferred argument (7) largely basing themselves on an examination of the various texts and how the Article had been viewed, especially by a German jurist who had attended the Warsaw conference and some of the later conferences.  They considered the history of the Convention and concluded that Article 17 should be given a wide and generous meaning: there is little difference between this and argument (8) as the Israeli case, <i>Daddon v Air France</i> (<i>inf</i>), demonstrates.  The dissenting opinion of Lord Reed comes closest to argument (6).  The Court of Appeal adopted argument (4), having broadly the same result as argument (2), viewing the phrase <i>bodily injury</i> as pointing a contrast with what they described as "mental injury".  This argument was developed by the carriers before your Lordships as an argument that, in 1929, those attending the conference at Warsaw would have contemplated only a crude mind-body dualism and the words used implicitly demonstrate an actual intention to exclude anything which would in popular diction be referred to as of the mind.  By contrast argument (6) can be developed by reference to basic medical knowledge of the brain and the way it works as an integral part of the whole body so as to show why psychiatric illnesses may come within the term <i>bodily injury</i> and therefore, provided the other conditions are satisfied, should be understood as falling within Article 17.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;138. The diversity of the judicial statements within the United Kingdom and to some extent elsewhere, all expressed in relation to the same two simple English words <i>bodily injury</i> as used in Article 17, disclose a legal confusion and even, it may be thought, a failure of method.  The range of the arguments advanced lead to a similar conclusion.  My Lords, I believe that it is possible to identify the explanations for this.  I will attempt to classify them under 3 headings: first, the adoption of a subjective approach to the construction of the words and the misuse of national law concepts and rules; second, the assumptions made by the lawyers as to medical science and the change of environment between 1929 and the present day and its relevance; third, the misuse of language and the errors which result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;139. But I will start by stating briefly what I consider to be the correct reading of these words and how it is supported not contradicted by the United States authorities.</p>
<i></i><p><i>Brief Overview</i>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;140. The composite expression <i>bodily injury</i> involves a combination of two elements.  The word <i>injury</i> in the context of personal injury involves a condition which departs from the normal, which is not a mere transitory discomfort or inconvenience and which, whilst not permanent or incurable, has, in conjunction with its degree of seriousness, a sufficient duration.  It includes a loss of function.  A person who is concussed or who is in clinical shock or who is made deaf or blind is properly described as injured.  (As to deafness, see, for example, <i>Air France v Saks</i> 470 US 392.)  A condition which requires treatment to enable the person to return to the normal is typical of an injury though not essential; many injuries heal over time without intervention.  Contracting an illness may amount to an injury depending upon the degree to which the illness departs from the normal.  One would not normally describe a person who caught a cold as having suffered an injury but, on the other hand, one would certainly describe someone who contracted a serious disease or condition, say, 'aids' or hepatitis, as the result of the deliberate or negligent act of another as having suffered an injury.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;141. The word <i>bodily</i> is simpler.  It means pertaining to the body.  There must be an injury to the body.  It is, as it must be, accepted that the brain, the central nervous system and the glands which secrete the hormones which enable the brain and the rest of the central nervous system to operate are all integral parts of the body just as much as are the toes, heart, stomach and liver.  They are all susceptible to injury.  The mechanisms by which they can be injured vary.  An ingested poison might injure the stomach or liver.  A lack of oxygen will injure the brain by causing the death of brain cells.  An injury to the heart may be caused by a blow or by a traumatic experience or by over-exertion.  In every case there is a cause, external to the organ in question, which produces a change in the structure or ability to function of the organ.  If the change, either alone or in conjunction with changes in other organs, is properly described as an injury, it is a <i>bodily</i> injury.  Since the body is a complex organism depending for its functioning and survival upon the interaction of a large number of parts, the injury may be subtle and a matter of inference not direct observation.  The medical science of diagnosis exists to enable the appropriate inferences to be drawn from the observed evidence.  Medicinal treatments (as with drugs) are prescribed on the basis that there is a physical condition which can be reversed or alleviated by physical means.</p>
<i>
</i><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;142. Bodily injury</i> does not import visibility nor palpability nor externality.  Its use in Article 17 in addition to the use of the words "death" and "wounding" ("blessure") and the inclusion of the word "any" confirm this.  Take an incident which ruptures a spleen or causes some other internal injury.  The doctor infers that the injury has been caused from other signs and symptoms and ultimately confirms it by an invasive (surgery) or non-invasive (ultrascan or x-ray) procedure.  An incident may damage someone's optic nerve in a location or manner which cannot be observed; the person may as a result have no sight in that eye; this will be a <i>bodily injury</i> even though there is no thing palpable, conspicuous or visible.  The use of the word "palpable" in the discussion of the meaning of Article 17 typifies the dangers of the use of loose terminology which does not aid clarity but, rather, creates ambiguity.  "Palpable" is a term which has a precise meaning - capable of being felt by touch - which is its medical meaning.  But it also has a metaphorical usage - readily perceived by the senses or the mind.  It will be readily understood that the precise meaning is too restrictive and cannot be justified as a gloss upon the simple phrase <i>bodily injury</i>.  The metaphorical usage likewise cannot be justified and is impractical and unprincipled.  Is the judge or arbitrator to say: "Having heard the evidence I am satisfied that the passenger suffered an injury but I cannot say that I readily perceived it"?  The obvious attraction of using words such as "palpable" is that they give an illusion of clarity when in truth they enable the user to avoid clarity and simply serve to detract from the clarity of the primary terminology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;143. Thus, <i>bodily injury</i> simply and unambiguously means a change in some part or parts of the body of the passenger which is sufficiently serious to be described as an injury.  It does not include mere emotional upset such as fear, distress, grief or mental anguish (<i>cf</i> argument 8).  A psychiatric illness may often be evidence of a <i>bodily injury</i> or the description of a condition which includes <i>bodily injury</i>.  But the passenger must be prepared to prove this, not just prove a psychiatric illness without evidence of its significance for the existence of a <i>bodily injury</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;144. Turning to the United States authority, the leading and subsequently influential case which first brought the relevant points to the fore was <i>Rosman and Herman v TWA</i> 34 NY 2d 385 decided in the Court of Appeals in New York in 1974 with the leading judgment given by Judge Rabin.  The plaintiff passengers sought to recover damages from the carrier for "psychic" (<i>sic</i>) trauma suffered on board a hijacked aircraft.  None of the passengers had been shot or struck or personally assaulted but they said that they had feared, as was natural in the circumstances, that their lives were in grave danger.  They complained of being subjected to emotional stress (and physical deprivation in being kept without adequate food and water in excessively hot and arid conditions).  The court rejected the claim for emotional stress but held that it would allow damages for any "palpable, objective bodily injuries, including those caused by the psychic trauma of the hijacking, and for the damages flowing from those bodily injuries, but not for the trauma as such or for the nonbodily or behavioral manifestations of that trauma". (p.400)  They explained their reasoning in a passage (at pp. 399-400) which it is worth quoting in full:</p>
<p></p><ul>"A faithful reading of the terms of the Convention leads, we believe, to the following conclusions.  A claim for damages under article 17 arises 'in the event of  ... bodily injury'.  The claim must therefore be predicated upon some objective identifiable injury to the body.  In addition, there must be some causal connection between the bodily injury and the 'accident'.  In our view, this connection can be established whether the bodily injury was caused by physical impact, by the physical circumstances of the confinement or by psychic trauma.  If the accident - the hijacking - caused severe fright, which in turn manifested itself in some objective 'bodily injury', then we would conclude that the Convention's requirement of the causal connection is satisfied.  For example, if plaintiff Herman's skin rash was caused or aggravated by the fright she experienced on board the aircraft, then she should be compensated for the rash and the damages flowing from the rash.  It follows that, if proved at trial, she should be compensated for her mental anguish, <i>suffered as a result</i> of the rash, since this anguish would have flowed from the 'bodily injury'."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" … only the damages flowing from the 'bodily injury', whatever the causal link, are compensable.  We are drawn to these conclusions by the clear import of article 17.  Those terms, in their ordinary meaning, will not support plaintiffs' claim that psychic trauma alone, or even the psychic trauma which caused the bodily injury, is compensable under the Warsaw Convention." (p.400) </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;145. I have underlined certain phrases in this quotation in order to illustrate certain of the points being made.  Emotional distress is not compensable as such; it is <i>bodily injury</i> which is compensable.  Therefore the passenger must prove that he has suffered a bodily injury.  That is what Article 17 says.  That is what Judge Rabin is saying when he says there must be some "objective identifiable injury"; the passenger must prove the bodily injury.  (He later refers to the need for proof at the trial.)  Thus, if an injury to the brain can be proved, we can substitute for the phrase 'skin rash' the words 'brain damage'.  He is holding that proved brain damage and its sequelae would be compensable.  Given causation, it comes down to a question of proof.  Judge Rabin rejects the <i>causation </i>and<i> impact </i>tests.  'Psychic' trauma experienced through the senses can be the route by which the <i>bodily injury</i> can be caused by the 'accident'.  The course upon which Judge Rabin is setting the United States courts is one which is fully consistent with the reading of article 17 which I have adopted in paragraph 143 above.  I will return to the American authorities (including <i>Rosman</i>) later in this opinion.</p>
<i><p>The Convention: Construction:</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;146. The historical context in which the Warsaw Convention of 1929 is set was not only the emergent business of commercial international carriage by air of passengers and goods but also the framework of existing international conventions and agreements covering carriage by sea which was at the time and was, for the following decades, to continue to be the dominant means of international transport.  The Warsaw Convention substantially incorporated the same scheme and the same main features as those earlier conventions.  Thus there is a recognition of the basic contractual relationship pursuant to which the transport is being performed and the requirement of the compulsory application of the internationally agreed terms to the contracts of carriage and the compulsory inclusion of statements to that effect into the contractual documentation.  The substantive provisions provide a division of risk between the carrier on the one hand and the goods or baggage owner or passenger on the other.  In relation to carriage by sea, the salient features of this division of risk are provisions which impose evidential burdens on the carrier, give him limited exceptions which he can rely on and which give him either an absolute or qualified right to limit his liability.  In the Warsaw Convention effectively the same scheme is followed for the carriage of passengers, their baggage and commercial cargo.  In each case an agreed code divides the risk between the carrier and his customer.  It provides uniformity and certainty; conflicts of laws problems are avoided as far as possible; the incidents of where any accident or litigation may occur are sought to be removed as far as possible; the negotiation and acceptance of the 'five freedoms' of international air transport were facilitated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;147. It follows from this that considerations of national or local law should not be allowed to intrude upon, let alone govern, any question of construction that may arise on the provisions for division of risk.  As Lord Hope of Craighead said in <i>Sidhu v British Airways Plc</i> [1997]  AC 430 at 453, "The code is intended to be uniform and to be exclusive also of any resort to the rules of domestic law."  It is not right to attempt to construe the words of the Convention by reference to the rules of any domestic law, English, American, German or even French.  We know that those rules were and are not all identical.  The purpose of uniformity means that it is the duty of the national court to put to one side its views about its own law and other countries' laws.  Quite apart from defeating uniformity, such a course can only lead to the complication of simple issues, the inadequately informed investigation of other legal systems and, most importantly, to uncertainty.  In few areas can this be more deleterious than in relation to the historical treatment by various legal systems, including our own, of the topic of so called 'nervous shock'.  Nor can it be acceptable, as was urged upon your Lordships by the carriers, to seek to find the 'lowest common denominator' of the delegates' national laws in 1929 and adopt that.  Whilst it is important to have regard to the international consensus upon the understanding of the provisions of international conventions and hence to what the courts in other jurisdictions have had to say about the provision in question, the relevant point for decision always remains: what do the actual words used mean?  (<i>Stag Line Ltd v Foscolo, Mango &amp; Co Ltd</i> [1932]  AC 328, the Hague Rules; <i>James Buchanan &amp; Co Ltd v Babco Forwarding &amp; Shipping (UK) Ltd</i> [1978]  AC 141, CMR, <i>Fothergill v Monarch Airlines Ltd</i> [1981]  AC 251, Amended Warsaw; <i>Sidhu v BA, sup, </i>Warsaw.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;148. Further things follow.  First, the words used should receive an objective interpretation.  It is equally mistaken to try and find out what the individual delegates thought they were agreeing to as it is to investigate the various domestic laws of the signatory countries.  The investigation is equally liable to be based on incomplete or imperfect evidence.  It may well be that different delegates may have had different beliefs.  The views of one delegate, however distinguished, articulate and well-published, may not represent the views of others.  The examination must be an objective one.  The disciplined liberty to make use of travaux préparatoires regulates this.  It is common ground that in the present case, to quote Lord Reed at 2001 SLT 126, 167, para 56,</p>
<p></p><ul>"The travaux préparatoires do not support any theory that the signatories to the Warsaw Convention had a specific intention either to include or to exclude liability for psychiatric disorders."<p></p></ul>
<p>Therefore, it is the unadorned language of the Article to which attention must be directed.  It is again a descent into unprincipled subjectivism to use, as do the Court of Appeal (§§50 and 96) and others have done before them, the absence of travaux préparatoires as a tool of construction.  Thus the Court of Appeal say:  "We consider that it is highly significant that no mention was made of liability for mental injury [<i>sic</i>] in the course of the negotiations that resulted in the Warsaw Convention."  This is reasoning which speculates about the subjective intentions of the delegates and is not directed to the objective autonomous meaning of the words used.  Likewise it is erroneous, in the absence of cogent travaux, to infer that a particular interpretation of a provision is intended from the fact that on a later occasion the Convention was amended without making any change to the provision in question.  All it shows is that on the later occasion the parties were content to leave the wording of the provision unaltered.  The motives or beliefs of the individual delegates for so doing are irrelevant.  Similarly, it is unprincipled to say as the Court of Appeal say also in paragraph 96 that it is "equally significant" that no claim was made for 'mental injury' until the 1970s.  One can only ask how can it be relevant to the question of the construction of the Convention.  In fact there are simple explanations arising from the development of mass passenger air transport, the outbreak of terrorist hijacking and probably developments in United States domestic law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;149. Secondly it is also mistaken to interpret a convention such as the Warsaw Convention, or the various amended versions of it, as if they were intended to be historical documents frozen in time.  They are intended to provide an enduring uniform code which will govern contractual and, where relevant, delictual relationships not just for a finite time but for the future as the transactions to which they apply are entered into.  The contracts into which the code is to be incorporated are to be made and will be performed at dates in the future, maybe long into the future.  Notionally to relate them back to a supposed state of affairs existing in 1929 is not only wrong but wholly impractical.  It leads to the complication and confusion to which I have already referred.  It is also destructive of uniformity since when a convention has later been amended, logic would require that one starts the clock again and asks what was in the minds of the delegates at the later conference.  It is not necessary in order to understand this point to have regard to the principles applicable to 'always speaking' constitutional documents.  The principle is more simple.  Words have a meaning which does not change but the application of those words to the decision of any question depends on the facts and circumstances of the case in which that question arises.  It is the facts and circumstances of the cases that change, not the meaning of the contractual words.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;150. Thirdly, the code involves a division of risk.  It strikes a balance.  It is wrong to construe it as a code designed to advantage one interest or the other, the carrier or the customer.  Like any code of this character, it contains familiar types of provision assisting one interest balanced against others assisting the other interest.  For the passenger, a simple criterion of causation by an 'accident' is adopted but counterbalanced by strong provisions enabling the carrier to limit his liability.  These are not like exemption clauses to be construed <i>against</i> one or other party.  The phrase <i>bodily injury</i> simply enters the picture as part of the balanced code regardless of which interest it is thought to assist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;151. I have elaborated the question of the approach to the construction of Article 17 because, in my view, all the courts below were drawn into an essentially mistaken consideration of material which was nationally based, historical, and subjective.  It has resulted in an over-complication of the relevant question.  It has necessitated a display of the most impressive scholarship and research but has led to the wrong questions being asked and the wrong answers given.</p>

<i><p>Medical Science:</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;152. It is a feature of the brain and the central nervous system that the manner in which it works has inevitably limited the knowledge and understanding of how the organ functions and its pathology.  It is an interrelated and interdependent system.  Only limited knowledge could be gained from the examination of the anatomy of a corpse.  In the living subject, the scope for intrusive investigation was very limited.  In the popular perception, this has led to the perpetuation of theories of psychic disembodiment long after they have any scientific justification.  There now exist techniques for investigating the functioning of the living brain and the central nervous system together with the roles played by neurotransmitters, hormones and electrical impulses.  Physical changes can be scanned and observed using sophisticated instruments and the alterations in the normal chemistry of the brain can now be detected by sophisticated sampling techniques.  What was previously invisible can now be made visible.  These developments have two relevant results.  It can now be shown by valid scientific techniques that certain psychiatric symptoms correspond to physical changes in the brain.  Psychiatry (the science of mental illness) has been able to develop a more reliable classification and aetiology enabling better diagnoses to be made and more reliable opinions to be given as to the probable causation of observed disorders.  What these developments have changed is not the phenomena nor the meaning of the language used in the Article but the ability to adduce evidence relevant to the factual issues raised by the Article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;153. The judgments of Lord Philip and Lord Reed in the Court of Session both show an awareness of these developments.  The judgment of the Master of the Rolls in the Court of Appeal, §§35-40, in a section headed "<i>The distinction between physical injury and mental injury</i>", from which it is necessary to quote certain passages in full since they are fundamental to the thinking of the Court of Appeal, says:</p>
<p></p><ul>"35&nbsp;&nbsp;This appeal has proceeded on the premise that there is a distinction between physical injury and mental injury; that physical injury involves damage or adverse change to the structure of the body, whereas mental illness adversely affects the well-being of the mind without organic change to the body.<p></p></ul>
36 <p></p><ul>This was undoubtedly the general belief in the 1920s, <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>when the terms of the Warsaw Convention were negotiated.  ......."<p></p></ul>
<p>Then, having quoted from two speeches in the House of Lords in two tort cases and two English textbooks on English tort law, the judgment continues -</p>
<p></p><ul>"40&nbsp;&nbsp;These passages lead to the reflection that it is possible that every mental illness may, in time, be shown to be accompanied by and consequent upon some change to the physical structure of the body, so that mental illness can properly be described as a type of physical injury.  That stage has not yet been reached, however, and this appeal must be approached on the premise that mental illness and physical injury are distinguishable and that the claimant, as she accepts, suffered no physical injury."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;154. The Master of the Rolls says, referring to the time when "mental illness can properly be described as a type of physical injury", that "that stage has not yet been reached".  This is in truth a statement about medical science.  It is contentious and needs to be made good by qualified expert evidence.  Evidence to the contrary was successfully adduced in the American case of <i>Weaver v Delta Airlines Inc</i> (1999)56 Fed Supp 2d 1190.  Before Lord Philip, in the Outer House, where there were three actions before the court, the unsuccessful argument was that the cases should proceed to proof so that the pursuers could call just such evidence: see 1999 SLT 919, 922, 925.  The argument apparently failed for want of particularity in the pleading: <i>ib</i> p.926.  The argument was not pursued on the solitary appeal by King to the First Division of the Inner House, where any reliance upon <i>Weaver v Delta Airlines</i> was disclaimed: see p.129 of the Lord President's judgment.  So far as United Kingdom judges are concerned there has long been an appreciation that given mental functions correspond to and depend upon a given physical state of the body.  In the Outer House, Lord Philip gave citations going back to the 19th century: pp.925-926 and there are others which he could have cited: for example, <i>McLoughlin v O'Brian</i> [1983]  1 AC 410 at 418 and <i>R v Burstow</i> [1998]  AC 147 .  These citations and a simple perusal of such basic but authoritative textbooks such as 'The Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry', 4th ed Oxford 2001, written by Professor Gelder and two other professors of psychiatry at Oxford University, show that there is respectable medical support for the view that, for example, a major depressive disorder is the expression of physical changes in the brain and its hormonal chemistry.  Such physical changes are capable of amounting to an <i>injury</i> and, if they do, they are on any ordinary usage of language <i>bodily</i> injuries.  The passenger needs to prove by qualified expert evidence that these changes have occurred, that they were caused by the accident and that they have led to the psychiatric condition which constitutes the damage complained of.  If he discharges this burden of proof he has satisfied the requirements of the Article and the explanation given of it in <i>Rosman</i> and <i>Weaver</i>.  For the court to shut out the passenger from his opportunity to prove his case is both wrong in law and involves assuming the role of prejudging an expert issue which it is not for the court to assume.</p>
