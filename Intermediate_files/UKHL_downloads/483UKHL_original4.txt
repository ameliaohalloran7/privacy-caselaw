<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92. These enforcement provisions included a right for a person "aggrieved" by an enforcement notice to appeal to the magistrates on various grounds, including the grounds that planning permission had been granted or that no planning permission was required.   There was a further right of appeal to quarter sessions.  In addition, a person prosecuted for failure to discontinue a use in accordance with an enforcement notice could challenge the validity of the notice before the criminal court on any ground whatever, including those upon which he could have appealed to the magistrates when it was served upon him: <i>Francis v Yiewsley and West Drayton Urban District Council </i>[1958]  1 QB 478. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93. These provisions therefore made the question of whether there had been a breach of planning control entirely a matter for judicial decision.  In addition, a person served with an enforcement notice could apply to the local planning authority for permission to retain or continue the offending structures or works, even if he had just applied and been refused.  If he was refused (or again refused) by the local planning authority, he could appeal to the minister.  An appeal against an enforcement notice (or resistance to a prosecution) proceeded in parallel with the application for planning permission, even though the quashing of the enforcement notice would make the planning application unnecessary and the grant of planning permission would invalidate the enforcement notice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94. Enforcement of planning control under the 1947 Act was therefore extremely complicated, time-consuming and expensive.  As a result, the whole system was radically recast by Part II of the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960.  The appeal to the magistrates was abolished and instead, by section 33, a person served with an enforcement notice was given a right of appeal to the Minister on a number of grounds.  These included: "(a) that permission ought to be granted…for the development to which the enforcement notice relates…(b) that permission has been granted…(c) that no permission was required…(d) that what is assumed in the enforcement notice to be development did not constitute or involve development…(e) that the enforcement notice was not served on the owner or occupier of the land within the relevant period of four years" and some other grounds.  Section 33(8) then provided that the validity of an enforcement notice "shall not be questioned in any proceedings whatsoever on any of the grounds specified in paragraphs (b), (c), (d) or (e)…except by way of an appeal under this part of this Act."  Section 34(1) gave a right of appeal from the minister's decision to the High Court, but only on a point of law.  This right of appeal is now contained in section 289 of the 1990 Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95. My Lords, I draw attention to the significant changes made by the 1960 Act.  First, it withdrew from the local planning authority the jurisdiction to deal with a planning application made in response to an enforcement notice.  All such applications or deemed applications were to be treated as if they had been called in by the minister: section 33(2).   Secondly, it withdrew the right to question an enforcement notice before a court on the grounds that there had in fact been no breach of planning control, because permission (or a deemed permission under the General Development Order) had been granted or because no permission was required.  It transferred the right to decide these questions to the minister.  Thirdly, it removed the right of a defendant prosecuted for failure to comply with an enforcement notice to challenge the validity of the enforcement notice on certain of the grounds which could have been raised by way of appeal to the minister.  For present purposes, the second and third changes are the most important because they effectively vested in the minister, subject only to appeal on a point of law, the exclusive right to decide the question of whether there had been a breach of planning control for which the owner was ultimately, in the event of non-compliance with the notice, liable to criminal sanctions.  The changes also meant that the minister could now have the dual function of deciding in the same proceedings the policy question of whether planning permission should be granted and the factual question of whether there had been a breach of planning control. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96. There have been further changes in the enforcement system since 1960 but the essential features, as now contained in the 1990 Act, remain the same.  The grounds for challenging the validity of the enforcement notice by an appeal to the Secretary of State under section 174 have been somewhat extended and the grounds for challenge in any other proceedings has been further restricted: see <i>R v Wicks</i> [1998]  AC 92.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97. The procedure for an appeal against an enforcement notice is prescribed by section 175 of the 1990 Act and Part III of the Town and Country Planning (Enforcement Notices and Appeals) Regulations 1991 (SI 1991/2804), as amended by SI 1992/1492.  The appellant and the local planning authority have the right to appear and be heard before an inspector, who makes his report and recommendations to the Secretary of State. If the Secretary of State is minded to disagree with the inspector on any material question of fact, he must notify the parties and give them the opportunity to make representations. Schedule 6 to the 1990 Act, which gives the Secretary of State power to confer power upon inspectors to hear and determine appeals (subject to recovery under paragraph 3) also applies to enforcement notice appeals.</p>
<i></i><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;European cases on the English planning system</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98. My Lords, this background enables me to discuss the four cases to which your Lordships were referred in which the European court or the Commission have considered the English planning system. The first in time is <i>ISKCON v United Kingdom</i> Application No 20490/92, 8 March 1994, a decision of the Commission on admissibility.  ISKCON was an Hindu religious organisation which owned a large manor house at Letchmore Heath in the Hertfordshire Green Belt near Watford.  It entered into a planning agreement with the local planning authority by which it agreed not to allow more than 1,000 visitors on any one day without the consent of the authority, which was given for six festival days in the year.  When an average of 1,500 people started coming every Sunday, the planning authority served an enforcement notice.  ISKCON appealed to the Secretary of State on ground (a) (that planning permission should be granted) and other grounds which were later dropped.  The inspector conducting the inquiry considered that the special needs of the organisation did not outweigh the policy of preserving the Green Belt and recommended that the appeal be dismissed.  The Secretary of State accepted the recommendation.  ISKCON appealed to the High Court under what is now section 289 of the 1990 Act.  The points of law relied upon were that the inspector and Secretary of State failed to have regard to relevant considerations and had been under a misapprehension about various facts. The judge dismissed the appeal, saying that the Secretary of State "was entitled to regard the inspector's conclusions as firmly founded".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99. ISKCON's complaint to the Commission alleged the breach of various articles of the Convention including article 6(1).  The Commission assumed that the Secretary of State was an "administrative body" who did not himself comply with article 6 but held that the right of appeal on a point of law was sufficient. It recited the formula from <i>Albert and Le Compte's </i>5 EHRR, para 29 case which required an appeal to "judicial bodies with full jurisdiction", went on to describe the principles of judicial review by which the English High Court decided whether the Secretary of State had erred in law and concluded that this jurisdiction was wide enough to satisfy the <i>Albert and Le Compte</i> formula.  It added:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is not the role of article 6 of the Convention to give access to a level of jurisdiction which can substitute its opinion for that of the administrative authorities on questions of expediency and where the courts do not refuse to examine any of the points raised: article 6 gives a right to a court that has 'full jurisdiction' (cf… <i>Zumtobel</i> [17 EHRR 116]…)"<p></p></ul>
<i>
</i><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100. ISKCON's</i> case is thus a decision that, at least when the ground of appeal against an enforcement notice is the policy ("expediency") question of whether planning permission should be granted, a decision by the Secretary of State subject to an appeal to the High Court satisfies article 6(1).  It is fair to say that it does not address the question of whether this would also do for a decision on the factual question of whether there has been a breach of planning control.  But the principle is sufficient for the purposes of the two planning appeals before your Lordships, which are both concerned solely with the question of whether planning permission should be granted.<i></i></p><i>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101. The next case, and the most important of the four, is <i>Bryan v United Kingdom</i> (1995)  21 EHRR 342.   Mr Bryan was a farmer at Warrington in Cheshire.  He built two brick buildings on land in a conservation area without planning permission and the planning authority served an enforcement notice which required them to be demolished.  He appealed to the Secretary of State on grounds (a) (that planning permission should be granted), (b) (that there had been no breach of planning control) and two other grounds.  The Secretary of State appointed an inspector with power under Schedule 6 to hear and determine the appeal.  He rejected the appeal on ground (a) because the buildings did not enhance or preserve the appearance of the conservation area.  On ground (b), Mr Bryan contended that the buildings were "designed for the purpose of agriculture" and that planning permission for them was deemed to have been granted under article 3 of the Town and Country Planning General Development Order 1988 (SI 1988/1813).  The planning authority said that they were not designed for the purpose of agriculture  and drew attention to the fact that they looked like detached houses with Georgian windows and other domestic features.  The inspector said that the question was one of fact and degree. He decided that the planning authority's view was correct and dismissed the appeal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102. Mr Bryan appealed to the High Court under section 289.  His notice of motion challenged the inspector's finding on ground (b) but the point was abandoned on the advice of counsel that, being a matter of fact and degree, it raised no arguable question of law.  On ground (a) it was alleged that the inspector had failed to take into account a relevant factor, namely that Mr Bryan was entitled to erect agricultural buildings of much the same size and appearance within the conservation area.  The judge said that this was a matter of planning judgment for the inspector and dismissed the appeal. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103. The complaint to the Commission was on the ground that these procedures did not satisfy article 6(1).  The Commission held Mr Bryan's complaint admissible but decided, by a majority of 11 to five, that there had been no breach of article 6(1).  In order to understand the issues, it is convenient to start with the opinion of the minority, at p 356. They were entirely concerned with whether article 6(1) had been satisfied in relation to the question of whether the building "was indeed a barn designed and intended for agricultural use".  This, they emphasised, was not a question of "expediency":</p>
<p></p><ul>"In the <i>Zumtobel</i> case [17 EHRR 110, para 32] the European Court of Human Rights referred to the 'respect which must be accorded to decisions taken by administrative authorities on grounds of expediency'. Whilst questions of expediency play a large role in matters relating to, for example, the public interest involved if a particular development is permitted, the present case concerns, at least in part, the fundamental factual issue of whether the building erected by the applicant was, or was not, designed for the purposes of agriculture and so had deemed planning permission.  This factual issue was in dispute and in the circumstances of this case the High Court judge was not able to provide a 'determination' of it.  For us, this deprived the applicant of access to a 'tribunal' to which article 6(1) of the Convention entitled him."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104. There is, if I may respectfully say so, considerable force in the reasoning of the minority and, as the history shows, it accords with the view which Parliament took of the appropriate enforcement procedures in 1947.  But the purity of the 1947 system had turned out in practice to be unworkable and it therefore had to be replaced with the impure system which we have today.  For present purposes, the important point to notice is that the minority had no difficulty in accepting limited judicial review of the "expediency" questions involved in deciding whether planning permission should be granted.  There is nothing to suggest that they would have disagreed with the reasoning or decision in <i>ISKCON's </i>case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105. The majority said, at paragraph 46, that no complaint could be made about the limited right of appeal on ground (a) because it called for "respect on the grounds of expediency" and referred to <i>Zumtobel's</i> case.  As for the ground (b) appeal, they accepted that it "would have raised matters of a more factual nature" but said that as the point had not been argued, it was impossible to say whether judicial review would have been inadequate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106. Both the majority and minority judgements proceeded upon the assumption that the inspector was not an "independent and impartial tribunal" and that the question was whether the High Court's jurisdiction under section 289 was a sufficiently "full jurisdiction" to satisfy article 6(1).  But the opinion of Mr Nicolas Bratza, concurring with the majority, needs some attention because it introduced a new and original element into the reasoning, which, as we shall see, influenced the judgment of the European court. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107. Mr Bratza started, at p 353, by saying that the only ground of appeal which Mr Bryan had pursued in the High Court, namely (a), "related to matters of planning policy" and that in accordance with the reasoning in <i>Zumtobel's</i> case, article 6 did not require "that a court should have the power to substitute its view for that of the administrative authorities on matters of planning policy or 'expediency' '."  On this point, therefore, all members of the Commission were of the same mind.  Mr Bratza then turned his attention to ground (b) and said that in his view, the power of the High Court under section 289 was sufficient even for the purpose of fact-finding to amount to "full jurisdiction".  He said, at p 354:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It appears to me that the requirement that a court or tribunal should have 'full jurisdiction' cannot be mechanically applied with the result that, in all circumstances and whatever the subject matter of the dispute, the court or tribunal must have full power to substitute its own findings of fact, and its own inferences from those facts, for that of the administrative authority concerned.  Whether the power of judicial review is sufficiently wide to satisfy the requirements of article 6 must in my view depend on a number of considerations, including the subject matter of the dispute, the nature of the decision of the administrative authorities which is in question, the procedure, if any, which exists for review of the decision by a person or body acting independently of the authority concerned and the scope of that power of review."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108. Mr Bratza pointed out, at pp 354-355, that an inspector hearing an appeal under section 174 acted in a quasi-judicial capacity and in accordance with prescribed procedures.  Both parties were entitled to be heard and he gave a reasoned decision.  It was true that for the purpose of applying policy, the inspectors could not be said to be independent.  They were chosen from the salaried staff of the Planning Inspectorate, "which serves the Secretary of State in the furtherance of his policies."  But for the purposes of finding and evaluating the facts, he was sufficiently independent:</p>
<p></p><ul>"there is…nothing to suggest that, in finding the primary facts and in drawing conclusions and inferences from those facts, an inspector acts anything other than independently, in the sense that he is in no sense connected with the parties to the dispute or subject to their influence or control; his findings and conclusions are based exclusively on the evidence and submissions before him."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109. Mr Bratza then discussed the breadth of the High Court's judicial review powers and said that this power of review, "combined with the statutory procedure for appealing against an enforcement notice" was sufficient to meet the requirement of "full jurisdiction" inherent in article 6(1).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110. Mr Bratza's particular insight, if I may respectfully say so, was to see that a tribunal may be more or less independent, depending upon the question it is being called upon to decide.  On matters of policy, the inspector was no more independent than the Secretary of State himself.  But this was a matter on which independence was unnecessary - indeed, on democratic principles, undesirable - and in which the power of judicial review, paying full respect to the views of the inspector or Secretary of State on questions of policy or expediency, was sufficient to satisfy article 6(1).  On the other hand, in deciding the questions of primary fact or fact and degree which arose in enforcement notice appeals, the inspector was no mere bureaucrat.  He was an expert tribunal acting in a quasi-judicial manner and therefore sufficiently independent to make it unnecessary that the High Court should have a broad jurisdiction to review his decisions on  questions of fact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111. I have spent some time on Mr Bratza's opinion because I think it is clear that it influenced and illuminates the reasoning of the EHCR.   The court said, at paragraph 38, that although the inspector was required to decide the appeal "in a quasi-judicial, independent and impartial, as well as fair, manner" he was still the creature of the Secretary of State, whose own policies were in issue and who could remove him at any time.  Therefore:</p>
<p></p><ul>"the review by the inspector does not of itself satisfy the requirements of article 6 of the Convention, despite the existence of various safeguards customarily associated with an 'independent and impartial tribunal'."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112. The court noted, at paragraph 44, that:</p>
<p></p><ul>"the appeal to the High Court, being on 'points of law', was not capable of embracing all aspects of the inspector's decision…In particular, as is not infrequently the case in relation to administrative law appeals in Council of Europe member states, there was no rehearing as such of the original complaints submitted to the inspector; the High Court could not substitute its own decision on the merits for that of the inspector; and its jurisdiction over the facts was limited."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113. The question was whether this limited jurisdiction was "full jurisdiction" for the purposes of the <i>Albert and Le Compte</i> formula 5 EHRR 533.  The court considered grounds (a) and (b) separately. On ground (a) it agreed, at paragraph 47, with the Commission that the applicant's submissions "went essentially to questions involving 'a panoply of policy matters such as development plans, and the fact that the property was situated in a Green Belt and in a conservation area'."  Judicial review was therefore, on the principle of <i>Zumtobel's</i> case 17 EHRR 116, a sufficiently full jurisdiction. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114. On ground (b), the European court noted what, in paragraph 46, it described as:</p>
<p></p><ul>"the uncontested safeguards attending the procedure before the inspector: the quasi-judicial character of the decision-making process; the duty incumbent on each inspector to exercise independent judgment; the requirement that inspectors must not be subject to any improper influence; the stated mission of the Inspectorate to uphold the principles of openness, fairness and impartiality."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115. It went on to say, at paragraph 47, that if Mr Bryan had pursued his appeal on ground (b), the High Court, while not being able to substitute its own findings of fact "had the power to satisfy itself that the inspector's findings of fact or the inferences based on them were neither perverse nor irrational".  This was enough to satisfy article 6:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Such an approach by an appeal tribunal on questions of fact can reasonably be expected in specialised areas of the law such as the one at issue, particularly where the facts have already been established in the course of a quasi-judicial procedure governed by many of the safeguards required by article 6(1).  It is also frequently a feature in the systems of judicial control of administrative decisions found throughout the Council of Europe member states."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116. My Lords, I have discussed <i>Bryan's</i> case at length because the Divisional Court placed heavy reliance upon it and, in my view, seriously misunderstood it.  The Divisional Court treated it as holding that <i>whatever the issues</i>, the "safeguards" which the court enumerated in paragraph 46 as attaching to the functions of the inspectors were necessary before the existence of an appeal on a point of law or judicial review would satisfy article 6.  But this is the very opposite of what the court was at pains to emphasise.  It said, in paragraph 45, in language echoing that of Mr Bratza's opinion:</p>
<p></p><ul>"…in assessing the sufficiency of the review available to Mr Bryan on appeal to the High Court, it is necessary to have regard to matters such as the subject matter of the decision appealed against, the manner in which that decision was arrived at, and the content of the dispute, including the desired and actual grounds of appeal."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117. If, therefore, the question is one of policy or expediency, the "safeguards" are irrelevant.  No one expects the inspector to be independent or impartial in applying the Secretary of State's policy and this was the reason why the court said that he was not for all purposes an independent or impartial tribunal.  In this respect his position is no different from that of the Secretary of State himself.  The reason why judicial review is sufficient in both cases to satisfy article 6 has nothing to do with the "safeguards" but depends upon the <i>Zumtobel</i> principle of respect for the decision of an administrative authority on questions of expediency.  It is only when one comes to findings of fact, or the evaluation of facts, such as arise on the question of whether there has been a breach of planning control, that the safeguards are essential for the acceptance of a limited review of fact by the appellate tribunal. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118. My Lords, I can deal much more briefly with the other two cases.  In <i>Varey v United Kingdom</i> Application No 26662/95 27 October 1999 the Commission considered a complaint by gypsies against whom enforcement proceedings had been taken for stationing caravans on land without planning permission.  They had applied three times for permission.  On the first occasion, an appeal to the Secretary of State was dismissed.  On the second occasion, the inspector said that there had been a change in circumstances and recommended that permission be granted but the Secretary of State disagreed.  He said that the new circumstances were insufficient to justify overriding the Green Belt policy.  On the third occasion the inspector again recommended that permission be granted and for similar reasons the Secretary of State rejected his recommendation and dismissed the appeal.  In no case did the applicants appeal to the High Court.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119. The Commission, following the <i>Bryan</i> case, 21 EHRR 342, said that there had been no violation of article 6.  The High Court's jurisdiction on appeal from the Secretary of State was sufficient.  So the case adds little to <i>Bryan</i> itself.  I would only comment that I find puzzling a remark of the Commission, at paragraph 78, that -</p>
<p></p><ul>"the procedural protection afforded to the applicants' interests by the process of a public inquiry before a planning inspector, who had the benefit of inspecting the site and of receiving written and oral evidence and representations, must be regarded as considerably diminished by the rejection on two occasions by the Secretary of State of the inspector's recommendations."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120. The Secretary of State does not appear to have differed from the inspector on any finding of fact or evaluation of the facts.  He disagreed because he did not think that the inspector had given sufficient weight to the importance of maintaining the Green Belt.  This is a pure question of administrative policy or expediency.  It has nothing to do with the issues on which it is essential for the inspector to be judicial and impartial.  However, despite these remarks, the Commission concluded that even though the safeguards had been diminished, the procedure still complied with article 6.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121. Finally there is <i>Chapman v United Kingdom</i> Application No 27238/95 18 January 2001, a decision of the Grand Chamber of the European court.  This was another case of enforcement proceedings against gypsies.  Her appeal on ground (a) was dismissed by an inspector exercising the power to determine the appeal under Schedule 6.  She did not appeal to the High Court and complained that the High Court would not have been entitled to determine the merits of her claim that she should have planning permission.  The court stated briefly that, following the <i>Bryan</i> case, the scope of judicial review was sufficient to satisfy article 6.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122. My Lords, I conclude from this examination of the European cases on our planning law that, despite some understandable doubts on the part of some members of the Commission about the propriety of having the question of whether there has been a breach of planning control determined by anyone other than an independent and impartial tribunal, even this aspect of our planning system has survived scrutiny.  As for decisions on questions of policy or expediency such as arise in these appeals, whether made by an inspector or the Secretary of State, there has never been a single voice in the Commission or the European court to suggest that our provisions for judicial review are inadequate to satisfy article 6.</p>
<i></i><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Judgment of the Divisional Court</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123. My Lords, I must now examine the reasoning of the Divisional Court.  They considered the way in which decisions are made by the Secretary of State and came to the conclusion that he was not independent or impartial. Even though the department has elaborate procedures to ensure that the decision-making process is not contaminated by reliance on facts which had not been found by the inspector or fairly put to the parties, the decision is bound to be influenced by the departmental view on policy.  Mr Kingston, who appeared for the Huntingdonshire District Council, spent a good deal of time making this proposition good by examining the documents showing how the department was, at various levels, involved in the development of policy for Alconbury.  But this was entirely what I would have expected.  It is the business of the Secretary of State, aided by his civil servants, to develop national planning policies and co-ordinate local policies. These policies are not airy abstractions.  They are intended to be applied  to actual cases.  It would be absurd for the Secretary of State, in arriving at a decision in a particular case, to ignore his policies and start with a completely open mind. </p>
