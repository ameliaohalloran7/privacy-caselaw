<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;158. In my respectful opinion, this passage, at least in its application to the surety wife cases, has set the law on a wrong track.  First, it seems to me to lose sight of the evidential and rebuttable character of the Class 2 presumption.  The presumption arises where the combination of the relationship and the nature of the transaction justify, in the absence of any other evidence, a conclusion that the transaction was procured by the undue influence of the dominant party.  Such a conclusion, reached on a balance of probabilities, is based upon inferences to be drawn from that combination.  There are some relationships, generally of a fiduciary  character, where, as a matter of policy, the law requires the dominant party to justify the righteousness of the transaction. These relationships do not include the husband wife relationship.  In the surety wife cases, the complainant does have to prove undue influence:  the presumption, if it arises on the facts of a particular case, is a tool to assist him or her in doing so.  It shifts, for the moment, the onus of proof to the other side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;159. Second, the passage cited appears to regard a relationship of trust and confidence between a wife and husband as something special rather than as the norm.  For my part, I would assume in every case in which a wife and husband are living together that there is a reciprocal trust and confidence between them.  In the fairly common circumstance that the financial and business decisions of the family are primarily taken by the husband, I would assume that the wife would have trust and confidence in his ability to do so and would support his decisions.  I would not expect evidence to be necessary to establish the existence of that trust and confidence.  I would expect evidence to be necessary to demonstrate its absence.  In cases where experience, probably bitter, had led a wife to doubt the wisdom of her husband's financial or business decisions, I still would not regard her willingness to support those decisions with her own assets as an indication that he had exerted undue influence over her to persuade her to do so.  Rather I would regard her support as a natural and admirable consequence of the relationship of a mutually loyal married couple.  The proposition that if a wife, who generally reposes trust and confidence in her husband, agrees to become surety to support his debts or his business enterprises a presumption of undue influence arises is one that I am unable to accept.  To regard the husband in such a case as a presumed "wrongdoer" does not seem to me consistent with the relationship of trust and confidence that is a part of every healthy marriage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;160. There are, of course, cases where a husband does abuse that trust and confidence.  He may do so by expressions of quite unjustified over-optimistic enthusiasm about the prospects of success of his business enterprises.  He may do so by positive misrepresentation of his business intentions, or of the nature of the security he is asking his wife to grant his creditors, or of some other material matter.  He may do so by subjecting her to excessive pressure, emotional blackmail or bullying in order to persuade her to sign.  But none of these things should, in my opinion, be presumed merely from the fact of the relationship of general trust and confidence.  More is needed before the stage is reached at which, in the absence of any other evidence, an inference of undue influence can properly be drawn or a presumption of the existence of undue influence can be said to arise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;161. For my part, I doubt the utility of the Class 2(B) classification.  Class 2(A) is useful in identifying particular relationships where the presumption arises.  The presumption in Class 2(B) cases, however, is doing no more than recognising that evidence of the relationship between the dominant and subservient parties, coupled with whatever other evidence is for the time being available, may be sufficient to justify a finding of undue influence on the balance of probabilities.  The onus shifts to the defendant.  Unless the defendant introduces evidence to counteract the inference of undue influence that the complainant's evidence justifies, the complainant will succeed.  In my opinion, the presumption of undue influence in Class 2(B) cases has the same function in undue influence cases as <i>res ipsa loquitur </i>has in negligence cases.  It recognises an evidential state of affairs in which the onus has shifted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;162. In the surety wife cases it should, in my opinion, be recognised that undue influence, though a possible explanation for the wife's agreement to become surety, is a relatively unlikely one.  <i>O'Brien</i> itself was a misrepresentation case.  Undue influence had been alleged but the undoubted pressure which the husband had brought to bear to persuade his reluctant wife to sign was not regarded by the judge or the Court of Appeal as constituting undue influence.  The wife's will had not been overborne by her husband.  Nor was <i>O'Brien</i> a case in which, in my opinion, there would have been at any stage in the case a presumption of undue influence.</p>
<i><p><i>The steps to be taken by the creditor bank</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;163. The protection that Lord Browne-Wilkinson proposed for the vulnerable surety wives is based upon the undoubted risk that in procuring his wife's consent to the transaction the husband might have used undue influence or made some material misrepresentation and upon the proposition that the bank must be taken to be aware of the existence of the risk.  So the bank should take reasonable steps to satisfy itself that the wife understands what she is doing.  The protection is not based upon the bank's knowledge of facts from which a presumption of undue influence arises.  If, of course, a bank is aware of such facts, the steps the bank will then have to take in order to be able with safety to rely on the wife's apparent consent to the transaction may be considerable.  In his dissenting judgment in<i> Banco Exterior Internacional v Mann</i> [1995]  1 All ER 936 Hobhouse LJ (as he then was) said, at p 948:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It must be remembered that the starting point of this exercise is that the wife's will is being unduly and improperly influenced by the will of her husband.  The steps taken have to be directed to freeing her of that influence or, at the least, providing some counterbalance."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;164. I respectfully agree that if the bank is indeed aware of facts from which undue influence is to be presumed, the steps to be taken would be of the sort Hobhouse LJ describes.  But in the ordinary case the facts of which the bank is aware, or must be taken to be aware, point to no more than the existence of the inevitable risk that there may have been undue influence or some other impropriety and are not facts sufficient by themselves to give rise to a presumption of undue influence.  In such a case the bank does not have to take steps to satisfy itself that there is no undue influence.  It must take steps to satisfy itself that the wife understands the nature and effect of the transaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;165. Lord Browne-Wilkinson made clear, at [1994] 1 AC 180, 197, that it would only be in exceptional cases "where a creditor has knowledge of further facts which render the presence of undue influence not only possible but probable" that a bank would, to be safe, have to insist that the wife be separately advised.  In other cases it would suffice if the bank took steps "to bring home to the wife the risk she is running by standing as surety and to advise her to take separate advice" (p 196).  He added that, as to past transactions - and each of the cases now before the House involves a past transaction - it would depend on the facts of each case whether the bank had satisfied the reasonable steps test.  I would emphasise and repeat that the purpose of the steps, in the ordinary surety wife case, would be to satisfy the bank that the wife understood the nature and effect of the transaction she was entering into.</p>

<i><p><i>The problems</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;166. The application of the <i>O'Brien</i> principles has, in the appeals now before the House, given rise to some particular problems which are to be found, also, in most of the post <i>O'Brien</i> reported cases.</p>
<i><p><i>Solicitors' Advice</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;167. In a number of cases a firm of solicitors has been acting for the husband in the transaction with the bank and has acted also for the wife in connection with the grant of the security to the bank.  In many cases, the same solicitor acting for the husband and the wife has been asked by the bank to act for it in connection with the completion of the security.  A number of questions arise:  for instance—</p>
<p></p><ul>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the fact that, to the knowledge of the bank, a solicitor is acting for the wife in the security transaction entitle the bank reasonably to believe that the solicitor will have given her an adequate explanation of the nature and effect of the security document she is to sign?<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;If so, are there, in the ordinary case, ie where there is no special reason for the bank to suspect undue influence or other impropriety, any other steps that the bank ought reasonably to take?<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the answer to question 1 is 'yes' and to question 2 is 'No', does the fact that the solicitor is also the husband's solicitor and is acting for the bank in arranging for completion of the security bar the bank from relying on the solicitor's role in acting for the wife?<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;In many cases the solicitor in whose offices the wife has signed the security document has confirmed, sometimes on the document itself and sometimes in a covering letter to the bank, that the nature and effect of the document has first been explained to the wife and that she has appeared to understand it and to be entering freely into the transaction, or to that effect.  If in these cases the solicitor has in fact given no, or no adequate, explanation of the document to the wife, in what circumstances can the solicitor's knowledge of his failure be attributed to the bank?<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;168. As to question 1, the duty of a solicitor towards his client is, in every case, dependent on the instructions, express or implied, that he has received from his client.  A solicitor acting for a client in connection with a proposed transaction under which the client is to become surety or give security for the debts of another will not necessarily have instructions to advise the client about the nature and effect of the transaction.  In most cases such instructions, if not express, would, I think, be implied;  but it is at least possible that the circumstances of the solicitor's retainer would not require him to give such advice.  So, in my opinion, knowledge by a bank that a solicitor is acting for a surety wife does not, without more, justify the bank in assuming that the solicitor's instructions extend to advising her about the nature and effect of the transaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;169. Normally, however, a solicitor, instructed to act for a surety wife in connection with a suretyship transaction would owe a duty to the wife to explain to her the nature and effect of the document or documents she was to sign.  Exactly what the explanation should consist of would obviously depend in each case on the facts of that case and on any particular concerns that the wife might have communicated to the solicitor.  In general, however, the solicitor should, in my opinion:</p>
<p></p><ul><ul>(i) explain to the wife, on a worst case footing, the steps the bank might take to enforce its security;<p></p></ul></ul>
<p></p><ul><ul>(ii) make sure the wife understands the extent of the liabilities that may come to be secured under the security;<p></p></ul></ul>
<p></p><ul><ul>(iii) explain the likely duration of the security;<p></p></ul></ul>
<p></p><ul><ul>(iv) ascertain whether the wife is aware of any existing indebtedness that will, if she grants the security, be secured under it;<p></p></ul></ul>
<p></p><ul><ul>(v) explain to the wife that he may need to give the bank a written confirmation that he has advised her about the nature and effect of the proposed transaction and obtain her consent to his doing so.<p></p></ul></ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;170. I think the solicitor should, probably, begin by trying to discover from the wife her understanding of the proposed transaction.  He, the solicitor, may then be in a position to remedy any misapprehensions and cure any misrepresentations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;171. A bank, proposing to take a security from a surety wife for whom a solicitor is acting, requires, first, confirmation that the solicitor's instructions do extend to advising her about the nature and effect of the transaction.  Subject to that confirmation, however, the bank is, in my opinion, entitled reasonably to believe that the solicitor will have advised her on the matters to which I have referred and, accordingly, that she has had an adequate explanation and has an adequate understanding of the transaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;172. As to question 2, there are, in my opinion, in the ordinary case and subject to the points about disclosure that I will make later, no other steps that the bank can reasonably be required to take.  In particular the bank does not, in order to be able safely to rely on the security being offered, have to advise the wife about the wisdom of her entry into the transaction, or about the bank's opinion of the financial state or business prospects of the principal debtor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;173. As to question 3, the fact that the solicitor is acting also for the bank in arranging for completion of the security does not, in my opinion, alter the answers to questions 1 and 2.  The solicitor's role in acting for the bank is essentially administrative.  He must see that the security document is validly executed and, if necessary, see to its registration.  If there are documents of title to whose custody the bank, as chargee, is entitled, the solicitor will usually have to obtain them and hold them to the bank's order.   But he has no consultative role vis a vis the bank.  His duties to the bank do not, in my opinion, in the least prejudice his suitability to advise the wife.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;174. If the solicitor is acting also for the husband, his role presents a little more difficulty.  It is, after all, the existence of the risk of undue influence or misrepresentation by the husband that requires the bank to be reasonably satisfied that the wife understands the nature and effect of the transaction.  If there is some particular reason known to the bank for suspecting undue influence or other impropriety by the husband, then, in my view, the bank should insist on advice being given to the wife by a solicitor independent of the husband (see Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <i>O'Brien</i>,<i> </i>at p 197).  But in a case in which there is no such particular reason, and the risk is no more than the possibility, present in all surety wife cases, of impropriety by the husband, there is no reason, in my opinion, why the solicitor advising the wife should not also be the husband's solicitor.  In the ordinary case, in my opinion, the bank is entitled to rely on the professional competence and propriety of the solicitor in providing proper and adequate advice to the wife notwithstanding that he, the solicitor, is acting also for the husband.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;175. As to question 4, if the bank knows or has reason to suspect that the solicitor has not given the wife a proper explanation of the nature and effect of the security document, the bank should take some appropriate steps to remedy the failure.  The failure of the solicitor to give the bank written confirmation that he has given the wife such an explanation will in many cases give the bank reason to suspect that he has not done so.  In general, however, it will be reasonable for the bank to believe that the solicitor has properly discharged his professional duty.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;176. Mr Sher QC, counsel for five of the wives, placed some reliance on section 199(1)(ii)(b) of the Law of Property Act 1925:</p>
<p></p><ul>"(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;A purchaser shall not be prejudicially affected by notice of— . . . <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;any . . . matter or any fact or thing unless—<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;in the same transaction with respect to which a question of notice to the purchaser arises, it has come to the knowledge of his counsel, as such, or of his solicitor or other agent, as such . . . ."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;177. Mr Sher submitted that if a solicitor was instructed by a bank to arrange on its behalf for completion of a security to be granted by a surety wife, the solicitor was, for the purpose of any explanation or advice to be given to the wife, acting not only as the wife's solicitor but also as the bank's solicitor.  That being so, the solicitor's knowledge of his own failure should, Mr Sher submitted, be attributed to the bank.  Particularly, he submitted, this should be so if the solicitor's instructions from the bank had included a request that the solicitor give appropriate advice to the wife.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;178. A distinction must, in my opinion, be drawn between the case where the solicitor, as well as having instructions from the bank, is solicitor for the wife and the case where the solicitor's only instructions come from the bank and the bank is his only client.  In the former case, the solicitor' s duty, so far as advice to the wife is concerned, is owed to her and her alone.  The fact that a request for him to advise her may have been made by the bank is immaterial on this point.  It follows that in advising her the solicitor is not acting as the bank's solicitor and section 199(1)(ii)(b) does not apply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;179. A different conclusion must, in my opinion, be reached if the solicitor in question never does become the wife's solicitor.  The formation of a solicitor/client relationship may come about by express retainer or the retainer may be implied by conduct.  But whichever it is, it is not a relationship which can be brought into existence by the solicitor unilaterally.  In making these comments I have in mind the assumed facts in <i>Wallace</i> that are more fully set out below (see pp 92-94).   Shortly stated, the bank asked the solicitor to arrange for completion of the security and to advise the wife about it, the solicitor represented to the bank that he had advised the wife, the bank had no reason to doubt that that was so, but in fact the solicitor had given no advice or tendered any other services to the wife, other than witnessing her signature, a service for which he charged the bank, and she had had no reason to and did not regard him as acting for her.  In those circumstances, the solicitor was, in my opinion, acting for the bank alone and his knowledge that no one had given the wife any explanation or advice about the security document could properly be attributed to the bank.  But, as I have said, in cases where the solicitor has become the wife's solicitor and owes her a duty to advise her about the security document, his knowledge of his own failure to discharge that duty cannot, in my view, be attributed to the bank.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;180. In <i>Etridge (No 2)</i> [1998]  4 All ER 705, 721  Stuart-Smith LJ set out, in para 44, a number of propositions, (1) to (6), relating to legal advice to a surety wife.  I respectfully agree with all these propositions, save that knowledge by a bank of special facts pointing to undue influence might require a different approach and that where the solicitor was acting only for the bank and had never become the solicitor for the wife, his knowledge of what had or had not taken place regarding advice to the wife might well be imputed to the bank.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;181. At p 715, para 19 of the <i>Etridge (No 2)</i> judgment Stuart-Smith LJ expressed the view of the court as to the duty owed by a solicitor "instructed to advise a person who may be subject to the undue influence of another".  He said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is not sufficient to explain the documentation and ensure that she understands the nature of the transaction and wishes to carry it out."<p></p></ul>
<p>and:</p>
<p></p><ul>"His duty is to satisfy himself that his client is free from improper influence, and the first step must be to ascertain whether it is one into which she could sensibly be advised to enter if free from such influence."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;182. These passages were cited and applied by Mance LJ in <i>Kenyon-Brown v Desmond Banks &amp; Co</i> [2000]  PNLR 266, 273.<i>  </i>I must respectfully dissent.  The duty thus described may be applicable in a case in which the solicitor has had something or other drawn to his attention which arouses suspicion that the wife may be the victim of undue influence.  In the ordinary case, however, where there is no more than a normal relationship of trust and  confidence, financial arrangements negotiated by the husband with the bank and the wife proposing to become surety for her husband's, or his company's, debts, there will be no presumption of undue influence and no reasonable basis for suspicion of its existence.  There will be a risk, a possibility, of undue influence or misrepresentation, but no more than that.  The solicitor in such a case does not have a duty to satisfy himself of the absence of undue influence.  His duty is accurately described as a duty to satisfy himself that his client understands the nature and effect of the transaction and is willing to enter into it.</p>
<i><p><i>Disclosure</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;183. One of the issues that has arisen in several of the cases is as to the extent of disclosure to the surety wife, or to the solicitor acting for her, that is required of the bank.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;184. As to this, the wife's understanding of the nature and effect of the security document she is asked to sign should, obviously, be an informed understanding.  It is necessary, it seems to me, to consider, first, the extent of the obligation of disclosure to a would-be surety that lies generally upon the creditor and, secondly, to consider whether any additional disclosure has to be made where a wife is proposing to stand surety for her husband's debts.<i></i></p><i>
</i>
<i><p><i>The general law</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;185. A suretyship contract is not a contract <i>uberrimae fidei.  </i>In <i> Seaton v Heath</i> [1899]  1 QB 782  Romer LJ said, at p 793:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The risk undertaken is generally known to the surety and the circumstances generally point to the view that as between the creditor and surety it was contemplated and intended that the surety should take upon himself to ascertain exactly what risk he was taking upon himself."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;186. But although a would-be surety is, in general, expected to acquaint himself with the risk he is undertaking, the creditor is under an obligation to disclose to the intending surety</p>
<p></p><ul>"anything which might not naturally be expected to take place between the parties who are concerned in the transaction, that is, whether there be a contract between the debtor and the creditor, to the effect that his position shall be different from that which the surety might naturally expect" (per Lord Campbell in<i> Hamilton v Watson </i> (1845)  12 Cl &amp; F 109  at 119).<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;187. This passage from Lord Campbell's judgment in <i>Hamilton v Watson</i> was cited by Vaughan Williams LJ in <i>London General Omnibus Co Ltd v Holloway</i> [1912]  2 KB 72, 78.   Vaughan Williams LJ continued, at p 79:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Lord Campbell, it is true, takes as his example of what  might not be naturally expected an unusual contract between creditor and debtor whose debt the surety guarantees, but I take it this is only an example of the general proposition that a creditor must reveal to the surety every fact which under the circumstances the surety would expect not to exist, for the omission to mention that such a fact does exist is an implied representation that it does not." <p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;188. The general proposition expressed by Vaughan Williams LJ was somewhat extended by King CJ in<i> Pooraka Holdings Pty Ltd v Participation Nominees Pty Ltd</i> (1991)  58 SASR 184.  The duty of disclosure, said King CJ, extends to any unusual feature surrounding the transaction between the creditor and the surety (a) of which the creditor is or ought to be aware, (b) of which the surety is unaware, and (c) which the creditor appreciates, or in the circumstances ought to appreciate, might be unknown to the surety and might affect the surety's decision to become a surety.  This statement of the extent of the disclosure obligation may be too wide.  But at least, in my opinion, the obligation should extend to unusual features of the contractual relationship between the creditor and the principal debtor, or between the creditor and other creditors of the principal debtor, that would or might affect the rights of the surety (see generally the discussion of this topic in <i>O'Donovan &amp; Phillips</i>,<i> </i>The Modern Contract of Guarantee, 3rd ed (1996), at pp 122-131).</p>
<i><p><i>Disclosure to surety wives</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;189. In general, in my opinion, there is no greater obligation of disclosure owed by a bank, or other creditor, to a surety wife than to any other surety.  There is, however, a difference.  Where a wife is offering to stand as surety for her husband's, or his company's debts, the risk that her consent to do so may have been improperly procured, requires the creditor, if it is to be able safely to rely on her apparent consent, to take reasonable steps to satisfy itself that she understands what she is doing.  In order to satisfy itself about this, and in order that her understanding may be an informed understanding, it may be necessary for the creditor to disclose the amount of any existing indebtedness that will be covered by the security.  It may for the same reason be necessary for the creditor to disclose the amount of new money that is being made available to the principal debtor and will be covered by the security.  The financial details to which I have referred would not, under the general law, have to be disclosed by a creditor to the would-be surety.  They are details that the creditor could expect the surety, as part of the surety's risk assessment, to find out for himself.  But the surety wife cases present their own special problems, as was recognised in <i>O'Brien</i>.  In the surety wife cases, and in any other cases in which a creditor is placed on inquiry as to whether the surety's apparent consent to the transaction may have been procured by some impropriety of the principal debtor, the reasonable steps the creditor should take would generally include, in my opinion, disclosing to the surety the financial details to which I have referred.  Failure to do so would not matter, of course, if the surety already knew the details or if the creditor had reason to believe that the surety knew.  I should, perhaps, add that the failure of a creditor to have disclosed these details should not, without more, be taken, in relation to past transactions, to show that the creditor had failed to take reasonable steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;190. The financial details to which I have referred would, if the creditor were a bank, normally be confidential.  The bank would not be entitled to disclose them without the consent of its client, the principal debtor.  However, in the surety wife cases I would regard the husband's proposal that the wife stand surety for his, or his company's, debts as constituting an implied authority to the bank to disclose those details to the wife.  Express instructions to the contrary, if given by the husband to the bank, would constitute a warning to the bank of an extra risk that the husband might be abusing his wife's trust and confidence in him.  I think that the bank, before it could safely rely on the wife's apparent consent to the suretyship, would then need to insist that she receive legal advice from a solicitor independent of her husband.  </p>
