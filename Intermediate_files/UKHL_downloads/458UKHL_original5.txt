<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104. My noble and learned friend, Lord Hope of Craighead concludes from the absence of specific powers of search in the Extradition Act that Parliament did not intend police officers executing an arrest warrant in extradition proceedings to have such powers.  Like Lord Hutton I would not share that conclusion.  Again, the evidence of practice is of some significance.  The report of the Inter-Departmental Working Party, <i>A Review of the Law and Practice of Extradition in the United Kingdom</i>, was published in 1982, before PACE.  Chapter 11 deals with the seizure and surrender of property.  The Working Party had in mind both property that might serve as proof of the extradition offence and property that was in the possession of the person being extradited and might have been acquired by him in connexion with the offence.  They note that a sizeable proportion of extradition requests relate to offences such as theft and fraud and that, before section 26(1) of the Theft Act 1968 came into force, there was no provision in the Extradition Act 1870 for the issuing of search warrants where someone was arrested for such an offence.  In Commonwealth cases there was a specific power to grant search warrants in such cases under section 6(5) of the Fugitive Offenders Act 1967 but</p>
<p></p><ul>"[t]he absence of any equivalent provision from the Extradition Act 1870 for many years deprived the police officer seeking to execute a warrant of arrest of the reassurance available from being armed at the same time with a search warrant."<p></p></ul>
<p>This passage from para 11.6 suggests that, even though the comfort of a search warrant could not be obtained, in practice police officers did carry out searches when executing arrest warrants - although, as in domestic cases, there was no decision of the courts to say that such searches were lawful.  Again, the absence of authority one way or the other must be because the lawfulness of such searches had never been tested in the courts.  When it was eventually tested before the Divisional Court in <i>Osman</i>, the challenge was rejected and the court declared that police officers did indeed enjoy the same common law powers of search on arrest under an extradition warrant as on arrest under a domestic warrant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105. The Working Party suggested that section 26(1) of the Theft Act made section 6(5) of the Fugitive Offenders Act unnecessary.  For some reason, however, Parliament chose to re-enact section 6(5) in section 8(6) of the Extradition Act.  That provision covers only a limited range of cases.  Whatever may have been the reason for retaining that specific provision, it does not in my view justify the conclusion that Parliament intended to abolish, without replacing, any common law power of search that was available in other cases.  Nor did counsel point to any other provision that would have that effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106. I would therefore hold that at common law, before PACE was enacted, police officers arresting someone in the respondent's position in the driveway of his house would have had the power to search his house for evidence relating to the extradition offence.  The Extradition Act did not abolish that power.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107. The second question for decision arises, however, because the Administrative Court held that, even if the police officers would once have had that common law power to search the respondent's house, it no longer existed, having been extinguished by PACE five years before the Extradition Act was passed.  In concluding that any such power had been extinguished in this way, Brooke LJ (para 47) said that he found it:</p>
<p></p><ul>"quite impossible to interpret Part II of PACE as providing any saving for the common law power identified by Lloyd LJ in <i>Osman</i>."<p></p></ul>
<p>As Lord Hutton has noted, and as indeed Brooke LJ had himself noticed in the preceding paragraph of his judgment, the true question is not whether Part II of PACE saved the common law power but whether it extinguished or abolished that power.  In argument before the House Miss Montgomery accepted this and accepted also that she had to identify a provision or provisions in the legislation which had expressly or impliedly abolished the common law power.  She pointed to only one provision, section 17(5), as having this effect:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Subject to subsection (6) below, all the rules of common law under which a constable has power to enter premises without a warrant are hereby abolished."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108. In fact, section 17(5) has nothing whatever to do with the power of police officers to search premises for evidence once a person has been arrested.  As I have already noted, in English law arrest warrants do not contain a warrant to search for the individual concerned.  If arrests are to be carried out, however, it is obviously necessary that police officers should have the requisite power to search for the individual who is to be arrested.  The common law made provision for this, as did various statutes dealing with particular situations.  But in 1984 Parliament decided to regulate the power of police officers to enter premises to make arrests by replacing these common law and particular statutory powers with the more specific code of powers set out in section 17 of PACE.  The new statutory powers for police officers were intended to be comprehensive and to replace the existing law except in the situation where the police enter premises to deal with, or to prevent, a breach of the peace.  Therefore subsection (5) abolished all the police officers' common law powers of entry for the purpose of arresting persons, except in the case of breach of the peace (subsection (6)).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109. Since section 17(5) occurs within this very particular context, it is plain that it was intended to abolish only the common law powers relating to entry for the purpose of arrest.  The subsection was not intended to affect the common law relating to searches for evidence carried out when someone has been arrested.  Indeed Parliament only turns to deal with these kinds of search in section 18 ("Entry and search after arrest") and, as I have discussed, comes back to the topic in section 32 ("Search upon arrest").  As Miss Montgomery readily acknowledged, neither of these sections, nor indeed section 19, contains any provision to abolish the pre-existing common law on such searches.  The contrast with section 17(5), abolishing the common law rules on entry and search "for purpose of arrest", points up the significance of the absence of any equivalent provision abolishing the common law rules in the case of search "after" or "upon" arrest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110. Since neither section 17(5) nor any other provision abolishes the common law powers of search on or after arrest, Miss Montgomery's argument must fail.  These common law powers remain available in cases, such as extradition cases, where the new statutory powers do not apply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111. Brooke LJ was concerned (para 51) that, if this were the position:</p>
<p></p><ul>"then an unnoticed common law power of search would have survived the coming into force of PACE but would not have attached to it any of the disciplines created by section 18 of PACE or PACE Code of Practice B…".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not entirely clear to me why the common law power that Parliament has chosen not to abolish should be described as "unnoticed".  But, in any event, concern about the continued existence of this common law power would be justified only if in enacting PACE Parliament had intended to make a general statement of the law relating to search which was to be applied whenever an arrest was carried out in England or Wales.  There is no reason to suppose Parliament had any such intention.  The Green Paper on Extradition (February 1985) presented to Parliament by the Home Secretary after the enactment of PACE certainly gave no hint that the responsible minister thought that the Act had in any way changed the law in relation to searches on arrests by virtue of an extradition warrant.  Moreover, the respondent's own argument that sections 18 and 19 do not apply to such arrests - which the Administrative Court rightly accepted - shows that Parliament entertained no such far-reaching ambition.  Parliament's aim was more modest:  it was concerned to regulate such matters in relation to offences that were likely to be tried in England and Wales.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112. Consistently with that approach, a few years later Parliament enacted the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, Part X of which dealt with cross-border enforcement of police powers.  Under section 136(2)(a) of the 1994 Act, an arrest warrant issued in Scotland can be executed in England or Wales either by a local constable or by a constable from a Scottish force.  In either event, the constable executing the warrant has the same powers and duties, and the arrested person has the same rights, as they would have had if the warrant had been executed by a constable from a Scottish force in Scotland (subsection (5)(b)).  In other words the constable will have the powers of search routinely granted by Scottish sheriffs when granting an arrest warrant.  By contrast, where an English arrest warrant is executed in Scotland or Northern Ireland, the arresting officer has powers of search under section 139 which are similar to those conferred by PACE.  Clearly, Parliament accepted that, where the trial is likely to be in Scotland, someone can be arrested in England on a Scottish warrant and subjected to a search which has none of the safeguards of PACE or of the PACE codes of conduct but only the safeguards of the common law of Scotland.  There is no reason to believe that Parliament would not also have accepted that, where the offence was likely to be tried abroad, someone could be arrested in England and, in the matter of search, enjoy not the safeguards of PACE and of the PACE codes of conduct but only the safeguards of the common law of England.</p>
