<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not hard to see that, if an objection of the kind that was raised on the second day of the trial in <i>Remli</i> were to be raised during the trial in an English court and ignored by the trial judge, there would be grounds for saying that the article 6(1) guarantee had been breached.  The facts of that case, however, offer no guidance as to what should be done when the issue is raised for the first time when the trial is over - when the verdict has been delivered and all the jurors have assented to it.  It is worth noting also that in <i>Remli</i> it was a third party who overheard the remark before the trial began, and that the reason given by the judges for refusing to deal with it - namely that the words were spoken before the first hearing in the case and not in the presence of the judges of the court (see p 257, para 12) - is not one to which any weight would be attached by any court in this country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court's decisions in <i>Gregory </i>and <i>Sander</i> do not sit easily with each other on the facts, for the reasons that Sir Nicolas Bratza explained in his dissenting opinion in <i>Sander</i>; see also Professor Michael Zander, "The Complaining Juror" (2000) 150 NLJ 723.  But they do have this in common, that they were both dealing with the way the judge should react to such allegations when they are made during the trial and the jury has not yet returned its verdict.  One must start with the proposition that a tribunal is presumed to be impartial until there is proof to the contrary: <i>Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v Belgium</i> (1981)  4 EHRR 1, 21, para 58;  <i>Remli v France</i> (1996)  22 EHRR 253, 262, para 38 in the opinion of the Commission; <i>Sander v United Kingdom</i> (2000)  31 EHRR 1003,1008, para 25.  If this is disputed the court is in a position at that stage to investigate the matter (unimpeded, as I have said, by the provisions of section 8(1) of the Contempt of Court Act 1981) and to deal with the allegations as the situation may require.  The cases do not answer the question how the court should react when the allegations are made after the trial is over when, it must be remembered, the presumption of impartiality still applies.  But some guidance is provided by the emphasis which the decisions place on the principle of public confidence and on the Court's recognition of the crucial and legitimate role that is played in English law by the rule of secrecy.</p>
<i><p><i>The rationale</i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113.&nbsp;&nbsp;On one view these two points may be thought to pull in different directions.  Confidence in the system would be undermined, it may be said, if the allegations cannot be investigated.  That was the basis for Mr Fitzgerald's submission that, in order to give effect to the article 6(1) Convention right, a court faced with allegations of the kind that were made in those cases should ask itself two questions: (1) is the allegation capable of belief, and (2) does it cast doubt on the safety of the conviction.  On the other hand, the jury seems to enjoy the considerable confidence of the public and to return verdicts that are generally deemed to be reasonable: <i>Baldwin and McConville,</i> <i>Jury Trials</i>, p 134.  In the Supreme Court of Canada, in <i>R v G (RM)</i> [1996]  3 SCR 362, 374, para 13, Cory J said that he thought that the reliance that is placed on jury verdicts flows from public awareness that twelve members of the community have worked together to reach a unanimous verdict.  The same point can be made in those jurisdictions, like England and Wales, which accept verdicts by a majority.  It is the process of collective decision making, during which the jurors are free from outside interference and after which they are protected from ridicule, criticism and harassment, that gives it its strength.  That, too, is the experience in Scotland: see <i>McCadden v H M Advocate</i> 1985  JC 98;  <i>Russell v H M Advocate</i> 1991  JC 194.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>R v Pan</i> [2001]  2 SCR 344, another decision of the Supreme of Canada, at pp 373-374 Arbour J reviewed the competing rationales for the jury secrecy rule.  She did not regard finality, standing alone, as convincing.  But she took a different view of the need for full and frank debate and the need to protect jurors from censure, reprisals and harassment.  At p 373 she said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The first reason supporting the need for secrecy is that confidentiality promotes candour and the kind of full and frank debate that is essential to this type of collegial decision making.  While searching for unanimity, jurors should be free to explore out loud all avenues of reasoning without fear of exposure to public ridicule, contempt or hatred.  This rationale is of vital importance to the potential acquittal of an unpopular accused, or one charged with a particularly repulsive crime.  In my view, this rationale is sound, and does not require empirical confirmation."<p></p></ul>
<p>At p 374 she said that the proper functioning of the jury system depends on the willingness of jurors to discharge their duties honestly and honourably, which depends in turn on a system that ensures the safety of jurors - their sense of security, as well as their privacy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115.&nbsp;&nbsp;These observations take us to the heart of the matter.  The appeals raise questions about a rule which makes it impossible, after a guilty verdict has been returned, to investigate allegations that the jurors were biased or that they ignored directions by the trial judge.  But the rigour of the secrecy rule operates, and is designed to operate, in exactly the same way if the verdict is one of not guilty.  A defendant does not need to invoke his article 6(1) right where he has been acquitted.  But the rule protects jurors who acquit the unpopular, such as members of minority groups, or who acquit those accused of crimes that the public regards as repulsive, such as the abuse of children who were in their care.  It protects them too against pressure that might otherwise be brought to bear, in less enlightened times, by the executive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an important safeguard against biased verdicts.  One cannot have a rule that operates in one way where the jury acquits but operates differently where they convict.  Full and frank discussion, in the course of which prejudices may indeed be aired but then rejected when it comes to the moment of decision-taking, would be inhibited if everything that might give rise to allegations of prejudice after the verdict is delivered were to be opened up to scrutiny.  Attempts to soften the rule to serve the interests of those who claim that they were unfairly convicted should be resisted in the general public interest, if jurors are to continue to perform their vital function of safeguarding the liberty of every individual.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117.&nbsp;&nbsp;The case for wishing to soften the rule is easy to state.  No-one has done it better than my noble and learned friend Lord Steyn.  As he says, the position which the majority feel compelled to adopt is an austere one.  But the alternative which he suggests does not seem to me to answer the problem that he seeks to solve.  The examples with which he begins assume, as he explains later, that the allegations which the juror makes are the subject of cogent and compelling evidence.  His conclusion in Mirza's case is that the juror's letter provides that evidence.  Taking the letter simply at its face value, without further inquiry (for there has been no inquiry in Mirza's case), he holds that there are sufficient grounds for holding that there is a real risk that the jury in that case reached their verdict on perverse grounds which included a pronounced racial element.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118.&nbsp;&nbsp;If this approach is sound, it will be unnecessary for any of the jurors to be interviewed.  All the court need do is examine the letter.  It need only ask itself whether it contains a cogent and compelling allegation demonstrating a real risk that the jury was not impartial.  If the allegation measures up to that standard, the verdict will be set aside.  It is a simple solution but, to my mind, is unacceptable.  An allegation, however articulate it may be and however provocative, is no more than an allegation.  It cannot be assumed that the facts it alleges are true.  If that were so, every verdict would be at the mercy of the malicious and the unscrupulous.  At the very least the allegation must be checked to see whether there are good grounds for believing that what is alleged to have happened really did happen.  How else can one assess whether it provides cogent and compelling evidence?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119.&nbsp;&nbsp;So there must be an inquiry.  But as soon as one reaches that stage, the rule of secrecy has to be breached.  One letter alleging that racist remarks were made, for example, will be enough.  Lord Steyn's first example shows the kind of language that will make that course inevitable.  If that is so, the chance that a letter in such terms may be sent will be present every case.  The writer of the letter will need to be interviewed.  So too will those against whom the allegation is made, if the court is to decide whether the allegation is genuine.  All jurors will know that they are exposed to the risk of being questioned about what they said and heard during their deliberations in private in the jury room.</p>
<i>
<p>Whether the rule should be modified</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>R v Pan</i> [2001]  2 SCR 344 the Supreme Court of Canada drew a distinction between (a) statements made, opinions expressed, arguments advanced and votes cast by members of a jury in the course of their deliberations, which were held to be inadmissible and (b) evidence of facts, statements or events extrinsic to the deliberation process, whether originating from a juror or a third party, that may have tainted the verdict, which were held not to be inadmissible under the common law rule: p 386.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121.&nbsp;&nbsp;The New Zealand Law Commission, in section 77 of the draft Evidence Code in their 55th Report, <i>Evidence </i>(1999), proposed a provision in these terms:</p>
<p></p><ul>"A person cannot give evidence about the deliberations of a jury concerning the substance of a proceeding except in so far as that evidence tends to establish that a juror has acted in breach of the juror's duty."<p></p></ul>
<p>It was explained that the intention was to do away with the distinction made in the common law that depends on whether the impropriety occurred within or outside the jury room.  In Preliminary Paper 37, <i>Juries in Criminal Trials</i> (1999), vol 1, Part 2, paras 270 and 276, the Commission repeated this proposal for reform.  The proposal is not mentioned in their 69th Report, <i>Juries in Criminal Trials</i> (2001).  But the Commission say in para 454 that any attempt at legislation in this area must proceed very carefully because of the potential for anomalies and difficulties of the kind illustrated by <i>R v Young (Stephen)</i> [1995]  QB 324.   In para 455 they observe that, although section 8 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 is aimed at stopping newspapers in the United Kingdom publishing interviews with jurors, it operates undesirably to block the investigation of gross misbehaviour of a type that makes a conviction unsafe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, for my part, not wish to adopt either the Canadian model or the wording in the draft Criminal Code that has been proposed for New Zealand as they seem to me to relax the common law rule too much and to risk creating uncertainty.  I would place much greater emphasis on the need for a clear and precise rule.  It is worth noting the point made in <i>Summing-up to Juries in Criminal Cases - What Jury Research says about Current Rules and Practice</i> [2003] Crim L R 665, 689, by William Young, a Judge of the High Court of New Zealand, that isolated instances of jury misconduct or perversity should not be taken as the norm.  As he has said, it is right to recognise that juries are generally diligent and, if given the right assistance, are usually collectively willing and able to determine cases on the evidence and in accordance with the law as laid down by the trial judge.  The risk of perversity cannot be entirely eliminated.  But the balance of advantage lies firmly in favour of preserving the common law rule as a proportionate response to the needs of the jury system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be inclined to make only one modification to the rule that distinguishes, after the verdict has been delivered, between things which are intrinsic to the deliberation process and those which are extrinsic to it.  Article 6(1) of the Convention requires that the common law rule be scrutinised carefully, to ensure that it is compatible with the right to a fair trial.  So it is arguable that an allegation that the jury as a whole declined to deliberate at all, but decided the case by other means such as drawing lots or by the toss of a coin, can be placed into a different category.  Conduct of that kind, were it ever to occur, would amount to a complete repudiation by the jury of their only function which, as the juror's oath puts it, is to give a true verdict according to the evidence.  A trial which results in a verdict by lot or the toss of a coin, or was reached by consulting an ouija board in the jury room, is not a trial at all.  If that is what happened, the jurors have no need to be protected as the verdict was not reached by deliberation - that is, by discussing and debating the issues in the case and arriving at a decision collectively in the light of that discussion.  The law would be unduly hampered if the court were to be unable to intervene in such a case and order a new trial.  But that is not the situation which is before us in these appeals.</p>
<i><p><i></i></p>
<p><i>Improvements in practice</i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;124.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I would make no changes to the common law rule that the deliberations of the jury must remain confidential, I suggest that consideration should be given to making two refinements to current practice with a view to strengthening the system of jury trial and retaining public confidence.  I would also respectfully endorse the points made by my noble and learned friend Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough, and I agree with him that the implications of the opinions delivered in this case should be considered by the Judicial Studies Board.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first refinement relates to the advice which is given to jurors before they are empanelled and enter the jury box.  The current practice in all courts in England and Wales is for them to be shown a video which tells them how they were selected, what happens in court and how to perform their role as jurors.  They are told, amongst other things, that they should tell the court usher immediately if anyone outside the jury approaches them about the case or tries to influence them about it and to talk to a member of the court staff if they have any queries about any aspect of their jury service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;126.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no mention, however, of the point made by the Criminal Law Revision Committee in its 10th Report, <i>Secrecy of Jury Room</i>, para 10, that jurors are under a duty to inform the court at once of any irregularity which occurs during their deliberations.  If that step is taken before the verdict is given the matter can, of course, be considered, investigated and dealt with by the trial judge: <i>Archbold: Criminal Pleading, Evidence &amp; Practice</i> (2003), para 4-254.  If the step is not taken until after the verdict has been given, it may be too late for the court to do anything about it.  In practice jurors do from time to time draw such matters to the attention of the court during the trial.  The cases of <i>Gregory v United Kingdom</i> (1997)  25 EHRR 577 and <i>Sander v United Kingdom</i> (2000)  31 EHRR 1003 illustrate this point.  But this does not always happen, as the events that occurred in the case of the appeals which are before the House demonstrate.  The system would be strengthened if jurors were told before the trial begins that they are under a duty to inform the court at once of any irregularity which occurs while they are deliberating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;127.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second refinement relates to the information which is provided to the Court of Appeal by the trial court.  In <i>R v Papadopoulos</i> [1979]  1 NZLR 621 the Court of Appeal in New Zealand had the benefit of a report from the trial judge made under rule 22 of the Criminal Appeal Rules 1946.  The court had requested this, on the application of counsel for the Crown, because of the nature of some of the grounds of appeal and some of the allegations in the juror's affidavit: see p 623, lines 11-14.  It is standard practice in Scotland for reports to be provided by trial judges for the assistance of the appeal court: see Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995, section 113; <i>Renton &amp;</i> <i>Brown's:</i> <i>Criminal Procedure</i>, 6th ed, para 30-27.  These provisions enable the appeal court in those jurisdictions to make use of the fact that the judge who presided over the trial, and had the advantage of being able to observe the jury as the trial progressed, is in a good position to tell the appeal court if there were any signs of irregularity while the jurors were in the jury box.  Sir Nicolas Bratza placed considerable weight on this point in his dissenting opinion in <i>Sander</i>, p 1015, para O-II14.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;128.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 87(4) of the Supreme Court Act 1981 provides that Criminal Appeal Rules may require courts from which an appeal lies to the criminal division of the Court of Appeal to furnish that division with any information or assistance which it may request for the purpose of exercising its jurisdiction.  Requests to the court of trial for such information or assistance may be communicated by the registrar: see rule 22 of the Criminal Appeal Rules 1968 (SI 1968/1262).  These powers are wide enough to enable to the Court of Appeal to call for a report from the trial judge if it is alleged that there was an irregularity at the trial.  There will be no need for it to take that step if all the information that is required to deal with the allegation can be provided by members of the court staff.  But allegations of juror prejudice go to the heart of the question whether the defendant has received a fair trial.  To enable it to deal with them the Court of Appeal ought to be provided with as complete and accurate an account of the events of the trial as possible.   In that situation to call for a report by the trial judge would seem to be a step worth taking, to ensure that the allegations are subjected to the high degree of scrutiny that is needed to comply with the defendant's article 6 Convention right.</p>
<i><p><i></i></p>
<p><i>Conclusion</i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;129.&nbsp;&nbsp;The allegations which were made in each case relate to things said by jurors during their deliberations.  The common law rule which holds that after the verdict has been delivered evidence directed to matters intrinsic to the deliberations of jurors is inadmissible must be applied.  Viewing the proceedings as a whole, I do not think that it can be said that the appellants did not have a fair trial.  I would dismiss both appeals.</p>
<p><b>LORD HOBHOUSE OF WOODBOROUGH</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;130.&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue on these appeals necessitates that the discussion start with a restatement of some of the basic principles of English criminal justice:</p>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;A system of criminal law, including its enforcement by the state, is an essential component (and always has been) in the existence of a civilised society under the rule of law and the social contract between the state and the citizens.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The function of the criminal trial is to convict those whose guilt has been proved by the evidence adduced at the trial and to acquit those whose guilt has not been so proved.  <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the common law system of jury trial, all findings of fact are to be made by the jury and it is ultimately their decision whether to convict the defendant.  Special verdicts may not be asked for.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the evidence adduced does prove the defendant's guilt, it is the jury's duty and oath to return a verdict of 'guilty' and, where not, it is the jury's duty and oath to return a verdict of 'not guilty'.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;It is recognised that a jury has the ability ultimately to choose to acquit a defendant notwithstanding that his or her guilt has been proved and, on some occasions, juries have done so.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;A convicted defendant has the right, subject to a leave filter, to appeal and the Court of Appeal has the power and duty to quash the conviction whenever it considers that the conviction is for any reason unsafe; it is not confined to questions of law, it can review the evidence given at the trial and it has the power to entertain fresh evidence.  The Criminal Cases Review Commission has the power to investigate convictions alleged to have resulted from miscarriages of justice and refer the conviction appeal back to the Court of Appeal for further consideration. <p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;131.&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point it is necessary to make at the outset is that it is fundamentally wrong to use the phrase 'miscarriage of justice' selectively as if it only related to perverse convictions.  This presents a false picture.  Most miscarriages, including those referred to be my noble and learned friend Lord Steyn, occur because of some corruption of the evidence used by the prosecution to prove guilt.  Such corruptions may take many forms, <i>eg</i> non-disclosure of evidence or information favourable to the defence, undetected lies, undiscovered witnesses, partial or incompetent expert evidence.  None of these involve any failure of the jury system: the verdict returned was in accordance with the evidence adduced at the trial.  This leads on to the other reason why it presents a false picture: a perverse verdict of not guilty, whatever the reason for it, is also a miscarriage of justice.  The criminal justice system has failed to convict a person whose guilt has been proved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;132.&nbsp;&nbsp;The consequences of either type of miscarriage are different but equally serious.  A failure to convict a defendant whose guilt has been proved is a breach of the social contract between the State and its citizens.  It is a failure of the state to provide to citizens the protection to which they are entitled against the criminal activities of others.  It leads to a failure of public confidence in the justice system and the ability of the state to maintain "the Queen's peace".  It encourages vigilantes.  It encourages intimidation and discourages witnesses from giving evidence.  These are, to coin a phrase, 'clear and present dangers'.  In simple Human Rights terms, they are a breach of the victims' human rights: Article 8 and the First Protocol Article 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;133.&nbsp;&nbsp;The conviction of an innocent defendant is likewise serious and a breach of the defendant's social contract with the state.  It results in the defendant being publicly stigmatised and being subject to a criminal sanction which may be as serious as life imprisonment.  The defendant is right to be aggrieved but the Human Rights Convention does not guarantee to him that this will never occur.  Article 5.1(a) of the Convention permits imprisonment after a conviction by a competent court.  Article 6 gives a person charged with a criminal offence certain rights but, provided that these requirements are met, it does not give him a human right only to be convicted if he is in fact guilty.  The reason is obvious: it would make every conviction before a municipal court provisional and require that every contested charge be re-tried before a Human Rights court or courts (no less fallible and no better placed than the original trial court).  In any human system mistakes and errors are bound to occur from time to time.  The remedy is to have a review procedure before an appellate court which, among other things, objectively reviews whether the evidence sufficed to prove the appellant's guilt.  English law provides such a procedure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;134.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was accepted by counsel before your Lordships that whatever answer was given to the certified questions would have to apply where the defendant was acquitted as much as to where the defendant was convicted.  The questions have only achieved their current special significance since the introduction of majority verdicts.  Before that the jury had to be unanimous and a dissenting juror could always get his or her way by declining to agree the verdict wanted by the others.  Since the only persons allowed into the jury room were the jurors themselves, only the jurors would know what course their deliberations and discussions had taken.  It could only be some blatant misconduct externally observable which could give rise to a report by someone else or something occurring when they were not deliberating and not in the jury room (as was the case in the more modern <i>R v Young</i> [1995] QB 324).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;135.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since majority verdicts were permitted by s.17 of the Juries Act 1974, a different situation has existed.  Your Lordships were informed that, on average, about 20% of all convictions after a trial on indictment result from majority verdicts.  (No corresponding figures are available for acquittals since, when, after a majority direction, a jury returns a verdict of not guilty, the jury are not asked whether it was unanimous or by a majority.)  It follows that in 20% of conviction cases there will be one or more jurors whose views and arguments have not been accepted by the majority.  This is inevitably a fertile scenario for a dissident juror, maybe honestly, maybe not, to claim that the majority disregarded or misunderstood the judge's direction, did not understand the facts, were not prepared to listen to argument or were prejudiced in some way.  It must also be commented that it is often possible by watching the individual jurors when they return to court to tell which the dissenter(s) is/are, thus rendering them liable to be covertly approached by those with an interest in upsetting the verdict.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;136.&nbsp;&nbsp;The letters written by the dissenting jurors in the cases which have given rise to these appeals illustrate the type of complaints likely to be received if these appeals are allowed.  In the case of <i>Mirza</i> the issue for the jury was essentially one of credibility, whether the jury preferred the evidence of the defendant or that of the complainant whom he was alleged to have indecently assaulted over a number of years.  She was 17 years old at the time of the trial.  The jury retired and, after having returned to court and being given a direction on majority verdicts (of which no criticism is made), retired again and later returned with majority guilty verdicts, the majority being 10 to 2.  The juror's undated letter, written after the conclusion of the trial and the discharge and dispersal of the jury, to Mirza's counsel contains some telling phrases - "I was the only juror with any insight into the defendant's culture" - "I still do not understand the [majority's] theory myself, there was no apparent logic behind it, but bigots do not need logic" - "The bigots had decided that the case brought by the prosecution was not good enough for them, so they embellished it."  These remarks are more indicative of an animus of the juror against her colleagues than of providing significant evidence of a mistrial.  The jury had earlier, during the course of the trial, shown suspicion of Mirza for giving his evidence through an interpreter.  Both counsel had agreed a statement saying that it was normal for a defendant whose first language was not English to use an interpreter when faced with a serious criminal charge and the judge gave the jury a careful and sufficient warning and direction on the point of which, again, no criticism is made.  However the credibility of Mirza's evidence remained solely a question for the jury and the majority of jurors clearly did not believe him. </p>
