<p><b>LORD BINGHAM OF CORNHILL</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. I have had the great advantage of reading in draft the opinions prepared by each of my noble and learned friends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The transactions which give rise to these appeals are commonplace but of great social and economic importance.  It is important that a wife (or anyone in a like position) should not charge her interest in the matrimonial home to secure the borrowing of her husband (or anyone in a like position) without fully understanding the nature and effect of the proposed transaction and that the decision is hers, to agree or not to agree.  It is important that lenders should feel able to advance money, in run-of-the-mill cases with no abnormal features, on the security of the wife's interest in the matrimonial home in reasonable confidence that, if appropriate procedures have been followed in obtaining the security, it will be enforceable if the need for enforcement arises.  The law must afford both parties a measure of protection.  It cannot prescribe a code which will be proof against error, misunderstanding or mishap.  But it can indicate minimum requirements which, if met, will reduce the risk of error, misunderstanding or mishap to an acceptable level.  The paramount need in this important field is that these minimum requirements should be clear, simple and practically operable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. My Lords, in my respectful opinion these minimum requirements are clearly identified in the opinions of my noble and learned friends Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead and Lord Scott of Foscote.  If these requirements are met the risk that a wife has been misled by her husband as to the facts of a proposed transaction should be eliminated or virtually so.  The risk that a wife has been overborne or coerced by her husband will not be eliminated but will be reduced to a level which makes it proper for the lender to proceed.  While the opinions of Lord Nicholls and Lord Scott show some difference of expression and approach, I do not myself discern any significant difference of legal principle applicable to these cases, and I agree with both opinions.  But if I am wrong and such differences exist, it is plain that the opinion of Lord Nicholls commands the unqualified support of all members of the House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. In agreement with all members of the House, I would allow the appeals of Mrs Wallace, Mrs Bennett and Desmond Banks &amp; Co and dismiss those of Mrs Etridge and Mrs Gill, in each case for the reasons given by Lord Scott.  I would allow the appeal of Mrs Harris, bearing in mind that this is an interlocutory case, for the reasons given by Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough.  I would allow the appeal of Mrs Moore and dismiss that of Mrs Coleman, in each case for the reasons given by Lord Scott.</p>
<p><b>LORD NICHOLLS OF BIRKENHEAD</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Before your Lordships' House are appeals in eight cases.  Each case arises out of a transaction in which a wife charged her interest in her home in favour of a bank as security for her husband's indebtedness or the indebtedness of a company through which he carried on business.  The wife later asserted she signed the charge under the undue influence of her husband.  In <i>Barclays Bank Plc v O'Brien</i> [1994]  1 AC 180 your Lordships enunciated the principles applicable in this type of case.  Since then, many cases have come before the courts, testing the implications of the <i>O'Brien</i> decision in a variety of different factual situations.  Seven of the present appeals are of this character.  In each case the bank sought to enforce the charge signed by the wife.  The bank claimed an order for possession of the matrimonial home.  The wife raised a defence that the bank was on notice that her concurrence in the transaction had been procured by her husband's undue influence.  The eighth appeal concerns a claim by a wife for damages from a solicitor who advised her before she entered into a guarantee obligation of this character.<i></i></p><i>
</i>
<i><p>Undue influence</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. The issues raised by these appeals make it necessary to go back to first principles.  Undue influence is one of the grounds of relief developed by the courts of equity as a court of conscience.  The objective is to ensure that the influence of one person over another is not abused.  In everyday life people constantly seek to influence the decisions of others.  They seek to persuade those with whom they are dealing to enter into transactions, whether great or small.  The law has set limits to the means properly employable for this purpose.  To this end the common law developed a principle of duress.  Originally this was narrow in its scope, restricted to the more blatant forms of physical coercion, such as personal violence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Here, as elsewhere in the law, equity supplemented the common law.  Equity extended the reach of the law to other unacceptable forms of persuasion.  The law will investigate the manner in which the intention to enter into the transaction was secured: 'how the intention was produced', in the oft repeated words of Lord Eldon LC, from as long ago as 1807 (<i>Huguenin v Baseley</i> 14 Ves 273, 300).  If the intention was produced by an unacceptable means, the law will not permit the transaction to stand.  The means used is regarded as an exercise of improper or 'undue' influence, and hence unacceptable, whenever the consent thus procured ought not fairly to be treated as the expression of a person's free will.  It is impossible to be more precise or definitive.  The circumstances in which one person acquires influence over another, and the manner in which influence may be exercised, vary too widely to permit of any more specific criterion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Equity identified broadly two forms of unacceptable conduct.  The first comprises overt acts of improper pressure or coercion such as unlawful threats.  Today there is much overlap with the principle of duress as this principle has subsequently developed.  The second form arises out of a relationship between two persons where one has acquired over another a measure of influence, or ascendancy, of which the ascendant person then takes unfair advantage.  An example from the 19th century, when much of this law developed, is a case where an impoverished father prevailed upon his inexperienced children to charge their reversionary interests under their parents' marriage settlement with payment of his mortgage debts: see <i>Bainbrigge v Browne</i> (1881)  18 Ch D 188.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. In cases of this latter nature the influence one person has over another provides scope for misuse without any specific overt acts of persuasion.  The relationship between two individuals may be such that, without more, one of them is disposed to agree a course of action proposed by the other.  Typically this occurs when one person places trust in another to look after his affairs and interests, and the latter betrays this trust by preferring his own interests.  He abuses the influence he has acquired.  In <i>Allcard v Skinner</i> (1887)  36 Ch D 145, a case well known to every law student, Lindley LJ, at p 181, described this class of cases as those in which it was the duty of one party to advise the other or to manage his property for him.  In <i>Zamet v Hyman</i> [1961]  1 WLR 1442, 1444-1445 Lord Evershed MR referred to relationships where one party owed the other an obligation of candour and protection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. The law has long recognised the need to prevent abuse of influence in these 'relationship' cases despite the absence of evidence of overt acts of persuasive conduct.  The types of relationship, such as parent and child, in which this principle falls to be applied cannot be listed exhaustively.  Relationships are infinitely various.  Sir Guenter Treitel QC has rightly noted that the question is whether one party has reposed sufficient trust and confidence in the other, rather than whether the relationship between the parties belongs to a particular type: see <i>Treitel, The Law of Contract</i>, 10th ed (1999), pp 380-381.  For example, the relation of banker and customer will not normally meet this criterion, but exceptionally it may: see <i>National Westminster Bank Plc v Morgan</i> [1985]  AC 686, 707-709.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. Even this test is not comprehensive.  The principle is not confined to cases of abuse of trust and confidence.  It also includes, for instance, cases where a vulnerable person has been exploited.  Indeed, there is no single touchstone for determining whether the principle is applicable. Several expressions have been used in an endeavour to encapsulate the essence: trust and confidence, reliance, dependence or vulnerability on the one hand and ascendancy, domination or control on the other.  None of these descriptions is perfect.  None is all embracing.  Each has its proper place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. In <i>CIBC Mortgages Plc v Pitt</i> [1994]  1 AC 200 your Lordships' House decided that in cases of undue influence disadvantage is not a necessary ingredient of the cause of action.  It is not essential that the transaction should be disadvantageous to the pressurised or influenced person, either in financial terms or in any other way. However, in the nature of things, questions of undue influence will not usually arise, and the exercise of undue influence is unlikely to occur, where the transaction is innocuous.  The issue is likely to arise only when, in some respect, the transaction was disadvantageous either from the outset or as matters turned out.</p>
<i><p>Burden of proof and presumptions</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. Whether a transaction was brought about by the exercise of undue influence is a question of fact.  Here, as elsewhere, the general principle is that he who asserts a wrong has been committed must prove it.  The burden of proving an allegation of undue influence rests upon the person who claims to have been wronged.  This is the general rule.  The evidence required to discharge the burden of proof depends on the nature of the alleged undue influence, the personality of the parties, their relationship, the extent to which the transaction cannot readily be accounted for by the ordinary motives of ordinary persons in that relationship, and all the circumstances of the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. Proof that the complainant placed trust and confidence in the other party in relation to the management of the complainant's financial affairs, coupled with a transaction which calls for explanation, will normally be sufficient, failing satisfactory evidence to the contrary, to discharge the burden of proof.  On proof of these two matters the stage is set for the court to infer that, in the absence of a satisfactory explanation, the transaction can only have been procured by undue influence.  In other words, proof of these two facts is prima facie evidence that the defendant abused the influence he acquired in the parties' relationship.  He preferred his own interests.  He did not behave fairly to the other.  So the evidential burden then shifts to him.  It is for him to produce evidence to counter the inference which otherwise should be drawn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. The case of <i>Bainbrigge v Browne</i>, 18 Ch D 188, already mentioned, provides a good illustration of this commonplace type of forensic exercise.  Fry J held, at p 196, that there was no direct evidence upon which he could rely as proving undue pressure by the father.  But there existed circumstances 'from which the court will infer pressure and undue influence.'  None of the children were entirely emancipated from their father's control.  None seemed conversant with business.  These circumstances were such as to cast the burden of proof upon the father.  He had made no attempt to discharge that burden.  He did not appear in court at all.  So the children's claim succeeded.  Again, more recently, in <i>National Westminster Bank Plc v Morgan</i> [1985]  AC 686, 707, Lord Scarman noted that a relationship of banker and customer may become one in which a banker acquires a dominating influence.  If he does, and a manifestly disadvantageous transaction is proved, 'there would then be room' for a court to presume that it resulted from the exercise of undue influence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. Generations of equity lawyers have conventionally described this situation as one in which a presumption of undue influence arises.  This use of the term 'presumption' is descriptive of a shift in the evidential onus on a question of fact.  When a plaintiff succeeds by this route he does so because he has succeeded in establishing a case of undue influence.  The court has drawn appropriate inferences of fact upon a balanced consideration of the whole of the evidence at the end of a trial in which the burden of proof rested upon the plaintiff.  The use, in the course of the trial, of the forensic tool of a shift in the evidential burden of proof should not be permitted to obscure the overall position.  These cases are the equitable counterpart of common law cases where the principle of res ipsa loquitur is invoked.  There is a rebuttable evidential presumption of undue influence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. The availability of this forensic tool in cases founded on abuse of influence arising from the parties' relationship has led to this type of case sometimes being labelled 'presumed undue influence'.  This is by way of contrast with cases involving actual pressure or the like, which are labelled 'actual undue influence': see <i>Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA v Aboody</i> [1990]  I QB 923, 953, and <i>Royal Bank of Scotland Plc v Etridge (No 2)</i> [1998]  4 All ER 705, 711-712, paras 5-7.  This usage can be a little confusing.  In many cases where a plaintiff has claimed that the defendant abused the influence he acquired in a relationship of trust and confidence the plaintiff has succeeded by recourse to the rebuttable evidential presumption.  But this need not be so.  Such a plaintiff may succeed even where this presumption is not available to him;  for instance, where the impugned transaction was not one which called for an explanation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. The evidential presumption discussed above is to be distinguished sharply from a different form of presumption which arises in some cases.  The law has adopted a sternly protective attitude towards certain types of relationship in which one party acquires influence over another who is vulnerable and dependent and where, moreover, substantial gifts by the influenced or vulnerable person are not normally to be expected.  Examples of relationships within this special class are parent and child, guardian and ward, trustee and beneficiary, solicitor and client, and medical adviser and patient.  In these cases the law presumes, irrebuttably, that one party had influence over the other.  The complainant need not prove he actually reposed trust and confidence in the other party.  It is sufficient for him to prove the existence of the type of relationship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. It is now well established that husband and wife is not one of the relationships to which this latter principle applies.  In <i>Yerkey v Jones</i> (1939)  63 CLR 649, 675 Dixon J explained the reason.  The Court of Chancery was not blind to the opportunities of obtaining and unfairly using influence over a wife which a husband often possesses.  But there is nothing unusual or strange in a wife, from motives of affection or for other reasons, conferring substantial financial benefits on her husband.  Although there is no presumption, the court will nevertheless note, as a matter of fact, the opportunities for abuse which flow from a wife's confidence in her husband.  The court will take this into account with all the other evidence in the case.  Where there is evidence that a husband has taken unfair advantage of his influence over his wife, or her confidence in him, 'it is not difficult for the wife to establish her title to relief': see <i>In re Lloyds Bank Ltd, Bomze v Bomze</i> [1931]  1 Ch 289, at p 302, per Maugham J.</p>
<i><p>Independent advice</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20. Proof that the complainant received advice from a third party before entering into the impugned transaction is one of the matters a court takes into account when weighing all the evidence.  The weight, or importance, to be attached to such advice depends on all the circumstances.  In the normal course, advice from a solicitor or other outside adviser can be expected to bring home to a complainant a proper understanding of what he or she is about to do.  But a person may understand fully the implications of a proposed transaction, for instance, a substantial gift, and yet still be acting under the undue influence of another.  Proof of outside advice does not, of itself, necessarily show that the subsequent completion of the transaction was free from the exercise of undue influence.  Whether it will be proper to infer that outside advice had an emancipating effect, so that the transaction was not brought about by the exercise of undue influence, is a question of fact to be decided having regard to all the evidence in the case.</p>
<i><p>Manifest disadvantage</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21. As already noted, there are two prerequisites to the evidential shift in the burden of proof from the complainant to the other party.  First, that the complainant reposed trust and confidence in the other party, or the other party acquired ascendancy over the complainant.  Second, that the transaction is not readily explicable by the relationship of the parties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22. Lindley LJ summarised this second prerequisite in the leading authority of <i>Allcard v Skinner,</i> 36 Ch D 145, where the donor parted with almost all her property.  Lindley LJ pointed out that where a gift of a small amount is made to a person standing in a confidential relationship to the donor, some proof of the exercise of the influence of the donee must be given.  The mere existence of the influence is not enough.  He continued, at p 185:</p>
<p></p><ul>'But if the gift is so large as not to be reasonably accounted for on the ground of friendship, relationship, charity, or other ordinary motives on which ordinary men act, the burden is upon the donee to support the gift.'<p></p></ul>
<p>In <i>Bank of Montreal v Stuart</i> [1911]  AC 120, 137 Lord Macnaghten used the phrase 'immoderate and irrational' to describe this concept.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23. The need for this second prerequisite has recently been questioned: see Nourse LJ in <i>Barclays Bank Plc v Coleman</i> [2001]  QB, 20, 30-32, one of the cases under appeal before your Lordships' House.  Mr Sher QC invited your Lordships to depart from the decision of the House on this point in <i>National Westminster Bank Plc v Morgan</i> [1985]  AC 686. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24. My Lords, this is not an invitation I would accept.  The second prerequisite, as expressed by Lindley LJ, is good sense.  It is a necessary limitation upon the width of the first prerequisite.  It would be absurd for the law to presume that every gift by a child to a parent, or every transaction between a client and his solicitor or between a patient and his doctor, was brought about by undue influence unless the contrary is affirmatively proved.  Such a presumption would be too far-reaching.  The law would out of touch with everyday life if the presumption were to apply to every Christmas or birthday gift by a child to a parent, or to an agreement whereby a client or patient agrees to be responsible for the reasonable fees of his legal or medical adviser. The law would be rightly open to ridicule, for transactions such as these are unexceptionable.  They do not suggest that something may be amiss.  So something more is needed before the law reverses the burden of proof, something which calls for an explanation.  When that something more is present, the greater the disadvantage to the vulnerable person, the more cogent must be the explanation before the presumption will be regarded as rebutted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25. This was the approach adopted by Lord Scarman in <i>National Westminster Bank Plc v Morgan</i> [1985]  AC 686, 703-707.  He cited Lindley LJ's observations in <i>Allcard v Skinner</i>, 36 Ch D 145, 185, which I have set out above.  He noted that whatever the legal character of the transaction, it must constitute a disadvantage sufficiently serious to require evidence to rebut the presumption that in the circumstances of the parties' relationship, it was procured by the exercise of undue influence.  Lord Scarman concluded, at p 704:</p>
<p></p><ul>'The Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that the presumption of undue influence can arise from the evidence of the relationship of the parties without also evidence that the transaction itself was wrongful in that it constituted <i>an advantage taken of the person subjected to the influence which, failing proof to the contrary, was explicable only on the basis that undue influence had been exercised to procure it.</i>'  (Emphasis added)<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26. Lord Scarman attached the label 'manifest disadvantage' to this second ingredient necessary to raise the presumption.  This label has been causing difficulty.  It may be apt enough when applied to straightforward transactions such as a substantial gift or a sale at an undervalue.  But experience has now shown that this expression can give rise to misunderstanding.  The label is being understood and applied in a way which does not accord with the meaning intended by Lord Scarman, its originator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;27. The problem has arisen in the context of wives guaranteeing payment of their husband's business debts.  In recent years judge after judge has grappled with the baffling question whether a wife's guarantee of her husband's bank overdraft, together with a charge on her share of the matrimonial home, was a transaction manifestly to her disadvantage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28. In a narrow sense, such a transaction plainly ('manifestly') is disadvantageous to the wife.  She undertakes a serious financial obligation, and in return she personally receives nothing.  But that would be to take an unrealistically blinkered view of such a transaction.  Unlike the relationship of solicitor and client or medical adviser and patient, in the case of husband and wife there are inherent reasons why such a transaction may well be for her benefit.  Ordinarily, the fortunes of husband and wife are bound up together.  If the husband's business is the source of the family income, the wife has a lively interest in doing what she can to support the business.  A wife's affection and self-interest run hand-in-hand in inclining her to join with her husband in charging the matrimonial home, usually a jointly-owned asset, to obtain the financial facilities needed by the business.  The finance may be needed to start a new business, or expand a promising business, or rescue an ailing business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;29. Which, then, is the correct approach to adopt in deciding whether a transaction is disadvantageous to the wife: the narrow approach, or the wider approach?  The answer is neither.  The answer lies in discarding a label which gives rise to this sort of ambiguity.  The better approach is to adhere more directly to the test outlined by Lindley LJ in <i>Allcard v Skinner</i>, 36 Ch D 145, and adopted by Lord Scarman in <i>National Westminster Bank Plc v Morgan</i> [1985]  AC 686, in the passages I have cited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30. I return to husband and wife cases.  I do not think that, <i>in the ordinary course</i>, a guarantee of the character I have mentioned is to be regarded as a transaction which, failing proof to the contrary, is explicable only on the basis that it has been procured by the exercise of undue influence by the husband.  Wives frequently enter into such transactions.  There are good and sufficient reasons why they are willing to do so, despite the risks involved for them and their families.  They may be enthusiastic.  They may not.  They may be less optimistic than their husbands about the prospects of the husbands' businesses.  They may be anxious, perhaps exceedingly so.  But this is a far cry from saying that such transactions as a class are to be regarded as prima facie evidence of the exercise of undue influence by husbands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;31. I have emphasised the phrase 'in the ordinary course'.  There will be cases where a wife's signature of a guarantee or a charge of her share in the matrimonial home does call for explanation.  Nothing I have said above is directed at such a case. <i></i></p><i>
</i>
<i><p>A cautionary note</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32. I add a cautionary note, prompted by some of the first instance judgments in the cases currently being considered by the House.  It concerns the general approach to be adopted by a court when considering whether a wife's guarantee of her husband's bank overdraft was procured by her husband's undue influence.  Undue influence has a connotation of impropriety.  In the eye of the law, undue influence means that influence has been misused.  Statements or conduct by a husband which do not pass beyond the bounds of what may be expected of a reasonable husband in the circumstances should not, without more, be castigated as undue influence.  Similarly, when a husband is forecasting the future of his business, and expressing his hopes or fears, a degree of hyperbole may be only natural.  Courts should not too readily treat such exaggerations as misstatements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33. Inaccurate explanations of a proposed transaction are a different matter.  So are cases where a husband, in whom a wife has reposed trust and confidence for the management of their financial affairs, prefers his interests to hers and makes a choice for both of them on that footing.  Such a husband abuses the influence he has.  He fails to discharge the obligation of candour and fairness he owes a wife who is looking to him to make the major financial decisions.<i></i></p><i>

<i><p>The complainant and third parties: suretyship transactions</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;34. The problem considered in <i>O'Brien's</i> case and raised by the present appeals is of comparatively recent origin.  It arises out of the substantial growth in home ownership over the last 30 or 40 years and, as part of that development, the great increase in the number of homes owned jointly by husbands and wives.  More than two-thirds of householders in the United Kingdom now own their own homes.  For most home-owning couples, their homes are their most valuable asset.  They must surely be free, if they so wish, to use this asset as a means of raising money, whether for the purpose of the husband's business or for any other purpose.  Their home is their property.  The law should not restrict them in the use they may make of it.  Bank finance is in fact by far the most important source of external capital for small businesses with fewer than ten employees.  These businesses comprise about 95 percent of all businesses in the country, responsible for nearly one-third of all employment.  Finance raised by second mortgages on the principal's home is a significant source of capital for the start-up of small businesses.</p>
