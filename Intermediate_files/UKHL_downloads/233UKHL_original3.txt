      <strong>LORD RODGER OF EARLSFERRY </strong> 
      <p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;37.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the advantage of reading the speech of my noble and learned friend, Lord Steyn, in draft.  I agree with it and, accordingly, I too would allow the appeal.  I add only one short observation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;38.&nbsp;&nbsp;The decisions in <i>Elguzouli-Daf v Commissioner of Police </i>[1995] QB 335 and <i>Kumar v Commissioner for the Police of the Metropolis </i>31 January 1995, unreported, show, correctly in my view, that the Crown Prosecution Service and the police owe no duty of care to a defendant against whom they institute and maintain proceedings.  The reasons are general, but none the less persuasive.  The fact that no such legal duty of care exists does not mean, however, that a prosecutor or police officer should be anything other than scrupulous in considering the strengths and weaknesses of the case against the defendant.  On the contrary, at every stage they will be conscious that, if their decision is wrong, the defendant will be exposed to the risk of suffering substantial harm.  In that very real sense, the defendant's interests are always before them.  Prosecutors and police officers are therefore under an ethical and professional duty to act with due care.  Nevertheless, this duty does not translate into a legal duty of care to the defendant.  A fortiori, for the reasons given by Lord Steyn, police officers investigating crime do not owe witnesses the supposed legal duties of care alleged by the respondent.  But, as a matter of professional ethics, officers can be expected to treat witnesses with appropriate courtesy and consideration, and may be open to disciplinary proceedings if they do not.</p>
      <p><strong>LORD BROWN OF EATON-UNDER-HEYWOOD</strong></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;39.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the advantage of reading in draft the speech of my noble and learned friend, Lord Steyn.  I agree with it and for the reasons he gives I too would allow the Commissioner's appeal.</p>
