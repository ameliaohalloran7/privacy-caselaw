<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would dismiss the appeal and I would allow the cross-appeal.  For the reasons which I have already given, the interlocutor of the Extra Division of 18 December 2001 must be left standing so that the petitioner can appeal against that interlocutor if he is given leave.  The Second Division set aside that interlocutor as well as the interlocutor of the Extra Division of 20 December 2001.  So it will be necessary for your Lordships to set aside the Second Division's interlocutors of 11 September 2002.  I would remit the question whether the petitioner should be given leave to appeal to the House of Lords against the interlocutor of the Extra Division of 18 December 2001 to the Inner House of the Court of Session for further consideration in the exercise of the nobile officium.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Second Division pronounced two interlocutors on 1 October 2002 against which the respondents have also appealed.  They were concerned only with the question of expenses.  As the respondents were unsuccessful in their appeal and also in the cross appeal, I would not disturb those interlocutors.  The respondents must pay the costs which the petitioner has incurred in the proceedings before this House.</p>
LORD CULLEN OF WHITEKIRK
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the advantage of reading in draft the speeches of the noble and learned Lord Bingham of Cornhill and Lord Hope of Craighead.  For the reasons which they give, and with which I agree, I would dismiss the appeal, and in respect of the cross-appeal make the order proposed by Lord Hope of Craighead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would add a few observations of my own. In considering whether a fair-minded and informed observer would conclude that there was a real possibility that by reason of past words or conduct a judicial tribunal was unable to decide an issue impartially, it is necessary to consider the relationship between that issue and what happened in the past.  The members of the Second Division evidently were concerned principally with the view which Lord Hardie had expressed during the discussion of the proposed amendments to the Scotland Bill to which reference has been made.  Thus the Lord Justice Clerk at para 28 observed that in exercising his functions as Minister and legislator Lord Hardie did not simply promote an amendment to the 1947 Act that would extend to the Ministers in the devolved government the protection of section 21, leaving aside all questions as to the extent of that protection.  He then said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"He went further by committing himself to the view that under sec 21 the Crown was subject only to orders declaratory of the parties' rights and that the protection which he sought for the Scottish Ministers would therefore be such that they would not be subject to coercive orders of the courts.  That of course was the central issue before the Extra Division"<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80.&nbsp;&nbsp;It might be objected that the arguments before the Extra Division were not about whether the Scottish Ministers were in general immune from orders for specific performance: and that the main issue before that court was whether the expression "civil proceedings" in section 21 covered applications to the Court of Session for the exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction.  On the other hand, it is plain, on closer examination of the proceedings before this House, that the proposed amendments which led to Lord Hardie expressing his view related to the possibility of proceedings being taken against the Scottish Ministers for judicial review, that is to say by way of application to the Court of Session for the exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction. Accordingly the application of Lord Hardie's remarks to the type of application which was before the Extra Division was far from being an academic question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81.&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the past words and conduct to which reference has been made in the present case, I would give them a different emphasis from that of the Second Division.  The fact that Lord Hardie expressed an opinion as to the effect of section 21 is not in itself decisive.  What he said cannot be considered in isolation: he said it in the context of his role as a Government Minister in promoting the Bill, including its provision for the extension of the protection of section 21 to the Scottish Ministers.  It follows that as a Government Minister, and presumably in the light of considerations of policy, he was promoting the protection of Scottish Ministers from judicial review.  It was the exercising of that role, rather than simply his expressing of an opinion about the effect of section 21, that persuades me that Lord Hardie was disqualified from sitting as a member of the Extra Division.  I am in full agreement with the noble and learned Lord Bingham of Cornhill and Lord Hope of Craighead as to the significance of that role.  There is nothing which I wish to add to their analysis of it.</p>
