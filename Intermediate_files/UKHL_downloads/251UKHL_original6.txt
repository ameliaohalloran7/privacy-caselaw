<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;133.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other powerful considerations too militating against the imposition of a duty of care to parents arising out of the doctor's discharge of his role in combating child abuse.  These perhaps are best discerned by reference to the legal principles applying in certain related situations.  Take a doctor whose negligent diagnosis or treatment of a child causes it to die with the result that the bereaved parent suffers psychiatric injury.  Whilst clearly in such a case the parent can bring a claim on behalf of the child's estate under the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934, there can be no claim by the parent in respect of his own loss unless exceptionally he can bring himself within the narrow parameters recognised to give rise to secondary liability—see for example the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>North Glamorgan NHS Trust v Walters</i> [2003] Lloyd's Rep Med 49.   The law has always placed strict limitations upon the right to recover for psychiatric injury and it is not easy to see why, if no such  right exists in a father whose child is negligently allowed to die, it should be given to a father wrongly suspected of child abuse.  In the first case the child is lost forever; in the second for a comparatively short time.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;134.&nbsp;&nbsp;If it be said that in the second case the father's reputation is blackened, the law's response must be that a defamatory communication in the context of reporting suspicions of child abuse would inevitably attract the defence of qualified privilege so that liability would arise only on proof of malice, not mere negligence.  The reason for such a rule is obvious: the law is concerned to encourage candour in such communications; doctors should not feel inhibited in reporting their concerns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;135.&nbsp;&nbsp;I acknowledge that this principle did not prevent the House from finding a duty of care owed by an employer to his employee with regard to the preparation of a reference—<i>Spring v Guardian Assurance plc</i> [1995]  2 AC 296.   But the speeches of the majority clearly emphasise the importance to that decision of the employer-employee relationship.  Ordinarily, when considering the imposition of a duty of care previously unrecognised by the law, the courts are astute not to create a conflict of interest.  Lord Browne-Wilkinson's speech in <i>White v Jones</i> [1995]  2 AC 207, 276 illustrates the point:</p>
<p></p><ul>"[N]egligence in the preparation and execution of a will has certain unique features.  First, there can be no conflict of interest between the solicitor and client (the testator) and the intended beneficiary.  There is therefore no objection to imposing on a solicitor a duty towards a third party there being no possible conflict of interest."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;136.&nbsp;&nbsp;Another related situation to that presently under consideration is where a doctor prepares evidence with a view to appearing in a child abuse case as a witness.  In this event, of course, an absolute immunity or privilege attaches to his evidence.  Not for a moment do I suggest that that was the position in any of these cases; the Court of Appeal examined and rejected such a claim on behalf of the social workers in the <i>Dewsbury</i> case and no appeal arises as to that.  The point to be made, however, is that the public interest in law enforcement and the administration of justice does sometimes require potential liabilities to be excluded notwithstanding that those "wronged" are left uncompensated.  The limitations on the tort of malicious prosecution and the court's refusal to recognise a duty of care in cases such as <i>Calveley v Chief Constable of the Merseyside Police</i> [1989 ]  AC 1228 (the allegedly negligent conduct of disciplinary proceedings against police officers), <i>Elguzouli-Daf v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis</i> [1995]  QB 335 (the allegedly negligent prosecution of crime) and <i>Kumar v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis</i> (unreported) 31 January 1995 (again the allegedly negligent institution and prosecution of an offence) are further examples in point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;137.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is always a temptation to say in all these cases that no one, whether a doctor concerned with possible child abuse, a witness or a prosecutor will ever in fact be held liable unless he has conducted himself manifestly unreasonably; it is unnecessary, therefore, to deny a duty of care, better rather to focus on the appropriate standard by which to judge whether it is breached.  That, however, is to overlook two fundamental considerations: first, the insidious effect that his awareness of the proposed duty would have upon the mind and conduct of the doctor (subtly tending to the suppression of doubts and instincts which in the child's interests ought rather to be encouraged), and second, a consideration inevitably bound up with the first, the need to protect him against the risk of costly and vexing litigation, by no means invariably soundly based.  This would seem to me a very real risk in the case of disgruntled parents wrongly suspected of abuse; all too readily they might suppose proceedings necessary to vindicate their reputation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;138.&nbsp;&nbsp;I return to where I began, readily acknowledging the legitimate grievances of these particular appellants, against whom no suspicions whatever remain, sufferers from a presumed want of professional skill and care on the part of the doctors treating their children.  It is they, I acknowledge, who are paying the price of the law's denial of a duty of care.  But it is a price they pay in the interests of children generally.  The well-being of innumerable children up and down the land depends crucially upon doctors and social workers concerned with their safety being subjected by the law to but a single duty: that of safeguarding the child's own welfare.  It is that imperative which in my judgment must determine the outcome of these appeals.  For these reasons, together with those given by my noble and learned friends Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead and Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, I would dismiss them.</p>
