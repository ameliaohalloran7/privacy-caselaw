<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70.&nbsp;&nbsp;What is significant for present purposes is that the Court of Appeal preferred to deduct the elements for accommodation and food, "the domestic element", from the plaintiff's loss in the form of her outlays on nursing home fees.  In this way the court treated the plaintiff's normal expenditure on accommodation and food as a collateral matter which was no concern of the defendant.  Indeed, as a matter of policy - of the kind envisaged by Lord Reid in <i>Parry v Cleaver </i>[1970] AC 1, 13 - the law proceeds on the basis that the way the claimant spent his income or would spend his damages is not the defendant's business.  That policy was reiterated by Lord Griffiths in <i>Dews v National Coal Board </i>[1988] 1 AC 1.  The plaintiff sought damages for loss of earnings during a period of 31 weeks when he was off work due to injuries.  The claim included a sum representing the value of contributions which would have been made to a pension scheme during that period.  The plaintiff's ultimate pension entitlement was not affected, however, by the absence of these contributions.  The House rejected this aspect of his claim.  In the course of his reasoning Lord Griffiths said, at p 14E-G:</p>
<p></p><ul>"When a plaintiff is injured and as a result is paid no wages his immediate real loss is that part of his net earnings that were available for current expenditure.  In respect of this part of his earnings the object of which is to provide income available for current expenditure the tortfeasor is, subject to sums necessarily spent to earn the income, entitled to no credit for expenditure saved as a result of the injury;  the principle that it is no concern of the tortfeasor how the plaintiff chooses to spend his income applies."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Mackay of Clashfern also observed, at p 17D-E, that it is "generally true that a tortfeasor is in no way concerned with how a plaintiff might have spent the remuneration to which he would have been entitled had he not been injured."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;71.&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy was seen at work in <i>Shearman v Folland.  </i>It also means that a claimant who is awarded damages for his pre-trial loss of earnings may be left with more capital than he would have had if he had been earning and spending his money in his usual way.  Indeed, as Lord Brown points out, since the appellants are to be compensated under their non-pecuniary head of claim for the lost pleasures of a (hypothetical) fulfilled life outside prison, as a matter of pure logic it might seem appropriate to make virtually no award for loss of earnings on the view that they would have had to spend those earnings in order to achieve that pleasurable existence.  But, because of the policy adopted by the law in personal injuries cases, that approach is not applied in calculating awards for loss of earnings during the claimant's lifetime.  So it should not be applied to the appellants - and indeed counsel for the assessor did not suggest otherwise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72.&nbsp;&nbsp;Taken at their broadest, the statements by Lord Griffiths and Lord Mackay suggest that, as a matter of policy, a defendant who has to pay damages for loss of earnings is entitled to no credit for the expenditure on board and lodging which a claimant has saved as a result of his injury.  On that approach, the only proper basis for making an allowance for board and lodging would be as a deduction from any award for the cost of private nursing home or similar care for the claimant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Lim Poh Choo v Camden and Islington Area Health Authority </i>[1980] AC 174 the plaintiff, Dr Lim, had claims for both loss of earnings and the cost of private care.  By the time of the hearing before this House, as a result of the catastrophic injuries which she had suffered in the course of medical treatment, not only was the plaintiff unable to carry on her career as a psychiatrist, but she was having to be cared for in a private nursing home in England.  In considering how to approach the question of the plaintiff's living expenses, Lord Scarman adopted the approach of the Court of Appeal in <i>Shearman.</i>  He said, at p 191D-G:</p>
<p></p><ul>"This is necessarily a hypothetical figure in the case of a 'lost years' claim, since the plaintiff does not survive to earn the money:  and, since there is no cost of care claim (the plaintiff being assumed to be dead), it falls to be deducted from the loss of earnings award.  But where, as in the present case, the expectancy of life is not shortened but incapacity exists, there will be a cost of care claim as well as a loss of earnings claim.  How should living expenses be assessed and deducted in such a case?  One approach, analogous to the method necessarily adopted in 'lost years' cases, would be to attempt an assessment of how much the plaintiff would have spent and upon what - always a most speculative exercise.  How, for instance, could anyone tell how Dr Lim would have ordered her standard of living, had she been able to pursue her career?  Another approach is, however, available in the case of a living plaintiff.  In <i>Shearman v Folland </i>[1950] 2 KB 43 the Court of Appeal deducted what it described as the 'domestic element' from the cost of care.  Inevitably, a surviving plaintiff has to meet her living expenses.  This approach, being on the basis of a future actuality (subject to the uncertainties of life), is far less hypothetical than the former (which, 'faute de mieux', has to be adopted in 'lost years' cases). It is a simpler, more realistic, calculation and accords more closely with the general principle of the law that the courts in assessing compensation for loss are not concerned either with how the plaintiff would have used the moneys lost or with how she (or he) will use the compensation received."<p></p></ul>
<p>The trial judge had excluded the domestic element from his calculation of the cost of pre-trial care in Malaysia.  Lord Scarman endorsed that approach at p 194H and went on, at p 195B and G, to make an appropriate deduction for the domestic element both in calculating the cost of pre-trial care in England and in settling the multiplicand to be used in calculating the cost of future care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of being wrongly convicted and imprisoned the appellants were provided with accommodation, food and clothing at Her Majesty's expense.  They have accordingly no claim for sums spent by them on their care from which a domestic element can be deducted.  So the approach favoured by the Court of Appeal in <i>Shearman </i>and by this House in <i>Lim Poh Choo</i> - deducting the domestic element from the award for the cost of care - cannot be applied.  Despite this, Mr Burnett submitted that, in assessing the appellants' loss of earnings, the assessor had been right to take account of the sums which they would have had to pay for basic accommodation and food if they had been out in the world earning a living.  Given that the appellants had not paid for their keep in prison, as in "lost years" claims, faute de mieux the sum should be deducted from the appellants' compensation for loss of earnings during the period when they were imprisoned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Andrews v Grand &amp; Toy Alberta Ltd </i>[1978] 2 SCR 229 the Supreme Court of Canada had to deal with a case where the plaintiff was claiming both future loss of earnings and the cost of future care.  Dickson J said, at pp 250-251:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is clear that a plaintiff cannot recover for the expense of providing for basic necessities as part of the cost of future care while still recovering fully for prospective loss of earnings.  Without the accident, expenses for such items as food, clothing and accommodation would have been paid for out of earnings.  They are not an additional type of expense occasioned by the accident.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>When calculating the damage award, however, there are two possible methods of proceeding.  One method is to give the injured party an award for future care which makes no deduction in respect of the basic necessities for which he would have had to pay in any event.  A deduction must then be made for the cost of such basic necessities when computing the award for loss of prospective earnings:  ie<i> </i>the award is on the basis of net earnings and not gross earnings.  The alternative method is the reverse:  ie<i> </i>to deduct the cost of basic necessities when computing the award for future care and then to compute the earnings award on the basis of gross earnings.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>The trial judge took the first approach, reducing loss of future earnings by 53 per cent.  The Appellate Division took the second.  In my opinion, the approach of the trial judge is to be preferred.  This is in accordance with the principle which I believe should underlie the whole consideration of damages for personal injuries:  that proper future care is the paramount goal of such damages.  To determine accurately the needs and costs in respect of future care, basic living expenses should be included.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>The costs of necessaries when in an infirm state may well be different from those when in a state of health.  Thus, while the types of expenses would have been incurred in any event, the level of expenses for the victim may be seen as attributable to the accident.  In my opinion, the projected cost of necessities should, therefore, be included in calculating the cost of future care, and a percentage attributable to the necessities of a person in a normal state should be reduced from the award for future earnings."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the House in <i>Lim Poh Choo</i>, the Supreme Court preferred to make the deduction from the award for loss of earnings rather than from the award for the cost of care.  It should also be noted that the reason which the court gave for deducting the cost of basic necessaries applies only where the plaintiff is awarded damages for both loss of earnings and nursing home or similar care:  the aim is to avoid duplication in the two awards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Watkins v Olafson </i>[1989] 2 SCR 750 the plaintiff had been cared for by the state between the accident and the trial and so had no claim for the cost of care during that period.  The Court of Appeal of British Columbia held that, in calculating the plaintiff's pre-trial loss of income, allowance should be made for the plaintiff's basic living expenses.  Consistently with the reasoning in <i>Andrews</i>,<i> </i>the Supreme Court held that this was wrong.  McLachlin J said, at p 773:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In calculating loss of future earning capacity in cases where an award for future care is made, a deduction is made from the award for lost earning capacity for living expenses to avoid duplication between the two heads of damage.  The Court of Appeal in this case applied similar reasoning to the plaintiff's pre-trial lost income.  However, the basis for making a deduction on this account - duplication between two heads of damage - was lacking, there being no award for pre-trial cost of care.  No case was cited to us in which a deduction for living expenses has been made from damages for pre-trial loss of earning capacity and I see no need to introduce such a practice."<p></p></ul>
<p>By analogy, it could be argued that, since the appellants have no claim for the cost of care, no deduction for the cost of necessities need be made from the compensation for their loss of earnings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77.&nbsp;&nbsp;In arguing in favour of such a deduction, counsel for the assessor referred to the passage from Lord Griffiths' speech in <i>Dews v National Coal Board</i> which I have already quoted in para 70.  There Lord Griffiths acknowledged that, when paying damages for the loss of income, a defendant could take credit for sums which the plaintiff would necessarily have spent in order to earn the income.  There was no reason, counsel argued, to confine such sums to, for example, the substantial travel expenses which a self-employed businessman would have had to incur in order to earn his income.  It would have been equally necessary for the businessman to keep body and soul together in order to earn the income in question.  So the cost of minimum living expenses should be deducted as a necessary expense from any award for loss of earnings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78.&nbsp;&nbsp;In support of this argument Mr Burnett cited the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Toneguzzo-Norvell v Burnaby Hospital </i>[1994] 1 SCR 114.  The plaintiff had suffered horrendous injuries as a result of which her life expectancy had been reduced.  She claimed damages for loss of earning capacity during her lifetime and during the "lost years".  The Supreme Court held that a deduction for necessary living expenses should be made in respect of both elements of her claim - even though, during the "lost years", she would ex hypothesi be dead and so not incurring any care costs.  McLachlin J said this:</p>
<p></p><ul>"There can be no capacity to earn without a life.  The maintenance of that life requires expenditure for personal living expenses.  Hence the earnings which the award represents are conditional on personal living expenses having been incurred.  It follows that such expenses may appropriately be deducted from the award….  It can be argued that not to make a deduction for personal living expenses is to introduce into the award for lost earning capacity for the 'lost years' a measure of overcompensation akin to the duplication which the law avoids in the case of an award for lost earnings during the plaintiff's actual lifespan.  This deduction has been justified for the years before the plaintiff's actual projected death, on the ground that it avoids duplication between the award for cost of care and the award for lost earning capacity.  But in fact, the 'lived years' and the 'lost years' cannot be so easily distinguished.  The same reasoning applies to both:  had the plaintiff been in a position to earn the monies represented by the award for lost earning capacity, she would have had to spend a portion of them for living expenses.  Not to recognize this is to introduce an element of duplication and to put the plaintiff in a better position than she would have been in had she actually earned the monies in question."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79.&nbsp;&nbsp;The desirability of avoiding duplication is, generally speaking, indisputable.  But, so far as the "lost years" are concerned, there is no risk of duplication from the cumulation of an award for loss of earnings and an award for care.  The reasoning in <i>Watkins v Olafson </i>might therefore have suggested that no deduction for basic necessities should be made from the loss of earnings figure for that period.  But the court adopts a significantly different rationale and holds that a deduction for basic necessities should indeed be made for the "lost years" because the injured person could not have made the earnings which she claims without spending some of them on those basic necessities.  When considering the passage, it should, however, be noted that the Supreme Court envisages the deduction of only basic necessities even in claims for "lost years".  By contrast, in <i>Lim Poh Choo</i> [1980] AC 174, 191D-F, Lord Scarman considered that hypothetical discretionary expenditure by the plaintiff would also have to be deducted in calculating the loss of earnings during the "lost years".  The thinking underlying the two approaches is actually very different and the Supreme Court's reasoning cannot be easily reconciled with the approach which the House adopted in <i>Lim Poh Choo.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80.&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite this, Mr Burnett argued that the approach of the Supreme Court was really just a development of Lord Griffiths' indication in <i>Dews </i>that necessary expenses such as substantial travel costs should be deducted from an award for loss of earnings.  There is, of course, nothing to show that the assessor had this particular rationale in mind.  But, even leaving that aside and also leaving aside the difference in the measure of the deduction permitted by the two systems in "lost years" awards, the development appears to me to cross an important line.  The travel costs to which Lord Griffiths was referring are costs which the self-employed businessman incurs only in order to work and earn his income.  But people eat to live:  they don't eat to work.  So, like everyone else, even such businessmen incur basic living expenses simply in order to live.  When they are not working, they still have to incur those expenses.  For good reason, therefore, by contrast with the Canadian courts, even in care cases such as <i>Lim Poh Choo</i>, the courts in this country have respected the important policy that a defendant has no concern with how a claimant spends his earnings during his lifetime.  At common law they have accordingly deducted basic living costs only as part of the larger deduction for prospective discretionary expenditure in the "lost years" when ex hypothesi the claimant is presumed to be dead and so the award is regarded as being for the benefit of the claimant's estate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81.&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament has, however, stepped into the arena by enacting section 5 of the Administration of Justice Act 1982.  The section provides that:</p>
<p></p><ul>"any saving to the injured person which is attributable to his maintenance wholly or partly at public expense in a hospital, nursing home or other institution shall be set off against any income lost by him as a result of his injuries."<p></p></ul>
<p>This provision - which may, of course, have forestalled a development in the common law - enshrines a public policy that savings in basic living expenses attributable to an injured person's maintenance in a hospital, nursing home or "other institution" at public expense should be offset against compensation for loss of income.  Mr Burnett did not suggest that the words "other institution" would be apt, in themselves, to cover a prison.  And indeed both the context and the eiusdem generis rule would exclude such a construction.  His argument was, rather, that by analogy the savings in basic living costs to the appellants which were attributable to their maintenance in prison at public expense should be set off against their compensation for loss of income.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82.&nbsp;&nbsp;In respectful disagreement with your Lordships, I find myself unable to accept this, or indeed any other, argument in favour of the deduction.  Section 5 is designed to deal with an injured person's maintenance while necessarily living in a caring institution for the purposes of treatment.  I am by no means satisfied that Parliament would ever have envisaged that it would be extended by analogy to cover a prisoner's maintenance while unjustifiably detained in a prison for the purposes of punishment.  Indeed, at this point the assessor's approach meets what I consider to be an insuperable objection.  In the situation envisaged by Parliament, and indeed in all the situations where the courts have allowed a deduction for basic living costs, by the time the supposed saving occurs the defendant has already injured, but is no longer injuring, the claimant.  The wrong is over and done with, even though its effects remain.  Parliament provides that any savings which then accrue to the injured person, while he is being maintained at public expense in an institution providing treatment to remove or palliate those effects, are to be set off against any loss of earnings.  By contrast, in the appellants' situation the wrong was not over and done with when they were being maintained at public expense and the supposed savings accrued to them.  On the contrary, their enforced but unjustified maintenance in prison at public expense for years on end is the very worst part of the injury which has been done to them and for which they are entitled to compensation.  The actual infliction of the continuing wrong and the supposed saving are inextricably linked, just as they would be in the case of a prolonged kidnapping.  That simple fact takes the appellants' case beyond the reach of the kinds of policy considerations which favour offsetting the injured person's savings against loss of earnings in the situations envisaged by Parliament and the courts.  To put it no more strongly, justice, reasonableness and public policy surely dictate that no allowance should be made for so-called savings which the appellants were supposedly making while they were actually enduring the appalling wrong for which they are to be compensated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83.&nbsp;&nbsp;One further point in conclusion.  As I mentioned above at para 67, Mr Burnett accepted that the assessor would not have been entitled to make a deduction to represent the value of the benefit to the appellants of being fed, housed and clothed in prison.  But he argued, of course, that this did not mean that the assessor could not set off the saving to the appellants in the basic living expenses which they would have had to pay if they had been at liberty and earning an income.  Mr Burnett was right to say that the two approaches are different.  In theory.  In reality, they come to much the same thing.  If one assumes - which does not seem unreasonable - that the standard of living of prisoners is not significantly higher than the minimum standard of living to which they might aspire if at liberty and working, then the practical effect of the two approaches is in substance the same.  The value of the "benefit" provided to prisoners such as the appellants would be £y and the saving to them in not having to provide themselves with the basic necessities of life outside would also be £y.  So it is irrelevant under which of the heads the assessor deducts £y from the compensation of £x for the appellants' loss of earnings.  On either approach the appellants receive £(x-y).  It is not hard to see why, either way, the appellants would feel that in the end they were, in effect, paying for their keep throughout all those long years when they were wrongly deprived of their liberty and shut up in prison.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons I would have allowed the appeals on the first ground.</p>
<p><b>LORD CARSWELL</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the advantage of reading in draft the opinion prepared by my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill.  I entirely agree with the reasons which he has given on both questions for dismissing the appeal and wish to add only a very few observations of my own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86.&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of compensation remains the same, whether it be by way of damages in tort for an injury sustained by a claimant or compensation for a loss or deprivation in a case such as the present.  There is, as Lord Reid expressed it in <i>Parry v Cleaver</i> [1970]  AC 1, 13 "a universal rule that the plaintiff cannot recover more then he has lost."  He added the important observation that one must have regard to realities rather than technicalities.  So viewed, the appellants' proposition in relation to the deduction made for living expenses is unsustainable and the Court of Appeal were right to affirm the assessor's conclusion on this issue.  To approach the question as if the provision of board and lodging in prison should be regarded as a benefit is inapt and tends to distort consideration of the true issue, which is determination of the sum properly required to compensate the appellants for their true loss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second question, that of inconsistency between the percentage deductions from the awards made to the appellants by Lord Brennan and that made in James Robinson's case by Sir David Calcutt, I again agree entirely with the reasons given by Lord Bingham for rejecting the appellants' complaint.  I would, I think, go further in questioning the appropriateness of the method of deducting a percentage across the board to reflect the appellants' convictions and the punishment resulting from them.  As my noble and learned friend Lord Scott of Foscote has pointed out, such a deduction is relevant to some only of the heads of compensation which are properly included in the sum to be paid.  Section 133(4A)(c) of the Criminal Justice Act (inserted by section 28 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1995) requires the assessor to have regard to any other convictions of the person and any punishment resulting from them in assessing "so much of any compensation … as is attributable to suffering, harm to reputation or similar damage".  I find it difficult to see how any deduction from non-pecuniary loss can correctly be made except in respect of those specified heads, to which the factors in section 133(4A)(c) are obviously relevant.  Indeed, I would expect, as Lord Bingham said in paragraph 31, that it would be taken into account at the first stage in assessing the amount to be attributed to those heads, rather than making a deduction across the board at a later stage.  In supporting the assessor's decision, accordingly, I do not wish to be taken to giving my imprimatur<i> </i>to all of his method of calculation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88.&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, I agree that the inconsistency in the level of deduction between Robinson's case and those of the appellants does not vitiate the assessor's conclusions.  Consistency in the award of damages is a very desirable feature, just as it is in sentencing criminals - the recognition of which has produced such valuable works as <i>Kemp &amp; Kemp</i>, <i>The Quantum of Damages.  </i>That is because it is a facet of justice, to both payer and recipient, that like cases should attract like amounts.  But it is only one facet, and the imperative of consistency may have to yield to the larger imperative of justice in the particular case, achieving a result which is proper and fair to the interests of both payer and recipient.</p>
<i>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do consider the analogy with disparity in sentences, to which Lord Bingham and Lord Scott have referred, to be apt and instructive.  As Lord Bingham stated in paragraph 26, a court will, and generally should, be very slow to impose what it regards as anything other than the right sentence simply because it or another court has imposed a "wrong" sentence on a co-defendant.  As Hutton LCJ expressed it in the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal in <i>R v Delaney</i> [1994]  NIJB 31, 33-34:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The principle served by this approach is that where right thinking members of the public looking at the respective sentences would say that something had gone wrong the court should step in … It should not be supposed, however, that the court will be prepared to invoke the principle and make the reduction unless there is a really marked disparity, for unless that condition is satisfied it will not regard any sense of grievance felt by an appellant as having sufficient justification … It is only if a fair-minded and right-thinking person would feel that the disparity involved some unfairness to the appellant, as distinct from a possibly rueful feeling that his associate has been more fortunate in his treatment, that a court should intervene …"<p></p></ul>
<p>Griffiths LJ expressed the principle pithily in <i>R v Large </i>(1981) 3 Cr App R(S) 80, 83:</p>
<p></p><ul>"If there be honour among thieves and armed robbers, let him who has been properly and severely sentenced rejoice in the good fortune of his companion who has received a lenient sentence.  Let him not complain that he himself has received a proper sentence."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a marked disparity between the deduction made by Sir David Calcutt in Robinson's case and those made by Lord Brennan in respect of the appellants.  It is apparent, however, that Lord Brennan was of the view that the deductions which he made were right and proper, notwithstanding the disparity, of which he was well aware.  It is equally apparent that he was satisfied that the deductions which he made were justified and that that made by Sir David was insufficient.  Although Lord Scott considers that that disparity constitutes such unfairness that the deductions made by Lord Brennan should not stand, I am unable to share this view.  It has not been argued that those deductions are in themselves excessive, and the focus of the submission on behalf of the appellants was the disparity with Robinson's case.  In my opinion it would be wrong for the appellants to be awarded more than what the assessor adjudged to be fair and proper amounts and I would reject this ground of appeal.</p>
