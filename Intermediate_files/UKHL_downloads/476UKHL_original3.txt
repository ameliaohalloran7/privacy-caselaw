<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;52. The principal argument advanced on behalf of the respondents is that the long title to the 1998 Act makes clear that the purpose of the Act is to implement the agreement contained in the Belfast Agreement and that accordingly the provisions of the Act should be construed to give effect to the objectives of the Agreement.  The Agreement commences with the declaration:</p>
<p></p><ul>"1.&nbsp;&nbsp;We, the participants in the multi-party negotiations, believe that the agreement we have negotiated offers a truly historic opportunity for a new beginning.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The tragedies of the past have left a deep and profoundly regrettable legacy of suffering.  We must never forget those who have died or been injured, and their families.  But we can best honour them through a fresh start, in which we firmly dedicate ourselves to the achievement of reconciliation, tolerance, and mutual trust, and to the protection and vindication of the human rights of all.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are committed to partnership, equality and mutual respect as the basis of relationships within Northern Ireland, between North and South, and between these islands."<p></p></ul>
<p>A fundamental and vital strand of the Agreement is that there should be cross-community, ie unionist and nationalist, involvement in the devolved government in Northern Ireland.  Thus in Strand 1 of the Agreement under the heading "Democratic Institutions In Northern Ireland" there are the following provisions:</p>
<p></p><ul>"1.&nbsp;&nbsp;This agreement provides for a democratically elected Assembly in Northern Ireland which is inclusive in its membership, capable of exercising executive and legislative authority, and subject to safeguards to protect the rights and interests of all sides of the community.<p></p></ul>
….
<p></p><ul>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Assembly - operating where appropriate on a cross-community basis - will be the prime source of authority in respect of all devolved responsibilities.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be safeguards to ensure that all sections of the community can participate and work together successfully in the operation of these institutions and that all sections of the community are protected, including:<p></p></ul>
….
<p></p><ul>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;arrangements to ensure key decisions are taken on a cross-community basis;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(i)  either&nbsp;&nbsp;parallel consent, ie a majority of those members present and voting, including a majority of the unionist and nationalist designations present and voting;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(ii)  or&nbsp;&nbsp;a weighted majority (60%) of members present and voting, including at least 40% of each of the nationalist and unionist designations present and voting."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;53. Therefore the respondents submit that the provisions of the 1998 Act should be interpreted so as to uphold cross-community devolved government (the Assembly's commitment to such government being demonstrated by the election on 6 November 2001 of Mr Trimble and Mr Durkan as First Minister and deputy First Minister) and to enable such cross-community government to continue.  The respondents further submit that if the appellant's argument is correct the Secretary of State would be obliged to propose an early date for a poll which might result in the election of members of the Assembly who would not co-operate to provide the necessary majority of nationalists and the necessary majority of unionists to elect a First Minister and a deputy First Minister and to enable cross-community government to continue.  The respondents also submit that when the Assembly succeeded in electing a First Minister and a deputy First Minister within 48 hours of the expiration of the six weeks' period, Parliament could not have intended that that election should be treated as a nullity and that an early poll for a new Assembly should take place with the risk that the new Assembly would be unable to co-operate to provide cross-community government in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;54. My Lords, despite the attractiveness of the respondents' argument based on the purpose of the Belfast Agreement, I have come to the conclusion that the appeal should succeed.  The Northern Ireland Assembly is a body created by a Westminster statute and it has no powers other than those given to it by statute.  Section 16(1) and section 16(8) expressly require that the election of the First Minister and deputy First Minster shall take place within a period of six weeks beginning either with the first meeting of the Assembly or, if the offices become vacant at any time, within a period of six weeks beginning with the time of the vacancy.  Therefore once the period of six weeks has expired the Assembly has no express power under the Act to elect the First Minister and deputy First Minister.   Does the Assembly then have an implied power to elect a First Minister and deputy First Minister outside the six weeks' period?  Where a statute gives power to a statutory body to perform a certain act within a specified period the normal rule is that the body has no power to perform that act outside the period, and I see nothing in the provisions of the Act pointing to a different conclusion.  I do not think that a consideration of the authorities on the distinction between mandatory and directory provisions is of any direct assistance in this case, but to the extent that those authorities are of any relevance I consider that the statement of Millett LJ in <i>Petch v Gurney</i> [1994] 3 All ER 731, 738b-f assists the appellant:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The taxpayer's argument, therefore, comes to this— that the requirement that the case stated be transmitted to the High Court is mandatory; but the requirement that this be done within 30 days is not.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>This is not an easy proposition to accept.  Where statute requires an act to be done in a particular manner, it may be possible to regard the requirement that the act be done as mandatory but the requirement that it be done in a particular manner as merely directory.  In such a case the statutory requirement can be treated as substantially complied with if the act is done in a manner which is not less satisfactory having regard to the purpose of the legislature in imposing the requirement.  But that is not the case with a stipulation as to time.  If the only time limit which is prescribed is not obligatory, there is no time limit at all.  Doing an act late is not the equivalent of doing it in time.  That is why Grove J said in <i>Barker v Palmer</i> (1881) 8 QBD 9 at 10— 'provisions with respect to time are always obligatory, unless a power of extending the time is given to the court'.  This probably cannot be laid down as a universal rule, but in my judgment it must be the normal one.  Unless the court is given a power to extend the time, or some other and final mandatory time limit can be spelled out of the statute, a time limit cannot be relaxed without being dispensed with altogether; and it cannot be dispensed with altogether unless the substantive requirement itself can be dispensed with."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;55. In my opinion the provisions of section 32 demonstrate that Parliament did not intend that the Assembly should have a power to elect a First Minister and a deputy First Minister outside the six weeks' period and those provisions constitute a strong impediment to the implication of such a power.  It is relevant to observe that the provision in section 32(1) and the provision in section 32(3) are not contained in separate sections of the Act but are contained in the same section, and both subsections end with the same words "the Secretary of State shall propose a date for the poll for the election of the next Assembly".   Moreover in section 32(4) the proposal of a date on the Assembly failing to elect within the six weeks' period and the proposal of a date on the Assembly passing a resolution for dissolution are linked together and the subsection states "If the Secretary of State proposes a date under subsection 1 or 3" an Order in Council may direct that the date of the poll shall be the date proposed by the Secretary of State.  Therefore I consider that the meaning to be given to section 32(1) casts light on the meaning to be given to section 32(3).  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;56. The submission made on behalf of the respondents is that if the Assembly fails to elect a First Minister and deputy First Minister within the six weeks' period specified in section 16(8) the Secretary of State is under no duty under section 32(3) to fix an early date for a poll but is entitled to delay fixing a date and to wait for a reasonable period to see if at some time after the expiration of the six weeks' period the Assembly does succeed in electing a First Minister and deputy First Minister, in which event there will be no need for an early poll and he can fix a date for a poll as the same date as that specified in section 31(1) or section 31(2) for an election to take place at the end of the four year term of an Assembly (which is what the Secretary of State has done in the present case).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;57. If that argument is correct then I consider that the same construction must be given to section 32(1), and Mr McCloskey QC for Mr Trimble and Mr Durkan accepted this when it was put to him in the course of his submissions.  But in my opinion under section 32(1) it is clear that if the Assembly passes a resolution that it should be dissolved the Secretary of State would have no discretion to delay proposing an early date for a poll in the hope that the Assembly might resolve the differences which had caused it to pass the resolution for dissolution.  I consider that similarly where the Assembly has failed to elect a First Minister and deputy First Minister within the period of six weeks specified by section 16, the Secretary of State has no power under section 32(3) to delay proposing a date in the hope that if the Assembly is given more time it may succeed in making the election, and he has no such power even if he has strong grounds for believing at the time of the expiration of the six weeks' period that in the near future there may be cross-party support to make an election of a unionist and nationalist First Minister and deputy First Minister.  In my opinion section 32(1) and section 32(3) are not dealing with different situations so as to permit the duty of the Secretary of State to be interpreted differently under the two subsections.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;58. I further consider that if the respondents' argument be correct it would result in unusual consequences which were never intended by Parliament.  If the Assembly does not elect a First Minister and deputy First Minister within the six weeks' period and the Secretary of State then proposes a date for the poll and an Order in Council fixes that date, on the respondents' argument the Assembly could elect a First Minister and deputy First Minister the day before its dissolution.  I do not think that Parliament intended the Assembly to have such a power.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;59. In my opinion the wording of section 32(3) read in conjunction with the other subsections of section 32 makes it clear that Parliament intended that if there was not a successful election within the six weeks' period, the Secretary of State would fix an early date for the poll.  What has happened in this case, where the Secretary of State has fixed the date as being the date when a poll would have taken place under section 31 on the normal expiration of the life of the Assembly, appears to be a procedure which is contrived and artificial, particularly as the side note to section 32 refers to "Extraordinary elections" but the Secretary of State has proposed the date on which an ordinary election for the Assembly would take place under section 31.  Moreover on the respondents' argument if the Assembly failed under section 16(1) to elect a First Minister and deputy First Minister within six weeks of its first meeting, the Secretary of State would be entitled in some circumstances to propose a date more than three years beyond the expiration of the six weeks' period.  I do not think that Parliament intended that section 32(3) could operate in that way and that the Secretary of State should have such a power.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60. I do not consider that constitutional practice in relation to the United Kingdom Parliament at Westminster assists in the interpretation of section 32.  Lester and Oliver on Constitutional Law and Human Rights state at paragraph 209:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Except in the case of effluxion of time, an existing Parliament can be ended only by an exercise of the royal prerogative.  Parliament may be so dissolved at any time, but by the customary or conventional usage of the constitution in the exercise of this prerogative the monarch acts upon the advice of the Prime Minister unless prepared to dismiss him."<p></p></ul>
<p>But the Assembly is entirely a creation of statute and Parliament has laid down the procedure to be followed where the Assembly resolves that it should be dissolved or fails to elect a First Minister and deputy First Minister within the stipulated period of six weeks.  For the reasons which I have given I consider that the duty imposed upon the Secretary of State under section 32(1) and section 32(3) is to propose an early date for a poll, and once the Secretary of State has proposed a date for a poll there could, in my opinion, be no question of the Secretary of State then failing to advise Her Majesty to make an Order in Council that the date of the poll should be the date which he has proposed and that the Assembly should be dissolved on a date before that date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;61. In considering the extent to which the purpose of the 1998 Act to implement the Belfast Agreement can affect the interpretation of section 16 and section 32 I think it is necessary to bear in mind that the Belfast Agreement was drafted in a spirit of hope that the cross-community institutions of government which it proposed would succeed. Whilst the Agreement contains a final section containing provisions for review by the British and Irish Governments in consultation with the parties in the Assembly if difficulties arise across the range of institutions, the Agreement contains no express provision stating what would happen if cross-community government was not established or did not continue.  But Parliament had to provide for this contingency and it did so by the provisions of section 16(1), 16(8) and section 32.  Parliament has laid down a procedure to be followed in the event of the Assembly resolving that it should be dissolved or failing to elect a First Minister or deputy First Minister within the specified period of six weeks, and whilst those sections continue in force unamended I consider that the objective of the Belfast Agreement cannot operate to alter the meaning of their words.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;62. I would add, in conclusion, that although on its face the statement of Lord Dubs in the House of Lords on 19 October 1998 (HL Deb col 1229) gives the appellant some support, I agree with the opinions of my noble and learned friends Lord Bingham and Lord Hoffmann that the statement is not of sufficient precision to be relied upon as an aid to interpretation under the rules laid down in <i>Pepper v Hart</i> [1993]  AC 593.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;63. I would allow this appeal for the reasons which I have given.</p>
<p><b>LORD HOBHOUSE OF WOODBOROUGH</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;64. The question of statutory construction raised by this appeal has given rise to differences of opinion both in your Lordships' House and in the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland.  Agreeing as I do with the conclusions of the Lord Chief Justice and my noble and learned friend Lord Hutton, I will shortly add in my own words my reasons for that agreement.  I am indebted to my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill for having set out the relevant statutory provisions and for referring to the time-table of the events which have led up to the commencement of this action by Mr Robinson. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;65. I do not consider that the resolution of this dispute has in any way been assisted by the references to the parliamentary progress of the bill which became the Northern Ireland Act 1998 nor by what was said at various stages of that progress.  I would wholeheartedly adopt what has been said by my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann in this connection.  The task of construing legislation is not assisted by the too ready reference to what has been said during debates without having regard to the very limited authority for the use of such material given by <i>Pepper v Hart</i> [1993] AC 593 and the clear limits laid down in that decision.  It is fundamental to our constitution and the proper ascertainment of the law as enacted by Parliament that the law should be found in the text of the statute, not in the unenacted statements or answers of ministers or individual parliamentarians.  This requirement is simply an <i>a fortiori</i> application of the rules for the proper recognition of what are and are not sources of law and the construction of written instruments.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66. The central point in the present case is the question of the holding of extraordinary elections for the Assembly under s.32 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 (the 1998 Act).  The Assembly is entirely a creature of the Westminster statute.  It is an organ of devolved government within a quasi-federal structure.  As agreed in the Belfast Agreement, it is both an executive and a legislative body and is to be elected upon a basis which reflects and incorporates the range of different communities which make up the political electorate of the Province.  The Belfast Agreement itself did not specify how often elections to the Assembly were to be held nor what specific criteria were to be applied to determine the life of any given Assembly.  The current Assembly is indeed the continuation of one elected pursuant to s.2 of the Northern Ireland (Elections) Act 1998 before the 1998 Act had been enacted and come into force: s.31.  It is also a feature of the statutory scheme in existence since early 2000 that the Westminster Parliament enacted the Northern Ireland Act 2000 (the 2000 Act) which suspended the Assembly and gave the Secretary of State a wide power thereafter by statutory instrument to reactivate and re-suspend the Assembly.  As recorded in Lord Bingham's opinion, these powers had already been exercised twice during the period since Mr Trimble had resigned on 1 July 2001, thereby extending the 6 week limit to a not ungenerous 18 weeks; it was no doubt the broader political cost which the exercise of those powers involved and their impact upon the operation of the Belfast Agreement which led to the decision not to exercise them again in November 2001.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;67. Despite what might at first sight appear, this case is not about a vacuum in the executive power of the Assembly.  The executive powers of the Assembly are exercised on its behalf by ministers and the 1998 Act includes provisions which enable the ministers to continue to fulfil this function.  Similar provision is made in respect of the First Minister and his Deputy; there are also provisions for alternates.  No point was made in argument or on the evidence before the House that the question relevant to the present appeal should be guided by any consideration of the need for the devolved government to perform its executive functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;68. Part IV of the 1998 Act deals with the election of Assemblies.  The first Assembly (the 'continuation' assembly, see above) is to be dissolved a minimum period before 1st May 2003, the prescribed date for the first ordinary election under the 1998 Act: s.31(2).  But s.32 makes provision, under the side-heading "extraordinary elections", for the dissolution of the Assembly and the holding of a fresh Assembly election in two stated circumstances.  The first is "if the Assembly passes a resolution that it should be dissolved": s.32(1).  S.32(2) requires a two thirds majority for such a resolution.  The other is "if the period mentioned in s.16(1) or (8) ends without a First Minister and a deputy First Minister having been elected": s.32(3).  In either of these two situations, it is a necessary implication that the Assembly shall then be dissolved and  an extraordinary Assembly election held; otherwise the expressed will of the Assembly and the provisions of s.32 will be frustrated.  The mechanism for prescribing the actual dates for such dissolution and the holding of the poll is left to the Secretary of State and the formality of an Order in Council.  Subsections (1) and (3) use the words "shall propose a date for the poll for the election of the next Assembly" and subsection (4) authorises an Order in Council to give effect to that proposal and prescribe a date of dissolution in variation of s.31.  No distinction is made between s.32(1) and (3).  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;69. On Monday 5th November, when he was before the High Court of Justice in Northern Ireland defending Mr Robinson's first judicial review proceedings, the period prescribed under s.16(8) (and extended by the use of the 2000 Act) having expired, the Secretary of State conceded that he was under an obligation to propose a date for an extraordinary poll under s.32(3).  He was clearly right to make this concession and he did not seek to resile from it in the present proceedings.  The concession recognises that the prescribed period is substantive and its expiry triggers the duty.  It also recognises that s.32(3) (and subsection (1)) do impose a substantive duty upon the Secretary of State to implement the necessary procedures for holding an extraordinary Assembly election.  The nub of the complaint of Mr Robinson is that the Secretary of State has not performed this obligation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70. What has happened instead is that the Secretary of State has apparently concluded that it would have adversely affected the stability of the devolved government to have held an extraordinary Assembly election in late 2001 or even early 2002 which it appears to be accepted would constitute the normal and reasonable time-span for the holding an Assembly election.  That the duty should be performed gains powerful support from Strand One of the Belfast Agreement which is based upon requirements of inclusive democracy commanding cross-community support.  The two triggering events specified in s.32 follow the same logic, one positive and the other negative.  Both are clearly stated and neither of them contemplates or accommodates provisional or tentative attitudes.  The negative condition, in (3), incorporates a time-limit which it is conceded sufficed to trigger the duty to hold the extraordinary poll.  The legal position is clear and straightforward: the duty attached at midnight on the Sunday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;71. The argument of the Secretary of State is that the further vote of the re-designated members of the Assembly on the Tuesday released him from what would otherwise have been his duty: he was now at liberty to propose a polling date, and present an Order in Council, for 1st May 2003, which was the date prescribed by s.31(2) for the next ordinary Assembly election absent any intervening extraordinary election.  This was patently a non-exercise of the duty to hold an extraordinary election under s.32.  He did not perform that duty.  The question therefore is: did he have a legal excuse for his failure?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72. The Secretary of State argues that the vote on the Tuesday negatived the effect of the previous expiry of the extended six week time-limit.  This is the argument which I cannot accept.  S.32(3) is not so drafted.  It is time specific.  The concession made on the Monday and adhered to thereafter also accepts that interpretation.  The context of subsection (3) in s.32 also bears this out.  S.32 is a provision for extraordinary elections.  Subsections (1) and (2) enable the Assembly by a two thirds majority to decide upon its own dissolution.  No distinction is made between this and allowing the six weeks to expire without having elected a new First Minister and deputy by the appropriate combination of votes.  The argument is clearly contrary to the provisions of the statute and the necessary implication of the concession which the Secretary of State has made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73. Those who take a contrary view say that the statute does not say what is to happen  if the Assembly does not elect a new First Minister and deputy in accordance with the requirements of s.16 and then reason that there is nothing to stop the Assembly from electing them outside the six week period.  This shows that the question has been misunderstood.  The Act does say what is to happen if the six week period is allowed to expire.  The Assembly is to be dissolved and an extraordinary Assembly election is to be held.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74. Another argument deployed in favour of the Secretary of State is to say that the Belfast Agreement supports the view that the Assembly should not be dissolved if it would be expedient, in the interests of stability, not to do so.  Thus, it is said, even after the expiry of the six weeks the process of negotiation should continue and alignments or candidates looked for which will enable a vote complying with s.16(3) but not s.16(8) to be obtained.  Parliamentary elections, it is said, are not lightly to be undertaken; in the United Kingdom the unwritten constitution allows a wide discretion to the Executive in choosing the timing of elections (but even then subject to an over-riding statutory limit).  These arguments do not sufficiently recognise that the Northern Ireland Assembly is a statutory body governed by specific statutory provisions.  The six week period is part of that structure.  It is not acceptable to say that a longer period might have been better; in fact, in the present case, it was some 18 weeks, three times as long as the specified period.  If the members of the Assembly had not performed their duty within that period, s.32 says what is to follow.  The Tuesday vote in the Assembly is simply legally irrelevant.  As regards the inferences to be drawn from the Belfast Agreement, Strand One incorporates an important safeguard that key decisions should be taken on a cross-community basis, specifically including the election of the First Minister and the deputy (paragraph 5(d)).  The designation of the members of the Assembly is to be registered at its first meeting (paragraph 6) and there is nothing in the Belfast Agreement that contemplates any re-designations to enable a particular result to be achieved.  The Secretary of State's refusal to perform the duty to hold an extraordinary Assembly election must be political in character since it is bound to be seen to favour one political party or another; it thus fails to reflect the inclusive aspirations of the Belfast Agreement for the democratic institutions of Northern Ireland.  Similarly inconsistent is to treat the Secretary of State as having a reserved power to refuse to give effect to the requirements of s.32 and the decisions of the Assembly which have knowingly triggered the provisions for holding an extraordinary Assembly election.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75. I therefore would allow the appeal.  I would uphold the duty to act under s.32 of the 1998 Act.  As I have said, I consider that the validity of the vote held on Tuesday 6th November 2001 to be irrelevant.  But, if, contrary to my view, it is relevant, it follows from what I have said about the scheme of Parts III and IV of the 1988 Act that I would construe s.16 as conferring a power which is coterminous with the performance of the duties which go with it.  An election of a First Minister and deputy, if it is to be constitutional, must be carried out in accordance with the terms of s.16.  This would be the ordinary construction of such a statutory provision.  The statutory context supports this conclusion and does not support the opposite reading.</p>
<p><b>LORD MILLETT</b></p>
My Lords,
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76. I have had the advantage of reading in draft the speeches of my noble and learned friends, Lord Bingham of Cornhill and Lord Hoffmann, with which I am in full agreement.  In view of the constitutional importance of the questions your Lordships have to decide, I propose to express in my own words my reasons for agreeing with them that the appeal should be dismissed.</p>
