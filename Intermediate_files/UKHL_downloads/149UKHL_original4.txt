<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73.&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard Green was convicted on 5 October 2004 after a trial before Judge Statman and a jury at Woolwich Crown Court on two counts, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and having a bladed or pointed article.  He was sentenced to seven weeks' imprisonment on each count, to run concurrently.  The offence arose out of an incident in the course of which Police Sergeant Burgess, who suspected that Green might be intending to steal a wheel from a wrecked car, required him to submit to a search of his person.  Sgt Burgess asked him if he had anything he should not have on his person.  Green handed over a bag containing sterilised needles.  Sgt Burgess asked him again if he had anything "he should know about", to which Green replied "no".  There was in fact another needle in his pocket and when the sergeant put his hand into the pocket he pricked himself on it.  The prosecution case was that Green knew all along of the presence of the needle in his pocket and deliberately or recklessly let Sgt Burgess impale himself on it.  Green's defence was that he had the needle for self-injection, as he was a heroin addict, and had forgotten that he had it in his pocket.  He claimed that the sergeant had commenced the body search without giving him time to check his pockets, which would have obviated the danger to a searcher.  There was accordingly a factual issue for the jury to decide, though it was more one of Green's credibility than a conflict of factual testimony between Sgt Burgess and Green.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74.&nbsp;&nbsp;A police officer named Mason was one of the members of the jury, a fact which did not come to light until several weeks after the trial, when Green's solicitor happened to hear of it on a visit to a police station.  Both Sgt Burgess and Pc Mason had served in the Royal Borough of Greenwich, overlapping for a short time.  It was accepted that neither had ever met the other or knew of his existence, a point of distinction from a case such as <i>R v Pintori </i>[2007] EWCA Crim 1700.  The Court of Appeal held (para 66) that there was nothing in the particular circumstances of the case to give any continuing cause for concern with regard to the presence of Pc Mason on the jury.  The case was therefore governed by the general issues of principle.  I agree with their conclusion and do not consider that Green was deprived of a fair trial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kenneth Joseph Williamson was convicted on 3 February 2005 at Warrington Crown Court after a trial before Judge Hale and a jury on two counts of rape.  He was sentenced to ten years' detention in a young offender institution.  The complainant in the case alleged that the appellant had entered her house at night, having obtained a key, threatened her with a knife and raped her.  Williamson at first denied that he had been in the house at all, then when he was confronted with DNA evidence linking him with semen on the complainant's underwear he changed his defence to one of consent, claiming that he had lied earlier because of his shock at being arrested.  The issue of fact was accordingly a straight conflict between the complainant and the appellant, and its resolution depended upon whether the jury were sure that the complainant's version was the correct one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76.&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the members of the jury was a solicitor employed by the CPS named Martin McKay-Smith.  In accordance with the CPS policy he wrote to the judge after receiving a summons for jury service, setting out the work which he did, so that the judge could determine if he ought to sit.  He had never conducted a trial in the Crown Court and was then engaged in advising police on charging out of office hours.  There was no evidence that he knew any of the prosecution witnesses or any of the members of the CPS staff connected with the case.  He was not employed in the area which had conduct of the prosecution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77.&nbsp;&nbsp;When Mr McKay-Smith was called to sit on the jury the judge handed his letter to defence counsel, who on instructions sought to challenge him for cause.  The judge rejected the challenge, holding that if a member of the CPS staff with as little connection with a case could not serve, none could ever serve on a case prosecuted by the CPS, which was not what Parliament had clearly intended.  The Court of Appeal (para 73) held that on the facts of the case there was no basis on which to contend that fears as to impartiality could be objectively justified.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78.&nbsp;&nbsp;Williamson's appeal is the one about which some of your Lordships feel most concern.  My noble and learned friend, Lord Bingham of Cornhill, has expressed the view in paragraph 27 of his opinion that "justice is not seen to be done if one discharging the very important neutral role of juror is a full-time, salaried, long-serving employee of the prosecutor".  This is not a concern which one can lightly dismiss.  I consider, however, that there is considerable weight in two contrary factors.  The first is the point made by the judge, that if the jury service of CPS employees were to be confined to cases other than those prosecuted by the CPS, they would be ruled out of most trials and the intention of Parliament in the 2003 Act would be frustrated.  The second is the point trenchantly made by Lord Rodger in paragraphs 39 and 40 of his opinion, that an observer who took the view that the inclusion of a member of the CPS staff would of itself give rise to a real possibility that the tribunal was biased would be looking only at the formal employment of that staff member with the large CPS organisation.  Lord Rodger draws attention to the professional qualities of the ability to assess evidence in a realistic fashion possessed by an experienced CPS staff member, which should allay the concerns of the fair-minded and informed observer.  In my opinion these factors are sufficient to allay such concerns and such an observer would not conclude that the mere presence on the jury of a CPS staff member, who has no connection with the case or the personnel who prepared or presented it, would not make the trial unfair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79.&nbsp;&nbsp;I accordingly would dismiss all three appeals.</p>
<p><b>LORD MANCE</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the benefit of reading in draft the opinions of all of your Lordships. There is a division of opinion between your Lordships with regard to the appeals of the second and third appellants. The difference turns largely on different perceptions of the view that would be taken by a fair-minded and informed observer, after considering the facts, on the question whether there was a reasonable possibility that the jury was biased by the inclusion among its number of the relevant police officer or Crown Prosecution Service lawyer: see <i>In</i> <i>re Medicaments and Related Classes of Goods</i> (No. 2) [2001] 1 WLR 700 and <i>Porter v. Magill</i> [2001] UKHL 67; [2002] 2 AC 357 for the principle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of these two cases, the fair-minded and informed observer - a reasonable member of the public neither unduly compliant or naïve nor unduly cynical or suspicious, and adopting a balanced approach - replaced the court, whose view had previously been taken as the relevant test in <i>R v. Gough</i> [1993] AC 646. But the fair-minded and informed observer is him or herself in large measure the construct of the court. Individual members of the public, all of whom might claim this description, have widely differing characteristics, experience, attitudes and beliefs which could shape their answers on issues such as those before the court, without their being easily cast as unreasonable. The differences of view in the present case illustrate the difficulties of attributing to the fair-minded and informed observer the appropriate balance between on the one hand complacency and naivety and on the other cynicism and suspicion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event, despite my noble and learned friend, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry's observations in paras 38 to 42, I agree with the reasoning and conclusions in the opinions prepared by my noble and learned friends, Lord Bingham of Cornhill and Baroness Hale of Richmond. </p>
