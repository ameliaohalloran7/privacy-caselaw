<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;67.&nbsp;&nbsp;By the letter of 9 April 2001 from the UK Immigration Service to the respondent's solicitors the Secretary of State certified, pursuant to section 72(2)(a) of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, that the respondent's allegation that a person acted in breach of his human rights was manifestly unfounded.  In consequence the respondent was barred while in the United Kingdom from appealing under section 65 against the Secretary of State's decision to remove him to Germany under the Dublin Convention.  The effect of the certificate accordingly is that he could only appeal after his removal to Germany.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;68.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appeal before your Lordships' House has been brought against the dismissal by the Court of Appeal of an appeal from the decision of Richards J on an application for judicial review, whereby he quashed the decision of the Secretary of State to certify in this manner that the respondent's case was manifestly unfounded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;69.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Lordships dealt comprehensively in <i>R (Yogathas) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </i>[2003] 1 AC 920 with the test which should be applied by the Secretary of State when considering whether an allegation of breach of human rights is manifestly unfounded.  It is unnecessary now to say more than that before certifying he must be reasonably and conscientiously satisfied that the application must fail.  As Lord Bingham of Cornhill stated at paragraph 16 of his opinion in this appeal, in considering an application for judicial review of the decision to certify the court is exercising a supervisory jurisdiction, although one calling for the degree of careful scrutiny appropriate to the seriousness of the subject matter.  As he also stated, the reviewing court must consider how an appeal would be likely to fare before an adjudicator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary of State had before him the opinions expressed by Dr Sathananthan in his several reports, and in the absence of any other medical knowledge he was obliged for the purposes of considering the issue of a certificate to accept their correctness.  It is common case that the adjudicator, if hearing an appeal now, would be entitled and bound to have regard to any further material evidence produced.  Further reports given after the date of the certificate, in July 2001 and September 2002, were before your Lordships.  The high water mark of the medical evidence in the respondent's favour was the opinion expressed by Dr Sathananthan in his report of 18 July 2001, based on an examination of the respondent on 7 June 2001, that </p>
<p></p><ul>"I feel that sending him back to Germany or even to Iraq would be very detrimental to his mental and physical well-being.  I think he would make a serious attempt to kill himself."<p></p></ul>
<p>The picture painted of the respondent in his report of 24 September 2002 appeared somewhat less sombre, but Dr Sathananthan expressed concern that if he were returned to Germany his mental state would drastically deteriorate.  We did not have the benefit of any more up-to-date psychiatric evidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;71.&nbsp;&nbsp;In paragraph 4 of the decision letter of 9 April 2001 it was stated that the Secretary of State was </p>
<p></p><ul>"satisfied that your client's human rights would be fully respected in Germany and that your client would not be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment or  punishment if removed there."<p></p></ul>
<p>The reference is clearly to the requirements of article 3 of the Convention and there is no indication in the letter that the Secretary of State had regard to the possibility that article 8 might be engaged.  Indeed, the Attorney General argued on his behalf at the hearing of this appeal that as a matter of law article 8 could not be engaged in any circumstances.  It might be said that this alone constitutes a misdirection of himself by the Secretary of State which is sufficient to vitiate his decision.  It was clear, however, from the application for judicial review brought in May 2000 and subsequent correspondence that the applicant's solicitors were relying on article 8 as well as article 3 and a reference to both articles is contained in the letter of 4 July 2000 from the UK Immigration Service.  I would therefore be willing to assume for the purposes of this appeal that the Attorney General's argument had its roots in the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>R (Ullah) v Special Adjudicator </i>[2003] 1 WLR 770 and that the Secretary of State did take article 8 into account as well as article 3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reasons given by your Lordships in the appeals of <i>R (Ullah) v Special Adjudicator </i>and <i>Do v Secretary of State for the Home Department</i> [2004] UKHL 26, it must now be accepted that in principle article 8 could exceptionally be engaged by the foreseeable consequences for health of removal from the United Kingdom pursuant to an immigration decision, even though they do not amount to a violation of article 3.  In order to bring himself within such an exceptional engagement of article 8 the applicant has to establish a very grave state of affairs, amounting to a flagrant or fundamental breach of the article, which in effect constitutes a complete denial of his rights.  It is necessary accordingly to consider the present case in order to determine whether an adjudicator could arguable find that the removal decision is a breach of article 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not regard the conditions in which the respondent may be detained in Germany, taking the case at its height in his favour, as capable in themselves of constituting such a flagrant breach.  They may be regarded as somewhat spartan and it would be legitimate to argue that they are repressive, but in my judgment they fall a long way short of a flagrant violation of the respondent's article 8 rights.  If he is to make out any case under article 8 I consider that it must be founded on the possible effects on his mental health.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74.&nbsp;&nbsp;The precise extent of the interests which article 8 is capable of protecting still remains to some degree uncertain and, as my noble and learned friend Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe pointed out in his opinion in the present appeal, the language of some of the statements in the Strasbourg jurisprudence must be treated with some caution.  It does appear to be clear enough, however, from pp 219 - 220, para 47 of the judgment in <i>Bensaid v United Kingdom </i>(2001) 33 EHRR 205 that the preservation of mental stability can be regarded as a right protected by article 8.  The issue therefore is whether the removal of the respondent to a third country Germany could arguably be said to amount to a flagrant denial of his article 8 right to the preservation of his mental stability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, I think, important to note that the deleterious effects on the respondent's mental health described by Dr Sathananthan appear to stem from his fear that Germany will decide to return him to Iraq.  It is to be assumed that Germany will observe its obligations under the Geneva Convention and the European Convention on Human Rights and will properly and conscientiously apply their provisions.  If that be so, then the respondent's fears should be regarded as lacking in rational foundation.  If they nevertheless exist in an extreme form, sufficient to make him suicidal at the prospect of removal to Germany, even if unjustified or irrationally held, the question has to be considered whether that may arguably be sufficient to found an allegation that his article 8 rights have been violated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion it could in principle be sufficient on a tenable view of the facts placed before us.  It seems to me that the decider, whether it be the Secretary of State, an adjudicator or the court, should base a decision on the actual state in which the respondent may find himself, whether or not it is rationally justifiable.  This appears to be consistent with the emphasis in the judgment of the ECtHR in <i>Tomic v United Kingdom </i>(Application No 17837/03) (unreported) 14 October 2003  upon the risk of harm capable of engaging the responsibility of the respondent government.  That decision concerned the admissibility of an application founded on a claim that article 3 was engaged, but the principle seems to me to be the same, founded upon the effect of powerful humanitarian considerations.  Similarly, in <i>D v United Kingdom </i>(1997) 24 EHRR 423 the Court, in admitting a claim under article 3, was concerned with the effects upon the applicant and the certainty that he would suffer severely in the absence of suitable medical facilities in St Kitts to treat his condition.  I would mention also that this should not entail the adoption of a process of comparing levels of care in the expelling country and the receiving country, and I fully agree with the observations of my noble and learned friend Baroness Hale of Richmond in that respect in paragraph 63 of her opinion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the facts which were before your Lordships - which I would emphasise are far from up to date - I am compelled to conclude that an adjudicator might arguably hold that a sufficiently fundamental breach of the respondent's article 8 right to the preservation of his mental stability had been established to engage that article.  The adjudicator would then have to consider the effect of article 8(2), which will require the striking of a fair balance, in the manner referred to by Lord Bingham of Cornhill in paragraph 20 of his opinion.  This has not received consideration by the Secretary of State or the judge.  The factors which would have to be assessed on the application of article 8(2) are potent indicators in favour of upholding the operation of immigration control and affirming decisions to refuse entry to persons such as the respondent.  I could not be fully satisfied, however, that the case is so clear in favour of upholding the decision to remove the respondent that no reasonable adjudicator could hold otherwise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78.&nbsp;&nbsp;I accordingly conclude, not without very considerable hesitation, that for the reasons which I have given the decision of the Secretary of State must be set aside.  In so holding, however, I have to emphasise that the decision of the House goes no further than to determine the question of law submitted to it whether the Secretary of State was justified in ruling out an appeal <i>in limine </i>on the ground that the respondent's allegation was manifestly unfounded.  We cannot attempt to say how the case will appear before an adjudicator who has full information of the current state of the respondent's mental health and the facilities which will be available to him in Germany and is in a position to test the evidence of the respondent and the reliability of any medical opinions adduced.  Still less can we give any indication how we think the adjudicator is likely to decide the substantive issue if an appeal is brought from the decision to remove the respondent.</p>
