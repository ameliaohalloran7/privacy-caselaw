<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81. I would accept also that the character of things that a court may do which are incompatible with a person's right to a fair trial under article 6 of the Convention may be indistinguishable from that of things done by a prosecutor.  Some of the things which a court does may be regarded as judicial acts.  Decisions made in the course of a trial by the trial judge as to whether to admit evidence and the directions which he is required to give in his summing up are judicial acts.  But other things that a court does which may affect the conduct of the proceedings, perhaps through its officials, are administrative in character.  If they are incompatible with a Convention right, they should be treated in the same way as acts of the same kind by the prosecutor which are incompatible with the defendant's right to a fair trial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82. On the other hand, as Mr Emmerson for the interveners pointed out, there is room for the view that some judicial acts may be distinguished from others on the ground that, as a result of one or more provisions of primary legislation, the public authority could not have acted differently: see section 6(2)(a) of the 1998 Act.  Acts to which that subsection applies are not made unlawful by section 6(1).  I would prefer not to develop this point in any detail as it was not argued in <i>R v Lambert</i> and your Lordships would decide this case on other grounds.  But I think that it can be said that, as the direction by the trial judge which was under challenge in that case was in accordance with the meaning and effect of sections 5(3) and 28 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 as it was understood at the time when he gave the direction, no element of discretion was involved in what he did.  As the law stood at that time, in terms of section 6(2)(a), he "could not have acted differently".  On this approach his act was not made unlawful by section 6(1), so the appellant could not say that he was the victim of an unlawful act for the purposes of section 7(1)(b).  I should add that it was not contended in <i>R v Lambert</i> that what occurred in that case was due to any act on the part of the prosecutor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83. It would be possible therefore by this route to confine the decision in <i>R v Lambert </i>to its own facts.  Decisions of courts or tribunals made before 2 October 2000 which they were required to make by primary legislation are not affected by section 22(4) of the 1998 Act.  Section 22(4) requires section 7(1)(b) to be read together with section 6(1), as it presumes that acts of a public authority may be made unlawful by that subsection whenever the act took place.  But the Act does not say that effect must be given retrospectively to section 3(1).  As I indicated in <i>R v Lambert</i> [2001]  3 WLR 206, 244, para 115, I would hold that the interpretative obligation in section 3(1) cannot be applied so as to change retrospectively the meaning which was previously given to a provision in primary legislation.  It does not make unlawful acts of courts or tribunals or other public authorities which, as a result of provisions in primary legislation, could not at the time when the acts were done have been done differently: see section 6(2)(a).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84. I do not overlook the fact that in <i>R v Benjafield</i> [2001]  3 WLR 75, 92, para 48 Lord Woolf CJ said that section 3(1) cannot be considered in isolation, and that at p 94, para 53 he concluded that it has retrospective effect if sections 22(4) and 7(1)(b) apply.  In my opinion however the usual presumption that statutes are not intended to be retrospective in effect applies to section 3(1).  The fact that section 22(4) gives limited retrospectivity only to section 7(1)(b) supports the application of the presumption elsewhere in the Act.  Of course, section 7(1)(b) requires to be read with section 6 when it is applied retrospectively to pre-commencement acts.  This is because the purpose of the subsection is to enable a person to rely on a pre-commencement act by a public authority which is made unlawful by section 6(1).  But I do not find anything either in section 7(1)(b) or in sections 6(1) and (2) which requires retrospective effect to be given to section 3(1).  If that were to be done, the result could be that legislation which at the time of the pre-commencement act was being applied correctly according to the traditional rules of statutory interpretation must now for the purposes of section 7(1)(b) be given a different meaning which best accords with Convention rights.  Such a result could have profound consequences.  It would not be consistent with the general principle on which primary legislation depends, which is legal certainty.  So I would not extend retrospectivity to section 3(1), in the absence of an express provision to that effect.</p>
<i><p><i>Section 6(2)(b)</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85. In the present case the Crown says that the trial judge could not have acted differently, as he was duty bound to admit the compulsory questioning evidence.  This is because, according to the traditional rules of construction, it was lawful for that evidence to be used at the trial: see section 6(2)(a).  It also says, applying the same rules of construction, that the prosecutor was giving effect to section 433 of the Insolvency Act 1986 when he was leading and relying on that evidence: see section 6(2)(b) of the 1998 Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86. I agree that, applying those rules, the judge's act was not unlawful within the meaning of section 6(1), read together with section 6(2)(a), as he had no discretion to refuse to allow the prosecutor to adduce that evidence.  To do otherwise would have amounted to a repeal, or at least to a substantial repeal, of legislation enacted by Parliament which authorised the use of that evidence: see <i>R v Staines </i>[1997]  2 Cr App R 426, 442-443 <i>per</i> Lord Bingham of Cornhill CJ.  But I think that there is force in the point developed in written submissions by the Crown that the prosecutor's act also was not unlawful on the ground, reading section 6(1) with section 6(2)(b), that what the prosecutor was doing was "acting so as to give effect to" section 433 of the 1986 Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87. The  respondent and the interveners say that this is not so, as the prosecutor was entitled to make his own choice as to the evidence which was to be led at the trial.  They point to the fact that in February 1998 the Attorney General circulated a guidance note to prosecutors on the use by the prosecution of answers obtained under compulsory powers in criminal proceedings which illustrates this point.  It took account of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in <i>Saunders v United Kingdom</i> (1996)  23 EHRR 313.  In paragraph 3 of his note the Attorney General said that the prosecution should not normally use in evidence as part of its case or in cross-examination answers obtained under compulsory powers.  In paragraph 4 he said that there was a discretion for such answers to be used in evidence in particular circumstances, as where the defendant who provided the answers himself introduced them in evidence or where he was being prosecuted for a failure or refusal to answer.  So, it is said, section 433 of the 1986 Act could be given effect to according to traditional rules of construction by the prosecutor in a way that was compatible with Convention rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88. In my opinion however the question whether or not the prosecutor was giving effect to section 433 of the 1986 Act within the meaning of section 6(2)(b) does not depend on whether he had a discretion as to whether or not to use these answers in evidence.  The question is whether, having decided to use the answers and invite the judge to hold them to be admissible, he was doing what he was authorised to do by section 433.  It seems to me that there can be only one answer to this question.  According to the traditional rules of construction by reference to which at the time that provision was to be interpreted, section 433 authorised him to lead and to rely on that evidence.  He was entitled also to give effect to section 433 by asking the judge to hold that in terms of that section the evidence was admissible.  In this respect I would hold that this case is indistinguishable from <i>R v Lambert</i> and that it too can be decided by applying the provisions of section 6(2)<i>.  </i>I would hold that there was no act made unlawful by section 6(1) on which the respondent can rely in this appeal under section 7(1)(b).</p>
<i><p><i>Criminal Cases Review Commission</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89. Mr Krolick for the respondent submitted that, if he was wrong on his main argument about retrospectivity, the respondent was nevertheless entitled to the benefit of section 22(4) in this case because it had come before the Court of Appeal on a reference by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which is a public authority.  He maintained that, that being so, these were proceedings brought or instigated by a public authority within the meaning of section 7(6)(a) and section 22(4) of the Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90. As I am in his favour on the main argument but against him on the question whether there was an unlawful act I do not need to deal with this point at any length.  I am not persuaded that it is right to regard a reference under section 9 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1995 as a proceeding by the Commission.  Section 9(2) states that the reference, once made, shall be treated for all purposes as an appeal by the person under section 1 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.  The Commission takes no part in the appeal itself, the conduct of which is entirely in the hands of the person whose conviction is under review.  Nor do I think that it is right to regard the appeal as having been instigated by the Commission.  The Commission has power to make a reference without an application having been made to it by the person to whom it relates: see section 14(1) of the 1995 Act.  But that is not what happened in this case.  The reference was made in response to an application which was made by the respondent.  He took the initiative, so it would be more accurate to say that it was he rather than the Commission who instigated it.</p>
<i><p><i>Prosecution appeals</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91. Mr Krolick also submitted that, if he was wrong on the previous argument, the respondent was nevertheless entitled to the benefit of retrospectivity because the appeal to your Lordships' House was an appeal by the prosecutor and as such was to be regarded as a proceeding by a public authority within the meaning of section 7(6)(a) and section 22(4) of the Act.  He said that the respondent was entitled for this reason to rely on the violation of his Convention right in response to this appeal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92. Here again I do not need to deal with the point at any length.  It is sufficient to say that I would reject this argument on the ground that, for reasons already given, the reference to the Court of Appeal and the appeal to this House must both be regarded as part of the criminal proceedings which were initiated at first instance by the prosecutor.</p>
<i><p><i>Conclusion</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93. For these reasons I would hold that the Court of Appeal were right to find that the respondent was entitled to rely on the retrospectivity provision in section 22(4) of the Human Rights Act 1998 in his appeal.  But I think that they were wrong to declare his convictions unsafe on the ground that they were obtained as the result of the admission of evidence obtained in breach of article 6 of the Convention.  I consider that the act of the prosecutor was not made unlawful by section 6(1) as he was acting so as to give effect to a provision in primary legislation which, at the time when the act was done, could not have been read differently.  I would allow the appeal.</p>
<p><b>LORD HUTTON</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94. The respondent was convicted nine years ago in February 1992 by a Crown Court of two offences of obtaining property by deception and two offences contrary to section 354 of the Insolvency Act 1986.  He appealed against his convictions and his appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 12 May 1992.  It is clear that at the time of his convictions and at the time of the dismissal of his appeal his convictions were lawful and safe in accordance with the law of England.  The admission at his trial of answers which the respondent was obliged to give in his examination by the Official Receiver (which admission is now claimed by him to have constituted a breach of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights) was expressly sanctioned by Parliament in section 433 of the Insolvency Act 1986 which provided:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In any proceedings (whether or not under this Act)—<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;a statement of affairs prepared for the purposes of any provision of this Act which is derived from the Insolvency Act 1985, and<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;any other statement made in pursuance of a requirement imposed by or under any such provision or by or under rules made under this Act,<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>may be used in evidence against any person making or concurring in making the statement."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95. Subsequently in 1998 two of his convictions were referred to the Court of Appeal by the Criminal Cases Review Commission and in 2000 the remaining two convictions were also referred and the appeal was heard by the Court of Appeal in April 2001.  The Court of Appeal [2001] 3 WLR 751 allowed the appeal and quashed the convictions on the ground that the admission in evidence at the trial of the answers given in the examination by the Official Receiver constituted a violation of Article 6 of the Convention and were accordingly wrongly admitted in evidence so that the convictions were unsafe. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96. The judgment of the Court of Appeal was delivered before the decision of this House in <a href="/pa/ld200102/ldjudgmt/jd010705/regina-1.htm"><i>R v Lambert</i> [2001]</a> 3 WLR 206 and the Court of Appeal was of the opinion that, in the light of the authorities which were then before it, section 22(4) of the Human Rights Act 1998 applied to appeals, so that if evidence had been admitted in breach of Article 6 of the European Convention in a criminal trial prior to 2 October 2000 when the Human Right Act came into operation, convictions resulting from the admission of that evidence must be held to be unsafe, notwithstanding that the evidence had been properly admitted in accordance with the domestic law which was then applicable.  Therefore, "with no enthusiasm whatever" (see para 24 of the judgment) the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and quashed the convictions.  On the application of the Crown the Court of Appeal then certified the following point of law of general public importance:  "Following a reference to the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, is a defendant whose trial took place before the coming into force of section 6(1) and section 7(1)(b) of the Human Rights Act 1998 entitled, after they come into force, to rely on an alleged breach of his Convention rights whenever the alleged breach took place?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97. On this appeal by the Crown against the decision of the Court of Appeal two principal questions arise.  The first question is whether the decision of the House in <i>Lambert </i>can be distinguished.  If it cannot be distinguished, the second question is whether the House should depart from the decision in <i>Lambert</i>.  </p>
<i><p><i>Can the decision in Lambert be distinguished?</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98. Mr Krolick, on behalf of the respondent, and Mr Emmerson QC, on behalf of the interveners, submitted that <i>Lambert </i>can be distinguished on the ground that in that appeal the case made on behalf of the appellant was that it was the trial judge who had violated his Convention rights under Article 6 by directing the jury (as he was obliged to do under domestic law) that the onus of proof rested upon him to prove lack of knowledge that the bag he was carrying contained drugs,  whereas in the present case the respondent claims that it was the prosecutor who violated his Convention right against self-incrimination under Article 6 by putting in evidence before the jury, in exercise of a discretion, the answers which he had been compelled to give in his examination before the Official Receiver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99. I am unable to accept this submission.  Whilst in <i>Lambert</i> the House was considering a claim that the trial judge had acted in violation of Article 6, the ratio of the decision given by Lord Slynn of Hadley, Lord Clyde and myself was that on an appeal after 2 October 2000 section 22(4) of the 1998 Act did not operate so as to permit a convicted person to rely on a violation of a Convention right occurring in a trial before 2 October 2000.  Lord Slynn stated at p 210G:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is to be noted that section 7(6) distinguishes between proceedings brought by a public authority and "an appeal against the decision of a court" whereas section 22(4) extends the application of section 7(1)(b) only where proceedings are brought by a public authority.  This appears to indicate that an appeal by an unsuccessful defendant is not to be treated as a proceeding brought by or at the instigation of a public authority albeit in other contexts an appeal may be considered to be part of the proceedings initiated by a particular party."<p></p></ul>
<p>Lord Clyde, referring to section 7(1)(b) stated at 253C:</p>
<p></p><ul>"That subsection applies to "legal proceedings" as defined in section 7(6), that is, both "proceedings brought by or at the instigation of a public authority" and an appeal.  But the provision admitting reliance on earlier acts in section 22(4) is limited to "proceedings brought by or at the instigation of a public authority".  The use of the same language as was used in section 7(6) is significant.  In my view the intention is that section 22(4) should not extend to the other kind of "legal proceedings" mentioned in section 7(6), namely an appeal.  I am not persuaded that section 22(4) can avail the appellant."<p></p></ul>
<p>And at 263E, referring to section 7(6), I stated:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The subsection therefore distinguishes between "proceedings brought by or at the instigation of a public authority" and "an appeal against the decision of a court or tribunal".  Accordingly when section 22(4) refers, in identical words to the words of section 7(6)(a), to "proceedings brought by or at the instigation of a public authority", the retrospective operation permitted by that subsection does not apply to an appeal against the decision of the Crown Court in this case."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100. It is clear, in my opinion, that this ratio governs a case where the violation of the Convention right was caused by the act of the prosecutor (whether or not acting in the exercise of a discretion) as well as a case where the violation was caused by the act of the judge.</p>
<i><p><i>Should the House depart from the decision in Lambert?</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101. It is clear that there is a division of judicial opinion on the correctness of the decision of the majority in <i>Lambert</i> that the words in section 22(4) "proceedings brought by or at the instigation of a public authority" do not include "an appeal against the decision of a court or tribunal".  I recognise that an argument of considerable force can be advanced in support of the view that the decision in <i>Lambert</i> was erroneous.  This argument includes the points that the term "proceedings" usually includes an appeal from the court of first instance and that section 7(6) is not a definition section and does not purport to give exclusive meanings to "proceedings" in sub-clause (a) and "an appeal" in sub-clause (b).  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102. Nevertheless having considered the matter afresh I remain, with respect, of the opinion that the contrary argument is a stronger one and that the decision of the majority in <i>Lambert</i> is correct.  I think that when Parliament in section 7(6)  refers separately to "proceedings brought by or at the instigation of a public authority" and to "an appeal against the decision of a court or tribunal", and then uses only one of those phrases in section 22 (4) (which relates directly to section 7) it is clear that section 22(4) does not relate to an appeal.  Having separated the two subsets of "legal proceedings" in section 7(6) into "proceedings brought by or at the instigation of a public authority" and "an appeal against the decision of a court or tribunal", if Parliament had intended section 22(4) to apply to an appeal it would not have referred in that subsection to the first subset only.  It is a well established principle that when Parliament uses words in a statute those words should be given a similar meaning in other parts of the statute unless there is some reason to give them a different meaning:  see per Cleasby B in <i>Courtauld v Legh </i> (1869)  LR 4 Ex 126, 130. </p>
<i><p><i>Policy considerations</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103. I also think that there is an additional ground to that based on a consideration of the wording of section 7(6) and section 22(4) which supports the decision in <i>Lambert</i>.  This ground relates to the policy to which Parliament was giving effect in enacting section 22(4).  Mr Emmerson submitted in the present appeal before the House that the policy of Parliament in relation to section 22(4) was to ensure that if a public authority (including a prosecutor) brought proceedings against a citizen and prior to, or in the course of, those proceedings violated one of his Convention rights, he should be able to defend himself by relying on his Convention right even if the public authority's action in violating it had taken place before the Human Rights Act 1998 came into operation, and this policy required that this defence should be available in an appeal as well as in a trial at first instance.  In my opinion Parliament did intend that a citizen whose Convention rights had been violated before the date on which the Human Rights Act came into operation and was then a defendant in a trial after that date should be able to rely on his Convention rights at that trial.   However, there are strong reasons of policy, grounded in the need for certainty in the law and finality in litigation, why a conviction which was valid and lawful at the time it took place should not be set aside because of a change in the substantive law brought about by legislation.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104. In <i>R v Mitchell</i> [1977]  65 Cr App R 185, 189 Geoffrey Lane LJ stated:</p>
<p></p><ul>"This is an application for an extension of time in which to appeal against conviction.  It should be clearly understood, and this Court wants to make it even more abundantly clear, that the fact that there has been an apparent change in the law or, to put it more precisely, that previous misconceptions about the meaning of a statute have been put right, does not afford a proper ground for allowing an extension of time in which to appeal against conviction."<p></p></ul>
<p>And in <i>R v Campbell</i> [1997]  1 Cr App R 199, 206F Lord Bingham CJ stated:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It would be quite contrary to the general practice of this Court to permit convictions to be reopened because the law has changed since the date of conviction".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Minto and Cuthbert v Police</i> [1990-92]  1 NZ BORR (cited by Lord Clyde in his speech in Lambert at para 147) the appellants had been convicted of obstructing a police officer in the execution of his duty.  The Bill of Rights Act 1990 in New Zealand came into force four months after the convictions of the appellants.  On the appeal by the defendants Robertson J described the argument advanced by counsel on their behalf as follows:</p>
<p></p><ul>"He argued that s 16 (which guarantees freedom of peaceful assembly) altered the test for determining the lawfulness of police instructions by now requiring the police to do anything else which is reasonably possible to prevent a breach of the peace before interfering with a protester's s 16 right.  Further, he submitted that the Court should give the Bill of Rights Act retrospective effect, and decide that even if the police instruction was reasonable, and therefore lawful at the time it was given, s 16 retroactively made it unlawful.  Counsel's thesis was that the police must prove beyond reasonable doubt that there was no other reasonable way of averting a breach of the peace before the request could be upheld as lawful.  He argued that the "beneficial" effect of such a retrospective interpretation should overwhelm the presumption against the retrospective effect of statutes."<p></p></ul>
<p>Robertson J rejected this argument and stated at page 214:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Certainly, it would be beneficial from his clients' point of view to have their misdemeanour undone in this fashion.  But I do not accept that it would be "beneficial" for the law or society at large if a Court were to declare invalid that which was valid at the time it was done."<p></p></ul>
<p>Therefore I do not consider that in enacting section 22(4) Parliament intended that a conviction which was validly and lawfully imposed should be quashed on an appeal perhaps many years later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105. Mr Emmerson sought to answer this objection by submitting that appeals in respect of old convictions could be filtered out of the system by the Court of Appeal exercising its discretion to refuse leave to appeal out of time, or by the Criminal Cases Review Commission deciding, in the exercise of its discretion, not to refer old convictions to the Court of Appeal.  I am unable to accept this submission.  If it were to be established by a decision of this House, reversing the decision in <i>Lambert</i>, that section 22(4) applied to appeals to the Court of Appeal as well as to trials at first instance, I consider that where a person had been convicted before the Human Rights Act came into operation in a manner which violated his Convention rights he would have a strong argument that he should be able to rely on that violation in an appeal to the Court of Appeal.  He would be able to contend that it would be an improper exercise of the Court of Appeal's discretion to refuse him leave to appeal out of time having regard to the consideration that section 22(4) applies "whenever the act in question [ie. the breach of the Convention right] took place".  Where an applicant claimed that he had been convicted before 2 October 2000 in breach of a Convention right it would be difficult, in my opinion, for the Court of Appeal to formulate a principle which would permit some of those appeals to proceed out of time but which would exclude other appeals on the ground that the convictions were too old.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106. Section 9 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1995 provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a person has been convicted of an offence on indictment in England and Wales, the [Criminal Cases Review] Commission—<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a) may at any time refer the conviction to the Court of Appeal . . . <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;A reference under subsection (1) of a person's conviction shall be treated for all purposes as an appeal by the person under section 1 of the 1968 Act against the conviction."<p></p></ul>
<p>The argument that the Commission should exercise its discretion to filter out old convictions, notwithstanding that the manner in which they were obtained might well have constituted violations of Convention rights is, in my opinion, even less persuasive than the similar argument in respect of the Court of Appeal when one considers the reasons given by the Commission for referring the case of the intervenors to the Court of Appeal.  After the Commission had referred their case to the Court of Appeal in the exercise of its discretion under section 9(1) the Director of the Serious Fraud Office brought an application for judicial review against the Commission and the nature of the application was set out in the papers as follows:</p>
<p></p><ul>"1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The claimant [the Director of the Serious Fraud Office] submits that the Commission should have exercised its discretion not to refer the convictions of Mr Lyons and others to the Court of Appeal.  In particular, it is submitted that the Statement of Reasons does not show whether the Commission had regard to the consistent practice of the Court of Appeal when refusing leave to appeal out of time on the basis of a change in the law.  Further the Commission did not consider whether it would be desirable to leave the appellants to apply for leave out of time.  The Claimant also submits that the Commission should have referred a question for the opinion of the Court before making a reference of the convictions".<p></p></ul>
