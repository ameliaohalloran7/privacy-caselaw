<p align="right"><a href="total-3.htm">(back to preceding text)</a></p>

<p class="para">64.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have set out the two issues in what seems to be their logical order. But the Commissioners’ appeal (on the second issue) was opened before Total’s cross-appeal (on the first issue) and I will follow the same course. I gratefully adopt the exposition of the facts and the legislation set out in the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Hope of Craighead.</p>
<p class="hditl">The tort of conspiracy: background</p>
<p class="para">65.&nbsp;&nbsp;The essential dispute between the parties, on the Commissioners’ appeal, is whether the Court of Appeal was right in holding that, in order to establish the tort of “unlawful means” conspiracy, the claimant must show that the unlawful means constituted or included a civil wrong which had been committed by at least one of the conspirators, and was actionable at the suit of the claimant himself. The Court of Appeal made clear that it would not have reached that conclusion had it not felt bound to follow the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Powell v Boladz</i> [1998] Lloyd’s Rep Med 116. </p>
<p class="para">66.&nbsp;&nbsp;That decision referred (on the material point) to only three authorities, only one being a decision of this House, that is <i>Lonrho Ltd v Shell Petroleum Co Ltd (No. 2)</i> [1982] AC 173 (“<i>Lonrho v Shell</i>“). It might therefore appear to be a short point. But your Lordships have had the advantage of full argument and full citation of authority. Mr Flint QC for Total (echoing Lord Diplock in <i>Lonrho v Shell</i> at p189) urged the House not to extend the scope of an already anomalous tort. Against that Mr Martin QC for the Commissioners argued that on Total’s case the tort would be reduced to no more than a barren iteration of joint tortfeasance. In these circumstances it is necessary, I think, to go back to some of what Lord Diplock (in <i>Lonrho v Shell</i> at p188) called the tort’s “chequered history” between the first-instance decision of Lord Coleridge CJ in <i>Mogul Steamship Co. Ltd v McGregor, Gow &amp; Co.</i> (1888) 21 QBD 544 (“<i>Mogul</i>“) and <i>Crofter Hand Woven Harris Tweed Co Ltd v Veitch</i> [1942] AC 435 (“<i>Crofter</i>“). The decision of this House in <i>Crofter</i> can, I think, be seen as the final emergence of the tort of conspiracy in its modern form. But it is necessary to go back further to see why the tort is generally regarded as anomalous, and why the notion of “predominant purpose” or “real and predominant purpose” was defined in <i>Crofter</i> (especially in the speeches of Viscount Simon LC and Lord Wright at pp 445-447 and pp 477-478 respectively) as a necessary ingredient of an “unlawful object” (or “lawful means”) conspiracy.</p>
<p class="para">67.&nbsp;&nbsp;In looking at the older cases I have the advantage of traversing some of the same ground as has recently been covered by Lord Hoffmann in his opinion in <i>OBG Ltd v Allan</i> and associated appeals [2007] 2 WLR 920 (“<i>OBG</i>“), paras 6 to 21 and paras 45 to 64. In the latter group of paragraphs Lord Hoffmann concluded (with the concurrence of the majority) that a wrong actionable in private law is a necessary ingredient of the tort of intentionally causing harm by unlawful means (which I shall for brevity call “the intentional harm tort”). That may be thought to add a further layer of anomaly to the tort of conspiracy, if the Commissioners are right on the first issue. That there is an anomaly, or at least something calling for explanation, was recognised as long ago as 1889, when Bowen LJ said in <i>Mogul</i> in the Court of Appeal (1889) 23 QBD 598, 616:</p>
<p class="qt">“Of the general proposition, that certain kinds of conduct not criminal in any one individual may become criminal if done by combination among several, there can be no doubt.”</p>
<p class="para">He proceeded to state what he saw as sound reasons for the distinction, but some other distinguished judges have been more sceptical.</p>
<p class="para">68.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Mogul</i> the plaintiffs complained that the defendants (an association of shipowners) had conspired to obtain a monopoly of the China tea trade, mainly by offering a discount on the freight charged to those who confined their shipments to the defendants’ vessels. The claim failed at first instance before Lord Coleridge CJ sitting without a jury (1888) 21 QBD 544, before the Court of Appeal (Bowen and Fry LJJ, Lord Esher MR dissenting) (1889) 23 QBD 598 and in this House [1892] AC 25. The distinction between the two varieties of the tort was seen in terms of combination for an unlawful object, or combination to cause harm by unlawful means. The real difficulty (exemplified in the difference of opinion in the Court of Appeal) was in identifying what was unlawful, either as an object or as a means to an end, in the <i>laissez-faire</i> Victorian world of trade competition.</p>
<p class="para">69.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Coleridge CJ described the two categories of the tort 21 QBD 544, 550:</p>
<p class="qt">“And in this case it is clear that if the object were unlawful, or if the object were lawful but the means employed to effect it were unlawful, and if there were a combination either to effect the unlawful object or to use the unlawful means, then the combination was unlawful, then those who formed it were misdemeanants and a person injured by their misdemeanour has an action in respect of his injury.”</p>
<p class="paraleft">He was almost but not quite persuaded (pp 553-554) that there was a “wrongful and malicious combination to ruin a man in his trade". He concluded that:</p>
<p class="qt">“I cannot see that these defendants have in fact passed the line which separates the reasonable and legitimate selfishness of traders from wrong and malice.”</p>
<p class="paraleft">Here Lord Coleridge CJ was identifying the problem of mixed motives - the trader who wants to damage his competitor’s business because that will make his own business more profitable - which runs through the development of the law of economic torts, including conspiracy. This point was recently made by Lord Hoffmann (in the context of causing loss by unlawful means) in <i>OBG </i>[2007] 2 WLR 920 paras 134-135, quoting Lord Sumner in <i>Sorrell v Smith </i>[1925] AC 700, 742:</p>
<p class="qt">‘When the whole object of the defendants’ action is to capture the plaintiff’s business, their gain must be his loss.’</p>
<p class="para">70.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Court of Appeal in <i>Mogul </i>Lord Esher MR stated nine rules (23 QBD 598, 609-610). The first seven enunciated a doctrine of “fair trade competition” which, had they prevailed, would have set the development of the law on a very different course. They applied to all traders, whether or not they were acting in concert, and Lord Esher MR treated the defendants’ combination as a sort of <i>a fortiori </i>footnote (at p.710). But the views of Bowen and Fry LJJ (which were approved unanimously by this House) insisted in much-quoted passages (at pp 614-618 and pp 626-628) that trade competition, however fierce, was not unlawful unless it involved fraud, misrepresentation, intimidation or molestation; that the defendants did not intend to injure their competitors further than was necessarily involved in the activity of competition; and that a combination of traders to engage in such activity did not amount to an unlawful conspiracy, although the doctrine of restraint of trade might make it unenforceable.  </p>
<p class="para">71.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Allen v Flood </i>[1898] AC 1, the case about the demarcation dispute between the ironworkers and the woodworkers at a shipyard in Millwall, was regarded at the time as a case of the highest importance, and its importance is still recognised over a century later. It was first argued over four days before an appellate committee of seven, and then again over six days before a committee of nine (three Lords of Appeal in Ordinary and six other peers who held or had held high judicial office). On the second occasion eight judges attended to give the House the benefit of their opinions (the last time that ever occurred). The judges divided 6-2 in favour of the plaintiffs (the respondents in the appeal) but the House divided 6-3 in favour of Allen (one of the three original defendants, but by then the only appellant). The Lord Chancellor, Lord Halsbury, presided but was in the minority. The case is of enormous interest as a matter of legal and social history (see RFV Heuston, Legal Prosopography (1986) 102 LQR 90). But as regards conspiracy it is of limited importance since although conspiracy was an issue on the pleadings, at first instance (Kennedy J with a jury) the judge ruled that there was no evidence of conspiracy (or of intimidation, coercion or breach of contract). Allen, the London representative of the Boilermakers’ Society, had simply been summoned to the shipyard, and (acting on his own initiative) told the management what would happen if Flood and Taylor (woodworkers who were known to have done ironwork at another yard) were not discharged (as they could be without a breach of contract, since they were employed by the day). The absence of a conspiracy was most strongly emphasised by Lord Macnaghten [1898] AC1, 153:</p>
<p class="qt">“the decision of this case can have no bearing on any case which involves the element of oppressive combination.  The vice of that form of terrorism commonly known by the name of ‘boycotting,’ and other forms of oppressive combination, seem to me to depend on considerations which are, I think, in the present case conspicuously absent.”</p>
<p class="para">72.&nbsp;&nbsp;To my mind the main significance of <i>Allen v Flood </i>to the present appeal is in explaining the delicacy with which, about four years later, the House approached <i>Quinn v Leathem </i>[1901] AC 495. The Earl of Halsbury LC was again presiding, and the committee included several law lords who had sat in <i>Allen v Flood</i>. (Heuston’s article does not advert to the curious fact that when this House gave judgment on 5 August 1901, there were according to the Law Reports six speeches, given by the Earl of Halsbury LC, Lord Macnaghten, Lord Shand, Lord Brampton, Lord Robertson and Lord Lindley. Lord Davey is recorded as having read the speeches of Lord Shand, Lord Robertson and Lord Lindley but not as having given any speech of his own. Mr G R Dymond of the House of Lords Library has kindly checked that the Lords’ Journals confirm what is in the Law Reports.)  </p>
<p class="para">73.&nbsp;&nbsp;Quinn<i> </i>was treasurer of a Belfast butchers’ association. Leathem, who traded as a butcher, employed some non-union men, although when the union made difficulties he asked for them to be admitted to the union, and offered to pay their dues. The union put pressure on Munce, a wholesale customer of Leathem, to stop buying his meat. It also called out Dickie, one of Leathem’s employees. The jury found for Leathem, holding that there had been a malicious conspiracy between Quinn and other officers of the union. The Irish Court of Appeal affirmed this. So, unanimously, did this House. The House’s anxiety to explain why <i>Allen v Flood </i>was not in point makes it quite difficult to discern what <i>Quinn v Leathem </i>did decide. But it can, at any rate with hindsight, be recognised as a case of “unlawful object” (or “lawful means”) conspiracy, since (on the facts found) the union did not have the justification of advancing its own interests, and was acting primarily for the purpose of punishing and injuring Leathem (see especially the speeches of Lord Macnaghten at p 511 and Lord Shand at p 515; Lord Lindley, however, at p 538 seems to have regarded it as a case of unlawful means). In <i>Sorrell v Smith </i>[1925] AC 700 most of the House saw <i>Quinn v Leathem </i>as a case of unlawful object, not unlawful means (see especially Viscount Cave LC at p 712, Lord Dunedin at pp 719 and 724, Lord Sumner at p 735 and Lord Buckmaster at p 744).</p>
<p class="para">74.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Crofter </i>[1942] AC 435 the House, building on <i>Sorrell v Smith</i>, finally established the basic principles of the modern tort. There is a key passage in the speech of Viscount Simon LC at p 445:</p>
<p class="qt">“The combiners may feel that they are killing two birds with one stone,  and, even though their main purpose may be to protect their own legitimate interests notwithstanding that this involves damage to the plaintiffs, they may also find a further inducement to do what they are doing by feeling that it serves the plaintiffs right.  The analysis of human impulses soon leads us into the quagmire of mixed motives, and even if we avoid the word ‘motive', there may be more than a single ‘purpose’ or ‘object.’ It is enough to say that if there is more than one purpose actuating a combination, liability must depend on ascertaining the predominant purpose.  If that predominant purpose is to damage another person and damage results, that is tortious conspiracy.  If the predominant purpose is the lawful protection or promotion of any lawful interest of the combiners (no illegal means being employed), it is not a tortious conspiracy, even though it causes damage to another person.”</p>
<p class="para">75.&nbsp;&nbsp;Another very important passage is in the speech of Lord Wright, at p 462, and it has been the subject of a good deal of discussion before your Lordships:</p>
<p class="qt">“The rule may seem anomalous, so far as it holds that conduct by two may be actionable if it causes damage, whereas the same conduct done by one, causing the same damage, would give no redress. In effect the plaintiff’s right is that he should not be damnified by a conspiracy to injure him, and it is in the fact of the conspiracy that the unlawfulness resides. It is a different matter if the conspiracy is to do acts in themselves wrongful, such as to deceive or defraud, to commit violence, or to conduct a strike or lock-out by means of conduct prohibited by the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875, or which contravenes the Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927.”</p>
<p class="para">76.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, I would draw attention to three general features of the authorities down to, and including, <i>Crofter</i>. First, the debate is overwhelmingly about intention (or purpose, or object) culminating in the approval of “real and predominant purpose” (Viscount Simon LC in <i>Crofter </i>at p 446) as the essential ingredient of the “unlawful object” variety of the tort. Second, there is little or no discussion of whether unlawful means can include conduct which is a criminal offence but cannot found a civil cause of action. Most of the examples of unlawful means given in the speeches and judgments are expressed in general, fairly non-technical terms (fraud, misrepresentation, molestation, intimidation, obstruction). Lord Wright, in the passage just quoted from his speech in <i>Crofter,</i> includes some statutory offences, but he does not seem to have regarded it as a point calling for reasoned discussion. Third, there are frequent references (again, the quotation from Lord Wright in <i>Crofter</i> is an example) to the anomaly that the conduct of two or more persons may be actionable whereas the same conduct on the part of a single person would not be.</p>
<p class="para">77.&nbsp;&nbsp;This third point calls for a little more discussion. In <i>Mogul</i>, Bowen LJ (23 QBD 598, 616) gave two reasons for it:</p>
<p class="qt">“The distinction is based on sound reason, for a combination may make oppressive or dangerous that which if it proceeded only from a single person would be otherwise, and the very fact of the combination may shew that the object is simply to do harm, and not to exercise one’s own just rights.”</p>
<p class="para">The first reason is not very satisfactory, since (as has very often been pointed out, for instance by Lord Sumner in <i>Sorrell v Smith</i> at p 741 and Lord Diplock in <i>Lonrho v Shell</i> at p189) it all depends on the particular facts. The second reason seems to me more principled, focusing as it does on the fact that the claimant’s damage is caused by two or more persons acting in concert to carry out an unlawful plan. That is, I think, what was behind an observation of Lord Dunedin in <i>Sorrell v Smith</i> at p 725:</p>
<p class="qt">“Now the moment that that is recognised, ie, that the essence of conspiracy on which civil action is founded is a criminal conspiracy, though of course unless actual damage has followed no civil action will lie, the moment that fact is recognised, you at once bring in the spirit of the criminal law, where motive or intention—the <i>mens rea—</i>is everything.”</p>
<p class="para">That identifies what sets conspiracy apart from other torts, and emphasises the first point made above—the intense focus, in the tort of conspiracy, on intention. It is also worth noting that in some factual situations (such as that in the present appeal) the fraud disclosed by the assumed facts could not have been carried out otherwise than by a number of persons acting in concert.</p>
<p class="para">78.&nbsp;&nbsp;I suspect that the judges at the end of the 19th century also had a third reason, largely unarticulated but appearing in Lord Macnaghten’s dictum about boycotts in <i>Allen v Flood</i>. That was the deep suspicion which the governing class had, in Georgian and Victorian England, of collective action in the political and economic spheres, as potential threats to the constitution and the framework of society. It is a theme from the Gordon Riots in 1780 to the Land League in Ireland a century later (see <i>R v Parnell</i> (1881) 14 Cox CC 508), with the conventions called by the corresponding societies in the 1790s, the Peterloo Massacre in 1819, the Tolpuddle Martyrs in 1834 and the Chartist Movement (1838-1848) and the rise of the trade unions in between.</p>
<p class="hditl">The tort of conspiracy: the modern cases</p>
<p class="para">79.&nbsp;&nbsp;The litigation in <i>Lonrho v Shell</i> [1982] AC 173 arose from sanctions imposed against Southern Rhodesia, after UDI, under the Southern Rhodesia Act 1965.  Lonrho’s claim was that Shell and its co-defendant BP had breached the sanctions and caused loss to Lonrho and its Portuguese co-owner of a pipeline from Beira in Mozambique to a refinery in what was then Southern Rhodesia. The matter came before the court as issues of law arising on assumed facts in the course of an arbitration. The relevant issue was numbered 5(b):</p>
<p class="qt">“Whether the claimants have a cause of action for damage alleged to have been caused by such breaches [of the sanctions orders] by virtue only of the allegation that there was an agreement to effect them.”</p>
<p class="para">That is a rather bald way of putting the issue: the essential point was whether it was fatal that there was no pleading of an intention to injure Lonrho and its co-plaintiff, as Lord Diplock explained at p188:</p>
<p class="qt">“Question 5(b), to which I now turn, concerns conspiracy as a civil tort. Your Lordships are invited to answer it on the assumption that the purpose of Shell and BP in entering into the agreement to do the various things that it must be assumed they did in contravention of the sanctions Order, was to forward their own commercial interests; <i>not</i> to injure those of Lonrho. So the question of law to be determined is whether an intent by the defendants to injure the plaintiff is an essential element in the civil wrong of conspiracy, even where the acts agreed to be done by the conspirators amount to criminal offences under a penal statute.”</p>
<p class="para">80.&nbsp;&nbsp;So the question was clearly understood as being one of intention, and the reference to “criminal offences under a penal statute” (introduced as it was by the words “even where”) does not suggest that the criminal element was seen as a potential flaw in Lonrho’s case. Lord Diplock then briefly discussed the classic authorities on the tort of conspiracy; I have already mentioned some of his observations. He stated (at p189) that none of the authorities</p>
<p class="qt">“was directed to a case where the damage-causing acts although neither done for the purpose of injuring the plaintiff nor actionable at his suit if they had been done by one person alone, were nevertheless a contravention of some penal law.”</p>
<p class="para">He concluded that the House had an unfettered choice, and his unhesitating choice (agreeing with the courts below in their conclusion if not in their reasoning) was not to extend the scope of the tort, and to answer question 5(b) in the negative. The other members of the House agreed.</p>
<p class="para">81.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, the reasoning in Lord Diplock’s speech seems to me to be very compressed, especially in the passage from which I have just quoted. I am very conscious of the danger of trying to expound speeches and judgments (even of the most eminent judges) as if they were Acts of Parliament. It is a danger of which Slade LJ (delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal in <i>Metall und Rohstoff AG v Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Inc</i> [1990] 1 QB 391—”<i>Metall</i>“) was conscious. Nevertheless he did subject the speech of Lord Diplock to “detailed textual analysis” (as Lord Bridge of Harwich put it in <i>Lonrho plc v Fayed</i> [1992] 1 AC 448, 468—”<i>Lonrho v Fayed</i>“). In analysing <i>Lonrho v Shell</i>, Slade LJ also quoted from and paid close attention to the reasoning of the arbitrators, Parker J and the Court of Appeal, although it is far from clear that Lord Diplock (whose speech on this issue runs to no more than one and a half pages) had the reasoning in the lower courts at the forefront of his mind.</p>
<p class="para">82.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Lonrho v Fayed</i> this House unanimously disapproved of the views which the Court of Appeal in <i>Metall</i> had expressed about the effect of Lord Diplock’s speech in <i>Lonrho v Shell.</i> In doing so the House also clarified the law, which had fallen into some confusion as a result of <i>Lonrho v Shell</i> as interpreted in <i>Metall</i>. In those circumstances it is unnecessary and inappropriate, I suggest, for your Lordships to revisit the exegesis of Lord Diplock’s speech. It is sufficient to repeat that it was concerned solely with the issue of intention, and that Lord Diplock uncharacteristically failed to make a clear distinction between the requirement of predominant purpose under one variety of the tort of conspiracy and the lower requirement of intentional injury needed for the other variety.</p>
<p class="para">83.&nbsp;&nbsp;Clarity was restored by the speech of Lord Bridge in <i>Lonrho v Fayed</i> [1992] 1 AC 448, with which the rest of the House agreed.  (Lord Templeman also stated, with the agreement of the majority, that the ambits and ingredients of the torts of conspiracy and unlawful interference might require further analysis and reconsideration.) The key passage in the speech of Lord Bridge is at p464, after a citation of Lord Diplock’s reference to injury to the plaintiff being the predominant purpose of the conspiracy:</p>
<p class="qt">“But this reasoning has no relevance to the second type of conspiracy which employs unlawful means.  Of this type Lord Devlin said in his speech in <i>Rookes v Barnard</i> [1964]  AC 1129, 1204, . . . ‘In the latter type . . . the element of conspiracy is usually only of secondary importance since the unlawful means are actionable by themselves.’</p>
<p class="qt">It is no doubt for the reason mentioned by Lord Devlin that there is no direct authority, unless it be <i>Rookes v Barnard</i> itself, establishing the negative proposition that the tort of conspiracy to injure by unlawful means may be established without proof that the intention to injure the plaintiff was the predominant purpose of the conspirators.  But in the many cases where plaintiffs have asserted a conspiracy to injure, but have been unable to prove that any unlawful means were used, judgments in the Court of Appeal and speeches in your Lordships’ House emphasising the requirement of a predominant purpose to injure have repeatedly included dicta indicating that this requirement does not apply where the means used to effect the conspirator’s purpose are unlawful.”</p>
<p class="para">84.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Bridge then gave some examples, including a passage from the speech of Lord Wright in <i>Crofter</i>, of which I have already quoted part. He also quoted from the judgments below in <i>Lonrho v Shell</i> before coming to <i>Metall</i>. Of that case he said (at p468):</p>
<p class="qt">“My Lords, I am quite unable to accept that Lord Diplock or the other members of the Appellate Committee concurring with him, of whom I was one, intended the decision in <i>Lonrho v Shell</i> [1982]  AC 173 to effect, <i>sub silentio</i>, such a significant change in the law as it had been previously understood.  The House, as is clear from the parties’ printed cases, which we have been shown, had never been invited to take such a step.  Moreover, to do so would have been directly contrary to the view of Lord Denning MR expressed in the judgment which the House was affirming and inconsistent with the dicta in what Lord Diplock described, at p188, as ‘Viscount Simon LC’s now classic speech in [<i>Crofter</i>].’  I would overrule the <i>Metall</i> case in this respect.”</p>
<p class="para">85.&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to <i>Powell v Boladz</i> [1998] Lloyd’s Med Rep 116, which the Court of Appeal saw as compelling it to require civil actionability as an ingredient of unlawful means. It was a very unusual conspiracy claim, alleging falsification of hospital records. I need not go further into the complicated facts. Stuart-Smith LJ (with whom Morritt and Schiemann LJJ agreed) saw three answers to the claim for conspiracy. The second (at p126) is in point:</p>
<p class="qt">“Secondly the unlawful act relied upon must be actionable at the suit of the plaintiff. It is not sufficient that it amounts to a crime or breach of contract with a third party. (See <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i>, 17th ed. Para 23-80, <i>Marrinan v Vibart</i> [1963] 1 QB 234 &amp; 528, <i>Hargreaves v Bretherton</i> [1959] 1 QB 45, <i>Lonrho v Shell </i>[1982] AC 173 per Lord Diplock at p186 etc). For this reason this form of unlawful act conspiracy adds little to the remedies available to a plaintiff.”  </p>
