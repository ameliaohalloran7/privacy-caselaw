<p class="para">116.&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days later the European Court of Rights commenced its deliberations on another United Kingdom case, <i>Phillips v. United Kingdom </i>(Application no. 41087/98) decided 5th July 2001. Again, the argument was that the confiscation order proceedings were “a discrete judicial process which involved [the convicted defendant] being ‘charged with a criminal offence’ within the meaning of article 6(2)". The Court in paragraph 31 identified three relevant criteria: the classification under national law (under which in this case no new charge or offence was involved - the Court cited <i>R. v Benjafield and Revzi </i>in the Court of Appeal: [2003] 1 AC 1099), their essential nature and the type and severity of the penalty that the defendant risks incurring. Considering the second and third criteria, it noted - obviously as factors <i>favouring</i> the view that a penalty was involved - the statutory assumptions and the onus of proof on the defendant, as well as the substantial size of the relevant order (£91,400) and of the two-year consecutive sentence ordered to be served in default of its payment. But it went on decisively to reject the applicant’s case, saying:</p>
<p class="qt">“34.  However, the purpose of this procedure was not the conviction or acquittal of the applicant for any other drug-related offence. Although the Crown Court assumed that he had benefited from drug trafficking in the past, this was not, for example, reflected in his criminal record, to which was added only his conviction for the November 1995 offence. In these circumstances, it cannot be said that the applicant was “charged with a criminal offence". Instead, the purpose of the procedure under the 1994 Act was to enable the national court to assess the amount at which the confiscation order should properly be fixed. The Court considers that this procedure was analogous to the determination by a court of the amount of a fine or the length of a period of imprisonment to be imposed on a properly convicted offender. This, indeed, was the conclusion which it reached in <i>Welch</i> …. when, having examined the reality of the situation, it decided that a confiscation order constituted a “penalty” within the meaning of Article 7.</p>
<p class="qt">35.  The Court has also considered whether, despite its above finding that the making of the confiscation order did not involve the bringing of any new “charge” within the meaning of Article 6 § 2, that provision should nonetheless have some application to protect the applicant from assumptions made during the confiscation proceedings. </p>
<p class="qt">However, whilst it is clear that Article 6 § 2 governs criminal proceedings in their entirety, and not solely the examination of the merits of the charge ….. , the right to be presumed innocent under Article 6 § 2 arises only in connection with the particular offence “charged". Once an accused has properly been proved guilty of that offence, Article 6 § 2 can have no application in relation to allegations made about the accused’s character and conduct as part of the sentencing process, unless such accusations are of such a nature and degree as to amount to the bringing of a new “charge” within the autonomous Convention meaning referred to in paragraph 32 above (see <i>Engel and Others v. the Netherlands</i>, judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22, pp. 37-38, § 90).”</p>
<p class="para">Once again, it is clear that the assumptions made were regarded as a factor militating potentially <i>in favour of</i> the applicant’s argument that a new charge or offence was involved, but that this factor was outweighed by the overall purpose and effect of the scheme. Judges Bratza and Vajic dissented on the issue whether article 6(2) could have no application in relation to allegations made about the accused’s character and conduct as part of the sentencing process, unless they amounted to the bringing of a new “charge".</p>
<p class="para">117.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court in its judgment in <i>Phillips </i>also rejected submissions that the scheme for making confiscation orders infringed article 6(1) or article 1 of the first protocol. The Court noted that the requirement that the prosecution bear the onus of proof formed “part of the general notion of a fair hearing under article 6(1)", but added that this was “not, however, absolute, since presumptions of fact or of law operate in every criminal law system and are not prohibited in principle by the Convention” (para. 40). It accepted as legitimate the shifting of the onus of proof to the defendant under the statutory assumptions required to be made by s.4(3) of the Drug Trafficking Act 1994. It referred repeatedly to the standard of proof applicable to the confiscation order proceedings (under, at that time, the 1994 Act) as being “that applied in civil proceedings, namely on the balance of probabilities” (para. 22; see also the recital of the sentencing judge’s express references to this in paras. 13 and 14, as well as paras. 43-44). It recited at paragraph 13 the trial judge’s statements that:</p>
<p class="para">“It is for the prosecution to establish, of course, on a balance of probabilities that he has benefited from drug trafficking ….. Here there is no direct evidence of that so the Crown invite me to make the assumptions required by section 4(3) of the Act ……”</p>
<p class="para">as well as his further statements that the defendant “had failed to take obvious, ordinary and simple steps [to take to displace the assumptions and counter the prosecutor’s allegations] which would clearly have been taken if his account of the facts had been true". The Court at paragraphs 44-45 summarised these statements as part of the reasoning leading it to conclude that there had been no violation of article 6(1). Nowhere does the Court suggest that it saw or had any problem with the application of the civil standard to all issues involved in the question whether a defendant has engaged in and benefited from drug trafficking (see paras. 40-47). On the contrary, it is clear that the only difference that the Court identified or saw between proof by “direct evidence” and circumstances where the statutory assumptions were applicable lay in the onus, not the standard, of proof (see especially paras. 43-45 referring to and read with para. 13). </p>
<p class="para">118.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>R v. Benjafield and Rezvi </i>came to the House on appeal and was decided on 24th January 2002 [2002] UKHL and [2003] 1 AC 1099. Although the Convention rights were not strictly engaged (because the appeal related to a criminal trial concluded before 2nd October 2000 when the Human Rights Act 1998 came into force), the House of Lords focused primarily on the resolution of the issues on an assumption that the Convention rights did apply. Lord Steyn, giving the leading speech with which all other members of the House agreed, followed and endorsed the majority decision in <i>Phillips</i>, underlined the national and international policy objectives behind the 1988 Act, rejected the submission that its terms were disproportionate or inconsistent with the Convention rights and rejected an argument based on the principle of legality, saying that “There is …. no scope for the application of this principle in this case. the legislation is explicit in its terms and represents a fair balance between the interests of the individual and those of the community” (par. 19). For similar reasons he rejected an argument of abuse of process to the effect that “in making the confiscation order the court took into account counts that were undetermined", saying: “The premise of this argument is wrong: the judge rightly relied on the evidence before him in relation to confiscation and not on any undetermined counts. The confiscation regime is a fair procedure which takes account of the offender’s rights as well as the public interest” (par. 20).</p>
<p class="para">119.&nbsp;&nbsp;The next case is <i>van Offeren v The Netherlands </i>(Application no. 19581/04) an admissibility decision on 5th July 2004 by the Third Section of the European Court of Human Rights presided over by Judge Zupancic. Article 36e of the Dutch Criminal Code provided that “any person convicted of a criminal offence might be ordered in a separate judicial decision to pay a sum of money to the state in order to deprive him of illegally obtained advantage” (art. 36e par.1) and that such an order might be imposed on a person “who has obtained advantage by means of or from the proceeds of the said criminal offence or similar offence or offences for which a fifth-category fine may be imposed, in connection with which there exist sufficient indications that they were committed by him” (art. 36e par.2). In the case of a conviction of a fifth-category offence which had been preceded by a relevant criminal financial investigation the confiscation order could extend to any illegally obtained advantage if, having regard to that investigation, “it is likely that other indictable offences led in any other way to the convicted person obtaining illegal advantage” (art. 36e par.3). Article 511f of the Code of Criminal Procedure enabled the judge to derive the assessment of the actual amount of such advantage from any “legal means of evidence", including the accused’s own statements. </p>
<p class="para">120.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr van Offeren was charged with various offences, but convicted on 13th September 1999 of only four fifth-category offences, consisting of one weapon offence and three drug offences (transporting cocaine between 1st June and 8th October 1998 and holding cocaine and mannitol, destined to dilute cocaine, on 9th October 1998). Nonetheless, the Dutch courts by separate judicial decisions under article 36e concluded that he had engaged in cocaine trafficking, and that the considerable capital in the form of jewellery and cars, which he was shown to have held in the period between 1st January 1997 and 31st May 1998 when he was in receipt of welfare benefits, derived from cocaine trafficking (rather than an illegal trade in gold and cars, as the defendant maintained). The Court of Appeal (which evidently conducted a full rehearing, hearing evidence from seven witnesses, one of them subsequently charged as a result with perjury) reached the same conclusion, while varying the confiscation order in amount (pp.3-4). An appeal to the Dutch Supreme Court complaining that the confiscation order was based on an offence of which he had been acquitted, in violation of article 6(2) of the Convention, was dismissed. The Supreme Court held the procedure under both art. 36e pars. 2 and 3 of the Criminal Code and art. 511b was compatible with article 6(2). It made clear, inter alia, that “the circumstance that the suspect has been acquitted of specific offences does not automatically constitute an obstacle for considering those offences, in the framework of the confiscation procedure, as ‘similar offences’ or ‘offences for which a fifth-category fine may be imposed’ as referred to in Article 36e par. 2 of the Criminal Code” (p.8). Mr van Offeren complained to the European Court on the same basis as he had complained to the Supreme Court, viz that the confiscation order infringed article 6(2) “since it was based on a judicial finding that he had committed an offence of which he had been acquitted in criminal proceedings that had been brought against him” (p.9). </p>
<p class="para">121.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Human Rights quoted and applied the reasoning in its previous decision in <i>Phillips </i>to resolve the case. It held that, although the confiscation proceedings were disconnected from the principal criminal proceedings, “only a criminal conviction can trigger off a confiscation order procedure", so that the latter “must be regarded as forming a part of the sentencing process under domestic law” (p.10). It noted that it was for the prosecution, in the confiscation order procedure, to “establish a prima facie case that the convicted person has benefited from crime, i.e. from the offence(s) of which he has been found guilty and/or other offences of a similar nature", the onus then being on the convicted person to rebut such case. The Court said that, although the Dutch Court of Appeal had concluded that the capital acquired by the applicant between 1st January 1997 and 31st May 1998, by reference to which the confiscation order was made, must stem from drug trafficking:</p>
<p class="qt">“….. the purpose of this procedure was not the conviction or acquittal of the applicant for any other offences, but to assess whether assets demonstrably held by him were obtained by or through drug-related offences and, if so, to assess the amount at which the confiscation order should properly be fixed. In these circumstances, the Court is of the opinion that the confiscation order procedure must therefore be regarded as analogous to the determination by a court of the amount of a fine or the length of a period of imprisonment to be imposed on a person properly convicted of one or more drug offences and did not involve the bringing of any new “charge” within the meaning of Article 6 § 2 of the Convention (see, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, <i>Phillips v. the United Kingdom</i>, cited above, §§ 32-35.”</p>
<p class="para">122.&nbsp;&nbsp;The confiscation order in <i>van Offeren</i> was based on specific evidence of benefit by and of proceeds from drug trafficking of which the defendant had not been convicted. The Dutch Court of Appeal saw and relied on extensive evidence from the prosecution, including financial reports drawn up both before and during the proceedings and, in addition to the defendant, the seven witnesses to whom reference has already been made (p.4). The Court of Human Rights, reviewing the consistency of this procedure with the Convention, started with Dutch law, which it summarised as permitting a confiscation order to be based “also on the similar offence(s) of which he has been acquitted but in respect of which the judge is satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that there exist sufficient indications that he has committed them"; it went on to refer to article 511f (p.9). Later, in applying the Convention, it described the Dutch legal position as being that “the prosecution must establish a prima facie case that the convicted person has benefited from crime, i.e. from the offences of which he has been found guilty and/or other offences of a similar nature” and that “It is then for the convicted person to rebut the prosecution’s case by proving on the balance of probabilities, that the benefits in question were not obtained through such offences but have another origin not related to the offence(s) of which he was convicted or to any offence of a similar nature” (pp.10-11). This reference to a shifting of onus would seem to derive from the wording of arts. 36e pars. 2 and 3. The Court on any view accepted that it is entirely legitimate for a confiscation order to be made to strip a defendant of benefits from other similar offences (than those of which the defendant has been convicted) established by reference to a civil standard of proof; this, despite the shifting of onus to the defendant’s prejudice which the Court identified. </p>
<p class="para">123.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is impossible to think that, if there had been no shifting of onus, the defendant would in the eyes of the Court, have been <i>better able </i>to invoke article 6(2) of the Convention. It is impossible to conclude that the procedure followed was only permissible in the eyes of the Court because of the evidence of the defendant’s possession of jewellery and cars between 1st January 1997 and 31st May 1998. That evidence was only part of the documentary and oral evidence adduced before the Dutch courts; and there is no logical reason why a confiscation order procedure should be legitimate if it starts with evidence of unexplained property which it may then be inferred (or assumed) was acquired with the proceeds of drug trafficking, but illegitimate if it starts with direct evidence (including admissions) of the receipt of the proceeds of illegitimate drug trafficking. The European Court of Human Rights’ decision in <i>van Offeren </i>is thus authority that in a case mirroring the present a confiscation order does not involve “the bringing of a new charge".</p>
<p class="para">124.&nbsp;&nbsp;The next decision of the Court requiring analysis is <i>Geerings v. The Netherlands </i>(Application no. 30810/03) (2008) 46 EHRR 49, decided less than two years later by a section again presided over by Judge Zupancic and five of whose seven members had also participated in <i>van Offeren</i>. The applicant was accused of serial thieving between 1st August 1996 and 28th October 1997, but in the event he was on appeal on 29th January 1999 acquitted of all but two thefts and one charge of handling. Nonetheless, in the separate confiscation procedure following such convictions, the Court of Appeal held on 30th March 2001 that, although he had been acquitted him of most of the charges, there remained sufficient indications that he had committed them to justify a confiscation order based on their assessed benefit. The Dutch Supreme Court upheld the order made on this basis, by similar reasoning to that which they had adopted in <i>van Offeren</i>. The European Court held that there had been a violation of article 6(2). I set out the relevant reasoning in full:</p>
<p class="qt">“44.  The Court has in a number of cases been prepared to treat confiscation proceedings following on from a conviction as part of the sentencing process and therefore as beyond the scope of Article 6 § 2 (see, in particular, <i>Phillips</i>, cited above, § 34, and <i>Van Offeren v. the Netherlands</i> (dec.), no. 19581/04, 5 July 2005). The features which these cases had in common are that the applicant was convicted of drugs offences; that the applicant continued to be suspected of additional drugs offences; that the applicant demonstrably held assets whose provenance could not be established; that these assets were reasonably presumed to have been obtained through illegal activity; and that the applicant had failed to provide a satisfactory alternative explanation.</p>
<p class="qt">45.  The present case has additional features which distinguish it from <i>Phillips</i> and <i>Van Offeren</i>.</p>
<p class="qt">46.  Firstly, the Court of Appeal found that the applicant had obtained unlawful benefit from the crimes in question although in the present case he was never shown to be in possession of any assets for whose provenance he could not give an adequate explanation. The Court of Appeal reached this finding by accepting a conjectural extrapolation based on a mixture of fact and estimate contained in a police report.</p>
<p class="qt">47.  The Court considers that “confiscation” following on from a conviction - or, to use the same expression as the Netherlands Criminal Code, “deprivation of illegally obtained advantage” - is a measure (<i>maatregel</i>) inappropriate to assets which are not known to have been in the possession of the person affected, the more so if the measure concerned relates to a criminal act of which the person affected has not actually been found guilty. If it is not found beyond a reasonable doubt that the person affected has actually committed the crime, and if it cannot be established as fact that any advantage, illegal or otherwise, was actually obtained, such a measure can only be based on a presumption of guilt. This can hardly be considered compatible with Article 6 § 2 (compare, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, <i>Salabiaku v. France</i>, judgment of 7 October 1988, Series A no. 141-A, pp. 15-16, § 28).</p>
<p class="qt">48.  Secondly, unlike in the <i>Phillips </i>and <i>Van Offeren</i> cases, the impugned order related to the very crimes of which the applicant had in fact been acquitted.</p>
<p class="qt">49.  In the <i>Asan Rushiti</i> judgment (cited above, § 31), the Court emphasised that Article 6 § 2 embodies a general rule that, following a final acquittal, even the voicing of suspicions regarding an accused’s innocence is no longer admissible.</p>
<p class="qt">50.  The Court of Appeal’s finding, however, goes further than the voicing of mere suspicions. It amounts to a determination of the applicant’s guilt without the applicant having been “found guilty according to law” (compare <i>Baars v. the Netherlands</i>, no. 44320/98, § 31, 28 October 2003).”</p>
<p class="para">125.&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting with the second point (paras. 48-50), the correctness in principle of such an approach was in fact clearly raised both by the reasoning of the Dutch courts and by the complaint made to the European Court in <i>van Offeren</i>, in which case the European Court did not in any way disapprove it. In <i>van Offeren</i> the drug trafficking found by the Dutch courts and on the basis of which the European Court saw no objection to a confiscation order related to the period between 1st January 1997 and 31st May 1998, and the date(s) of the trafficking in respect of which there was an acquittal are not specifically given. But the reasoning of the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court as well as of the complaint to the European Court assumes that they were one and the same. The Court in <i>Geerings </i>believed that it could distinguish its previous decision in <i>van Offeren </i>as addressing a different factual situation, when in fact it was, and was certainly presented as, addressing a precisely parallel situation. Further, in justification of the approach taken in <i>van Offeren</i>, it can be said, as the Dutch courts said, that a distinction exists between being acquitted because the standard of criminal proof, beyond reasonable doubt or so as to be sure, has not been achieved, and being found liable on the civil balance of probabilities. In some contexts (e.g. the use of similar fact evidence in “brides in the bath” type cases: see <i>R v Z (Prior Acquittal)</i> [2000] 2 AC 483. and now Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003) great injustice could be done if courts were bound to treat acquittals as positive proof of innocence.</p>
<p class="para">126.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, one can, like Richards LJ in the Court of Appeal (par.  43) understand a court’s reluctance to endorse a confiscation order relating to “the very crimes of which the defendant has been acquitted". That, as it seems to me, must represent the point of public policy or public appearance which is the key to paragraphs 47-50 and to the approach taken  in <i>Geerings</i> (however inconsistently with <i>van Offeren</i>). If so, the present case is clearly different. There was no charge or acquittal here in respect of any of the drug trafficking offences which led the judge to conclude that the appellant had benefited and received the proceeds in relation to which the confiscation order was made. The potential affront to public perception involved in confiscation proceedings relating to the proceeds of offending of which the defendant has been acquitted is not present. </p>
<p class="para">127.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the first and second points made by the Court in <i>Geerings </i>are separate or interdependent is left unclear. But on any view the first point (pars. 46-47) involves problematic reasoning. In saying that the applicant “was never shown to hold any assets for whose provenance he could not give adequate explanation", the Court cannot have been suggesting that a confiscation order is only admissible in respect of current assets representing the proceeds of drug trafficking as at the date of the relevant order. Such a suggestion would undermine most previous domestic and Strasbourg decisions: e.g. <i>Benjafield</i>, <i>Phillips </i>and <i>van Offeren</i>, in each of which it is clear that much of the proceeds of drug trafficking to which the order related must long since have been spent. In the English and Welsh context, it would make it necessary, when applying the assumptions, to determine whether the property appearing to have been transferred to the defendant during the six year period prior to proceedings was still held by him (often most unlikely) and it would render entirely nugatory the provision assuming past <i>expenditure</i> during that period to have been made out of the proceeds of drug trafficking. So the Court must be taken still to accept as legitimate a scheme like the present English and Welsh scheme under which, if a convicted defendant is shown to have held unexplained assets at some past time or during some past period, then at least his current assets may, however innocently acquired, be confiscated up to the value of the previously held unexplained assets.</p>
<p class="para">128.&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming this to be legitimate, what of the next sentence, in which the Court dismissed the Dutch Court of Appeal’s finding as a “conjectural extrapolation based on a mixture of fact and estimate contained in a police report"?  This may well be a comment confined to the particular facts and the inadequacy of the proof adduced in <i>Geerings</i>. The disparaging reference to “conjectural extrapolation” based on “a police report” suggests as much, as Richards LJ also thought (par. 44). In its next paragraph (47), the Court also said that “confiscation” following on a conviction is “a measure inappropriate to assets which are not known to have been in the possession of the person affected".  If this means that it is necessary when making a confiscation order to establish that the defendant has benefited by and received proceeds from (here, drug) offending, and perhaps also that any resulting confiscation order should be limited to his realisable assets, there is no problem.</p>
<p class="para">129.&nbsp;&nbsp;The last two sentences of paragraph 47 in <i>Geerings </i>are particularly difficult.  Breaking them down and adding the bracketed lettering for convenience of reference, the Court says that [a] “If it is not found beyond a reasonable doubt that the person affected has actually committed the crime", and [b] “if it cannot be established as fact that any advantage, illegal or otherwise, was actually obtained", then [c] a confiscation order measure “can only be based on a presumption of guilt". Taken literally, if [a] and [b] are read cumulatively, the Court is reversing its previous case-law (<i>Phillips </i>and<i> van Offeren</i>), by holding that any application for a confiscation order involves a charge within article 6(2). The Court did not say this and clearly did not mean it, since it expressly accepted and distinguished <i>Phillips </i>and<i> van Offeren</i>. Secondly, read literally, the conjunction of [a] and [b] would also suggest that the Court thought that confiscation orders should be confined to benefit actually obtained from charges actually brought and proved beyond reasonable doubt. Again, that would reverse the whole previous jurisprudence. Thirdly, it is clear a “presumption” both of involvement in and of benefit from past drug trafficking can legitimately be derived from proof to the civil standard of assets at present or past dates (see e.g. <i>Phillips</i> and <i>van Offeren</i>, above, and <i>Grayson &amp; Barnham v. United Kingdom</i>,<i> </i>Application nos. 19955/05 and 15085/06). The conditions must of course be read in context, and [a] can be seen as reflecting and repeating the fact that the confiscation order in <i>Geerings </i>related to the proceeds of offences of which the applicant was charged but acquitted (i.e. “not found beyond a reasonable doubt” to have committed).  I suspect that [b] was simply added as a corollary of the inability to prove the charges of which Mr Geerings was acquitted, emphasising that, after such an acquittal, it is not permissible to suggest (“cannot be established”) as a fact that any advantage was actually obtained thereby.</p>
