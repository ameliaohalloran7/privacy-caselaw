<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;57. In my opinion there are no grounds for doubting that the Secretary of State was entitled to issue a certificate under section 72(2)(a) in Thangarasa's case in these circumstances. </p>
<i><p><i></i></p>
<p><i>Conclusion</i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
</i><p><i><i></i></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;58. There is an obvious tension between the need to make use of accelerated procedures to remove those whose claims for asylum ought not to be substantively considered in this country and the protections to which genuine refugees are entitled under both the Geneva Convention and the ECHR.  This places a special responsibility on the court in its examination of the decision making process.  As Lord Bridge of Harwich said in <i>R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex p Bugdaycay</i> [1987]  1 AC 514, 531, the basis of the decision must surely call for the most anxious scrutiny.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;59. The European Court has accepted that the process of judicial review, under which decisions of this kind are indeed given the most anxious scrutiny, is capable of providing an effective remedy: <i>Vilvarajah v United Kingdom</i> [1991]  14 EHRR 248, 292, para 126; <i>TI v United Kingdom</i> [2000]  INLR 211, 233.  In my opinion the scrutiny which the courts below gave to the decisions which are under challenge in these appeals fully measures up to this standard, and I agree with them as to the result. For these reasons, and those given by Lord Bingham and Lord Hutton with which I agree, I would dismiss the appeals.</p>
<b><u>
</u></b><p><b>LORD HUTTON</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60. The background facts in these two cases and the grounds on which the two appellants bring these appeals to the House have been fully set out in the opinions of my noble and learned friends Lord Hope of Craighead and  Lord Scott of Foscote and I gratefully adopt their accounts.  As they have explained, the case advanced by the appellant Mr Yogathas arises under Section 2(2)(c) of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996, ("the 1996 Act") which relates to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees ("the Geneva Convention") and the case advanced by the appellant Mr Thangarasa arises under sections 65 and 72(2)(a) of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 ("the 1999 Act") which relates to the human rights declared in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms ("the European Convention") and protected by section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998.  The issues in these appeals are whether the rights of Mr Yogathas under the Geneva Convention and the rights of Mr Thangarasa under the European Convention are violated by the decisions of the Secretary of State to direct the removal of each appellant to Germany.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;61. In considering these issues it is relevant to state at the outset four principles which are established by the decision of the European Court of Human Rights ("the European Court") in <i>TI v United Kingdom </i> [2000]  INLR 211.  Whilst the decision in <i>TI v United </i>Kingdom relates to alleged breaches of the European Convention I consider that these principles were also of relevance in considering alleged breaches of Article 33.1 of the Geneva Convention, and as I state in paragraph 62 of this opinion I think that the obligations of the United Kingdom under Article 33.1 of the Geneva Convention when considering the removal to another country of those claiming asylum are broadly similar to its obligations under Article 3 of the European Convention.  The principles established are these:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The United Kingdom will be in breach of its obligations under Article 3 of the European Convention if it expels a person to a country where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that he would face a real risk of being subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention (see page 228 A-B).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;The United Kingdom will also be in breach of Article 3 if it removes a person to a third country, where he will not be at risk of treatment contrary to Article 3, but where there is a real risk that he would be removed by that country to another country where he would be subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 (see page 228 E-F).  But the United Kingdom will not be in breach of Article 3 if it sends a person to another European country where there is no real risk that that country will send him to a country where he will be subjected to Article 3 treatment.  The Court stated at page 231G:</p>
<p></p><ul>"the court finds that it is not established that there is a real risk that Germany would expel the applicant to Sri Lanka in breach of Art 3 of the Convention.  Consequently, the UK have not failed in their obligations under this provision by making the decision to remove the applicant to Germany".<p></p></ul>
<p>Nor will the United Kingdom be in breach of Article 3 if it sends a person to another European country which will send him to a country where he would not be at real risk of being subjected to Article 3 treatment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;The second principle is applicable and the United Kingdom can be in breach of Article 3 notwithstanding that the person is removed from the United Kingdom to another country pursuant to the arrangements made in the Dublin Convention concerning the attribution of responsibility between European countries for deciding asylum claims (see page 228 F).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;The onus rests on the person alleging that his removal from the United Kingdom would constitute a breach of Article 3 by the United Kingdom to show substantial grounds for believing that he would face a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 (see pages 228 B and 231 G-H).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;62. I consider that the decisions of this House in <i>R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex Parte Bugdaycay</i> [1987]  AC 514 and <i>R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex Parte Adan</i> [2001]  2 AC 477  have established broadly similar principles in respect of the United Kingdom's obligations under Article 33.1 of the Geneva Convention which provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"No contracting state shall expel or return ('refouler') a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion."<p></p></ul>
<p>In <i>Bugdaycay </i>at page<i> </i>532D<i> </i>Lord Bridge of Harwich stated:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Suppose it is well known that country A, although a signatory to the Convention, regularly sends back to its totalitarian and oppressive neighbour, country B, those opponents of the regime in country B who are apprehended in country A following their escape across the border.  Against that background, if a person arriving in the United Kingdom from country A sought asylum as a refugee from country B, assuming he could establish his well-founded fear of persecution there, it would, it seems to me, be as much a breach of article 33 of the Convention to return him to country A as to country B.  The one course would effect indirectly, the other directly, the prohibited result, i.e. his return "to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened'."<p></p></ul>
<p>And in <i>Adan</i> at page 515C Lord Steyn stated: </p>
<p></p><ul>"It is accepted, and rightly accepted, by the Secretary of State that it is a long standing principle of English law that if it would be unlawful to return the asylum seeker directly to his country of origin where he is subject to persecution in the relevant sense, it would equally be unlawful to return him to a third country which it is known will return him to his country of origin."<p></p></ul>
<i><p>The Appeal of Yogathas </p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;63. The appellant, Mr Yogathas, challenges the validity of the Secretary of State's certificate under section 2(2)(c) of the 1996 Act that the government of Germany would not send him to another country or territory otherwise than in accordance with the Geneva Convention.  The appellant's principal submission was that the persecution and ill-treatment to which he claims he would be subjected if he were returned to Sri Lanka would not be by authorised agents of the state but by the Tamil Tigers or by members of the security forces acting without the approval or sanction of the state.  This House held in <i>Adan </i>that the only true and autonomous interpretation to be ascribed to Article 1A(2) of the Geneva Convention was that its protection extended to asylum seekers who feared persecution by those other than the state if, for whatever reason, the state in question was unable to protect them.  This interpretation has been termed "the persecution theory", but the courts in Germany apply a different interpretation, termed "the accountability theory", which is that international protection under the Convention only applies if the country of the person claiming protection is responsible for, or complicit in, the persecution which the person fears.  Therefore the appellant submits that as the persecution to which he claims he would be subjected in Sri Lanka does not emanate from the state a German court would rule that he is not entitled to protection under the Convention and that Article 33.1 does not apply to him. It follows that the United Kingdom would be in breach of Article 33.1 in removing him to Germany as this would result in him being removed from Germany to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;64. The Attorney General on behalf of the Secretary of State submitted in reply to this argument that the reality is that, notwithstanding the application by the German courts of the accountability theory, a German court would not send the appellant to Sri Lanka if there was a real risk that he would suffer ill-treatment or persecution at the hands of the Tamil Tigers or of individual members of the security forces.  The relevant provisions of German law are set out in Article 16(a)(1) of the German Basic Law and sections 51 and 53 of the German Aliens Act.  Article 16(a)(1) provides: </p>
<p></p><ul>"Persons persecuted on political grounds enjoy the right of asylum."<p></p></ul>
<p>Section 51(1) provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"A foreigner cannot be deported to a state in which his life or his liberty is threatened on the grounds of his race, religion, nationality, his membership of a certain social group or because of his political convictions."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 53(4) provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"A foreigner may not be deported should it appear from the application of the Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Liberties of 4 November 1950 (BGBI 1952 pp. 686) that the deportation is unlawful."<p></p></ul>
<p>Section 53(6) provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Deportation of a foreigner to another state can be avoided if there exists for this foreigner a considerable definite danger for body, life, or liberty in that state."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;65. In my opinion the argument advanced by the Attorney General is well founded.  The judgment of the European Court in <i>TI v UK</i> gives clear guidance as to the extent of the protection afforded under German law.  In the section of its judgment under the heading <i>German law concerning asylum-seekers and persons claiming protection,</i> the European Court states that because of the application by the German courts of the accountability theory an asylum seeker who claims that he will be subjected to ill treatment or persecution by persons who are not acting on behalf of the State cannot claim protection under Article 16(a) (1) or section 51 or section 53(4), but such a person can obtain protection under section 53(6).  The Court stated at page 222 E:</p>
<p></p><ul>"If the preconditions for the application of s 53(4) are not met, protection may be granted under s 53(6) of the Aliens Act, which grants a discretion to the authorities to suspend deportation in case of a substantial danger for life, personal integrity or liberty of an alien.  This applies to concrete individual danger resulting from either State or private action.  It does not require an intentional act, intervention or State measure and covers risks for life resulting from adverse living conditions, lack of necessary medical treatment etc. (FAC 9 September 1997, InfAusIR 1998, 125).  This provision has also been applied to civil war or war situations where the threat derived from a non-State source (Administrative Appeal Court of Baden-Württemberg decision of 11 May 1999, 6S 514/99)."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later in its judgment the Court stated at pages 230H and 231:</p>
<p></p><ul>"the Court notes that the apparent gap in protection resulting from the German approach to non-State agent risk is met, to at least some extent, by the application by the German authorities of s 53(6).  It appears that this provision has been applied to give protection to persons facing risk to life and limb from non-State agents, including groups acting in opposition to the Government, in addition to persons threatened by more general health and environmental risks.  It has also been applied to a number of Tamils, including a young Tamil at risk of ill-treatment from security forces due to the presence of scars on his body".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66. A further submission advanced by Mr Gill QC on behalf of the appellant was that the United Kingdom would be in breach of its obligations under Article 33.1 of the Geneva Convention in removing the appellant to Germany because the German courts, applying the accountability theory, would not decide the issue of his removal to Sri Lanka on the basis of the protection to which he was entitled under the Convention and in accordance with the Convention but pursuant to the separate German domestic provision contained in section 53(6).  I am unable to accept this submission.  If Germany would decide not to send the appellant to Sri Lanka because there would be a real risk that he would be persecuted or ill-treated in that country his rights under Article 33.1 are protected, notwithstanding that a German court does not directly apply Article 33.1 but applies a specific provision of German domestic law.  Therefore I am in full agreement with the opinion of Richards J in paragraphs 18 and 19 of his judgment and the opinion of the Court of Appeal in paragraph 21 of its judgment that the Secretary of State is concerned under section 2(2)(c) of the 1996 Act with the practical question whether the government of the third country would send the claimant to another country in breach of the obligations imposed by the Geneva Convention and not with the legal reasoning by which, or the statutory provision under which, the court of the third country would give protection to the claimant.  It is relevant to observe that in <i>Adan</i> the question before the House related only to the proper interpretation of the Geneva Convention and the protection given expressly pursuant to it and the issue of protection given under German domestic law which would, in its practical operation, provide the same safeguards as those provided by the Convention was not considered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;67. Mr Gill also submitted that when German courts considered the concept of "internal flight" (and I agree with Lord Hope and Lord Scott that "internal relocation" is a preferable term) they applied a standard which was stricter and less reasonable than that which United Kingdom courts considered was required under the Geneva Convention.  Lord Scott has fully considered this submission in paragraphs 111 to 116 of his opinion and I am in full agreement with the reasons which he gives for rejecting the submission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;68. Mr Gill further submitted that the burden of proof required by the German courts appeared to be different and more strict than that required by the courts in the United Kingdom, but in my opinion this is not a material matter which can affect the outcome of these cases.  In <i>TI v United Kingdom</i> the European Court stated at page 231:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Finally, as regards the applicant's arguments concerning the high burden of proof placed on asylum-seekers in Germany, the Court is not persuaded that this has been substantiated as preventing meritorious claims in practice.  It notes that this matter was considered by the English Court of Appeal and rejected.  The record of Germany in granting large numbers of asylum claims gives an indication that the threshold being applied in practice is not excessively high".<p></p></ul>
<i><p><i>The Appeal of Thangarasa</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;69. The issue which arises on Mr Thangarasa's appeal is whether the Secretary of State was entitled to certify under section 72(2)(a) of the 1999 Act that his allegation that his removal to Germany would constitute a breach of his human rights under Article 3 of the European Convention was manifestly unfounded.  The submissions advanced on behalf of this appellant were in large measure the same as those advanced on behalf of Mr Yogathas, namely, that because of the acceptance in Germany of the accountability theory, the appellant would not be given protection in Germany under Article 3 of the European Convention against removal to Sri Lanka where he would be at real risk of persecution and ill-treatment from Tamil Tigers and individual members of the security forces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70. If the question to be decided by a court was the substantive one whether the removal of the appellant to Germany would breach his human rights under Article 3 I consider, for the reasons which I have given in considering the appeal of Mr Yogathas, that the judgment of the European Court in <i>TI v United Kingdom</i> makes it clear that the removal would not constitute such a breach.  But that is not the exact question which was before Collins J and the Court of Appeal and is now before this House.  The question is whether the Secretary of State was entitled to certify that the appellant's allegation was manifestly unfounded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;71. Mr Gill submitted that the Secretary of State was not entitled to give such a certificate because, notwithstanding the judgment in <i>TI v United Kingdom</i>, the appellant's allegation gave rise to complex and difficult issues which were worthy of consideration by an adjudicator on an appeal to him under section 65(1) of the 1999 Act.  This submission was stated in the following terms in the appellant's case:</p>
<p></p><ul>"whilst the Secretary of State must of course have regard to the nature and volume of the case put to him, the overriding purpose of the relevant statutory provisions of the 1999 Act is to ensure that speedy decisions are made on a limited analysis of the material.  Unless it is quite obvious from a quick scrutiny that the material submitted by the applicant is complete rubbish which does not even engage the human rights issues involved in the removal, then, so long as the material reveals something of concern which may mean that the removal might be a breach of the applicant's human rights, the Secretary of State cannot say that the claim is manifestly unfounded; even though on careful scrutiny which does justice to the volume and nature of the case put to him he ultimately concludes that there will be no breach of human rights if the removal takes place".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72. I am unable to accept this submission and I am in agreement with the opinion of the Court of Appeal set out in paragraphs 57-60 of its judgment that an allegation is manifestly unfounded if it is plain that there is nothing of substance in the allegation.  I further agree with the reasons given by the Court of Appeal for rejecting the submission that the Secretary of State is only entitled to give a certificate if on an initial and cursory examination of the case it is plain that there is no substance in it.  Whilst the process in which the Secretary of State engages in coming to his decision will not involve as detailed a consideration of the facts and issues as would be involved in a hearing by an adjudicator under section 65 or by a court, the extent of the consideration which the Secretary of State will give to the issue will depend on the nature and detail of the arguments and the factual background presented to him by the applicant.  It is relevant to observe, as did Laws LJ, that the European Court on occasions considers a case in considerable detail before holding that the applicant's complaint is manifestly ill founded, and this was the practice it followed in the case of <i>TI v United Kingdom</i> itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73. In coming to his decision in Mr Thangarasa's case the Secretary of State took into account not only the judgment of the European Court in <i>TI v United Kingdom</i> but also the detailed knowledge possessed by the officials of his Department as to the way in which the German authorities and the German courts considered and determined asylum claims by nationals of Sri Lanka.  This knowledge is set out in statements which were filed before the House by Mr Ian Geoffrey Taylor, a senior executive officer of the United Kingdom Immigration Service, in which he states:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The German Federal Office for the Recognition of Foreign Refugees, the Bundesamt für die Anerkennung Ausländischer Flüchtlinge (BAFI) is the authority in Germany for processing asylum claims lodged in Germany.  The Unit which deals with transfers to and from Germany under the provisions of the Dublin Convention is part of BAFI.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>My understanding of how Germany deals with asylum applications from nationals of Sri Lanka, at a practical operational level, has been informed by considerable previous contact, at a working level, with the officials of BAFI at liaison meetings and at various international fora.  My understanding of the theoretical legal perspective in Germany has been informed both by contact with those responsible for asylum policy in Germany and as a result of advice commissioned from, in particular, Professor Dr Kay Hailbronner of the University of Konstanz, who is an internationally respected expert in asylum law."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74. Where an applicant challenges in the High Court the issue of a certificate by the Secretary of State under section 72(2)(a) the question arises as to the degree of scrutiny to which the High Court should subject  the decision of the Secretary of State.  It is apparent that there is a degree of tension between the need to make use of an accelerated procedure to enable the arrangements under the Dublin Convention to operate effectively and the duty to recognise the human rights of a person who, once he is in the United Kingdom, is entitled to the protection given by the European Convention.  In a well known passage in his judgment in <i>Bugdaycay</i> at p 531E-G Lord Bridge of Harwich said that "the court must, I think, be entitled to subject an administrative decision to the more rigorous examination, to ensure that it is in no way flawed, according to the gravity of the issue which the decision determines", and he then stated that where the administrative decision under challenge is one which may put the applicant's life at risk, the basis of the decision must call for "the most anxious scrutiny".  I consider that in a case where there is a challenge to a certificate under section 72(2)(a) the court must subject the decision of the Secretary of State to a rigorous examination, but the examination must be on the basis and against the background that, as I have earlier stated, the extent of the consideration which the Secretary of State will have given to the issue will have depended on the nature and details of the argument and the factual background presented to him by the applicant.  I further consider that in conducting this examination the court should, as stated by my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill in paragraph 9 of his opinion, take account of the need to ensure that insignificant differences between the law and practice of different countries and legal niceties and requirements should not be permitted to obscure the essential question which is, to use the words of Lord Templeman in <i>Bugdaycay</i> at page 538A, whether the Secretary of State had "adequately considered and resolved" the issue whether the applicant's claim that his human rights have been breached is manifestly unfounded.  The court should also have regard to the onus which rests on the applicant to show that there are substantial grounds for believing that if he were removed from the United Kingdom he would face a real risk that he would be subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3.  In the case of Mr Thangarasa I am clearly of the opinion that the Secretary of State did adequately consider and resolve the issue which arose under section 72(2)(a).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75. Whilst I consider that there is considerable merit in the suggestion made by my noble and learned friend Lord Scott of Foscote in paragraph 125 of his opinion that a practice should be introduced under which an asylum applicant will be required to disclose the papers relating to his earlier application in another Member State, I do not wish to express a final opinion on this point or on whether the mere conduct of the appellants in bringing applications for asylum in the United Kingdom constituted an abuse of process after bringing such applications in another European country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76. For the reasons which I have given, which are in general agreement with those given by Lord Bingham, Lord Hope and Lord Scott, I was of opinion that these two appeals should be dismissed.</p>
<p><b>LORD MILLETT</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77. I have had the advantage of reading in draft the speeches of my noble and learned friends, Lord Bingham of Cornhill, Lord Hope of Craighead and Lord Hutton.  The reasons they give are those which persuaded me, at the end of the hearing, to conclude that these two appeals should be dismissed.  I would add only that I think that there is much to be said for the practice which my noble and learned friend Lord Scott of Foscote recommends in para 125 of his speech; but that I too would wish to leave open the difficult question whether the bringing of a fresh application for asylum in the United Kingdom after bringing an application for asylum in another European country constitutes a prima facie abuse of process.</p>
<p><b>LORD SCOTT OF FOSCOTE</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>The Three Treaties</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78. These two appeals require the House to consider the interaction of three treaties, to each of which the United Kingdom is a signatory.  First, there is the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees ("the Geneva Convention") of 1951 as amended by the New York Protocol of 1967.  The Geneva Convention represented an international reaction to the plight of refugees fleeing from persecution in their countries of origin.  Article 33.1 of the Geneva Convention provides that</p>
<p></p><ul>"No Contracting State shall expel or return ('refouler') a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion."<p></p></ul>
<p>And Article 1A (2) defines "refugee" as including any person who</p>
<p></p><ul>"…. owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country …. "<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79. The Geneva Convention is not part of our domestic law but its provisions and requirements constitute the background to the asylum legislation in this country and provide the essential context for assessing the Government's asylum policy and the individual decisions taken by the Secretary of State on asylum applications.  A decision by the Secretary of State to reject an asylum application and return the applicant to the country of his nationality that appears inconsistent with the requirements of Article 33.1 is a decision liable, on a challenge in the courts, to be declared unlawful (see <i>R v Secretary of State for the Home Department</i>, <i>Ex p Adan </i>[2001]  2 AC 477).</p>
