<p align="right"><a href="total-7.htm">(back to preceding text)</a></p>

<p class="para">168.&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 4 of the Bill of Rights 1688 renders “illegal", “levying money for or to the use of the Crown", if it is “by pretence of prerogative, without grant of Parliament". It appears to me that, in order to decide whether this provision bars the present claim, it is necessary to identify the proper characterisation of the Commissioners’ claim. In particular, is their claim for damages in tort, or for recovery of tax, or indeed should it be characterised in some other way? In my judgment, the claim is not for recovery of tax, but for damages in tort. It is quite clear that the Commissioners’ case is pleaded, and has been argued throughout, solely in tort, as explained by Lord Hope in paragraphs 7 to 10 of his opinion. The Commissioners accept that Total is not liable for any VAT (whether by way of payment or repayment of tax or penalty) under the 1994 Act, insofar as it was in force at the time relevant for the purpose of these proceedings: hence the complete code issue. Indeed, they go further, and accept that, in order to succeed, they have to establish that a claim in common law is made out: hence the conspiracy tort issue. </p>
<p class="para">169.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, as my noble and learned friend Lord Scott has explained in para 59 of his opinion, the amount which the Commissioners would recover in these proceedings by way of damages would not necessarily be the same as the amount of tax out of which the Commissioners were cheated. The amount of output tax which should have been paid by Redlaw or, on the Commissioners’ alternative case, the amount that they wrongly paid to Alldech is not necessarily the same as their recoverable damages in tort. Unlike any tax so payable, the award of damages in tort would, of course, have to give credit for any VAT which had been paid to the Commissioners in the context of the totality of the transactions involved in the carousel fraud: such VAT would not have been paid if there had been no such fraud. </p>
<p class="para">170.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once one concludes that the claim which the Commissioners make is for damages in tort, it seems to me, in agreement with the Court of Appeal, that the basis of Total’s case on the Bill of Rights issue falls away. While the claim for damages may be assailable on one of the other two grounds which have been raised on this appeal, I am of the view that a genuine claim for damages in tort does not fall within either the spirit or the literal meaning of the words of Article 4 of the Bill of Rights. Seeking damages under a claim which is made pursuant to a properly established common law ground does not fall within the expression ‘levying money’ within the meaning of the Article, which, in my view, is directed to claims which would have no other legal basis than the fact that they are made by or on behalf of the Crown. That point is, I think, made clear by the words “by pretence of prerogative” in the Article. Looking at the realities of the early twenty-first century, as opposed to those of the late seventeenth century, the effect of the Article is that the executive cannot impose or claim a tax or other imposition without the authority of the legislature. </p>
<p class="para">171.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Crown has suffered a wrong which, in common law, would give it the right to claim damages, Article 4 of the Bill of Rights would not serve to prevent the Crown from raising a claim. If the Crown were to sue in debt for a sum due under an agreement or for damages for breach of an agreement, there would similarly be no ‘levying [of] money', and no “pretence [or invocation] of prerogative", because the juridical basis for the Crown’s claim would be an established legal right in contract, such as that enjoyed by any other individual or entity. So, too, if money were stolen from the Crown, it could maintain a claim for recovery or damages: again, there would be no “levying” or reliance on the prerogative: the claim would be based on an established legal right in tort.</p>
<p class="para">172.&nbsp;&nbsp;I should add that, if Article 4 of the Bill of Rights had otherwise applied, I would have unhesitatingly agreed with Lord Hope and disagreed with the Court of Appeal on the issue of whether it would have been open to Total to invoke the Article. Far from it being “a mockery of the law” for Total “as a fraudster” to invoke the Article, as the Court of Appeal suggested, it seems to me that such a statutorily enshrined unqualified fundamental right, intended to curb the powers of the Crown (and the executive), exists for the benefit of everyone. Indeed, it is when the unmeritorious seek to rely on such a right that it truly comes into its own and is properly put to the test. Outlawry, which is what the reasoning of the Court of Appeal appears to me to involve, may have existed in the past, but the concept has long ceased to be recognised by the law. As it is, however, it seems to me that this case is simply not within the territory of Article 4 of the Bill of Rights. </p>
<i><p class="paraleft">The complete code issue: Does the 1994 Act preclude the claim?</p>
</i>
<p class="para">173.&nbsp;&nbsp;That, then, leads to the question whether a common law claim, such as that sought to be raised by the Commissioners in the present case, is precluded by the 1994 Act, and in particular its provisions relating to the functions of the Commissioners, the recovery of VAT and other sums, and procedures and the like. </p>
<p class="para">174.&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue is not dissimilar from that in <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Group plc v Inland Revenue Commissioners </i>[2007] 1 AC 558, to which your Lordships were referred and in which my noble and learned friend Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe said <i> </i>this at para 135:</p>
<p class="qt">“When Parliament enacts a special regime providing special rights and remedies, that regime may (but does not always) supersede and displace common law rights and remedies (or more general statutory rights and remedies). Whether it has that effect is a question of statutory construction….”</p>
<p class="para">(A comparable point in relation to equitable rights was made by Lord Wilberforce in <i>Shiloh Spinners Ltd v Harding </i>[1973] AC 691 at 724G to 725C). In other words, one is seeking to discern from the terms of the legislation concerned whether the legislature intended a common law claim to be displaced by the Statute, as in <i>Deutsche</i> or to exist outside the Statute, as in this case.</p>
<p class="para">175.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is convenient initially to consider this issue separately in relation to the two alternative bases upon which the Commissioners put their case. The first is that each of the transactions in the carousel should be taken as genuine for VAT purposes, so that the payment by the Commissioners to Alldech was a proper credit of input tax. On that basis, the Commissioners contend that the conspiracy deprived them of the receipt of output tax due from Redlaw. The alternative basis is that the whole set of alleged transactions was a fraud and a deceit on the Commissioners, in which case the conspiracy resulted in Alldech being wrongly credited with, and paid, input tax by the Commissioners.</p>
<i><p class="paraleft">The claim based on unpaid output tax: general</p>
</i>
<p class="para">176.&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the 1994 Act constitute a “complete code” which excludes the Commissioners from raising claims for damages based on unlawful means conspiracy (which would otherwise be well-founded) in respect of any tax which should have been, but was not, paid to them? The reasoning of Lord Walker, Lord Scott, and Lord Mance (whose draft opinions I have had the benefit of seeing) as to why the Commissioners are entitled to maintain a common law claim in tort is powerful, and has resulted in even greater diffidence than I had already felt about reaching a conclusion to the contrary effect. </p>
<p class="para">177.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, in agreement with Lord Hope, I am of the view that the statutory scheme of the 1994 Act precludes the Commissioners from pursuing a common law claim for non-payment of VAT which they should have recovered. In other words I consider that not only the Commissioners’ right to recover VAT, but also their right to recover compensation for not recovering, or for wrongly being induced to pay, VAT, are exclusively governed by the 1994 Act, and that it is thus not open to them to raise claims outside that Act to recover damages for loss of tax which they should have recovered or which they should not have paid. Three aspects of the 1994 Act are relevant in this connection: the functions of the Commissioners, the remedial rights given to the Commissioners, and the procedural and similar stipulations relating to such rights. </p>
<i><p class="paraleft">The claim based on unpaid output tax: the Commissioners’ functions</p>
</i>
<p class="para">178.&nbsp;&nbsp;The contents of para 1 of schedule 11 changed in 2005, and, although it makes no difference to my conclusion, the relevant provisions are, in my view, those in force when the tax was lost and when these proceedings were issued. The fact that VAT was to be “under the care and management of the Commissioners” does not, as a matter of ordinary language, appear to me to carry with it a right to pursue a common law claim for damages, based on the contention that tax has been wrongly not paid to them or which has been wrongly paid by them, against someone who is not liable for VAT or any other sum under the 1994 Act. Nor can it be fairly claimed, in my opinion, that the pursuit of such a claim is within the ambit of the duty in the 1979 Act to “collect", “account for” or “manage” the customs and excise revenues. In these proceedings, the Commissioners are claiming neither VAT nor a penalty or similar sum under the 1994 Act, as is emphasised by their successful rebuttal of Total’s argument based on Article 4 of the Bill of Rights. </p>
<p class="para">179.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commissioners, an arm of the executive, appear to have suffered no loss if VAT which ought to have been paid or recovered is not paid or recovered: they have merely collected less tax then the 1994 Act intended. In this connection, para 1-39 of <i>Clerk and Lindsell</i> <i>on Torts</i> (19th Edition) starts with the proposition that: “the primary function of the law of tort remains to protect private rights and private interests". The exceptions that it then considers constitute breaches of public rights, which can give rise to claims by private persons who suffer particular damage. I consider that this reinforces the view that an action which results in non-payment of tax due under a statute should not amount to a tort actionable at the suit of the Commissioners.</p>
<p class="para">180.&nbsp;&nbsp;In another leading textbook, <i>McGregor on Damages </i>(17th Edition), it is stated at para 1-021 that “the object of an award of damages is to give the claimant compensation for the damage, loss or injury he has suffered". At least on the face of it, it is difficult to say that the Commissioners have suffered loss or damage simply because tax which they ought to have been entitled to collect is not capable of collection or because they have paid tax they ought not to have paid. The answer to that point might lie in para 5(1) of schedule 11, which specifically empowers the Commissioners to recover VAT payable under the 1994 Act as a debt due to the Crown. However, that appears to me to be directed to identifying how the tax is to be juridically characterised for the purpose of legal proceedings. Indeed, the paragraph gives some indirect support for the conclusion that there is no room for a tortious claim such as that raised in the present case. If the Commissioners were entitled to maintain a claim in tort arising out of non-payment of VAT, their right to claim VAT due under the 1994 Act as a debt would be <i>a fortiori</i>,<i> </i>and there would be no need for such a right to be expressly conferred. I would add that para 5(1) cannot have been inserted to defeat any argument based on Article 4 of the Bill of Rights, as the right to “levy” VAT is clear from other provisions of the 1994 Act, especially elsewhere in schedule 11. </p>
<p class="para">181.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mention has been made of sections 5, 9, and 25 of the 2005 Act. They did not come into force until 2005, and I therefore do not think that they could be relied on in this case, where the alleged tort occurred in 2002 and the proceedings were started in 2003. In any event, they would not cause me to change my view. Section 5 of the 2005 Act takes matters no further. Section 9 of the 2005 Act gives the Commissioners power to do things which are “necessary or expedient” for, or “incidental or conducive to", the exercise of their functions. These are general words, which are all contingent on their existing functions (i.e. the recovery of VAT and other sums statutorily levied on persons statutorily designated as liable), and cannot, to my mind, possibly extend the nature of the Commissioners’ powers to enable them to bring a common law claim against someone not liable for tax or other payment under the 1994 Act.  Section 25 of the 2005 Act is only concerned with rights of audience.</p>
<p class="para">182.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true, as Lord Walker has pointed out, that the Commissioners seek freezing orders and present winding-up petitions against defaulting taxpayers. However, it seems to me that such applications or petitions can fairly and properly be said to fall within the ambit of their statutory function of “collect[ing]” VAT as a “debt", and are now plainly within the powers given to the Commissioners by section 9 of the 2005 Act. I cannot agree that the fact they bring such proceedings with a view to recovering what is undoubtedly VAT (or other sums due under the 1994 Act), from someone who is undoubtedly liable under the terms of the 1994 Act, assists the Commissioners’ argument that they can bring proceedings for damages in tort against someone who is not a taxable person or otherwise liable under the 1994 Act. </p>
<p class="para">183.&nbsp;&nbsp;The successful claim for misfeasance by the Commissioners, as preferential creditors, against the receiver, and the debenture holder to whom he had wrongly paid out money, in<i> Inland Revenue Commissioners v Goldblatt </i>[1972] Ch 498 appears at first sight to present greater difficulties.  However (although Goff J said at 509B that counsel for the defendants “took every point that could possibly be taken”) the contention that the IRC had no power to bring the claim for misfeasance was not run - see at 501C to 502D. In any event, even if the point had been taken, the claim would, I think, still have succeeded, on the basis that the money paid by the receiver to the debenture holder was impressed with a trust for the payment of the tax -see at 507G to 508A. </p>
<p class="para">184.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also true that the Commissioners could bring claims in tort in some circumstances; for instance, if cash belonging to them was stolen from a vehicle. However, that would be a claim for money which was their property in their possession, albeit money representing what had been paid as tax. Such a claim would be covered by the passage quoted above from <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell</i>, as it would be a private law claim, albeit by a public body. Such examples do not, to my mind, assist on the issue whether the statutory scheme under the 1994 Act permits extra-statutory common law claims by the Commissioners to recover damages for not having recovered tax which should have been paid to them.</p>
<i><p class="paraleft">The claim based on unpaid output tax: statutory claims and remedies</p>
</i>
<p class="para">185.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second relevant group of provisions in the 1994 Act are sections 59 to 69, 72 and 73, which, when taken together, have a long and broad reach. It is important in the present context to note that those provisions extend (a) to many more payments than of the simple VAT which is described in sections 24 to 26, and (b) to persons other than the primarily taxable person under those three sections. </p>
<p class="para">186.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the 1994 Act deals with recovery of other payments (such as surcharges, penalties and assessments) effectively compensating for failure to pay VAT or to comply with other statutory requirements, where the non-payment, or non-compliance, has occurred through dishonesty, recklessness negligence or mistake. It is hard to believe that a common law right to claim for such failures should co-exist with those statutory rights. The legislation also often extends the Commissioners’ rights of recovery of such sums from the person responsible for paying the tax to others who are involved with the failure. Examples where others are rendered liable include sections 61, 72, 73(7B) and 75; many aspects of sections 65 to 69 also appear to me to be capable of extending to those who are not taxable persons. Again, it seems to me unlikely that the legislature envisaged common law claims being brought against such persons in addition to claims under the 1994 Act.</p>
<p class="para">187.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, a section 60(1) claim is excluded by section 60(6) where there has been a conviction, and many of the succeeding sections are expressly disapplied where section 60 has been successfully invoked or where there has been a criminal conviction. It cannot have been intended that the Commissioners could get round such exclusions, in cases where there had been criminal convictions, by bringing common law claims based on the defaults covered by those sections. </p>
<p class="para">188.&nbsp;&nbsp;An answer to these points might be that common law claims can only be brought where the statute does not provide a remedy. I am unimpressed with that argument for two reasons. First, and more generally, it strikes me as unconvincing and unattractive that the common law should be invoked to “fill in the gaps” in a taxing statute in favour of the Crown, by providing remedies for non-compliance, where the statute has many provisions which clearly provide such remedies. Secondly, and more particularly, it seems unlikely that it can have been intended that the principal wrongdoer, if convicted (e.g. under section 72, or of cheating the Revenue), can escape liability, whereas a person jointly liable with him, who has similarly been convicted, should not. It also seems unlikely that the principal wrongdoer could only be liable under section 60, while his fellow wrongdoers could only be liable in tort. </p>
<i><p class="paraleft">The claim based on unpaid output tax: procedure and mitigation</p>
</i>
<p class="para">189.&nbsp;&nbsp;The third strand of relevant statutory provisions are those relating to assessment, appeal, interest, limitation, and mitigation. If common law, as well as statutory, claims could be brought, these provisions serve to emphasise the curious differences which would arise between the two types of case. In my judgment, the differences become positively capricious once one considers a case of conspirators or other joint wrongdoers, some of whom are within the ambit of the statutory code and others of whom are not.</p>
<p class="para">190.&nbsp;&nbsp;The assessment provisions in sections 75 and 76, which enable the Commissioners to determine the surcharges, penalties and interest for which a person is statutorily liable under the preceding sections, would not apply in relation to common law damages, which would have to be assessed by the court. Nor would the procedural provisions of those sections apply to common law claims brought by the Commissioners. This would be particularly odd if one conspirator was liable statutorily (e.g. Redlaw under section 60) and the co-conspirators (e.g. Total) were liable at common law. </p>
<p class="para">191.&nbsp;&nbsp;The statutory appeal provisions in schedule 12 to the 1994 Act are designed to provide an exclusive set of routes and procedures whereby any liability determined by the Commissioners, whether to VAT or to any statutory surcharges, penalties or assessments, can be challenged. It would seem somewhat surprising if claims such as the present, which, while they do not strictly constitute claims for payment of VAT, nonetheless involve very similar considerations, should be subject to different procedures in different tribunals, namely the Civil Procedure Rules in the High Court or the County Court. Again, this would be particularly odd in a case such as this, where section 60 appears to apply to Redlaw, but not to Total.</p>
<p class="para">192.&nbsp;&nbsp;If common law claims could be brought, the interest provisions in section 74 would mean that different rates of interest could apply to claims under the 1994 Act and common law claims, and, indeed, that the interest might run for different periods. Once again, this would appear particularly odd where the Act applied only to the person who failed to pay the tax, but not to his co-conspirators.</p>
<p class="para">193.&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the time limits, sections 73(6) and 75(2) contain two year time limits, and, more generally, section 77 contains two or three year time limits and twenty year time limits. Thus, penalties, surcharges and assessments under the 1994 Act are subject sometimes to shorter, and sometimes to longer, time limits than would apply to any claims brought in tort, which would be governed by the Limitation Act 1980. Most claims under the 1994 Act are subject to a three or two year limitation period, which would represent an eccentric mismatch with the six year limitation period which would normally apply under the 1980 Act. If the Commissioners had an unrestricted right to sue in tort, then they would often be able to avoid the shorter limitation period in section 77. If the Commissioners could only rely on tort to “fill the gaps” in the 1994 Act, then it would be equally unsatisfactory. There would, in a case such as this, be different time limits for claims against joint wrongdoers, with the principle wrongdoer being liable under the 1994 Act, and therefore often benefiting from a shorter limitation period than could avail his co-conspirators. </p>
<p class="para">194.&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to some claims under the 1994 Act, including those under section 60, the limitation period is twenty years, which is again different from that in tort. In many cases it would be longer than the period under the 1980 Act, but bearing in mind the fraud and concealment provisions in section 32 of the 1980 Act, that would not always be the case. In any event, there would still be a curious mismatch between the limitation period appropriate for the principal wrongdoer under section 60, and that applicable to his collaborators if they are liable in tort. Accordingly, these procedural provisions also suggest to me that no claim such as that sought to be raised here could have been intended by the legislature.</p>
<p class="para">195.&nbsp;&nbsp;A claim based on tort for loss of VAT on a transaction would, as Lord Scott points out, have to give credit for any VAT paid on another transaction which was part of the same scheme; yet that would not be true of a claim based on section 60 - see section 70(4)(b). Further, although this may be less significant in practice, good faith would be a defence to a claim in tort involving dishonesty, but it would not operate as a defence to a section 60 claim - see section 70(4)(c). Even if common law claims are limited to “filling gaps", it seems unlikely that the legislature could have intended that quantum in statutory claims should be subject to different mitigation from that in common law claims, especially as common law claims will normally be against co-conspirators of the person who is statutorily liable.</p>
<i></i><p class="paraleft"><i>The claim based on wrongly credited and paid input tax </i> </p>
<p class="para">196.&nbsp;&nbsp;As already explained, the alternative basis of the claim involves treating the whole carousel, and each purported transaction within it, as a fraud and a deceit on the Commissioners. If each transaction can be treated as bogus, then the Commissioners’ claim fastens not on the output tax which should have been paid by Redlaw to the Commissioners, but on the payment by the Commissioners to Alldech in respect of purported input tax which should not have been paid. On that basis, the Commissioners’ case is that, as a result of a deception (to which Total was a party), they were dishonestly deprived of money. </p>
<p class="para">197.&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is whether this way of putting the Commissioners’ claim is also defeated on the “complete code issue". At least on the face of it, on this basis, the Commissioners would appear to have a strong argument to the effect that, while, at the time the money was paid to Alldech, they may have believed it to have been a payment in respect of input tax, it was not, and therefore the whole transaction was outside the ambit of the 1994 Act, and could properly be the subject of a common law claim. In other words, the Commissioners would argue that this was a straightforward case of claimants being defrauded of money by a deceitful statement, and the fact that they were led to believe by the deceit that the money was paid in the context of the VAT regime does not mean that that regime governs the claim. </p>
<p class="para">198.&nbsp;&nbsp;Attractive though that submission (and indeed its consequences) may be, it does not appear to me to tie in with the wide way in which the provisions of the 1994 Act, and sections 60 and 72 in particular, are drafted. Sections 60(2)(b) and 60(3)(a) extend the concept of “evading VAT” in section 60(1) to “obtaining…a VAT credit” where “the person concerned is not entitled to that sum” so that it plainly applies to a case where a non-existent VAT credit is falsely claimed. Section 72(2)(a), especially subpara (i), contain similar provisions for the purpose of extending the ambit of section 72(1). It appears to me, therefore that the legislature has decided to extend the statutory regime in explicit terms to cases where money is wrongly claimed and paid out as a VAT credit, which would apply here in relation to the claim made by Alldech. </p>
