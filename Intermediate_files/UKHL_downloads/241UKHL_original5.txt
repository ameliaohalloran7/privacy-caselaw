<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;133.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Mr Gregg is still alive.</i> The claim for lost years has been advanced on the basis of a comparison between Mr Gregg's statistical chance of being a survivor as portrayed by Professor Goldstone's model and his actual chance of being a survivor. While statistics are of assistance in calculating the latter, Mr Gregg's clinical history up to the moment of assessment is of critical significance. At the time of the trial, Mr Gregg had survived about five years from commencement of treatment and, having regard to his clinical history Professor Goldstone estimated his chances of being a survivor as 20-30%. By the time of the hearing before us, Mr Gregg had survived a further three years, without relapse.  This must plainly have resulted in a dramatic improvement in his prospects of being a survivor. It may be that his prospects of being a survivor are better than his statistical prospects would have been had his treatment been commenced timeously. This was not a matter that was raised at the hearing before us, but Mr Havers QC on behalf of Dr Scott now submits that, should the case be remitted to the trial judge for assessment of damages on a loss of a chance basis, he will have to take this into account in order to decide whether Mr Gregg has any claim for lost years. Alternatively he invites us to have regard to the implications of Mr Gregg's survival and to rule that no claim in respect of lost years has been made out.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary facts</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;134.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Statement of Facts agreed by the parties for the purpose of this appeal admirably summarises the primary facts as follow. Mr Gregg was born on 12 November 1951. In autumn 1994 he developed a lump under his left arm. This was due to a condition known as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a particular type of cancer. The cancer is of the subtype Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase Negative ("ALK Negative") which can be distinguished from ALK Positive lymphomas. The former type of cancer carries a worse prognosis. On 22 November 1994 he went to see Dr Scott, who was and is a general practitioner, for the first and only time. Among his complaints was the lump.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;135.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Scott concluded that the lump was a lipoma, that is a benign collection of fatty tissue, and that no further action was called for. The trial judge concluded that this was negligent, not because Dr Scott was not entitled to conclude that the lump was probably a lipoma but rather because he was not entitled on the information before him, particularly the precise location of the lump, to exclude more sinister pathology with sufficient confidence to warrant taking no further action. The trial judge found that Dr Scott should have referred the appellant to hospital on a routine basis in November 1994.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;136.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1995 Mr Gregg moved home and registered with another general practitioner. He saw this doctor on 22 August 1995 and, again, raised the question of the lump. That doctor, too, concluded that the lump was probably a lipoma but referred the appellant to a surgeon at the Lincoln County Hospital for further investigation and examination. In his referral letter he described the lump as having gradually enlarged over the previous year. When Mr Gregg was seen at hospital, on 2 November 1995, the surgeon arranged for an urgent biopsy, which confirmed the presence of cancer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;137.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was some delay thereafter whilst the precise nature of the pathology was identified. A CT scan did not reveal spread of the disease elsewhere in the body. Mr Gregg was awaiting treatment when he was admitted to hospital as an emergency on 13 January 1996 with acute and intense chest pain. This was the symptomatic result of the spread of the cancer into the left pectoral region.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;138.&nbsp;&nbsp;Chemotherapy was administered on six occasions and was then supplemented by a course of radiotherapy. Although the tumour responded, it did so incompletely. It was therefore decided that Mr Gregg should be subjected to high dose chemotherapy. This involved the harvesting of stem cells, the administration of chemotherapy and the subsequent replacement of the preserved stem cells. The treatment took place in Leicester in August 1996 and Mr Gregg was discharged in September 1996.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;139.&nbsp;&nbsp;In early 1998 Mr Gregg suffered a relapse when he developed a tumour in the right axilla, which statistically gave him a very poor prognosis. The result was that the chemotherapy which was then started was intended to be merely palliative. He was told that he could not be cured. "Cure" in this context means that the patient has survived for at least 10 years without evidence of disease. In April 1998 there was thought to have been another relapse, although this was never demonstrated histologically. Nonetheless, a further course of palliative chemotherapy was prescribed. Since then, there has been no recurrence of the disease, so far as the parties are aware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;140.&nbsp;&nbsp;The effects of the history outlined above have been devastating for Mr Gregg and his life. He suffered severe side effects from the original treatment, in particular the high dose of chemotherapy in August 1996. He had to give up work. He felt very ill and has continued to feel weak and lacking in energy ever since. Since his relapse in 1998 he has believed that he has been living on borrowed time. He was put on high dose steroids and became obese, as well as suffering when withdrawn from those drugs. Mr Gregg and his wife have been very anxious and distressed, and Mr Gregg has been preoccupied with his illness and possible death.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expert evidence</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;141.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before statistics could be used in the present case it was necessary to determine, as a question of fact, the date when treatment would have commenced had Dr Scott referred Mr Gregg to hospital in November 1994 and the extent to which his cancer had developed between that date and the date when treatment was in fact begun in January 1996. As to this the experts were in broad agreement. The judge found that, had Dr Scott referred Mr Gregg in November 1994, his cancer would, in due course, have been diagnosed and his treatment would have commenced 9 months earlier than it did, that is in about April 1995 rather than in January 1996. The judge further found, on the basis of the medical evidence, that the significant spread of the disease to the left pectoral region occurred in the last months of 1995, that is after the date that he would have received treatment had Dr Scott not been negligent. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;142.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the experts first advised in the present case, the use of the relevant statistics appeared relatively simple. There exists a prognostic index which is widely used as a predictive model for patients diagnosed with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This appeared to provide a satisfactory basis for estimating (1) what Mr Gregg's prognosis would have been had treatment begun in April 1995, before his cancer had spread, and (2) what his prognosis was having regard to the stage to which the disease had developed when treatment was in fact started. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;143.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the years that elapsed up to the trial, in which judgment was given on 3 August 2001, events occurred which rendered the use of the prognostic index much more difficult. The first was the discovery that patients, such as Mr Gregg, with the ALK negative sub-type have a less favourable prognosis than those with the ALK positive sub-type. The evidence in relation to this is "immature". Mr Gregg's expert, Professor Goldstone, nonetheless did his best to develop a model which adjusted the prognostic index so as to predict the expected fate of 100 patients diagnosed with the ALK negative lymphoma. The judge accepted the evidence that Professor Goldstone gave as the basis for deciding the questions of causation and damages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;144.&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter which made the use of statistics more difficult was the contrast between their indication of the probable progression of a patient in Mr Gregg's position and Mr Gregg's actual experience in the five years that elapsed between the commencement of his treatment and the trial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;145.&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge set out at length the statistical evidence provided by the experts in the period leading up to the trial and Professor Goldstone's oral evidence at the trial. Oral expert evidence was not adduced by the defence. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;146.&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Goldstone's model showed with some particularity the fate of those in his cohort of 100. The judge summarised this evidence in a paragraph which also included Professor Goldsmith's estimate of Mr Gregg's survival prospects as at the date of the trial: </p>
<p></p><ul>"Of those with initial treatment by CHOP chemotherapy with or without field radiotherapy 55 will achieve complete remission. 45 will not achieve complete remission, and of those 41 will then die. Four who did not achieve complete remission immediately will be brought to achieve it by further treatment of various kinds. Thus of the initial 100 59 manage to achieve complete remission. Of those 35 do not relapse. They are described by Professor Goldstone as the core group of survivors. 24, however, do relapse (usually, if they are going to, within two years or so of achieving remission). Of those 24 half, a further 12, will not be responsive to further treatment and will die. The remaining 12 will be responsive to further treatment, typically high dose chemotherapy with stem cell harvesting such as the claimant himself went through. Of those 12 half, a further six, will not relapse again and will become survivors. Of the remaining six who do relapse again, only one will survive. The number of survivors from the 100 who started out will therefore be 42. Mr Gregg's disease and treatment has not quite taken this course, since he is probably to be regarded as someone who attained complete remission only after stem cell treatment and high dose chemotherapy. But he is someone who, having received that treatment, subsequently relapsed. He may therefore be regarded as possibly the one survivor [at] the end of the process described in the model. He had after his relapse in early 1998 a 10% or 15% chance of survival. However, he has now survived over three years, and as time goes by the chances of relapse diminish. The best that Professor Goldstone can say of it now, however, is that given all that has happened, at present Mr Gregg's chances of survival for five years is less than 50%, though he put a figure of 20% to 30% as the present chance as best as he could assess it."<p></p></ul>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fallacy</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;147.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Statement of Facts and Issues agreed by the parties included a statement that the judge found that the effects of the delay in commencing Mr Gregg's treatment meant that his "chances of long-term survival fell as a result of the negligence from 42% (on initial presentation to [Dr Scott]) to 25% (as at the date of trial)". The Court of Appeal drew the same conclusion. I believe that it was fallacious. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;148.&nbsp;&nbsp;Latham LJ stated that the "the assumption was" that the cohort that made up Professor Goldstone's model "consisted of patients with the same stage of disease as that from which the appellant suffered at the time when treatment should have been commenced". This assumption was, I suspect, critical to the conclusion to which I have referred in my previous paragraph. Even if the assumption were correct I do not believe that the conclusion followed. But I question the assumption. When describing Professor Goldstone's model, the judge stated: "The 100 patients in the worked example include all ages, and also people with other unrevealed personal characteristics, <i>one of which is the stage of the disease at diagnosis" </i>(emphasis mine).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;149.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purposes of argument I am prepared to assume, however, that Professor Goldstone's model evidenced Mr Gregg's statistical chances at the time when his treatment should have commenced. It does not follow that the difference between this and Mr Gregg's actual prognosis at the time of the trial was attributable to the delay in starting his treatment. The judge did not state that this was the case. Nor did Professor Goldstone. Had it been the case there would have been no need for the further evidence given by Professor Goldstone on the likely effect of the delay in commencing Mr Gregg's treatment. Nor would there have been room for the consideration of this question which the judge was to give at a later stage of his judgment, to which I shall come in due course and which was inconsistent with the simple premise that the delay in commencing his treatment had reduced Mr Gregg's chances of being a survivor from 42% to 25%.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;150.&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point I would like to identify two other examples of what I believe to be misuse of statistics. In the Court of Appeal Latham LJ accepted the following argument advanced on behalf of Mr Gregg: </p>
<p></p><ul>"There is no doubt that in the present case, the delay in diagnosis caused the tumour to enlarge, invade neighbouring tissue and cause severe pain. It was the enlargement of the tumour which reduced the chances of successfully treating it. This aspect of the plaintiff's claim was never addressed by the judge. Nonetheless, the judge's findings amply support the submission that the appellant had indeed suffered injury which entitled the appellant to general damages for the pain and suffering which were the physical consequence of the spread of the tumour, an assessment of the extent to which delay resulted in more intensive therefore damaging treatment, an assessment of the increased risk of relapse and the adverse effect on prognosis, involving an assessment of the consequences to the appellant's expectation of life."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That approach, if correct, would seem to lead to the conclusion that had Mr Gregg received prompt treatment, his chances of surviving without relapse or further treatment would have been 60% and his chances of surviving, with further treatment if necessary, would have been 75%, for these are the prospects according to Professor Goldstone's model for those achieving initial complete remission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;151.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mance LJ dismissed the analysis on the following basis:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The head of loss in respect of which the claimant is seeking to claim is diminution of his life expectancy. That represents a substantive head of claim, for which the claimant could recover if he could show, as a matter of probability, that the respondents' negligence had caused it. If damages cannot be recovered for that as such, it is because the appellant cannot show (as I have concluded that he would have to) that he was not already going to suffer that head of loss, independently of the negligence. It is not possible to change the starting point to the enlarged tumour and to ask the court to assess the prospects that this made any difference to the claimant's life expectancy."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;152.&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect, I do not find this reasoning wholly convincing. It reflects, I suspect, a reaction against treating Mr Gregg's chances of achieving initial remission, if treated promptly, as a certainty, when statistically they were only 55%, and using this as a base for the exercise of calculating, on a basis of statistics, the effect of the delay on his life expectancy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;153.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other objections to Latham LJ's approach, and indeed to the approach which leads to the conclusion that the delay in starting Mr Gregg's treatment reduced his chances of being a survivor from 42% to 25%.  Professor Goldstone's model simply showed statistically the likely fate of his cohort of 100. It gave no indication of the factors that would determine what would befall an individual member of that cohort. Mance LJ convincingly speculated: </p>
<p></p><ul>"the most obvious influencing factors are, one would suppose, internal to the claimant at the time of the negligence, however unknown or unknowable they may be; and they consist of the precise characteristics, development and spread of the cancerous cells at the time of the negligence as well as the claimant's precise physical characteristics and resistance. Other influencing factors may very well include subsequent events such as the particular medical treatment received, the patient's subsequent life-style and his or her, or indeed others', reaction to the stress inevitably incurred."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;154.&nbsp;&nbsp;The assumption that Mr Gregg would have achieved initial complete remission had he been treated promptly is the obverse of the assumption that the reason why he did not achieve complete remission on initial treatment was that by then his cancer had spread. Neither is axiomatic. The possibility exists that some other factor existed which would have prevented Mr Gregg from achieving initial complete remission, if treated earlier, and which in fact prevented initial complete remission when he was treated. In the absence of other evidence the assumption of a probable link between the fact that his cancer had spread and the fact that he did not obtain initial complete remission was, however, a reasonable one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;155.&nbsp;&nbsp;More tenuous was the assumption that the difference between Mr Gregg's 42% chance of being a survivor (on the basis of Professor Goldstone's model) and his 25% prospect of being a survivor, as assessed at the date of trial, was attributable to the fact that, before treatment had begun, his cancer had spread to the pectoral region. Professor Goldstone's model showed that, of the 42 destined to be survivors, all but four (at the most) achieved initial complete remission. Of the 55 who achieved initial complete remission between 38 and 42 were destined to be survivors. Of the 45 who did not achieve initial complete remission, four at the most were destined to be survivors. The degree of uncertainty in these figures reflects the fact that Professor Goldstone's model gives no figure for the prospect of surviving of the small sub-category of four who achieve complete remission, not initially but after further treatment of various kinds. Mr Gregg's subsequent clinical history demonstrated that he fell into this small sub-category. It seems to me that, so far as his chances of surviving were concerned, once Mr Gregg had achieved complete remission, Professor Goldstone's model gave no reason to think that Mr Gregg was worse off than he would have been had his treatment commenced nine months earlier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;156.&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Goldstone's model demonstrated, however, that what then happened to Mr Gregg placed him in a further small sub-category - the six who relapsed after remission, responded to treatment, and then relapsed again. Of these six, on Professor Goldstone's model, only one survived. This led Professor Goldstone to comment that Mr Gregg might be regarded as "possibly the one survivor".  Although statistically his prospects of surviving after the second relapse were no better than one in six, by the time of the trial they had improved to 20% to 30% and were climbing daily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;157.&nbsp;&nbsp;All of this demonstrates that Professor Goldstone's model was a very inadequate tool for assessing the effect of the delay in treatment on Mr Gregg's progress and prognosis and that his subsequent clinical progress was of critical significance in re-assessing this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;158.&nbsp;&nbsp;This last fact has not escaped those acting for Mr Gregg. In their written submissions on how to assess quantum they contend that the judge erred in not having regard to the fact that Mr Gregg had, in fact, achieved complete remission so that the statistical evidence should have been applied to him on that premise. This led, so they submit, to the following conclusion: </p>
<p></p><ul>"The evidence was that 59 of the original 100 would have survived initial treatment and that the appellant was, necessarily, one of those. Of those 59, 17 went on to die. That amounts to (say) 28%. Thus, assessed at the date of trial the appellant would have had a 72% chance of survival had he received appropriate treatment. On the expert evidence that chance was reduced by the negligent delay: it had been 10%-15% assessed at the date treatment should have been given but had increased to 20%-30% as at the date of trial (paragraph 34, last sentence). Thus, if (as the judge did) one takes the mid-way point the appellant's lost chance assessed at the date of trial was 72% - 25% = 47%. In those circumstances the correct approach was to have awarded the appellant damages on the basis of a 47% loss of the chance of survival."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;159.&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that this submission was made to the trial judge and to the Court of Appeal, and rejected by each. Its fallacy, so it seems to me, is that it assumes that the deviation between Mr Gregg's clinical history after first remission and the statistical chances of surviving after remission was attributable to the delay in commencing Mr Gregg's treatment. I can see no basis for this conclusion.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Goldstone's evidence</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;160.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I indicated earlier, neither Professor Goldstone nor the judge proceeded on the premise that the difference between the 42% chance of surviving depicted by Professor Goldstone's model and Mr Gregg's 25% chance of surviving, as assessed at the trial, was caused by the delay in commencing Mr Gregg's treatment. It is time to turn to see what Professor Goldstone and the judge did have to say about this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;161.&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to a written question from counsel, Professor Goldstone stated, on the premise that one had regard to the limited data on the adverse effect of the ALK negative sub-type of cancer, that the upstaging of Mr Gregg's cancer in the period of delay turned his prospects of survival from the order of 30% to something in the order of 10%. He further estimated that, as at the date of the trial, his prospects of surviving were between 20% to 30% and climbing. Looking at the matter more broadly, he advised: </p>
<p></p><ul>"As to the effect of delay on the course of treatment, if he does not survive he would have gone through the various stages anyway. The probability is that he will not survive. If he does, it is more likely than not that he would have been cured by simple treatment, CHOP only, or less therapy, but that is using the overall data and not the ALK data."<p></p></ul>
<i>The judge's findings
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;162.&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge in his findings went rather further than this last statement by Professor Goldstone. The judge held that, if Mr Gregg had been treated promptly: </p>
<p></p><ul>"It is possible to say on the basis of Professor Goldstone's model that he would more probably than not have achieved complete remission with initial CHOP therapy and without high dose chemotherapy with stem cell harvesting."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;163.&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge, applying a conventional test of balance of probability, dismissed Mr Gregg's claim. He held: </p>
<p></p><ul>"In this case the claimant has failed to prove that it is more probable than not that the outcome for him, looked at at the time of trial, would have been materially different had he been treated nine months earlier. Since the burden of proof lies on the claimant that means it should be taken as more probable than not that, treated earlier, the claimant would nonetheless have had at some stage to undergo high dose chemotherapy with stem cell harvesting, would have relapsed, and would thereafter have had a very poor prognosis for survival …"<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"Although he might have suffered them at different times, Mr Gregg would on the balance of probabilities have gone through the same sequence of setbacks and treatments, and his outlook now is not shown to be different from what it would have been had there been no negligence."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;164.&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge went on to make findings to cater for the possibility that his approach was incorrect and that Mr Gregg was entitled to advance his claim on the basis of loss of a chance. In so doing he followed the approach of Andrew Smith J in <i>Smith v National Health Service Litigation Authority </i>[2001] Lloyd's Rep Med 174. He held: </p>
<p></p><ul>"50. The approach in <i>Smith</i>, as applied to this case would be to say that in the spring of 1995 the claimant had a chance of achieving disease free recovery after the application during the summer and autumn of 1995 of one course of CHOP chemotherapy treatment possibly with radiation, a course that would last six months or so. He had a chance, which is taken to be a less than evens chance, of achieving a combination of complete remission and not relapsing. He no doubt had a chance also of an intermediate position, for example of having to have high dose chemotherapy, but not relapsing thereafter. The evidence does not enable me to come to a conclusion about each of the routes by which, at the time of trial, the claimant could have been taken to arrive at a state of disease free recovery. As a question of fact, however, I think that I should quantify the diminution, by reason of the delay, in the claimant's chance of achieving disease free status after the initial six months treatment.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>51. Professor Goldstone was unable to put a percentage figure on that chance. It has to be taken as less than evens, because if he had been able to commit himself to the delay having turned a probability into an improbability the claimant would simply have won on causation. It might be said that since neither he nor Dr Bunch put a figure on it, the court should not. I do not agree. Once the effect of delay is said, as here, to be substantial, putting a figure on the chance is a jury question, as it was to the judge in <i>Smith</i> in similar circumstances. In his first report Professor Goldstone said that the claimant's chances of successful treatment were "massively reduced" by the delay, but his more cautious approach by the time of the trial resulted from emerging knowledge, particularly about the possible effect of ALK negative status. The experts thought it possible that his individual prognosis had been reduced to less than 50% of what it would have been intrinsically at the outset. So, for example, if he had a 45% chance of a good outcome, that could have been reduced to 20% by the delay. If he had a 45% chance lost completely because of the negligence, then that would translate into an award of 45% of the damages that would be awarded had the certainty of a good outcome been lost completely. But the chance was not lost completely, only reduced, and if a chance is to be given a cash value, a 45% chance is worth much less to start with than, for example, a 75% chance. I think it right to take roughly half of the less than evens chance as being the measure of the reduction of the possibility that the claimant might in any event have achieved disease free status after one course of treatment. The loss of chance award will therefore be 20% of the damages that would have been awarded for the loss of the certainty of cure after one initial six months course of treatment. The calculation therefore involves deciding what would have been the award for the loss of that certainty, and then discounting it by 80%."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;165.&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge then proceeded to make findings as to the damages that would have been recoverable on a 100% recovery basis. He dealt first with loss of earnings in the period up to trial. Next he turned to future loss of earnings. In this context he made the following findings: </p>
<p></p><ul>"57. The claimant's life expectancy now has not been the subject of direct evidence, though life expectancy is an essential piece of information for the calculation of future loss, both during an expected life period, and for a lost years claim afterwards. I think that if possible a figure must be arrived at. It is not permissible to take the loss to retirement age and discount it for the claimant's own risk of mortality (as opposed to the discount applied for the male population as a whole). The finding I have made is that he has a 25% chance of surviving five years. The present state of his chances was only expressed as to five years. It would be wrong to say from that that his life expectancy is therefore 15 months, because that would be to assume that he will definitely die within five years. In increasing that 15 months without any scientific basis I must be cautious, and err if at all, in the absence of evidence, in favour of the defendant. I would without confidence arrive but nonetheless arrive at an expectation of life from now of four years, and calculations should be based on that.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>58. That means that applying the multiplicand I have previously identified to loss of earnings, there will be a four year multiplier appropriately discounted for acceleration and care will continue for the same period. Thereafter, since I have adopted a multiplier / multiplicand approach a lost years' claim is properly sustainable, and I do not regard it as too speculative. The basis is that employment would have continued to normal retirement age at 65, since the assumption on which the claim is predicated is one of disease free survival."<p></p></ul>
