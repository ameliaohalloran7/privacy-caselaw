<p class="para">112.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I return to what I regard as the determinative issue, short but difficult.  Why should the dishonesty of Mr Stojevic be attributed to S&amp;R for the purposes of an action by S&amp;R against its auditors, officers of the company who, on the assumed facts, had committed breaches of contractual duty that had a causative role in producing the liabilities to which S&amp;R is subject?  There are, in my opinion, two reasons why that attribution should not be made, the first is a procedural reason, the second is substantive.</p>
<i><p class="paraleft">The procedural reason</p></i>
<p class="para">113.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a strike-out application.  There has been no trial and no factual findings but, nonetheless, the argument has proceeded on the footing that Mr Stojevic was the beneficial owner of the S&amp;R shareholding.  This derives, I think, from paragraph 2 of the Agreed Statement of Facts and Issues, which says that “Mr Stojevic was, indirectly through his family trust and a company incorporated in the Isle of Man, [S&amp;R’s] ultimate beneficial owner".  It is not clear to me what was meant in this context by “ultimate” or whether an “ultimate beneficial owner” is the same as an owner who is absolutely beneficially entitled.  There is nothing in the pleadings that says Mr Stojevic was the absolute beneficial owner of the S&amp;R shares.  Paragraph 2 of S&amp;R’s Amended Particulars of Claim says that he was a “shadow director” of S&amp;R and held a power of attorney on behalf of S&amp;R and paragraph 14 says that</p>
<p class="qt">“S&amp;R was controlled by Mr Stojevic and owned by Law Investments Limited …, an Isle of Man company which was in turn owned by Mr Stojevic’s family trust …”</p>
<p class="paraleft">None of this justifies the assumption that Mr Stojevic was absolutely beneficially entitled to the S&amp;R shares.</p>
<p class="para">114.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the action in the Commercial Court brought by KB against S&amp;R and Mr Stojevic, evidence was given about the relationship between Mr Stojevic and S&amp;R.  In paragraph 7 of his judgment, [2003] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 383 at 384, Toulson J described Mr Stojevic as S&amp;R’s chief executive officer and continued:</p>
<p class="qt">“SR’s ultimate ownership is obscure, but Mr Stojevic was in command of its dealings with BCL and the bank”</p>
<p class="paraleft">He returned to the point in paragraph 25:</p>
<p class="qt">“The shares in SR are held by an Isle of Man company called Law Investments Ltd, whose shareholders are nominee companies operating under an Isle of Man trust known as the Lucia trust.  Mr Stojevic acknowledged that he was one of the beneficiaries of the trust.  Objection was taken to his being asked to identify the other beneficiaries or the extent of his own beneficial interest, and the matter was not ultimatedly pressed by Mr Doctor QC on behalf of [KB]”</p>
<p class="paraleft">None of this justifies the assumption that Mr Stojevic was the absolute beneficial owner of the shares in S&amp;R.</p>
<p class="para">115.&nbsp;&nbsp;Langley J, in his judgment on the striking out application, referred to paragraphs 2 and 14 of S&amp;R’s pleading (cited in para 113 above) and said, in paragraph 21, that it was part of S&amp;R’s case that Mr Stojevic was “the controlling mind and will of S&amp;R".  He went on “There was no one else.  In a real sense he was the company.”  The judge could not have meant that Mr Stojevic was the absolute beneficial owner of the S&amp;R shares.  There was nothing in the pleadings to justify such an assumption.  In the Court of Appeal, on the other hand, Rimer LJ did say, in paragraph 5 that Mr Stojevic “owned, controlled and managed [S&amp;R]” and in paragraph 9, that </p>
<p class="qt">“In a real sense the company was [Mr Stojevic’s] company.  It was, for practical purposes, a ‘one man company'.”</p>
<p class="paraleft">And Mummery LJ, at paragraph 114, referred to S&amp;R as “the one-man company owned and controlled by Mr Stojevic".</p>
<p class="para">116.&nbsp;&nbsp;These references to S&amp;R as being wholly controlled by Mr Stojevic were fully justified on S&amp;R’s own pleading; but references to S&amp;R as “owned” by Mr Stojevic were not.  A trial, if there is one, may establish that Mr Stojevic was indeed the absolute beneficial owner of the S&amp;R shares but a conclusion to that effect cannot be reached at the present stage and I do not regard the single sentence in paragraph 2 of the Agreed Statement as justifying the description of S&amp;R as a “one-man company” otherwise than for the purpose of emphasising that he was in complete managerial control. </p>
<p class="para">117.&nbsp;&nbsp;This point bears on the status of S&amp;R as a victim of Mr Stojevic’s dishonesty.  Mr Stojevic derived his powers of control of S&amp;R not from the status of director, for he was not one, but from the power of attorney that he had been granted by, presumably, Law Investments Ltd or nominees of theirs.  That power of attorney had been used by Mr Stojevic to turn S&amp;R into, so to speak, a corporate automaton.  The power of attorney, if valid, could not have authorised the frauds in which S&amp;R at Mr Stojevic’s direction participated.  Everything done by S&amp;R at the direction of Mr Stojevic and in pursuance of his scheme of fraud must have been <i>ultra vires </i>his powers under the power of attorney.<i>  </i>This feature could not enable S&amp;R to resist the claims made by the defrauded third parties such as KB but, in my opinion, establishes S&amp;R as a victim of the fraudulent scheme.  In causing S&amp;R to pay away to third parties the money fraudulently extracted from KB and the other victims of the frauds Mr Stojevic was abusing his powers under the power of attorney.  That abuse was an essential feature of Mr Stojevic’s fraudulent scheme and, as it seems to me, S&amp;R was a victim of that abuse.</p>
<p class="para">118.&nbsp;&nbsp;The emphasis placed by my noble and learned friends Lord Walker and Lord Phillips, and also by my noble and learned friend Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood, on the assumed absolute beneficial ownership by Mr Stojevic of the S&amp;R shareholding, coupled with his undoubted absolute managerial control, indicates, I suggest, that they are, in effect, lifting the corporate veil and treating S&amp;R as if it were Mr Stojevic himself who was seeking to repel the <i>ex turpi causa </i>defence.  But if the corporate veil cannot be lifted, and it cannot, in my opinion, if Mr Stojevic was not the absolute beneficial owner of the shares, the attribution of Mr Stojevic’s dishonesty to S&amp;R for the purpose of defeating an admitted breach of duty by S&amp;R’s officers, a breach of duty that had caused S&amp;R to incur liabilities that it would not otherwise have incurred, cannot, in my opinion, be justified either in principle or on authority.  S&amp;R is a <i>legal persona</i> in its own right.</p>
<i><p class="paraleft">The substantive reason</p></i>
<p class="para">119.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Caparo Industries plc v Dickman </i> [1990]  2 AC 605 established that auditors who prepare and submit to the company of which they are auditors negligently prepared accounts and reports may be in breach of the duty they owe to the company but are not in breach of any duty they owe to the shareholders.  The company can recover in damages any loss caused by the breach of duty and the shareholders have no independent cause of action.  Where a company is insolvent, loss caused to the company by a similar breach of duty by its auditors can similarly be remedied by an action in damages brought by the company.  Its creditors, like the shareholders of a solvent company, are owed no duty of care by the auditors and can have no independent cause of action.  None of this is in doubt.  There is, however, a difference between a cause of action in negligence brought by a solvent company and a similar cause of action brought by an insolvent company.  In the former case any damages recovered will benefit the shareholders; in the latter case the damages will benefit the creditors. </p>
<p class="para">120.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>ex turpi causa </i>rule is a procedural rule based on public policy.  The perpetrators of illegality, <i>a fortiori </i>of dishonest illegality, ought not to be allowed to benefit from their reprehensible conduct.  If S&amp;R had remained a solvent company an action against Moore Stephens that would have enabled Mr Stojevic to benefit from any damages that were recovered would have offended the <i>ex turpi causa </i>rule.  Take the case of a solvent company that under the direction of its managing director engages in an unlawful and, in the event, loss making activity that could and should have been prevented by a timely report made by its auditors.  Let it be supposed the managing director is also a shareholder and that he and the auditors are together sued for negligent breach of duty.  I know of no authority that would bar such an action on <i>ex turpi causa </i>grounds.  The action, assuming it succeeded against both defendants, could be expected, via contribution proceedings, to leave the delinquent managing director with no benefit from any damages recovered from the auditors.  And why, if that were so, should public policy require the auditors to be relieved of liability for their breach of duty?</p>
<p class="para">121.&nbsp;&nbsp;In a case, such as the present, where the company is insolvent and will stay so whatever damages are recoverable from the auditors, the need to ensure that the delinquent director does not benefit from the damages does not present a problem.  There is no possibility of Mr Stojevic benefiting from any damages recoverable from Moore Stephens.  So, I repeat, why should the <i>ex turpi causa </i>rule, a rule based on public policy, bar an action against the auditors based on their breach of duty?</p>
<p class="para">122.&nbsp;&nbsp;The wielding of a rule of public policy in circumstances where public policy is not engaged constitutes, in my respectful opinion, bad jurisprudence.</p>
<p class="para">123.&nbsp;&nbsp;For all these reasons, and in general agreement with the reasons given by Lord Mance, I would allow this appeal and allow this action to proceed to trial.   </p>
<p class="lawlord">LORD WALKER OF GESTINGTHORPE</p>
<p class="mylords">My Lords,</p>
<p class="hditl">Introduction</p>
<p class="para">124.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an appeal by Stone &amp; Rolls Ltd (in liquidation) (“S&amp;R”) against an order of the Court of Appeal made on 18 June 2008, [2008] EWCA Civ 644, [2008] 3 WLR 1146.  The Court of Appeal (Mummery, Keene and Rimer LJJ) allowed an appeal by Moore Stephens, a firm of chartered accountants, from an order of Langley J made on 11 September 2007, [2007] EWHC 1826 (Comm), [2008] Bus LR 304,  [2008] 1 BCLC 697, and struck out S &amp; R’s claim against Moore Stephens (who had been its auditors) as barred by the <i>ex turpi causa</i> principle of public policy.</p>
<p class="para">125.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fullest account of the facts is to be found in the judgment of Toulson J in <i>Komercni Banka AS v Stone and Rolls Ltd</i> [2002]  EWHC 2263 (Comm), [2003] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 383.  There is also a full statement of the facts which must be assumed (for the purposes of Moore Stephens’ strike-out application) in the lengthy amended statement of claim (running to 398 paragraphs, with supporting schedules) setting out S &amp; R’s case against Moore Stephens.  The brief summary that follows is based on these sources as well as the judgments below.</p>
<p class="para">126.&nbsp;&nbsp;S &amp; R, a company registered in England, was dormant when in 1995 it came under the control of Mr Stojevic, the second defendant in the action brought by Komercni Banka AS (“KB”), a Czech bank.  Mr Stojevic, a Croatian, was at all material times in sole control of S &amp; R and (through artificial arrangements set up in the Isle of Man) effectively the beneficial owner of its share capital.  He was described by Toulson J as having a very quick mind, but as having been evasive and untruthful.  He was in fact the mastermind behind a fraudulent scheme which eventually resulted in KB obtaining judgment against S &amp; R and Mr Stojevic for a sum in excess of $94m.  Provisional liquidators of S &amp; R were appointed on 15 November 2002 followed by a full winding-up order on 15 January 2003.  The consequential claim against Moore Stephens is for about $94m together with several years’ accrued interest.</p>
<p class="para">127.&nbsp;&nbsp;The frauds were effected by means of letters of credit issued by KB in favour of S &amp; R at the request of an Austrian company named BCL Trading GmbH (“BCL”).  BCL was controlled by Mr Barak Alon, who appears to have been an accomplice of Mr Stojevic.  Payment under the letters of credit was obtained by the presentation of false documents certifying the existence in distant warehouses of non-existent stocks of agricultural produce.  These payments were promptly passed on to BCL, which initially met its liabilities to KB, so building up its confidence (KB was also found to have been negligent, but that was immaterial in a claim for deceit).  Eventually however there were 30 letters of credit (totalling $94m) for which KB was not reimbursed. About $80m of this was promptly passed on to BCL, or companies connected with it, and it has never been traced. </p>
<p class="hditl">The illegality defence</p>
<p class="para">128.&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can found a cause of action on his own criminal conduct.  This is not a technical rule, but a fundamental principle of public policy.  In the well-known words of Lord Mansfield CJ in <i>Holman v Johnson</i> (1775)  1 Cowp 341, 343:</p>
<p class="qt">“No court will lend its aid to a man who founds his cause of action upon an immoral or an illegal act.  If, from the plaintiff’s own stating or otherwise, the cause of action appears to arise ex turpi causa, or the transgression of a positive law of this country, there the court says he has no right to be assisted.  It is upon that ground the court goes; not for the sake of the defendant, but because they will not lend their aid to such a plaintiff.”</p>
<p class="para">The same principle has been described by McLachlin J in the Supreme Court of Canada, writing for the majority, as based on the need to preserve the integrity of the legal system: <i>Hall v Hebert</i> (1993)  101 DLR (4th) 129,160, 165. </p>
<p class="para">129.&nbsp;&nbsp;The leading modern English authority on the scope of the principle is the decision of this House in <i>Tinsley v Milligan</i> [1994] 1 AC 340.   In that case the House was unanimous in disapproving the “public conscience” test applied by the Court of Appeal (in reliance on the earlier decisions of the Court of Appeal in <i>Saunders v Edwards</i> [1987]  1 WLR 1116,  <i>Euro-Diam Ltd v Bathurst</i> [1990]  1 QB 1 and <i>Howard v Shirlstar Container Transport Ltd</i> [1990]  1 WLR 1292).  But the House was divided over the correct test.  The majority identified the test as whether the claimant had to plead or rely on his own illegality (see Lord Browne-Wilkinson at p 376).  The minority favoured a broader test of whether the claim was tainted by illegality (see Lord Goff of Chieveley at p 363).</p>
<p class="para">130.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Tinsley v Milligan</i> is in some ways a difficult and controversial decision.  It raised issues as to equitable interests in property, and the equitable “clean hands” doctrine, which do not arise here.  The Law Commission is well advanced, after lengthy deliberation and consultation, with proposals for the reform of this area of the law (Consultation Paper No. 160, The Illegality Defence in Tort (2001) and Consultation Paper No. 189, The Illegality Defence (2009)).  These proposals, if enacted by Parliament, would introduce more flexibility into this area of the law (although without reintroducing a general “public conscience” discretion). </p>
<p class="para">131.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not necessary to go further into the Law Commission’s proposals.  The present state of the law is as laid down by the majority of the House in <i>Tinsley v Milligan</i>.  Any legislative change is likely to widen the test, not to narrow it.  It is common ground that if Mr Stojevic had carried out his frauds on his own, and not through a corporate vehicle, neither he nor his trustee in bankruptcy would have had a claim against the auditors, since the illegality defence would have been unanswerable.  The main area of dispute is as to the imputation to S &amp; R of Mr Stojevic’s criminal acts and intentions.</p>
<p class="hditl">Primary or vicarious liability?</p>
<p class="para">132.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first issue, within this main area of dispute, is whether S &amp; R was primarily (or directly, the term used by Rimer LJ) liable for the fraud practised on KB, or was merely vicariously liable for the fraud of Mr Stojevic.  In the Court of Appeal and before your Lordships Mr Brindle QC contended that S &amp; R’s liability was vicarious only, while also contending (rather more vigorously) that the point was in any case of no real significance.  Even if S &amp; R’s liability was more than merely vicarious, he submitted, the principle in <i>Re Hampshire Land Co.</i> [1896]  2 Ch 743 was still capable of applying in the context of a claim by S &amp; R against its auditors.  He criticised Rimer LJ for failing to distinguish between the attribution exercise called for in two different situations, that is (i) KB’s claim for fraud against S &amp; R, and (ii) S &amp; R’s claim for negligence against the auditors.</p>
<p class="para">133.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion Rimer LJ (with whom Mummery and Keene LJJ agreed) was clearly right in holding that S &amp; R was primarily (or directly) liable for the frauds.  He recognised that <i>Citizens’ Life Assurance Co Ltd v Brown</i> [1904] AC 423 (a case of malicious libel on appeal to the Judicial Committee from New South Wales) was decided on the basis of vicarious liability.  But its historical importance is as a decisive rejection of Lord Bramwell’s view (in <i>Abrath v North Eastern Railway Co.</i> (1886) 11 App Cas 247) that a company could never have a dishonest motive attributed to it.  The present law was clearly explained by Lord Reid in a passage which Rimer LJ cited from <i>Tesco Supermarkets Ltd v Nattrass</i> [1972]  AC 153, 170: </p>
<p class="qt">“I must start by considering the nature of the personality which by a fiction the law attributes to a corporation.  A living person has a mind which can have knowledge or intention or be negligent and he has hands to carry out his intentions.  A corporation has none of these: it must act through living persons, though not always one or the same person.  Then the person who acts is not speaking or acting for the company.  He is acting as the company and his mind which directs his acts is the mind of the company.  There is no question of the company being vicariously liable.  He is not acting as a servant, representative, agent or delegate.  He is an embodiment of the company or, one could say, he hears and speaks through the persona of the company, within his appropriate sphere, and his mind is the mind of the company.  If it is a guilty mind then that guilt is the guilt of the company.”</p>
<p class="para">134.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case there is no doubt that Mr Stojevic was the persona of S &amp; R.  He was “really the directing mind and will of the corporation, the very ego and centre of the personality of the corporation” (Viscount Haldane LC in <i>Lennard’s Carrying Co. Ltd v Asiatic Petroleum Co. Ltd</i> [1915]  AC 705, 713).  In his written case Mr Brindle criticised Rimer LJ for a meaningless inquiry for a single directing mind and will.  He drew attention to a leading textbook suggesting that Lord Hoffmann has castigated that approach as a misleading “general metaphysic of companies” (Gower and Davies, The Principles of Modern Company Law, 8th edition, 2008, para 7-29, commenting on <i>Meridian Global Funds Management Asia Ltd v Securities Commission</i> [1995]  2 AC 500, 509).  That comment is, I think, overstated. In <i>Meridian</i> Lord Hoffmann approved Viscount Haldane’s search for the person who was, within Lennard’s Carrying Company, the equivalent of an individual ship-owner.  He then pointed out that as the company seemed to have no business other than ship-owning, the functions of general management and responsibility for ship-owning coincided; and (p 509):</p>
<p class="qt">“It was this coincidence which left Viscount Haldane LC’s speech open to the interpretation that he was expounding a general metaphysic of companies.”</p>
<p class="para">In short not every company has a single directing mind and will, but some companies do.</p>
<p class="para">135.&nbsp;&nbsp;The criticism is therefore quite inapposite in relation to S &amp; R, because it is common ground that Mr Stojevic really was the embodiment of S &amp; R for all purposes.  As Rimer LJ put it (in para 9 of his judgment):</p>
<p class="qt">“It is the essence of [S &amp; R’s] claim that Mr Stojevic was its controlling mind and will.  Nobody else was in a like position.  In a real sense the company was his company.  It was, for practical purposes, a ‘one man company'. It is a further part of the claim that the company was throughout used by Mr Stojevic as a vehicle for fraud, by extracting money from KB so that it could then be paid away to the fraudsters.”</p>
<p class="para">136.&nbsp;&nbsp;I conclude that S &amp; R was primarily liable for the frauds and on that basis I go on to the <i>Hampshire Land</i> principle, bearing in mind that I have not yet fully addressed Mr Brindle’s submissions about the importance of context—that is, the type of claim, by or against the company, in which the question of attribution arises.</p>
<p class="hditl">The Hampshire Land principle</p>
<p class="para">137.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Re Hampshire Land Company</i> [1896] 2 Ch 743 Mr Wills was secretary of a trading company, Hampshire Land, and of a building society, Portsea Island.  The company borrowed £30,000 from the building society.  This was irregular because it was done without the authority of the company given at a properly-convened general meeting.  The company then went into liquidation, and the building society claimed to be a creditor for £30,000.  The claim depended on whether the building society was to be imputed, through Mr Wills, with knowledge of the irregularity.  It was accepted that if Mr Wills had been fraudulent, his knowledge would not have been imputed to the building society; and Vaughan Williams J applied the same principle to a breach of duty (even if it did not amount to fraud) since Mr Wills could not be expected to disclose something to his own detriment.</p>
<p class="para">138.&nbsp;&nbsp;That principle (which is a general principle of agency) was applied by this House in <i>J C Houghton and Co v Nothard, Lowe and Wills Ltd</i> [1928] AC 1.  Two brothers, the Lowes, owed duties to two different trading companies, NLFP (an old-established company) and NLW (a new joint venture company partly owned by a competitor).  The Lowes committed NLW to commercial arrangements that were against its best interests, and favourable to NLFP.  The issue was whether the Lowes’ guilty knowledge estopped NLW from obtaining relief.  This House held that there was no estoppel.  Viscount Dunedin observed (at p 14):</p>
<p class="qt">“My Lords, there can obviously be no acquiescence without knowledge of the fact as to which acquiescence is said to have taken place.  The person who is sought to be estopped is here a company, an abstract conception, not a being who has eyes and ears.  The knowledge of the company can only be the knowledge of persons who are entitled to represent the company.  It may be assumed that the knowledge of directors is in ordinary circumstances the knowledge of the company.  The knowledge of a mere official like the secretary would only be the knowledge of the company if the thing of which knowledge is predicated was a thing within the ordinary domain of the secretary’s duties.  But what if the knowledge of the director is the knowledge of a director who is himself particeps criminis, that is, if the knowledge of an infringement of the right of the company is only brought home to the man who himself was the artificer of such infringement?  Common sense suggests the answer, but authority is not wanting.”</p>
<p class="para">He then referred to <i>Hampshire Land.</i>  Similarly Viscount Sumner said of the Lowes (at p19):</p>
<p class="qt">“Their silence was accordingly a notable breach of duty.  It has long been recognised that it would be contrary to justice and common sense to treat the knowledge of such persons as that of their company, as if one were to assume that they would make a clean breast of their delinquency.  Hence, for the purpose of estopping the company, some knowledge other than theirs has to be brought home to other directors, who can be presumed not to be concerned to suppress it.  This was laid down, following earlier cases, in <i>Re Hampshire Land Co,</i> and was even then treated as incontestable.”</p>
<p class="para">139.&nbsp;&nbsp;The same principle was applied by the Court of Appeal in <i>Belmont Finance Corporation Ltd v Williams Furniture Ltd</i> [1979] Ch 250.   It was an appeal against the summary dismissal of Belmont’s claim on the ground that Belmont was a party to the fraudulent conspiracy, and so shut out by the <i>ex turpi causa</i> rule.  Belmont’s directors (apparently in collusion with the shareholders in a company that I shall call Maximum) agreed to buy Maximum for £500,000, although it was said to be worth little more than £60,000.  Maximum’s ex-shareholders then bought all the shares in Belmont from the Williams Furniture group for £489,000, so committing an offence under section 54 of the Companies Act 1948.  Later Belmont, in liquidation, brought proceedings for misfeasance against its former holding companies and various individuals.  The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and directed that the claim should go to trial.  The leading judgment was given by Buckley LJ, who did not refer to <i>Hampshire Land</i> or <i>J C Houghton and Co v Nothard, Lowe and Wills Ltd</i>, but stated the same principle (at pp 261-262):</p>
<p class="qt">“It may emerge at a trial that the facts are not as alleged in the statement of claim, but if the allegations in the statement of claim are made good, the directors of the plaintiff company must then have known that the transaction was an illegal transaction.  </p>
<p class="qt">But in my view such knowledge should not be imputed to the company, for the essence of the arrangement was to deprive the company improperly of a large part of its assets.  As I have said, the company was a victim of the conspiracy.  I think it would be irrational to treat the directors, who were allegedly parties to the conspiracy, notionally as having transmitted this knowledge to the company; and indeed it is a well-recognised exception from the general rule that a principal is affected by notice received by his agent that, if the agent is acting in fraud of his principal and the matter of which he has notice is relevant to the fraud, that knowledge is not to be imputed to the principal.</p>
<p class="qt">So in my opinion the plaintiff company should not be regarded as a party to the conspiracy, on the ground of lack of the necessary guilty knowledge.”</p>
<p class="para">It should be noted that Belmont was not, on any view, a one-man company; and it was, as Buckley LJ observed, the victim of a conspiracy.</p>
