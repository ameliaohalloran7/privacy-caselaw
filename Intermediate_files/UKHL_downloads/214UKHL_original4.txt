<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80.&nbsp;&nbsp;The correct analysis, in my opinion, is that the article 52 infringements of which the Pirelli respondents complain were infringements of the Pirelli parent companies' rights to freedom of establishment in the United Kingdom, that the primary measure of the loss thus caused was the financial detriment to their UK subsidiary caused by its liability to pay ACT but its inability to make group income elections, but that the benefit of the tax credits that the Pirelli parent companies would not have received but for the article 52 infringements should be brought into account.  Logically, as it seems to me, the compensation should be compensation to the group for the detriment suffered by the group.  Compensation that concentrates on the financial detriment of the subsidiary and ignores the financial benefit of the parent seems to me to overlook the nature of the article 52 infringement.  The identity of the recipient or recipients of the compensation payable for the loss suffered by the group can be left to be decided by the group, but cannot, in my opinion, affect the quantum of the compensation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81.&nbsp;&nbsp;Park J, in paragraph 45 of his judgment, said that the Revenue's problem, in arguing that countervailing advantages to the Pirelli parent companies should be balanced against the disadvantage of the UK Holding Company having had to pay ACT soon after paying dividends to the Pirelli parent companies, was that the harm suffered in consequence of the breach of Community law was suffered by the United Kingdom subsidiaries whereas the countervailing advantages were enjoyed by the Pirelli parent companies.  The Court of Appeal, in paragraph 53 of its judgment, repeated with approval Park J's point.  But the point overlooks, in my opinion, the nature of an article 52 infringement.  ACT was not held to be an unlawful tax.  What was unlawful was interfering with the Pirelli parent companies' article 52 freedom of establishment by denying their subsidiaries a facility (the ability to avoid ACT by making a group income election) available to UK-resident parent companies' subsidiaries.  The charge which was found proved was discrimination against other member state parent companies which had established UK subsidiaries and in favour of UK parent companies with UK subsidiaries.  The relevant harm, which took the form of financial detriment to the UK subsidiary, was harm to the group brought about by a breach of the parent companies' article 52 freedom of establishment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, therefore, allow the Revenue's appeal on this issue too.</p>
<i>The withholding tax issue
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parent and Subsidiary Directive recited that it was necessary, in order to ensure fiscal neutrality, that the profits which a subsidiary distributed to its parent company be exempt from withholding tax.  Accordingly, article 1.1 of the Directive required each member state of the EU to apply the Directive to</p>
<p></p><ul>"… distributions of profits by companies of that State to companies of other Member States of which they are subsidiaries."<p></p></ul>
<p>and article 5.1 of the Directive said that -</p>
<p></p><ul>"profits which a subsidiary distributes to its parent company shall … be exempt from withholding tax …"<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pirelli respondents contend that ACT constituted a withholding tax.  If that is correct ACT would have been an unlawful tax, at least in its application to UK subsidiaries of parent companies of other member states.  It would then follow that exactions of ACT from these subsidiaries would have been unlawful exactions and the subsidiaries that had paid ACT would, <i>prima facie</i>, be entitled to re-imbursement of that which had been unlawfully demanded of them.  This, I think, is common ground.  No question would arise of any countervailing advantage obtained by the parent companies unless in an action brought by the Revenue against the parent companies for re-imbursement of the value of the tax credits as having been provided under a mistake of law.  The possibilities of such a claim need not be pursued here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, article 7.1 of the Directive says that -</p>
<p></p><ul>"The term 'withholding tax' as used in this Directive shall not cover an advance payment or prepayment (précompte) of corporation tax to the Member State of the subsidiary which is made in connection with a distribution of profits to its parent company …"<p></p></ul>
<p>Article 7.1 would appear to rule out any claim that ACT constituted a withholding tax for the purposes of the Directive.  Moreover, the European Court and the Advocate General in the <i>Metallgesellschaft</i> and <i>Hoechst </i>case made a number of references to ACT in terms which bring ACT within the article 7.1 exemption.  In paragraph 22 of his Opinion, Advocate General Fennelly said that</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is clear that advance corporation tax is nothing other than an advance payment of mainstream corporation tax"<p></p></ul>
<p>and the Court, in paragraph 6 of the judgment, said -</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is important to bear in mind that advance corporation tax is not a sum withheld on a dividend, which is paid in full, but is rather corporation tax borne by the company distributing dividends, paid in advance and set off against the mainstream corporation tax payable in respect of each accounting period".<p></p></ul>
<p>If the point rested there it would be plain, and <i>acte clair</i>, that ACT was not a withholding tax.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Pirelli respondents rely on certain passages in other European Court judgments which they submit make it arguable that ACT is indeed a withholding tax and that the point should be referred to the European Court for a definitive ruling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87.&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 7.1 said that an advance payment of corporation tax was not a withholding tax, but did not go on to say what was.  Conceptually a "withholding tax" is a tax levied on the recipient of a payment and is an amount withheld from the recipient.  Park J, in paragraph 59 of his judgment said that he would not regard ACT "as being conceptually a withholding tax."  He explained </p>
<p></p><ul>"If a United Kingdom company declared a dividend of 100 to its shareholders it paid them 100, not 100 less an amount withheld out of it on account of the tax on the dividend."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88.&nbsp;&nbsp;The obvious conclusion that ACT was not a withholding tax is said to be called into question by the European Court's judgment in <i>Athinaiki Zithopiia v Elliniko Dimosio</i> [2001]  ECR I-6797.  In its judgment the Court commented that </p>
<p></p><ul>" … the chargeable event for the taxation … is the payment of dividends.  In addition, the amount of tax is directly related to the size of the distribution." (para.28).<p></p></ul>
<p>The same could be said of ACT. But in paragraph 29 the Court said this -</p>
<p></p><ul>"Contrary to the submissions of the Greek Government, the taxation cannot be treated like an advance payment or prepayment (précompte) of corporation tax to the Member State of the subsidiary which is made in connection with a distribution of profits to its parent company, within the meaning of Article 7(1) of the Directive.  The taxation relates to income which is taxed only in the event of a distribution of dividends and up to the limit of the dividends paid".<p></p></ul>
<p>It cannot be said of ACT that ACT "relates to income which is taxed only in the event of a distribution of dividends".  ACT is treated as an advance payment of corporation tax which is assessed on the company's profits whether or not the profits are distributed as dividends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, following the judgment of Park J, but before the hearing in the Court of Appeal, the European Court returned to the question of what constituted a withholding tax.  The case was <i>Oce' van der Grinten NV v Inland Revenue Commissioners</i> [2003]  STC 1248  where, at paragraph 47 of its judgment, the Court referred to the <i>Athinaiki </i> case (and the <i>Epson Europe</i> case) as establishing that</p>
<p></p><ul>" … any tax on income received in the State in which dividends are distributed is a withholding tax on distributed profits for the purposes of art.5(1) of the directive where the chargeable event for the tax is the payment of dividends or of any other income from shares, the taxable amount is the income from those shares and the taxable person is the holder of the shares …"<p></p></ul>
<p>ACT is not a tax charged on the shareholders.  It does not qualify as a withholding tax under the description of a withholding tax given in the <i>Oce' </i>case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, the terms of article 7.1 of the Directive coupled with the explanation of the nature of a withholding tax given in <i>Oce' </i>and the remarks about ACT by the Advocate General and the European Court in the <i>Metallgesellschaft </i>and <i>Hoechst </i>case establish, so that the point is <i>acte clair, </i>that ACT falls within the article 7.1 exception and is not a withholding tax.</p>
<i><p>Conclusion</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, and those set out in the opinions of my noble and learned friends Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, Lord Hope of Craighead and Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe, I would allow this appeal, set aside paragraphs 1 and 2 of the order made by Park J on 22 January 2003 and remit the case to Park J to decide the unresolved factual question referred to by Lord Nicholls in para 28 of his opinion.  The respondents must pay the costs of the appeal to the Court of Appeal and to this House.</p>
<p><b>LORD WALKER OF GESTINGTHORPE</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the advantage of reading in draft the opinions of my noble and learned friends Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, Lord Hope of Craighead and Lord Scott of Foscote and I gratefully adopt Lord Scott's summary of the facts.  I agree with the reasoning and conclusions in these opinions.  But in view of the importance of the matter, and because we are differing from the courts below, I add some comments of my own on what has been called the election issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Lordships are concerned with two double taxation agreements ("DTAs") entered into by the United Kingdom, one in 1980 with the Netherlands and the other in 1988 with Italy.  On what has been called the election issue the provisions of the DTAs can assist the respondents, at any rate in the national courts, only if and so far as those provisions have been incorporated into the domestic tax law of the United Kingdom.  That is the effect of the words "in so far as they provide" in section 788(3) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 ("the 1988 Act"): see <i>R v IRC ex parte Commerzbank AG</i> [1991]  STC 271 (Divisional Court); <i>NEC Semi-Conductors Ltd v IRC</i> [2004]  STC 489 (Park J).   The correct starting point for any examination of the position under domestic tax law is therefore the relevant paragraph of section 788(3) following the words "in so far as they provide", that is, </p>
<p></p><ul>"(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;for conferring on persons not resident in the United Kingdom the right to a tax credit under section 231 in respect of qualifying distributions made to them by companies which are so resident."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a striking feature of section 788(3)(d) that it is expressed in precise and technical language (in contrast to the three preceding paragraphs, which are expressed in more general, and largely non-technical, language).  What is to be conferred is "a tax credit under section 231" (which is in any case, under section 832(1) of the 1988 Act, the meaning of "tax credit") and it is to be conferred "in respect of qualifying distributions" made by companies resident in the United Kingdom.  Any Dutch or Italian businessman encountering these expressions in (say) 1995 would, unless he happened to be a tax expert himself, have had to seek advice as to their meaning from someone who was expert in the intricacies of United Kingdom corporation tax.  This need would not be diminished by the strong overriding language used earlier in section 788(3) ("notwithstanding anything in any enactment"), since paragraph (d) is spelling out what the content of the overriding provisions is to be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95.&nbsp;&nbsp;The inquiring businessman would have been told that a tax credit under section 231 was the only significant tax credit known to the imputation system of corporation tax introduced into the United Kingdom in 1973. (His adviser might, at the risk of confusion, have added that under section 239 of the 1988 Act payment of advance corporation tax ("ACT") gives the paying company a credit in respect of mainstream corporation tax ("MCT"), but that this is normally spoken of in terms of set-off rather than credit; and that there could also be a specialised type of tax credit under section 441A of the 1988 Act, but that that complication could be ignored.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96.&nbsp;&nbsp;The adviser would perhaps also have gone on to say that the basic structure of section 231 (as it then stood) was to be found in the first three subsections.  Subsection (1) laid down the basic condition for the grant of the tax credit, that is, a qualifying distribution made (usually in the form of a dividend) by a company resident in the United Kingdom to a shareholder resident in the United Kingdom.  It also laid down the amount of the tax credit: it was to be a proportion of the amount of the distribution corresponding to the rate of ACT (so that if the rate of ACT was 25%, the credit would be one-quarter of the amount of the distribution).  Subsection (2) dealt with certain rare cases in which a corporate shareholder resident in the United Kingdom would be entitled to payment of the tax credit; the adviser probably would have told his client to disregard subsection (2) as an unimportant exception to the general rules about franked investment income (to be found in Part VI, Chapter V of the 1988 Act).  Subsection (3) dealt with the much more common situation in which there was a right to payment of the tax credit, that is when the dividend was paid to a non-corporate shareholder resident in the United Kingdom, (typically an individual, but possibly a body of trustees of a pension scheme, a charity or some other type of trust) and the shareholder was not liable to pay income tax, or paid it at a relatively low rate.  Those were the salient characteristics of a tax credit under section 231.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97.&nbsp;&nbsp;On being told this much about a tax credit under section 231 the foreign client might have objected that it was dealing with a purely domestic situation (a United Kingdom company paying a dividend to a United Kingdom shareholder), so how could such a credit benefit him?  The adviser would have replied with some confidence that the whole point of section 788 (3)(d) was to confer on a non-resident, through a DTA, a right which was, under section 231, conferred on residents, and that this residence requirement was necessarily and obviously overridden in the parallel universe of the DTA.  The adviser might also have added, with little less confidence, that the quantification of the tax credit in section 231(1) was also liable to be overridden, and was in practice very likely to be overridden, by arrangements negotiated under section 788 between Her Majesty's Government and the Dutch or Italian Government.  Neither side would wish its fisc to have to pay out to non-resident shareholders more cash than it had to, and the amount of the credit under the DTA would depend on hard bargaining rather than on any transparent principle.  In the present case the negotiated formula produces, on an assumed ACT rate of 25%, the rather awkward figure of 6.875% (explained in paragraph 24 of the judgment of Park J [2003] STC 250, 262, para 24).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98.&nbsp;&nbsp;So (the client might have said, recapitulating his understanding  of the advice) the shareholder's residence requirement in section 231(1) is to be disregarded, and the quantum of the tax credit under section 231(1) cannot be relied on; are there any other characteristics of "a tax credit under section 231" about which advice is needed?  The adviser would then have drawn attention to the only other obvious technicality in section 231(1), the need for the shareholder to receive a "qualifying distribution."  He would have explained that that expression meant, in practice, a dividend, and that under the imputation system the payment of a dividend was closely associated with the payment (within a maximum period of fifteen weeks) of an amount of ACT (see section 14 of and schedule 13 to the 1988 Act).  He might have added that this was however subject to section 247 (Dividends etc paid by one member of a group to another), to which both section 14 and section 231 are expressly made subject.  Where a group income election ("GIE") under section 247 was in force, the dividends paid under it ("election dividends") did not give rise to an obligation for payment of ACT but were (under section 247(2)) to be "excluded from sections 14(1) and 231."  In other words, they were not to count as qualifying distributions triggering a liability to pay ACT, nor as qualifying distributions giving the right to a tax credit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dutch or Italian client would no doubt have evinced particular interest at this point; it was because his company had a subsidiary resident in the United Kingdom that he was interested in how the DTAs work.  If this imaginary consultation had taken place in 1995, the adviser (unless very prescient and knowledgeable about the EU treaties) would have hastened to reassure his client that he need not worry about section 247, because a GIE was available only between companies resident in the United Kingdom.  The question "What if a Dutch (or Italian) parent company and its UK subsidiary joined in making a GIE and dividends were paid under it, without ACT?" would have been regarded as a stupid question.  But the momentous decision of the Court of Justice of the European Communities in the <i>Hoechst</i> case (the combined cases of <i>Metallgesellschaft Ltd v IRC</i> and <i>Hoechst AG v IRC</i> [2001]  STC 452) has since made it a meaningful and highly pertinent question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the heart of the so-called election issue, which is the first issue in this appeal.  Is it an essential characteristic of "a tax credit under section 231" that it is conditional on a qualifying distribution in respect of which ACT is payable (so that if the company paying the dividend is not liable to pay ACT, there is no tax credit for the shareholder)?  Or is the liability to pay ACT simply a practical necessity in the domestic context of a United Kingdom shareholder obtaining a tax credit on the payment of a dividend by a United Kingdom company, but not a prerequisite (because of the "notwithstanding anything in any enactment" rubric) when the concept of "a tax credit under section 231" is transferred to the international context (or parallel universe) of the DTAs?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101.&nbsp;&nbsp;Park J had little difficulty in deciding that there was no requirement for ACT to be payable.  He said of section 231(1) (at para 36),</p>
<p></p><ul>"There is no requirement there or anywhere else that ACT must have been paid, or at least must be payable.  It is probably true that the draftsman in 1972 assumed that, in any case where a recipient of a dividend would be entitled to a tax credit under the predecessor of section 231(1), there would have been a liability on the part of the paying company, or of one or more lower tier companies, to pay ACT in amounts which would match the amount of the tax credit.  Further, in all circumstances which the draftsman could realistically have anticipated at the time, his assumption would have been correct.  It remains the case, however, that the policy considerations which influenced the architects of the imputation system and the assumptions which the draftsman probably made were nowhere enacted as conditions which had to be fulfilled before a shareholder could be entitled to a tax credit."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge repeated the same point (at para 38) in relation to article 10 of the DTAs.  After summarising submissions made by Mr Glick QC (for the Revenue) as to sections 231 and 247 he set out his comment very pithily (at para 40): So what?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal (Peter Gibson and Laws LJJ and Sir Martin Nourse) upheld the judge's conclusion, and again seem to have had little difficulty in doing so.  The core reasoning is in paras 46 and 47 of the judgment of the Court delivered by Peter Gibson LJ:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Given the elaborately detailed nature of the DTAs and their purpose of relieving double taxation, we would find it very surprising if specific provisions limiting the conferring of tax credits in the domestic tax legislation so as to exclude it in particular circumstances were intended to govern the availability of tax credits to a non-resident.  Is it really to be supposed that every statutory qualification enacted from time to time in the UK fiscal legislation to the availability of a tax credit under section 231 qualifies the entitlement conferred by the DTA to the limited relief of double taxation by the tax credit as provided for in the DTA?  We think not.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>Moreover, section 247(2), which forms the linchpin of Mr Glick's argument, is not in fact purporting to affect the meaning of 'tax credit' in UK tax law.  It is merely limiting the circumstances in which a tax credit under section 231 will be granted."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have found this issue much less easy.  It is to my mind a short but very difficult point of statutory construction.  The unanimous view of the very experienced judges in the courts below commands great respect.  But in the end I have come to the conclusion, differing most reluctantly from the courts below, that they reached the wrong conclusion because they did not give enough weight to two factors.  One is that in applying the DTAs it is necessary to look, not only at their terms, but also at the language of section 788(3)(d), which uses a technical expression of domestic tax law, "qualifying distribution."  The other is that the clear scheme of the 1988 Act is that the payment of a dividend should be accompanied by a payment of ATC if a tax credit is to come into existence, and if exceptionally (because of a GIE) the payment of a dividend is not accompanied by a payment of ACT, the dividend would not give rise to a tax credit, because of section 247(2).  Section 247(2) does not directly affect the meaning of "tax credit", but it does to my mind affect the meaning of "qualifying distribution"; a dividend paid under a GIE is in terms excluded from section 14(1), and section 231 is in terms made to take effect subject to section 247.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104.&nbsp;&nbsp;These processes of exclusion and subjection are no doubt not strictly a matter of definition (although the types and purposes of statutory definitions are manifold: see Bennion, <i>Statutory Interpretation</i>, 4th ed. pp 479 ff).  But they are a fundamental element of how a tax credit under section 247 was intended to work under the imputation system.  A thunderbolt from Luxembourg, in the form of the decision in <i>Hoechst,</i> has shown that under EU law the statutory scheme was flawed, and has been flawed since its inception in 1973.  There is no answer which resolves all the difficulties.  But in those circumstances your Lordships should in my opinion adopt a construction which best accords with the original scheme of the 1988 Act, flawed though it is now seen to be, rather than abandoning the attempt to find any sort of purposive construction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105.&nbsp;&nbsp;In his printed case Mr Aaronson QC (for the respondent Pirelli companies) acknowledged (para 38) that if commonsense or plain justice required it, the Revenue might be able to justify what he has called a selective reading of sections 231 and 247. The requirements of justice are not easy to discern in the world of cross-border taxation of multinationals, but I think that commonsense does point in favour of the Revenue's appeal. The evident purpose of section 788(3)(d) and of article 10 of the DTAs is to give a tax credit (of a certain sort) to a non-resident shareholder who receives a dividend from a United Kingdom company.  It is central to the concept of the United Kingdom granting a tax credit to the shareholder in respect of a dividend that some United Kingdom tax should have been paid (or at least payable) in respect of that dividend.  It would be an abuse of language, and contrary to commonsense, to speak of granting a tax credit when no such tax has been paid.  Moreover the DTAs would not then, in this sort of situation, be relieving double taxation.  It is the respondents, to my mind, who seek to adopt a selective reading of the relevant provisions of the 1988 Act by ignoring a central feature of the statutory scheme, that liability to pay ACT is a concomitant of a qualifying distribution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Aaronson relied on the well-known presumption that Parliament does not intend to act in breach of public international law, including the treaty obligations of the United Kingdom.  I would accept the submission (made by Mr Glick in his reply) that that principle does not assist the respondents, since section 788 (like its statutory antecedents) is a general enabling provision capable of incorporating an indefinite number of bilateral arrangements (that is, DTAs) into our domestic tax law, but only for the purposes specified in subsection (3), and within the scope of those purposes (see <i>R v IRC ex parte Commerzbank AG</i> [1991]  STC 271 and <i>NEC Semi-Conductors Ltd v IRC </i> [2004]  STC 489, to which I have already referred).  If section 788(3)(d) is clear and unambiguous, its meaning cannot be altered by the text of any particular DTA: see <i>Salomon v Customs and Excise </i> [1967]  2 QB 116, 143.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons I would resolve the election issue in favour of the Revenue.  In agreement with the reasoning of Lord Nicholls, Lord Hope and Lord Scott I would also decide the assessment issue and the withholding tax issue in favour of the Revenue.  I would therefore allow the appeal and make the order that Lord Scott proposes.</p>
<p><b>LORD BROWN OF EATON-UNDER-HEYWOOD</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the advantage of reading in draft the opinions of my noble and learned friends, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, Lord Hope of Craighead, Lord Scott of Foscote and Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe.  For the reasons they give, with which I entirely agree, I too would allow the appeal and make the order proposed.</p>
