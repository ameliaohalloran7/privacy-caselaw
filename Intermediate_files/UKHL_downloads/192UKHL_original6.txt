<p align="right"><a href="haward-5.htm">(back to preceding text)</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125.&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the run off policies, a letter written by the underwriting agents had described them as "outside the traditional scope of our business" and as representing "in hindsight â€¦ poor underwriting judgment"; the court in <i>Hallam-Eames</i> said that it was "well arguable" that this should have prompted Names to investigate, but was ultimately unwilling on a summary judgment application to hold that "it amounted to constructive knowledge that the risks reinsured were not reasonably quantifiable".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;126.&nbsp;&nbsp;The language of s.14A thus recognises a range of different states of mind: (a) actual knowledge of the material facts about the damage and other facts relevant to the action (including therefore knowledge that the loss was capable of being attributed to an act or omission alleged to constitute negligence); (b) knowledge that a claimant might reasonably have been expected to acquire (from facts observable by himself or ascertainable by him or with the help of appropriate expert advice which it would have been reasonable for him to seek); and (c) ignorance. Actual knowledge within (a) involves knowing enough to make it reasonable to investigate whether or not there is a claim against a particular potential defendant: see paragraph 112 above. Constructive knowledge within (b) involves a situation where, although the claimant does not yet know sufficient for (a) to apply, he knows sufficient to make it reasonable for him (by himself or with advice) to acquire further knowledge which would satisfy (a).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;127.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the present case is concerned only with actual knowledge, the claimants have to do no more than negative actual knowledge on Mr Haward's part that the damage suffered was capable of being attributed to the act or omission now alleged to constitute negligence on Fawcetts' part. I therefore turn to the facts to consider the difference in analysis and result between the judge and the Court of Appeal on this essentially factual point.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts and the evidence</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;128.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have in paragraph 96 above summarised in very broad outline the history of the years 1995 to 1998, during which the claimants made the initial and subsequent unexpectedly large investments and it eventually became apparent that they had become lost. The question is when Mr Haward actually knew both enough of the acts or omissions now alleged to constitute negligence and that the loss suffered was capable of being attributable thereto to make it reasonable for him to begin to investigate whether or not the claimants had a claim against Fawcetts. That would be the case, taking the reasoning in <i>Hallam-Eames</i>, once he realised that he had <i>prima facie </i>cause to complain of unsoundness from the outset of the investments; this would in turn suggest unsoundness in the advice given or not given by Fawcetts. In relation to the issue raised by this question, the onus was on the claimants. It was for the claimants to displace the basic limitation period by showing, if they could, that Mr Haward did not have the requisite knowledge prior to 6th December 1998.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;129.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Haward's witness statement and evidence were however focused on a different matter, which was when he was first made aware that he might have "a claim for damages in negligence" against Fawcetts and when he "might first have been in a position to commence proceedings in respect of such a claim". Mr Haward's statement merely recited the losses sustained by HAL from A1995 to 1997, before moving to detailed discussion of events from February 1998 when - "faced with ever mounting losses", as he put it - he instructed a business adviser, Mr Peter Hughes. It was, he said, not until Mr Peter Hughes suggested it in May 1999 that he became aware of the possibility of pursuing a claim against Fawcetts; some time thereafter investigations into Fawcetts' advice were begun, leading eventually to a positive opinion from counsel in February 2001. In response, it was suggested on Fawcetts' behalf in cross-examination and submissions that serious thoughts were being given to pursuing a claim in negligence against Fawcetts at earlier dates pre-dating 6th December 1998. It was to this issue, as I see it, that the findings made by HHJ Playford at the end of his judgment "for the sake of completeness only" were directed, Like HHJ Playford, but for the different reasons I have already explained, I think that these findings were not directed to the right test. However, so far as they may be material, I see the force of, and would for my part accept, the criticisms directed by Mr Pooles QC on behalf of Mr Haward at the judge's finding that the claimants had not even established that it was only after 6th December 1998 that Mr Haward actually thought of pursuing a claim in negligence against Fawcetts. I can in the circumstances state my reasons briefly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;130.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the judge himself said, as part of his recital of the background, that "It was not until May 1999 that Mr Hughes first suggested to Mr Haward that a claim might lie against Fawcetts for negligence â€¦" and, later, that "That investigation [viz "to isolate the causal link between the acts and omissions alleged against Fawcetts and the losses"] did not even commence until May 1999 - apparently as a consequence of Mr Hughes' involvement â€¦" These statements are, as the Court of Appeal thought, in apparent tension with the judge's later conclusion that the claimants had not established that they first knew that they had any claim against Fawcetts after 6th December 1998.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;131.&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, bearing in mind evidence about Mr Hughes's litigiousness, impetuosity and disinclination to hold back, it is hard to think that, if Mr Hughes had formed adverse views about Fawcetts' conduct of the affairs of Mr Haward and the other claimants in relation to HAL at an earlier date, Mr Hughes would not given these clear expression in documents, investigation and a claim. The judge placed weight on the fact that Mr Hughes would have told Mr Haward at once of any such views. Not only did Mr Haward deny that he was ever told of any such views, but, if he had been, one would have expected him to have told Mr Taylor, a solicitor with whom he shared an office who had also been introduced to and was acting for Mr Haward. Yet Mr Taylor gave detailed evidence about how the idea of a claim in negligence against Fawcetts in respect of HAL first occurred to him in the context of discovery in the claim involving Mr Brunt in May 1999, and how - far from Mr Hughes mentioning it to him - he mentioned it to Mr Hughes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;132.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Mr Hughes prepared some instructions to counsel in February 2001, which purported to record a meeting in March 1998 at which Mr Austreng admitted not carrying out a full and proper audit of HAL's "stock or its overall financial position". But this account was not supported by the oral evidence given by Mr Haward and was contradicted by that given by Mr Taylor. It seems implausible that a professional man in Mr Austreng's position would react as he is reported to have done, or would admit, at least without saying something by way of excuse or explanation, "that he had at no time carried out a full and proper audit of either the company's stock or its overall financial position". The absence of any follow up by way of investigation, if any such statement was made, would also be striking. Mr Haward and Mr Taylor gave evidence that Mr Hughes' advice leading Mr Haward to move from Fawcetts to another accountant, Mr Patel, in Spring 1998 was not based on any concern about Fawcetts' conduct in relation to HAL, but rather (Mr Taylor said) because Mr Patel was a tax specialist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;133.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the judge's treatment of a draft letter dated 8th December 1998, also prepared by Mr Hughes, failed to take account of the unchallenged evidence regarding both its background (consisting in the discussions and fears about the potential tax penalties relating to the Form IHT 200) and the absence of any relevant follow up to it, save in relation to tax penalties and Mr Austreng's position as trustee. Mr Hughes' impetuousness is evident in the language of the draft, in the inability of Mr Haward's then solicitor, Mr Quinney, to see any basis on which to send such a letter and in the fact that none was sent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;134.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, if the issue had been when Mr Haward first considered the possibility of pursuing a claim in negligence against Fawcetts, I would not disagree with the Court of Appeal's decision. But that is not the critical issue, which is identified in paragraph 128 above. </p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The critical issue</p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;135.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Haward was described in an unchallenged part of Mr Taylor's witness statement as "not very sophisticated in complex financial matters, and â€¦ very trusting of his professional advisers". Even so, there was a very remarkable discrepancy between the very limited cash injections contemplated as necessary by the 1995 business plan and the actual investments required in 1995 and succeeding years, and concomitantly between the expected profit and loss position and the actual outturn in such years. Mr Haward in his statement did not address his state of mind in the years 1995 to early 1998 regarding the causes of HAL's losses. In cross-examination he was unable to give a coherent account of his thinking or of any discussion which he might have had with Mr Austreng in these years. He said that he could not remember whether he had asked Mr Austreng about the unanticipated position which emerged. He recalled only saying to Mr Austreng at one stage, in the light of the continuing losses, "I can't keep going on like this", as well as being "very surprised" at a board meeting at Mr Austreng's optimism; so, Mr Haward added, they "went on a bit more, but it was only a matter of time before  you â€¦. ran out of money". Mr Haward did briefly mention, as causes which "all contributed to making losses", the recession, the consideration that "farmers are bad payers" and the problem with Mr Brunt. But he did not say that he, at any point, believed that all or any of these factors accounted for the whole or even the greater part of HAL's unanticipated losses and the extra injections of cash thereby necessitated. In re-examination he described the situation in 1997 in these terms: "â€¦basically, Mrs Vauxhall would say, 'John, I want some money, you know, to pay the bills'. And â€¦.. either you paid the cheque or you just got the company closed down, and you thought all that money you've put in you've lost. You thought you might, there might be a chance of trading out of it so you, you paid them the money."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;136.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Palmer QC for Fawcetts submits that Mr Haward must have realised that the investment losses he sustained by 6th December 1998 were capable of being attributed to some unsoundness in the venture, particularly in the business plan on which Fawcetts advised, or in Fawcetts' advice, giving <i>prima facie </i>cause for complaint, or at least that Mr Haward's evidence failed to establish the contrary. Friendship or loyalty, or indeed ignorance of the law of negligence, would not, as such, matter if this was Mr Haward's state of mind. There is in the answer quoted at the end of the preceding paragraph a possible indication that, despite the obvious discrepancy between the expected position allegedly confirmed by Fawcetts' advice and the loss-making outcome, Mr Haward was prepared to hope for the best, and why he might thus have been prepared to overlook, or at least not to pursue for the time being, obvious question-marks over the advice allegedly received from Fawcetts. Fawcetts were after all long-standing family accountants and financial advisers and he was on friendly terms with Mr Austreng. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;137.&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to such points, Jonathan Parker LJ drew attention to the other problems which affected HAL's business.  However there are difficulties about this response. First, I have already drawn attention to Mr Haward's very limited evidence about such other problems and their impact on HAL and on his thinking. Secondly, Jonathan Parker LJ referred to "a number of possible causes for the failure of the Company", but possible <i>additional </i>causes of damage would not be relevant, if one contributing cause was, to the claimants' knowledge, also the defendants' act or omission. Thirdly, and more fundamentally, the present claim is not for damage resulting from failure of HAL. Rather, it proceeds on the basis that, whatever happened to HAL, the claimants were induced by Fawcetts' negligence to invest monies which they would not otherwise have invested and which were before 6th December 1998 known to be lost; and that this process started with the initial acquisition in December 1994 and continued thereafter from year to year, on the basis of Fawcetts' original advice and (as Mr Haward put it in his evidence) their failure to advise to the contrary thereafter. Fourthly, while "the best-laid schemes o'mice an' men gang aft agley", it is hard to see that the undoubtedly difficult trading conditions which HAL experienced during the relevant period could have been regarded as explaining the hugely and on its face disastrously different position - when compared with that projected by the 1995 business plan - which emerged as soon as Mr Haward had taken over HAL and continued thereafter. One would have thought that there was, on its face, something unsound with the whole venture, and almost inevitably therefore, on the claimants' case, something unsound about any advice given with regard to its viability and advisability. On this basis, Mr Palmer submits that the present case is comparable to <i>Dobbie</i>, where, once Mrs Dobbie knew that a healthy breast had been removed, then, as Hoffmann LJ said in <i>Hallam-Eames</i>, she knew sufficiently that the operation was an act of which she would seem <i>prima facie </i>entitled to complain. </p>
