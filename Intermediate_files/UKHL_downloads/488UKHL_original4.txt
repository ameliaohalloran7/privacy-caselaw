<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79. A bareboat demise charter differs from the common kinds of charterparty, such as time charters and voyage charters.  They involve no transfer of the possession of the vessel to the charterer; they are simply contracts for services to be provided by the 'owner' (who may or may not be the actual owner and frequently is just another charterer higher up the line) to the charterer.  A voyage charter can be a contract of carriage.  A time charter normally includes an express or implied indemnity for the consequences of complying with the charterer's orders but the vessel remains under the command and control of the owner's master and crew as if she was being traded for the owner's own account.  A bareboat demise charter by contrast is truly a contract for the hire of the vessel and involves the delivery of the vessel into the possession of the charterer and the control of the vessel resting with the charterer's employees.  The vicarious liability <i>in personam</i> for the delictual or tortious acts of the master and crew rests with their employer, the demise charterer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80. Legislation, often following international conventions, has tended to recognise and reflect the various different ways in which members of the maritime and mercantile communities are involved with ships.  In international and municipal law vessels have a nationality being that of the country in which they are registered and of which they fly the flag.  On the register there must be a registered owner and the name of this registered owner will appear on the vessel's certificate of registry.  The registered owner is the legal owner.  This is the natural and normal meaning of the word "owner".  Legal mortgages are likewise registered and qualify the property rights of the registered owner.  Legislation has also recognised that the beneficial ownership of the vessel may be different from its legal ownership: s.58 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894, s.21(4) of the Supreme Court Act 1981.  From the days before the corporate ownership of vessels became the norm, owners were required to register a managing owner or "ship's husband" who was personally liable for the performance of the owner's statutory duties: s.59 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894.  Demise charterers have been expressly referred to in legislation: s.9(4) of the Maritime Conventions Act 1911.  Sections 20 and 21 of the Supreme Court Act 1981, defining the scope of the Admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court, refers to both demise charters and ordinary charters, following the scheme of the 1952 Arrest Convention.  There is also legislation which simply refers to charterers clearly covering all types of charterparty and including both demise charters and ordinary charters: s.3 of the Merchant Shipping (Liability of Shipowners and Others) Act 1958.  Thus, in approaching the construction of an Act passed in 1974, it is relevant to have in mind the various contractual and proprietary relationships that may exist and that legislators may make appropriate provision to accommodate them. </p>
<i><p>The Zetland County Council Act 1974</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81. As spelled out in the preamble and the recitals, the purposes of this Private Act included enabling the county council to provide proper marine facilities at Sullom Voe.  The directly relevant provision of the Act is the incorporation section, s.4, which reads -</p>
<p></p><ul>"The following enactments, so far as they are applicable for the purposes and are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act, are hereby incorporated with and form part of this Act:-<p></p></ul>
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;the Lands Clauses Acts, except sections 120 to 124 and 127 of the Lands Clauses Consolidation (Scotland) Act 1845;
(b) the Harbours, Docks and Piers Clauses Act 1847 (except sections 6 to 13, 16 to 19, 22, 25, 26, 28, 41, 43, 48 to 53, 77 and 83 to 101):
<p></p><ul>Provided that in construing the provisions so incorporated the expression "the special Act" shall mean this Act:<p></p></ul>
Provided further that in construing the provisions of the Harbours, Docks and Piers Clauses Act 1847 so incorporated -
 (i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the expressions "the promoters of the undertaking" and "the undertakers" shall mean the Council and the expression "the harbour, dock or pier" shall mean a harbour area;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)  &nbsp;&nbsp;the meaning of the word "vessel" as defined in section 3 (Interpretation) of this Act shall be substituted for the meaning assigned to what word by section 3 of that Act;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;section 15 shall be read and have effect as if for the words from "shall forfeit" to the end of the section there were substituted the words "shall be liable to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds";</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;section 23 shall be read and have effect as if the words "provided that no such lease be granted for a longer term than three years" were omitted;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  (v)&nbsp;&nbsp;section 63 shall be read and have effect as if for the words from "penalty" to the end of the section there were substituted the words "penalty not exceeding one hundred pounds";</p>
  (vi)&nbsp;&nbsp;section 69 shall be read and have effect as if for the words from "sum" to the end of the section there were substituted the words "sum not exceeding fifty pounds"."
<p>The scheme adopted in relation to the 1847 Act is to include the modifications which the draftsman requires to be made in the six subparagraphs in the second proviso to s.4.  Subparagraph (iii) shows that where the draftsman wishes to incorporate a definition from s.3 of the 1974 Act, he does so expressly.  Thus I do not consider that the definition in s.3 of "owner" as including a charterer has relevance in the present case.  That definition is relevant to other provisions of the 1974 Act, <i>eg,</i> s.36 concerning dangerous goods, but not to s.4.  S.16 dealing with wreck removal is likewise not directly relevant, but in cross-referring to sections 530 and 532 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894 provides an example of the right to recover expenses from the owner of the vessel at the time it became a wreck and to use the proceeds of its sale to reimburse that expenditure.  These liabilities are strict, not fault based, and are linked to the ownership of the relevant property.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82. The operative statute is the 1974 Act.  Therefore it is the statute which has actually to be construed but, by incorporating sections of the 1847 Act, the sections incorporated are to "form part" of the 1974 Act and "be construed therewith as forming one Act": s.1 of the 1847 Act.  This presents some problems of identifying the correct approach to the exercise of interpretation.  In 1847 the maritime and mercantile worlds were very different from what they had become in 1974 and have become since.  Almost every aspect of the operations carried out in ports has changed beyond recognition.  The berthing and loading or discharge of a VLCC is a wholly different exercise to what would have been involved in the days of the sailing ship and the infancy of steam navigation.  The role of the master has changed.  The use of flags of convenience and one ship companies has transformed the structures of ownership.  The legal environment has also changed.  Styles of statutory drafting are very different.  The maritime law governing the jurisdiction of the Admiralty Court and the liability of the vessel <i>in rem</i> was in the process of development.  The damage lien was recognised but its basis was not yet fully settled: <i>The Bold Buccleugh</i> (1850)  3 W Rob 220, (1851) 7 Moo PC 267, <i>Currie v M'Knight</i> [1897]  AC 97.  The concept that the vessel would be liable without more on the proof that it had been the physical instrument by which the damage was done was rejected in favour of a fault-based liability.  But that still left the question of what fault would suffice.  This was finally settled in cases later in the 19th century: <i>The Utopia</i> [1893]  AC 492, 499:  "the foundation of the lien is the negligence of the owners or their servants at the time of the collision."  Who are the owners for this purpose is a matter to which I will return; it was the subject matter of the judgment of Sheen J in <i>The Father Thames</i> [1979]  2 Lloyd's Rep 364, discussing and following the judgments in <i>The Ticonderoga</i> (1858)  Swa 215 and <i>The Lemington</i> (1874)  2 Asp MLC 475.  These dates speak for themselves.  They show the relatively fluid state of the law of admiralty in the 19th century and help to explain why there should initially have been some disagreement about the construction of s.74 of the 1847 Act. </p>
<i>

<p>Section 74</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83. As previously observed, the 1847 Act is drafted in a style typical of legislation of that date but untypical of modern legislation.  Over-precise syntactical constructions are inappropriate.  It is necessary to rely upon the natural meaning of the words used, guided by a consideration of the purpose of the statute.  Contemporaneous judicial statements are likely to be the most reliable guide rather than any attempt to reconstruct the context after the lapse of a century and a half.  The Act itself is one of a group of Acts which were passed in the 1840s to facilitate the legislative task of giving entrepreneurs, developers and local authorities the necessary powers to acquire land and construct works.  It is an Act which collects together, "consolidates", in one Act provisions "usually contained in Acts authorising the making and improving of harbours, docks and piers".  These statutes provide a model codes for use in whole or in part in other legislation.  The codes can be adapted to the needs of specific situations.  It is no argument that a particular interpretation might in some exceptional situation not be wholly adequate; it is for the draftsman of the special Act to anticipate and provide for that situation.  S.74 is the first of a group of three sections dealing with damage to harbour works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"74.&nbsp;&nbsp;Owner and Master of Vessel answerable for damage to Works - Saving as to Vessels in charge of Licensed Pilot  -  The owner of every vessel or float of timber shall be answerable to the undertakers for any damage done by such vessel or float of  timber, or by any person employed about the same, to the harbour, dock, or pier, or the quays or works connected therewith and the master or person having the charge of such vessel or float of timber through whose wilful act or negligence any such damage is done shall also be liable to make good the same; and the undertaker may detain any such vessel or float of timber until sufficient security has been given for the amount of damage done by the same: Provided always, that nothing herein contained shall extend to impose any liability for any such damage upon the owner of any vessel, where such vessel shall at the time when such damage is caused be in charge of a duly licensed pilot whom such owner or master is bound by law to employ and put his vessel in charge of.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  75.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ascertainment and recovery of amount of Damage  -  If the amount claimed in respect of any such damage as aforesaid do not exceed fifty pounds, such damage shall be ascertained, and the amount thereof shall, in England or Ireland, be recovered before two justices, and in Scotland before the sheriff; and in addition to the remedies hereby provided for the recovery of the same, the justices or sheriff before whom the same are recovered may cause the vessel or float of timber causing such damage, and any tackle and furniture thereof, to be distrained and kept until the amount of damages and costs awarded by them is paid, and, if the same be not paid within seven days after such distress or keeping, may cause the property so distrained or kept, or any part thereof, to be sold, and out of the proceeds of such sale may pay the amount of damages and costs awarded by such justices or sheriff, and all the charges incurred by the distress, keeping, and sale of such property.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  76.&nbsp;&nbsp;Owner paying damages or penalty or costs for act of servant may recover from him - If the owner of any vessel or float of timber make satisfaction for any such damage as aforesaid wilfully or negligently done by the master or person having charge of such vessel or float of timber, or if the owner of any vessel or goods in any other case have been compelled to pay any penalty or costs by reason of any act or omission of any other person, the person who actually did such damage or who committed such offence shall repay to the owner of such vessel or such goods the amount of the damage or penalty and costs, together with the costs of the proceedings to enforce such repayment; and if such damage or penalty respectively do not exceed fifty pounds, the sum may, in England or Ireland, be recovered before two or more justices, and in Scotland before the sheriff."</p>
<p>The proviso to s.74 was effectively repealed by the passing of s.15 of the Pilotage Act 1913: <i>The Towerfield</i> [1951]  AC 112.  (See now s.16 of the Pilotage Act 1987.)  It is however relevant to one of the arguments advanced upon behalf of the defenders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84. The submission of the defenders is that in s.74 the word "owner" does not refer to the registered owner but is a word used to refer to the person or entity which has the possession of the vessel and employs and has the right to control the master and crew.  In other words it is not a proprietary term but relates to the control of the vessel and the responsibility for those in charge of her.  In support of this submission the defenders rely upon three strands of argument.  First, they rely upon authorities which have construed the word "owner" in other statutes and contexts as extending to demise charterers.  These authorities only provide limited assistance to the defenders since they do not exclude the primary meaning of "owner" as the actual owner and still leave Tankers potentially liable.  However two authorities have construed the word  "owner" in an exclusive fashion as referring only to the charterer where the vessel was demise chartered.  But none of these authorities involved the 1847 Act; it seems that the present question has never before been raised in relation to the 1847 Act and s.74.  The second strand of argument was that liability should conform to responsibility for the navigation of the vessel and therefore be confined to the demise charterer.  Thirdly, they argued that the proviso showed that the "owner" was the employer of the crew.  The First Division accepted these arguments considering that it made better sense that the liability under s.74 should fall upon the demise charterer rather than upon the registered owner.</p>
<i></i><p><i>The Authorities upon s.74</i>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85. The first case which discussed the scope and effect of s.74 was <i>River Wear Commissioners v Adamson</i> (1877)  2 App Cas 743.  Mr Adamson and others were the owners of a steam vessel which was on a voyage from the Thames to the Tyne when she encountered a violent storm near the mouth of the Wear.  She went aground at low tide near to the entrance to Sunderland docks.  The crew were rescued by rocket apparatus but were unable to take down the sails before they abandoned the vessel.  The result was that when the tide rose she was blown on to the pier and damaged it.  There was no negligence on the part of the master and crew.  The damage to the pier had been occasioned by the violence of the wind and waves at a time when the master and crew had been compelled to abandon the vessel.  The House of Lords (Lord Gordon dissenting) held that the owners were not liable under s.74 to pay the cost of making good the damage.  The question considered was whether the purpose of sections 74 to 76 was to impose a liability upon the owner of the vessel doing the damage independently of any fault in the navigation of the vessel or was limited to providing a remedy against the owner without the need to inquire whether the owner was responsible for those who were at fault.  The decision of the House was based upon the acceptance of the latter alternative.  The claim failed not because the owners were not the right parties to sue but because there was no fault on the part of anyone.  Lord Cairns LC said (p.751):</p>
<p></p><ul>"By the Common Law, if a pier were injured by a ship sailing against it, the owner might be liable if he was on board and directing the navigation of the ship, or if the ship was navigated by persons for whose negligence he was liable.  But the owner would not be liable merely because he was the owner, or without shewing that those navigating the vessel were his servants.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>In my opinion, it was to meet this state of the law that this section was introduced.  It proceeds, as it seems to me, upon the assumption that damage has been done of the kind for which compensation can be recovered at Common Law against some person;  that is to say, damage occasioned by negligence or wilful misconduct, and not by the act of God.   The section relieves the undertakers from the investigation, always a difficult one for them to pursue, whether the fault has been the fault of the owner, or of the charterer, or of the persons in charge.  It takes the owner as the person who is always discoverable by means of the register, and it declares that he shall be the person answerable; that is to say, the person who is to answer, or is to be sued for the damage done.  It does not absolve the master or crew, it there has been wilful fault or negligence on their part.   They, in that case, may be sued as well as the owner, but if the owner is thus in the first instance made to pay the damage where there has been wilful or negligent conduct on the part of the master or crew, the owner may, under the subsequent sections of the Act, recover over against the master or crew; and if the damage has occurred by reason of the act or omission of any other person, if, for example, some one who had hired the ship sent her to sea insufficiently manned, and the accident occurred in consequence, the owner might apparently under those sections recover from the hirer by reason of this act or omission."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord O'Hagan said at p.760:</p>
<p></p><ul>"At Common Law, there were serious questions continually arising, which, on either construction of the statute, can arise no more.  Often it was doubtful upon whom liability should be charged or by what evidence the charge of it could successfully be sustained.  We can well conceive that the undertakers might have found difficulty in properly selecting a defendant, amidst the varying circumstances which affect the direction and management of merchant vessels, and the proof, establishing responsibility, must often have been hard to find, and inadequate to satisfy a jury."<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>"Accordingly, the Legislature made the owner - a person easily and always to be found - 'answerable', <i>as</i> owner, and dispensed with the proof of negligence or any other proof, save of the fact of injury by the vessel in all the cases contemplated by the Act."<p></p></ul>
<p>Lord Blackburn at pages 767 to 769 made the same points at greater length in a passage which is too long to quote.  He summarised the effect of the common law.  A person is only liable <i>in personam</i> if he commits the tort himself or can be proved to have been in the relationship of master and servant to him who did and, as we would say now, is therefore vicariously liable for that person's tort.  The owner of a vessel is commonly the employer of the master but it is not necessarily so and, if he is not, he is not liable <i>in personam</i> merely because he is the owner.  Ownership might be <i>prima facie</i> evidence that he was the employer of the master but this could be disproved. - </p>
<p></p><ul>"A case very likely to occur in a harbour, in which this would be disproved, would be where the ship was put in the hands of a shipwright to be repaired, and the shipwrights' servants in moving it into a graving dock negligently did mischief.  The owner would not there be liable at Common Law."<p></p></ul>
He then made the same point in relation to a compulsory pilot who would not be the servant of the owner.  He then went on to consider the purpose of the Act.  Its purpose was in a rough and ready way to avoid the need for litigation and to provide a simple and effective remedy in personam against the owner.
<p></p><ul>"… the remedy proposed was that the owner, who was generally really liable (although it was difficult and expensive to prove it), should be liable without proof either that there was negligence, or that the person guilty of neglect was the owner's servant, or proving how the mischief happened, and this is expressed by saying that the owner shall be "answerable for any damage done by the vessel or by any person employed about the same" to the harbour.  It seems to have been suggested that where a compulsory pilot was on board the mischief might very well be by his fault and then the previous general presumption that mischief generally was due to the fault of the owners' servants did not arise.  This case therefore was by the proviso, taken out of the enactment and restored to Common Law.  As to the possible case of the mischief being occasioned by the servants of a shipwright, or some other substantial person, it seems to have been thought enough to give the owner the remedy over provided by the 76th section."<p></p></ul>
<p>He thus identified the mischief to which the sections were directed as "the expense of litigation".  As will have been noticed, Lord Blackburn construed s.74 as imposing a strict liability but he nevertheless concurred in the decision of the majority to dismiss the appeal. (p.772-3) </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86. The <i>Adamson</i> case was not treated as having decided that the owner could be held liable under s.74 in the absence of negligence on somebody's part.  The difference of opinion on this point between Lord Blackburn and the remainder of the majority demonstrated this.  Fifty years later the point was settled by the House of Lords in <i>The Mostyn</i> [1928]  AC 57.  The vessel was moving from one dock to another at Swansea and in doing so fouled and damaged an electricity cable with its anchor.  The undertakers sued the owners of the vessel under s.74 for the cost of making good the damage.  The trial judge found that there had been no negligence.  The judge and the Court of Appeal held that in these circumstances there was no liability.  The House of Lords by a majority allowed the undertakers' appeal and held that there was a strict liability.  The speeches disclose problems in accepting Lord Cairns's view that s.74 had retained the need to prove negligence.  The essence of the decision was that, provided human agency was involved in the occurrence of the accident, the owner should be liable.  S.74 did more than change procedure; it also changed the substantive law.  The reasoning of Lord Blackburn appears to have been adopted.  It was referred to with approval by Viscount Haldane, save that Viscount Haldane would have treated <i>Adamson's</i> case as being one where there was no human agency involved, akin to a case of derelict.  (p.71-2)  Lord Shaw of Dunfermline referring to decisions which were inconsistent with Lord Cairns's view said that <i>Adamson</i> should have been decided on the basis that the vessel there had been equivalent to a derelict over which all means or chance of possible control by human agency had disappeared.  (p.81)  But he then goes on to affirm that the statutory liability is that of the "shipowners, as such".  (p.82)  Having considered the speeches of Lord O'Hagan and Lord Blackburn, Lord Shaw expresses his own view of the effect of the wording of s.74:</p>
<p></p><ul>"I cannot read that as in any sense confirming the view that this statute was to be interpreted upon the footing that the shipowners escaped all liability, except liability that grounded upon negligence.  On the contrary, it seems to me to affirm the proposition that a further and separate liability was imposed by statute, and that it was imposed on the owners qua owners.  I am humbly but distinctly of opinion that this is the correct view.  To use the language of a Roman lawyer, the liability imposed is not a liability <i>ex delicto</i>, nor is it a liability <i>quasi ex delicto</i>; but it is expressly a liability <i>ex dominio</i>.  It is laid upon the owner as owner and it humbly appears to me that this view is in entire accord with the dicta just cited from Lord Blackburn, and is in entire disaccord with the idea that he concurred the general doctrine which Lord Cairns had laid down."<p></p></ul>
<p>Lord Phillimore, although dissenting, expressly recognises that the statutory liability is that of the shipowner, using the same example as was used by Lord Blackburn of a shipowner who has placed his vessel in the hands of a ship-repairer; the shipowner must pay the undertakers and then recover over from the ship-repairer. (p.94)  Lord Blanesburgh considered both the actual language of the section and what had been said about its purpose in <i>Adamson</i>, in particular by Lord O'Hagan and Lord Blackburn.</p>
<p></p><ul>"...  the full effect of the section  ...  is that the owner of a vessel as such without any qualification in regard to the presence or imputation or otherwise of negligence on his part is made answerable for damage to harbour property done by his vessel: that the master or person having charge of the vessel is <i>also</i> fixed with liability to make good the <i>same</i> damage, but, in his case, only if the damage be due to his wilful act or negligence, and not otherwise.  And, my Lords, I would here observe that this contrast in the nature of the liability which by the section is imposed upon the owner on the one hand, and the master, using that term compendiously, on the other, is heightened by the terms of the pilotage exception ... ."  (pp.97-8) <p></p></ul>
<p>In discussing the speech of Lord Cairns, he reiterated that the first main result of the drafting of s.74 was that "the undertakers were relieved of the burden of finding, for the purposes of suit, the real wrongdoer" and "the owner in every case was the only necessary defendant".  (p.101)  He also, at p.103, used the examples given in Lord Blackburn's speech - the hirer and the ship-repairer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87. In <i>The Mostyn</i>, the House was influenced by the case of <i>The Crystal</i> [1894]  AC 508 which had also had to consider the speeches in <i>Adamson</i>.  It concerned the cost of wreck removal.  The vessel had sunk in the Tyne following a collision which was not her fault.  She was a total loss and had been abandoned to underwriters.  The harbour authority incurred expense dispersing the wreck.  It was acting under its statutory powers under s.56 of the 1847 Act which was the predecessor of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894.  The authority sought to recover those costs from the owner of the vessel, that is to say her owner at the time she sank.  The claim was rejected.  The liability was strict and was a liability of the person who owned the property.  But the property in question was the wreck not the vessel before she sank.  A point which particularly influenced the House was the provision that the harbour authority was given a power of sale in order to recoup the expenditure with any surplus being returned to the owner.  As was particularly pointed out by Lord Herschell at p.519, it would produce an inconsistency if s.56 were construed as referring to different persons as the owner at different places: the person liable as owner is the same person as the owner entitled to be paid the surplus (if any).  This reasoning, based on property not control, was applied in <i>The Mostyn</i> to s.74 as is demonstrated by the quotations I have made and the reasoning from s.56 (which is, incidentally, also incorporated into the 1974 Act) is equally applicable to sections 74 and 75 with the powers of detention distraint and sale which they contain.  Similar reasoning was also adopted in <i>The Towerfield</i> [1951]  AC 112.  In his speech, Lord Radcliffe described <i>The Mostyn</i> as deciding "that the shipowner's liability under it did not depend on any imputation of default to him or to others who might be in charge of the ship"; "it was plain that the section was conceived in the interests of the dock or harbour authority and was calculated to produce on occasions what might be very rough justice indeed".  (p.157)  He also pointed out that it was an error to import legal conceptions of responsibility in tort into the simple words of s.74 which had been held in <i>The Mostyn</i> not to be directed to any considerations of tortious liability.</p>
