<p class="para">101.&nbsp;&nbsp;As Lord Hope has explained in paras 27 to 30 of his opinion, there are two statutes conferring a degree of protection to those who make their homes in caravans: the Caravan Sites Act 1968 and the Mobile Homes Act 1983.  Each expressly makes exceptions to the protection extended to residents on local authority sites.  In particular, section 2 of and paras 4 to 6 of Schedule 1 to the Mobile Homes Act 1983 protect the security of tenure of a resident on a “protected site".  The occupant can be evicted only under a court order, which may be made only if (i) the occupier is in breach of a term of his agreement and the court considers it reasonable for it to be terminated; or (ii) the court is satisfied that the occupier is not occupying the caravan as his home; or (iii) the court is satisfied that the condition of the caravan is or will be detrimental to the amenity of the site.</p>
<p class="para">102.&nbsp;&nbsp;By section 5(1) of the Mobile Homes Act “protected site” is defined in such a way that it </p>
<p class="paraleft">“does not include any land occupied by a local authority as a caravan site providing accommodation for gipsies.”</p>
<p class="para">Those words are a very clear indication of Parliament’s intention that the law should be different in respect of gipsy caravan sites provided by local authorities.  There is no possibility of the different treatment having arisen through some error or inadvertence.  Parliament deliberately enacted the exception in order to give effect to a policy based on gipsies’ nomadic lifestyle, a policy which the United Kingdom defended, strenuously but unsuccessfully, in <i>Connors</i>: see 40 EHRR 189, paras 43-46 (summarizing the statutory provisions and referring to <i>Greenwich LBC v Powell</i> [1989] AC 995, 1012); paras 77-80 (the government’s submissions); and paras 81-95 (the Court’s assessment).  It would be disingenuous to say that the government was defending the common law; it was defending Parliament’s deliberate adoption of a special regime for gipsy caravans on local authority sites.</p>
<p class="para">103.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am therefore in agreement with the Court of Appeal’s own views on this point, which Carnwath LJ expressed as follows (at para 53, after some references to the majority opinion in <i>Kay</i>):</p>
<p class="paraleft">“It simply recognises that Parliament may express its policy intentions in a particular statutory scheme equally by means of exclusion or by inclusion.  In <i>Connors</i> (para 44) the Strasbourg court itself referred to <i>Greenwich LBC v Powell</i> [1989]  AC 995, 1012 B-C, where the House of Lords had referred to the clear ‘intention of the legislature’ shown by the 1983 Act to exclude local authority sites from protection.  In our view, in respectful agreement with Lord Hope, it is artificial to draw a distinction between the two means.”</p>
<p class="para">104.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where domestic law on a particular topic is a complex amalgam of common law and statute it may be difficult for the court to decide whether section 6(2) of the HRA applies or not.  The paramount consideration, I think, will be whether the composite legal scheme in general, and the offending provision in particular (offending, that is, against someone’s Convention right) clearly represents the considered intention of Parliament.  In my opinion the present case is, for the reasons which I have mentioned, clearly within that category.  By contrast the fact that Parliament has made some limited statutory modifications to the common law of defamation could not, I think, be treated as a general parliamentary endorsement of those extensive areas which have been left unmodified.  Within these extremes there may be some difficult problems to be determined on a case by case basis.</p>
<p class="para">105.&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision of the Strasbourg Court in <i>Connors </i>was based on the deficiencies of the “statutory scheme” which disadvantaged gypsies ((2004) 40 EHRR 189, para 94, summarising the effect of the previous paragraphs).  Precisely the same statutory scheme was applicable in this case.  It has been held to infringe article 8.  Mr Luba’s fallback position was therefore that your Lordships should make a declaration of incompatibility.  Mr Underwood QC (for the City Council) did not, as I understand it, strenuously oppose that submission. During your Lordships’ protracted deliberations on this appeal the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 has passed through Parliament and received the Royal Assent. It corrects the defect in the statutory scheme. But for that I would have urged your Lordships to make a declaration of incompatibility at least in relation to section 5(1) of the Mobile Homes Act 1983 (the offending provision in the Caravan Sites Act 1968 having already been covered by amending legislation).  </p>
<p class="para">106.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not necessarily the end of the appeal.  It provides a conclusion to what has been called gateway (a), but it leaves gateway (b) to be considered.  The two gateways are not necessarily exclusive alternatives. My noble and learned friend Lord Hope of Craighead makes that point in para 10 of his opinion.</p>
<p class="para">107.&nbsp;&nbsp;I must candidly admit that I feel difficulty about this part of the appeal.  As one of the minority in <i>Kay</i>, I must accept the decision of the majority, which distinguishes between grounds of judicial review which are based on the HRA and grounds (“common law” or “conventional” grounds) which are not based on the HRA.  The minority accepted the view of Lord Bingham of Cornhill (in <i>Kay</i> at paras 36-38, and at sub-para (3)(b) in the summary in para 39) that article 8 might, highly exceptionally, provide a tenant or licensee with additional protection.  Lord Hope, in the leading speech for the majority, disagreed (para 110).  So did Lord Scott (para 172), Baroness Hale (paras 189-190) and (most emphatically) Lord Brown (paras 207-208).  </p>
<p class="para">108.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are all agreed that the decision in <i>Kay</i> cannot be reopened, and I must and do accept it.  Nevertheless I think that I may properly express unease and indeed incomprehension at the suggestion, which is at least implicit in this part of the decision, that HRA grounds and traditional judicial review grounds can always be separately identified.  My unease is only partly diminished by Baroness Hale’s observations in <i>Kay</i> at para 190:</p>
<p class="paraleft">“It should not be forgotten that in an appropriate case, the range of considerations which any public authority should take into account in deciding whether to invoke its powers can be very wide: see <i>R v Lincolnshire County Council ex parte Atkinson</i> (1995)  8 Admin LR 529; <i>R (Casey) v Crawley Borough Council</i> [2006]  EWHC 301 (Admin).”   </p>
<p class="para">In <i>Atkinson</i> Sedley J (at p 534) quoted from an official circular, the quotation being repeated by Carnwath LJ in this case at para 56):</p>
<p class="paraleft">“. . . local authorities should not use their powers to evict gypsies needlessly.  They should use the powers in a humane and compassionate fashion and primarily to reduce nuisance and to afford a higher level of protection to private owners of land.”</p>
<p class="para">He added (at pp 535-536):</p>
<p class="paraleft">“. . .those considerations in the material paragraphs which are not statutory are considerations of common humanity, none of which can properly be ignored when dealing with one of the most fundamental human needs, the need for shelter with at least a modicum of security.”</p>
<p class="para">That case was of course decided several years before the HRA came into force.</p>
<p class="para">109.&nbsp;&nbsp;Public authorities are bound to take account of human rights.  As our domestic human rights jurisprudence develops and becomes bedded down, this should be seen as a normal part of their functions, not an exotic introduction.  I would echo a note by Anthony Lester QC and David Pannick QC to which I have already alluded ((2000) 116 LQR 380, 383):</p>
<p class="paraleft">“The central legislative purpose [of the HRA] is that of bringing the Convention rights home, that is, of domesticating them so that they are not regarded as alien rights protected exclusively by a ‘foreign’ European Court.  To change the metaphor yet again, Convention rights must be woven into the fabric of domestic law.  In the absence of a written British constitution, it is especially important to weave the Convention rights into the principles of the common law and of equity so that they strengthen rather than undermine those principles, including the principle of legal certainty.”</p>
<p class="para">Still more importantly, they must be woven into the fabric of public law.  The argument against speaking about “conventional judicial review grounds” is not limited to the verbal incongruity of using that phrase to mean “grounds that have nothing to do with the European Convention on Human Rights.”</p>
<p class="para">110.&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority in <i>Kay</i> did not spell out clearly why they thought it necessary to distinguish between “conventional” and HRA grounds for challenging a housing authority’s decision to take possession proceedings against a tenant.  The most likely reason, I think (and Carnwath LJ seems to have taken the same view), is that most of the majority were applying section 6(2)(b) of HRA as construed by this House in <i>R (Hooper) v Secretary of State for Work &amp; Pensions</i> [2005] 1 WLR 1681.  That brings me to the second important and difficult point on section 6(2).  The House’s decision in <i>Hooper</i> answered (at least partially) a question which had been simmering since the HRA was enacted, as to the scope and effect of section 6(2)(b).  The topic was considered in two cases of alleged discrimination which were decided together at each stage of their course through the courts: <i>R (Hooper) v Secretary of State for Work &amp; Pensions</i> [2002]  EWHC 191(Admin) (Moses J, 14 February 2002); [2003] 1 WLR 2623 (CA); [2005] 1 WLR 1681 (HL) and <i>R (Wilkinson) v Inland Revenue Commissioners</i> [2002]  STC 347  (Moses J); [2003] 1 WLR 2623 (CA); [2005] 1 WLR 1718 (HL).  At first instance they were heard separately, but disposed of in judgments delivered on the same day; in the Court of Appeal they were heard together, but with separate judgments; in this House they were heard consecutively by the same Appellate Committee. Each case concerned alleged discrimination against widowers on the ground of their gender, <i>Hooper</i> in connection with the payment of pensions under social security legislation and <i>Wilkinson</i> in connection with the grant of bereavement allowances for income tax purposes. Each case was complicated by issues of constitutional law (as to the authority for and the legality of extra statutory payments and concessions) which make some of the arguments on section 6(2) quite difficult to follow.</p>
<p class="para">111.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is generally accepted that section 6(2)(a) applies to statutory duties, and section 6(2)(b) to statutory powers and discretions.  But there is need for more analysis.  A public authority with a statutory power may exercise it or not as it thinks fit, subject only to the usual public law restraints.  Does section 6(2)(b) enable it to exercise the power with impunity in a way that infringes Convention rights, when it could act differently?  In <i>Wilkinson</i>, Moses J cited the view expressed by Grosz, Beatson and Duffy, Human Rights: the 1998 Act and the European Convention (2000) para 4-22, that a public authority can rely on section 6(2)(b) only in circumstances where <i>any</i> exercise of the power would involve a breach of Convention rights.  He saw this as supported by the Divisional Court in the <i>Alconbury</i> case (reported at that level as <i>R (Holding &amp; Barnes plc) v Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions</i> [2001] 1 All ER 929); <i>R v Kansal (No 2)</i> [2002] 2 AC 69 and <i>R (Friends Provident Life &amp; Pensions Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions</i> [2001] EWHC 820.  But Moses J went on to hold that the position was different in a situation in which a public authority could avoid a breach of Convention rights only by exercising a power on every single occasion when it was possible to do so, since then the power would become a duty, and would be destroyed as a power (the context was the suggestion that the Inland Revenue should grant an extra-statutory bereavement allowance to every widower, so as to avoid any discrimination).  Moses J reached a similar conclusion in his unreported judgment in <i>Hooper</i> (his conclusion was quoted by the Court of Appeal, [2003] 1 WLR 2623, para 115).</p>
<p class="para">112.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Hooper</i> the Court of Appeal accepted the first limb of Moses J’s reasoning, but rejected the second.  However, on further appeal to this House Lord Hoffmann (with whom Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead and Lord Hope agreed) differed from the Court of Appeal and also differed from Moses J on what I have called the first limb ([2005] 1 WLR 1681, paras 48, 49, 51):</p>
<p class="paraleft">“But section 6(2)(b) says nothing about a decision having to be necessary for any particular purpose.  If the 1992 or 1999 Acts had made it <i>necessary</i> not to make extra-statutory payments, the case would have fallen under section 6(2)(a).  The Secretary of State could not have acted differently.  </p>
<p class="paraleft">Clearly, section 6(2)(b) has a different purpose.  It assumes that the public authority could have acted differently but nevertheless excludes liability if it was giving effect to a statutory provision which cannot be read as Convention-compliant in accordance with section 3.  It follows that section 6(1) does not apply if the Secretary of State was acting incompatibly with Convention rights because he was giving effect to sections 36 and 37 of the 1992 Act . . .</p>
<p class="paraleft">This reasoning is in my opinion supported by the evident purpose of section 6(2), which was to preserve the sovereignty of Parliament: see Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead in <i>Aston Cantlow and Wilmcote</i> <i>with</i> <i>Billesley Parochial Church Council v Wallbank </i> [2004]  1 AC 546, para 19.  If legislation cannot be read compatibly with Convention rights, a public authority is not obliged to subvert the intention of Parliament by treating itself as under a duty to neutralise the effect of the legislation.”</p>
<p class="para">113.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Hope, as well as agreeing with Lord Hoffmann, added some further reasons of his own, including the following (para 73):</p>
<p class="paraleft">“The important point to notice about paragraph (b) is that the source of the discretion does not matter.  What matters is (a) that the provisions in regard to which the authority has this discretion cannot be read or given effect compatibly with the Convention rights and (b) that the authority has decided to exercise or not to exercise its discretion, whatever its source, so as to give effect to those provisions or to enforce them.  If it does this, this paragraph affords it a defence to a claim under section 7(1) that by acting or failing to act in this way it has acted unlawfully.  In this way it enables the primary legislation to remain effective in the way Parliament intended.  If the defence was not there the authority would have no alternative but to exercise its discretion in a way that was compatible with the Convention rights.  This power would become a duty to act compatibly with the Convention, even if to do so was plainly in conflict with the intention of Parliament.”</p>
<p class="para">Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood took a rather different line, but reached much the same conclusion.  <i>Hooper</i> and <i>Wilkinson</i> were very special cases and the line of argument which the House rejected would indeed have amounted to an obvious large-scale subversion of Parliament’s intention.  I am not at all sure that the same reasoning can sensibly be applied to a housing authority’s general powers of management of its stock of social housing.  But I understand that I am bound, by the majority decision in <i>Kay</i>, to assume that that is how section 6(2)(b) applies.</p>
<p class="para">114.&nbsp;&nbsp;In cases of this sort the relevant statutory discretions arise as part of the City Council’s general statutory functions in managing its social housing stock under s.21 of the Housing Act 1985 or (as in this case) s.24 of the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960.  There seems to be nothing in these statutory provisions which compels the City Council to take proceedings for possession in any particular circumstances (in contrast to the position of a judge who, if the case for possession has been made out, has no freedom of choice because of s.4(6) of the Caravan Sites Act 1968).  But for <i>Hooper</i> and <i>Kay</i> I would have supposed that s.6(2)(b) does not apply to a case where a housing authority had power to start proceedings aimed at a summary order for possession but could lawfully have decided to take a different course (that is, either holding their hand for the moment, or starting proceedings framed in such a way that any complaint which they had against the tenant or licensee would be adjudicated on by the court).</p>
<p class="para">115.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, I had prepared most of my opinion down to this point when the House was informed of the decision of the Fourth Section of the European Court of Human Rights in <i>McCann v United Kingdom</i> 13 May 2008, Application No 19009/04, and decided to entertain further written submissions from the parties (including the Secretary of State as intervener) as to the significance of <i>McCann</i>.  Having studied the decision and the further submissions I do not feel it necessary to withdraw or qualify anything that I have so far written.  In common (as I understand it) with the rest of your Lordships I do not think, despite the decision in <i>McCann,</i> that it would be right for this Appellate Committee to depart from the decision recently arrived at in <i>Kay</i> by an Appellate Committee of seven members.  That is my view even though we now know that <i>McCann</i> will not go to a full hearing before the Grand Chamber.  But your Lordships certainly have to take account of <i>McCann.</i></p>
<p class="para">116.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of <i>McCann</i> the precise scope of what was decided by this House in <i>Kay</i> becomes a still more pressing question, since the Fourth Section of the Strasbourg Court shows an obvious preference for the views of the minority.  Lord Hope takes the view (in para 36 of his opinion) that para 110 of his opinion in <i>Kay</i> requires further explanation, and as his explanation develops it narrows (without closing) the gap between HRA grounds and traditional judicial review grounds.  </p>
<p class="para">117.&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point I find it helpful to stand back a little and consider the very different positions of the Strasbourg Court and a court hearing a possession action in England and Wales.  Strasbourg is concerned with the bigger picture: has the United Kingdom failed, through all or any of its legislative, executive or judicial arms, to meet the requirements of article 8(2) (it being a given that eviction from one’s home engages article 8)?  The Strasbourg Court is normally not much concerned with the separation of powers under the constitution of any particular country which is a party to a complaint, although it generally does in its written judgments record the part which each arm of government has taken in the matter.  In <i>McCann</i> there is a particularly careful analysis, in paras 19 to 28 of the judgment, and it is clear that in that case (as in <i>Connors</i>) the breach of article 8 which the Court found was procedural (para 59 of the judgment in <i>McCann</i>).  But the outcome in Strasbourg would have been the same, I think, whether the County Court judge’s conclusion  that he could not or should not enquire into proportionality had been imposed on him by Parliament (as for instance with an introductory or demoted tenancy under, para 1A or 1B of Schedule 1 to the Housing Act 1985), or resulted from the housing authority’s action (under its normal policy, recorded in para 21 of the Strasbourg judgment) in getting Mrs McCann to give a notice to quit, or was caused by the judge’s (wholly understandable) inability to foresee the twists and turns by which this area of law has evolved.</p>
<p class="para">118.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the domestic court the position is very different.  For the domestic court (at every level from a district judge to your Lordships’ House) the European Convention on Human Rights is mediated through the HRA, which preserves parliamentary sovereignty.  All courts have a duty to apply the interpretative obligation in section 3, but no one suggests that section 3 applies here.  Judges at the level of the High Court and above have the power and duty, in appropriate cases, to make a declaration of incompatibility under section 4.  <i>Kay</i> shows that a successful challenge to our housing legislation, as legislation, is likely to be extremely rare, because (as Baroness Hale put it in para 182 of her opinion, in a passage which I have already quoted)</p>
<p class="paraleft">“the Court is entitled to make two assumptions.  The first is that the domestic law has struck the right balance between the competing interests involved: those of a person occupying premises as his home and those of the landowner seeking to regain possession of those premises in accordance with the law.”</p>
<p class="para">But it is only an assumption, and both <i>Connors</i> and the present case show that the special treatment which Parliament accorded to local authority gipsy caravan sites was, in human rights terms, a legislative error.</p>
<p class="para">119.&nbsp;&nbsp;By contrast, the important distinction drawn by our housing legislation between tenancies as to which the court must be satisfied, and those as to which it need not be satisfied, that it is reasonable to make a possession order is, <i>Kay</i> tells us, not open to attack under section 4 of HRA, because Parliament has over a long period worked out arrangements which strike a fair balance between the article 8 rights of existing tenants (who may be only probationary, or may have lost secure status as a result of past failings) and the claims of others with a pressing need for social housing.  So the important distinctions drawn by the Housing Act 1985 (as amended) between different types of tenancy cannot, since <i>Kay</i> and at the legislative level, be attacked as incompatible with article 8 rights.</p>
<p class="para">120.&nbsp;&nbsp;But <i>Connors</i> and <i>McCann</i> show that the decisions that a housing authority makes in giving effect to the legislation may be open to attack, subject to section 6(2)(b), as having been made with insufficient respect towards the tenant’s article 8 rights.  It is understandable that housing authorities, faced with long waiting lists and limited human and financial resources to deal with possession cases, should seek the simplest and cheapest way of obtaining possession from tenants or former tenants.  Why embark on proceedings which may involve a day or more’s oral evidence (possibly involving witnesses liable to be intimidated) if there appears to be a route under which the defendant will not be able to resist summary judgment?  Does not the authority’s duty to its council tax payers, and in particular to those on the waiting list, compel the choice of the simpler, cheaper remedy?  </p>
<p class="para">121.&nbsp;&nbsp;The decisions of the Strasbourg Court in <i>Connors </i>and <i>McCann</i> show that housing authorities may find that, in the long run, that course will not be simpler and cheaper.  Their housing policies ought to take account of the article 8 rights of tenants or ex-tenants, even if they are protected by section 6(2)(b) from direct challenge in the courts. To adopt a Convention-compliant policy could not possibly be described as subverting the will of Parliament (the expression used by Lord Hoffmann in <i>Hooper</i>).  Even if section 6(2)(b) of HRA gives a housing authority immunity, the decision-making process leading up to the commencement of proceedings ought to be Convention-compliant.  In <i>Connors</i>, the authority decided simply to terminate Mr Connors’ licence rather than undertake the burden of proving anti-social behaviour amounting to nuisance on the part of his extended family.  In <i>McCann</i>, the authority gave effect to its policy of obtaining a “relinquishing form” (that is, a notice to quit terminating the tenancy) signed by the departing wife, so making it unnecessary for the authority to call evidence of domestic violence, and depriving Mr McCann of the opportunity of challenging such evidence.  The Strasbourg Court stated (para 55):</p>
<p class="paraleft">“It is, for present purposes, immaterial whether or not Mrs McCann understood or intended the effects of the notice to quit.  Under the summary procedure available to a landlord where one joint tenant serves notice to quit, the applicant was dispossessed of his home without any possibility to have the proportionality of the measure determined by an independent tribunal.  It follows that, because of the lack of adequate procedural safeguards, there has been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention in the instant case.”</p>
<p class="para">122.&nbsp;&nbsp;In these circumstances I find that I have to reconsider a remark in my dissenting opinion in <i>Kay</i>, that circumstances of this sort would be highly exceptional.  Obtaining a “relinquishing notice” was (and perhaps still is) part of the Birmingham City Council’s housing policy, and it may also be the policy of many other housing authorities.  Such policies will need to be reconsidered.  In the meantime there may be more cases of this sort than the Strasbourg Court supposed (para 53).</p>
<p class="para">123.&nbsp;&nbsp;In deciding whether an arguable defence has been raised, and in hearing any contested case on its merits, the County Court judge (who is also a public authority for the purposes of HRA) will follow the guidance in para 110 of Lord Hope’s opinion in <i>Kay</i>, as more fully explained by his opinion in this case.  Occasionally section 3 of HRA may be in play.  If section 4 is seriously in play, the case will have to be transferred to the High Court.  If the defence is focused not on the legislation but on the housing authority’s decision-making process the judge will in effect be hearing an application for judicial review on traditional review grounds.  It is clear that any defence on these lines may now be raised and decided on oral evidence given in the County Court.  It will no longer be necessary to have an adjournment to enable the defendant to make a separate application for judicial review (in which oral evidence would probably not be permitted).</p>
