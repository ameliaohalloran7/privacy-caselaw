<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105.<i>	The Michael</i> is, in my opinion, a very important case for present purposes.  It seems to me that in order to succeed on the section 17 issue Mr. Pollock must persuade us that it was wrongly decided.  It is true, as Mr. Pollock pointed out, that the insurer's case in <i>The Michael</i> was presented as one of fraud on the part of the assured.  It was not argued that a lower degree of culpability would suffice.  There is, however, no hint in Roskill LJ's judgment in <i>The Michael</i> that the insurer's were trying to jump a hurdle higher than was necessary.</p>

<p>106.	Mr Pollock, in support of the submission that the section 17 duty attending the presentation and prosecution of a claim might be broken by culpable conduct falling short of fraud, relied on remarks made by Hirst J in <i>The Litsion Pride</i> [1985] 1 Lloyd's Rep 437.  The Litsion Pride was insured against war risks but, in the event of the vessel sailing to certain specified destinations, the insurers could exact an additional premium at their discretion.  The time was the Gulf War.  Bandar Khomeini in the Persian Gulf was, it was agreed, the most dangerous port in the Gulf.  A voyage there would be bound to attract an additional premium at a very high rate.  The vessel sailed to Bandar Khomeini without notification being given to the insurers.  It came under attack and sank.  A letter purporting to pre-date the voyage and to give notice of the vessel's destination was concocted by the assured in order to deceive the insurers into believing that the failure to give notice of the voyage before its commencement was due to an innocent oversight.  Hirst J. held that the falsely dated letter was a fraud directly connected to the claim and a breach of the section 17 duty of utmost good faith.  I do not think anyone would dissent from that conclusion.  But Mr Pollock, counsel for the insurers before Hirst J had submitted that a breach of the duty "… might be established for instance by proof of deliberate non-disclosure [or] misrepresentation, albeit negligent or even innocent, by either the owners or the brokers." (p 507).  Mr Kentridge QC, counsel for the assured, had submitted that, once the contract had been concluded, "the sole duty of the assured was not to act vis-à-vis the underwriter in a fraudulent manner … (p 508)"  But Hirst J did not accept that the post-contract duty was so confined and held, at p 512, that:</p>

<p></p><ul>"…the duty in the claims sphere extends to culpable misrepresentation or non-disclosure."<p></p></ul>

<p>Before us, Mr Pollock has resiled from the contention that, post- contract, merely negligent or innocent misrepresentation or non-disclosure could constitute a breach of the continuing section 17 duty.  But he has maintained his submission that fraud or dishonesty is not essential and that conduct which can fairly be described as unconscionable could suffice.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107.	Two recent cases in which this issue has been considered merit attention.  The first is the judgment of Rix J. in <i>Royal Boskalis Westminster NV  v  Mountain</i> [1997]  LRLR 523.  Rix J was troubled by the notion that the post-contractual duty of good faith could extend beyond fraud to some unspecified degree of culpability (p 597).  He found, on the facts of the case that "non-fraudulent but culpable and deliberate misrepresentation and non-disclosure have been proved, albeit they were subsequently repented of and remedied" (p 601).  He held that the insurers had failed to establish that the misrepresentations and non-disclosures had been material and that the insurers were not entitled under section 17 to avoid the policy.</p>

<p>108.	Mance J. in <i>Standard Steamship Owners' P &amp; I Association (Bermuda) Ltd v. Oceanfast Shipping Ltd</i>, (unreported) in which judgment was handed down on 6 March 1996, described as "extravagant …. [the] proposition that mere negligence in the presentation of a claim could lead to avoidance of the whole contract of insurance".  (p 13).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109.	In my opinion, the ambit of the post-contract section 17 duty cannot be considered without account also being taken of the difficulties of materiality that troubled Rix J in <i>the Royal Boskalis </i>case.  Let it be supposed that Mr Pollock is right and that non-disclosure not involving any dishonesty may entitle an insurer to avoid the policy.  Materiality becomes highly relevant.  It can only be the non-disclosure of material facts or information that can lead to the Draconian remedy of avoidance.  But what is to be the yardstick by which materiality is measured?  A decision to disclose or not to disclose would have to be taken at an early stage.  Delayed disclosure would expose the assured to similar charges to those being made in the present case where disclosure of the two <i>Kastora</i> reports was made in the course of the trial.  The assured will often not know where, in the spectrum that runs from 'interesting' at one end to 'issue determinative' at the other, the facts or information in question should be placed.  A similar problem in connection with the discovery of documents led to the rule that "a document, which, it is not unreasonable to suppose, may tend either to advance the case of the party seeking discovery, or to damage the case of his adversary" should be disclosed (<i>Compagnie Financiere et Commerciale du Pacifique v Peruvian Guano Co </i> (1882), 60 11 QBD 55, 60).  If Mr Pollock is right, what other test of materiality is proposed?  None has been suggested.  In the present case, let it be supposed that nothing in either of the two reports is determinative of any issue in the claim.  Nonetheless, it is submitted that a decision not to give early disclosure of them constitutes a section 17 breach and entitles the insurer to avoid the contract.  If that were right, an assured would have to be advised to swamp his insurer with a mass of facts and information which might have some conceivable relevance to an issue in the case.  This duty of disclosure could not logically be limited to information contained in documents.  It would, if Mr. Pollock is right, extend also to information imparted orally.  A duty that required such massive disclosure at the claim stage lacks any commercial justification or sense.</p>

<p>110.	These difficulties make clear, in my opinion, that Mr Pollock's submission cannot be accepted.  The presentation of a dishonest or fraudulent claim constitutes a breach of duty that entitles the insurer to  repudiate any liability for the claim and, prospectively at least, to avoid any liability under the policy.  Whether the presentation of such a claim should be regarded as a breach of a continuing duty under section 17 that entitles the insurer to avoid the policy with retrospective effect, enabling any payments made in satisfaction of previous unimpeachable claims to be recovered by the insurer, is more debatable.  It is not necessary in the present case to decide that point.  Nor is it necessary to decide what the position would be, if a claim that had been honestly begun were dishonestly continued.  I have in mind a claim for the loss of goods that, post-claim, were found or otherwise restored to the insured owner.  I can see a great deal of force in the argument that the section 17 duty does not apply to conduct in the prosecution of litigation, as to which the Rules of Court that govern litigation constitute the regulatory code.  A decision as to that, too, is best left for a case where the point is critical to the result.</p>

<p>111.	I would, however, limit the duty owed by an insured in relation to a claim to a duty of honesty. If the duty derives from section 17, nonetheless this limitation does not, in my opinion involve a judicial re-writing of section 17.  On the contrary, it would be the creation out of section 17 of a duty that could be broken notwithstanding that the assured had acted throughout in good faith that would constitute a re-writing of the section.  Unless the assured has acted in bad faith he cannot, in my opinion, be in breach of a duty of good faith, utmost or otherwise.  For these reasons, I agree with Tuckey J and the Court of Appeal in concluding that the insurers' section 17 claim cannot succeed.<i></i></p><i>

<p>The section 39(5) issue</p>

</i><p>112.	Did the assured have blind-eye knowledge of the unseaworthiness of the <i>Star Sea</i>?  It is as well to return to the language of the sub-section.  What is required is "privity" on the assured's part of the unseaworthiness.  "Privity" in its ordinary meaning connotes knowledge.  "Blind-eye" knowledge approximates to knowledge.  Nelson at the battle of Copenhagen made a deliberate decision to place the telescope to his blind eye in order to avoid seeing what he knew he would see if he placed it to his good eye.  It is, I think, common ground - and if it is not, it should be - that an imputation of blind-eye knowledge requires an amalgam of suspicion that certain facts may exist and a decision to refrain from taking any step to confirm their existence.  Lord Blackburn in <i>Jones v. Gordon</i> (1877) 2 App Cas 616, 629 distinguished a person who was "honestly blundering and careless" from a person who "refrained from asking questions, not because he was an honest blunderer or a stupid man, but because he thought in his own secret mind - I suspect there is something wrong, and if I ask questions and make farther inquiry, it will no longer be my suspecting it, but my knowing it, and then I shall not be able to recover".  Lord Blackburn added "I think that is dishonesty".</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113.	In <i>The Eurysthenes</i> [1977] 1 QB 49, Lord Denning MR gave the following description of 'blind-eye' knowledge:</p>

<p></p><ul>"If a man, suspicious of the truth, turns a blind eye to it, and refrains from inquiry - so that he should not know it for certain - then he is to be regarded as knowing the truth."  (p 68) <p></p></ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114.	Roskill LJ, in the same case, made clear that 'privity' in section 39(5) "must mean that he is privy to the unseaworthiness and not merely that he has knowledge of facts which may ultimately be proved to amount to unseaworthiness" and then turned to 'blind-eye' knowledge.  He said:</p>

<p></p><ul>"If the facts amounting to unseaworthiness are there staring the assured in the face so that he must, had he thought of it, have realised their implication upon the unseaworthiness of his ship, he cannot escape from being held privy to that unseaworthiness by blindly or blandly ignoring those facts or by refraining from asking relevant questions regarding them in the hope that by his lack of inquiry he will not know for certain that which any inquiry must have made plain beyond possibility of doubt." (p 76)<p></p></ul>

<p>I have some difficulty with Roskill LJ's inclusion in the cited passage of the qualification "had he thought of it."  If the assured had not "thought of it" he would, presumably, not have realised the implications of the facts.  His refraining from inquiry would not then have been attributable to the hope that he would not know for certain.  I do not, myself, see how a failure to think about the facts, and hence a failure to realise their implications, can afford the basis for a finding of blind-eye knowledge.  I respectfully prefer the formulation by Geoffrey Lane LJ:</p>

<p></p><ul>"Knowledge of what?  Again the subsection is clear.  It says 'unseaworthiness', not 'facts which in the upshot prove to amount to unseaworthiness'.  Accordingly it seems clear to me that if this matter were res integra, the section would mean that the assured only loses his cover if he has consented to or concurred in the ship going to sea when he knew or believed that, it was in an unseaworthy condition.  I add the word 'believed' to cover the man who deliberately turns a blind eye to what he believes to be true in order to avoid obtaining certain knowledge of the truth."  (p 81)<p></p></ul>

<p>Geoffrey Lane LJ's formulation was very similar to that of Branson J in <i>The Gloria</i> (1935)  54 LlLR 35: </p>

<p></p><ul>"I think that if it were shown that an owner had reason to believe that his ship was in fact unseaworthy, and deliberately refrained from an examination which would have turned his belief into knowledge, he might properly be held privy to the unseaworthiness of his ship.  But the mere omission to take precautions against the possibility of the ship being unseaworthy cannot, I think, make the owner privy to any unseaworthiness which such precaution might have disclosed."  (p 58)<p></p></ul>

<p>Leggatt LJ in the present case, after referring to <i>The Eurysthenes</i> and <i>The Gloria</i>, concluded that: </p>

<p></p><ul>"what the defendant underwriters had to establish was a suspicion or realisation in the mind of at least one of the relevant individuals that <i>Star Sea</i> was unseaworthy in one of the relevant aspects, and a decision not to check whether that was so for fear of having certain knowledge about it". (p 377). <p></p></ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115.	Save that, having regard to the judge's findings on causation, I and the insurers' concession (referred to by my noble and learned friend Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough), the suspicion or realisation of unseaworthiness had to be of both, and not simply of one, of the relevant aspects, I agree with that formulation.  There must be a suspicion of the relevant unseaworthiness, and a decision not to check.  Unless there is a decision not to check, not to obtain confirmation of what is suspected, there will, in my opinion, be no privity, no blind-eye knowledge, however seriously negligent the failure to check may be.  It is in this respect that, in agreement with Leggatt LJ, I think Tuckey J was in error.  He made no finding of a deliberate decision not to enquire on the part of any of the individuals who, for this purpose, could constitute the assured.  Such a finding was, in my view, an essential condition of a conclusion of blind-eye knowledge.  It is not acceptable, in my opinion to assume, from the judge's conclusion of blind-eye knowledge that he did find that one or other of the individuals had made a deliberate decision not to enquire.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116.	In summary, blind-eye knowledge requires, in my opinion, a suspicion that the relevant facts do exist and a deliberate decision to avoid confirming that they exist.  But a warning should be sounded.  Suspicion is a word that can be used to describe a state-of-mind that may, at one extreme, be no more than a vague feeling of unease and, at the other extreme, reflect a firm belief in the existence of the relevant facts.  In my opinion, in order for there to be blind-eye knowledge, the suspicion must be firmly grounded and targeted on specific facts.  The deliberate decision must be a decision to avoid obtaining confirmation of facts in whose existence the individual has good reason to believe.  To allow blind-eye knowledge to be constituted by a decision not to enquire into an untargeted or speculative suspicion would be to allow negligence, albeit gross, to be the basis of a finding of privity.  That, in my opinion, is not warranted by section 39(5).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117.	In the present case, on the facts, I can see no sufficient basis for attributing to any of the four individuals blind-eye knowledge of either of the two respects of unseaworthiness.  The incompetence of the masters of the <i>Centaurus</i> and the <i>Kastora</i> did not put the Kollakis brothers, Mr Faraklas or Mr Nicholaidis in a position in which they were bound to enquire into the competence of every other master in the Kollakis fleet.  The master of the <i>Star Sea</i>, although recently appointed to the <i>Star Sea</i>, had been with the fleet for over 11 years and there was no evidence of any previous incompetence on his part.  He had held a master's certificate since 1978.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118.	As to the dampers, outside contractors had been hired to overhaul the <i>Star Sea's</i> fire dampers while the vessel was laying-up in Piraeus before commencing its final voyage.  Tuckey J expressed the opinion that: </p>

<p></p><ul>"It was not enough merely to instruct outside contractors to overhaul dampers.  The evidence shows that the decision as to what dampers to overhaul was effectively made by the contractors' foreman.  In view of the state of the dampers on <i>Star Sea</i> after the fire, it is quite clear, I think, that work should have been done to her dampers in lay-up which was not done." (p 663)  <p></p></ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge went on to say that some system should have been in place to ensure that the necessary work had been done.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119.	These findings go to negligence, perhaps gross negligence, but they are, in my opinion, no basis for a finding of blind-eye knowledge.  The judge made no finding against either of the Kollakis brothers or against Mr Faraklas of a suspicion or belief that the dampers were defective.  And, as Leggatt LJ in the Court of Appeal pointed out, "there is no reason to suppose that the finding would have been made on this aspect fixing Mr Nicholaidis with a suspicion or belief where others were not" (p 378).  I agree that the evidence did not justify a finding that these four individuals, whether viewed individually or collectively, sent the <i>Star Sea</i> on its voyage in an unseaworthy state believing or suspecting that that might be so.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120.	I therefore agree with the Court of Appeal's conclusion that Tuckey J's finding in favour of the insurers on the section 39(5) issue cannot be sustained.  For these reasons and those given by Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough in his opinion, which I have had the advantage of reading in draft, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
