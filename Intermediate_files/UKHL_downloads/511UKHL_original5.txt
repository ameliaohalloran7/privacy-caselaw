<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117. In paragraph 55 of his opinion, Lord Hutton has posed two questions.  First, are the appellants "fugitive criminals" and, second, is the crime alleged against them an "extradition crime"?  The answer to the questions depends upon the scope to be given to the references to "jurisdiction" in the statutory definitions and other provisions which bear upon the meaning of these expressions.  I am in complete agreement with the answers and the reasons for the answers given by my noble and learned friends.  If a narrow meaning had to be attributed to "jurisdiction", the extradition arrangements between this country and the United States, and indeed all extradition arrangements to which the first Schedule to the 1989 Act applied, would fall short of properly achieving the first of the two purposes to which I have referred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118. There are several aspects of the extradition arrangements applicable under the first Schedule to the 1989 Act that are relevant to the second purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119. There is the double criminality rule.  No one is to be extradited unless the offence he is alleged to have committed would, if it had been committed in England "or within English jurisdiction", have been an offence for which he could be tried under English law.  It has been accepted in the argument before the House that if "jurisdiction" is given the wide meaning for which the respondents contend and that your Lordships have accepted, there would have been extraterritorial jurisdiction under English law over the alleged offence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120. A further safeguard for the fugitive criminal against whom extradition is sought is that the evidence relied on in support of the extradition request must be sufficient by the standards of English law to justify his committal for trial or to produce a case to answer (paragraph 7(1) of the first Schedule to the 1989 Act) (Article IX of the 1972 Treaty).  As to this, I agree with my noble and learned friends that in relation to each of the appellants the test is satisfied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121. Paragraph 8 of the first Schedule contains the final safeguard for the fugitive criminal whose extradition is being sought.  He will not be extradited unless the Secretary of State decides, as a matter of discretion, to order that the extradition may proceed.  It has become the settled practice, as I understand it, for the Secretary of State, in a case where the law of the extraditing state might subject the extradited prisoner on conviction to the death penalty, to require a guarantee that a death sentence will not be imposed (see <i>Soering v United Kingdom</i> (1989) 11 EHRR 439).  But there is, in the circumstances of the present cases, a further matter of concern.  The media have, over the past few weeks, carried reports of the intention of the President of the United States, acting under emergency executive powers, to establish military tribunals to try non-United States citizens who are accused of terrorist offences.  The offences with which these appellants are charged might well fall within the category of offences proposed to be dealt with by military tribunals.  It is reported that the proposed military tribunals will be presided over by military personnel, not judges, will be able to admit evidence that would not ordinarily be admissible before a criminal court of law and will be able to conduct the trial behind closed doors.  The charges against the appellants that have led to the extradition requests were laid before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.  If the appellants are to be extradited I imagine that they will be tried before that court or some other Federal Court and not before a military tribunal that will not need to sit in public and that need not observe the rules of evidence. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122. I agree that these appeals should be dismissed.</p>
<p><b>LORD RODGER OF EARLSFERRY</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123. I gratefully adopt the summary of the facts and issues given in the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Slynn of Hadley.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;124. The appeals arise out of applications for habeas corpus in relation to requisitions by the United States for the extradition of the appellants.  Extradition between the United Kingdom and the United States is regulated by a treaty signed between the two countries in 1972 and given effect in our law by The United States of America (Extradition) Order 1976, an order in council made by Her Majesty under section 2 of the Extradition Act 1870 ("the 1870 Act").  Article 3 of the order provides that the Extradition Acts 1870 to 1935, as amended or extended by any subsequent enactment, are to apply in the case of the United States in accordance with the 1972 Treaty.  This means that our domestic legislation regulating extradition has effect in relation to the United States, but "subject to the limitations, restrictions, conditions, exceptions, and qualifications, if any, contained in the order" (section 5 of the 1870 Act).  In other words the order may limit but cannot extend the scope of the extradition legislation.  When the order was made, the relevant domestic legislation comprised the Extradition Acts 1870 to 1935, but by virtue of section 1(3) of the Extradition Act 1989 ("the 1989 Act") it is now contained in schedule 1 to that Act.  So in the absence of any relevant qualification in the treaty - and none was suggested in argument - the law governing the extradition of the appellants is to be found in schedule 1 to the 1989 Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125. The entire scheme of schedule 1 is built around the concept of the "fugitive criminal".  He is the key figure.  So, for instance, under paragraph 3 every "fugitive criminal" of a relevant state - but no-one else - is liable to be apprehended and surrendered.  Similarly, under paragraph 4(1) the foreign state presents a requisition for the surrender of a "fugitive criminal" and under paragraph 4(2) the Secretary of State may require the metropolitan magistrate to issue his warrant for the apprehension of the "fugitive criminal".  If, eventually, the process ends in the magistrate making an order for his committal, under paragraph 8(2) the Secretary of State orders the "fugitive criminal" to be surrendered and he is handed over to the representative of the requesting state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;126. Paragraph 20 shows who is to be regarded as a "fugitive criminal" for these purposes:</p>
<p></p><ul>"'fugitive criminal' means any person accused or convicted of an extradition crime committed within the jurisdiction of any foreign state who is in or is suspected of being in some part of Her Majesty's dominions;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>'fugitive criminal of a foreign state' means a fugitive criminal accused or convicted of an extradition crime committed within the jurisdiction of that state."<p></p></ul>
<p>These definitions are not free-standing:  they cannot be understood unless one first knows what constitutes an "extradition crime".  To discover that, one has to look at another definition in paragraph 20:</p>
<p></p><ul>"'extradition crime', in relation to any foreign state, is to be construed by reference to the Order in Council under section 2 of the Extradition Act 1870 applying to that state as it had effect immediately before the coming into force of this Act and to any amendments thereafter made to that Order."<p></p></ul>
<p>This in turn sends the reader back to the order in council as it had effect immediately before the 1989 Act came into force on 27 September 1989.  For present purposes the relevant order in council gives effect to the 1972 treaty between the United Kingdom and the United States, article III(1)(b) of which provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"(1)  Extradition shall be granted for an act or omission the facts of which disclose an offence within any of the descriptions listed in the Schedule annexed to this treaty, which is an integral part of the treaty, or any other offence, if:<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul><ul>…<p></p></ul></ul>
<p></p><ul><ul>(b)  the offence is extraditable under the relevant law, being the law of the United Kingdom or other territory to which this treaty applies by virtue of sub-paragraph (1)(a) of article II…."<p></p></ul></ul>
<p>In the case of proceedings such as these, involving the United States, the question whether a crime is an extradition crime must therefore be decided by considering whether it would have been an extradition crime under the 1870 Act and under the treaty, as they stood immediately before the 1989 Act came into force.  In other words, it depends on whether the crime was an "extradition crime" in terms of section 26 of the 1870 Act.  That section provided:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The term 'extradition crime' means a crime which, if committed in England or within English jurisdiction, would be one of the crimes described in the first schedule to this Act".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;127. At the end of the legislative paper-chase the position is this.  The extradition process under schedule 1 to the 1989 Act applies only to fugitive criminals as defined in paragraph 20 of that schedule.  So defined, they are people who have been accused or convicted (a) of committing an extradition crime, as defined in section 26 of the 1870 Act, and (b) of committing that crime "within the jurisdiction" of the requesting state.  Since these appeals concern persons accused rather than convicted of crime, for ease of exposition I shall simply consider the legislation as it applies in such cases.  In turning to look at the course of events in extradition proceedings, I do so against the background of the classic account by Lord Diplock in his speeches in <i>R v Governor of Pentonville Prison, Ex p Sotiriadis</i> [1975] AC 1 and <i>In re Nielsen </i>[1984] AC 606.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;128. Schedule 1 of the 1989 Act is the source of the Secretary of State's powers to deal with a requisition for the surrender of an individual.  Under paragraph 4(2) he can issue an order for the arrest of the person concerned only if he is satisfied both that the person is accused of an extradition crime and that the crime is alleged to have been committed within the jurisdiction of the requesting state.  If the Secretary of State is not so satisfied, then the process can go no further unless and until he is provided with additional information which does satisfy him on these points.  If, on the other hand, the Secretary of State is so satisfied, he may issue an order for the apprehension of the fugitive criminal.  On receipt of the order to proceed the magistrate must issue an arrest warrant if he is presented with such evidence as would, in his opinion, justify the issue of such a warrant if the crime specified in the order had been committed in England or Wales.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;129. When the arrest warrant is executed and the individual is brought before the magistrate, the magistrate may commit him to prison or order his discharge.  Paragraph 7(1) tells the magistrate what he is to do:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In the case of a fugitive criminal accused of an extradition crime, if the foreign warrant authorising the arrest of such criminal is duly authenticated, and such evidence is produced as (subject to the provisions of this Schedule) would, according to the law of England and Wales, make a case requiring an answer by the prisoner if the proceedings were for the trial in England and Wales of an information for the crime. . ."<p></p></ul>
<p>The functions of the magistrate are simply those set out in paragraph 7(1), except that the magistrate is also to receive any evidence tendered to show that the alleged crime is of a political character (paragraph 6(2)).  The magistrate must look to see if the foreign warrant is duly authenticated.  In the case of an American extradition, the authentication formalities are to be found in article VII(5) of the treaty.  If the magistrate is satisfied on that point, the other matter which he has to consider under paragraph 7(1) is whether such evidence of the extradition crime has been produced as would make a case requiring an answer if the proceedings were for trial in England and Wales of an information for the crime specified in the order to proceed.  If he is satisfied on this point, the magistrate commits the fugitive criminal to prison;  otherwise, he orders his discharge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;130. Given the scheme of the legislation, it is helpful to keep distinct the issues which the Secretary of State must consider and the issues which are for the magistrate.  Their roles are different.  If need be, however, the proceedings may be reviewed by the Administrative Court in the application for habeas corpus which is specifically envisaged in paragraph 8(1) of the schedule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;131. Counsel for the appellants argued that the magistrate has to consider whether the individual is "a fugitive criminal accused of an extradition crime" since his jurisdiction under paragraph 7(1) depends on that being the position.  The suggestion was that, in a case like the present, this would involve the magistrate in hearing evidence and, on that basis, deciding where the crime had been committed so that he could determine whether it had been committed within the (territorial) jurisdiction of the requesting state.  In reality this submission was tied to the appellants' principal submission that the only relevant jurisdiction of a requesting state is its territorial jurisdiction.  At this stage I simply observe that I am satisfied that Parliament did not envisage that the magistrate would need to hear evidence in regard to his jurisdiction.  A dispute as to whether the crime specified in the order to proceed is an extradition crime will generally be legal rather than factual.  The nature of the jurisdiction upon which the requesting state founds will appear, if not from the arrest warrant issued by the authorities in the requesting state, at least from the supporting affidavits and other documents.  On neither issue is the magistrate likely to need to look beyond these documents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;132. In the present proceedings the contention for the appellants is that the conspiracy alleged against them was not committed "within the jurisdiction" of the United States.  In other words, their contention is that they are not "fugitive criminals" in terms of paragraph 20 of schedule 1 to the 1989 Act.  If they are correct in that contention, then none of the provisions in schedule 1 applies to them and the magistrate's warrants for their committal will have to be quashed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;133. The appellants' contention depends in the first place on the construction of the phrase "within the jurisdiction" in the definition of "fugitive criminal" in paragraph 20.  Most routine extradition cases will involve offences committed in the territory of the requesting state.  In such cases the jurisdiction element in the definition of a fugitive criminal will be uncontentious.  Of course, as the appellants accept, in many states, especially nowadays, criminal jurisdiction is not limited to crimes committed within the territory of the state.  They contend, however, that those accused of committing crimes outside the territory of the requesting state are not "fugitive criminals" because the crime was not committed "within the (territorial) jurisdiction" of the requesting state.  Those accused of such crimes are therefore immune to extradition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;134. On that approach the appellants in these cases who, it appears, have never set foot in the United States, would not count as "fugitive criminals" and so would fall outside the entire extradition scheme in schedule 1 to the 1989 Act, unless something had been done in pursuit of the conspiracy within the United States.  Only in that way would their alleged crime of conspiracy to murder have been committed within the United States and so only in that way would the appellants fall within schedule 1 as "fugitive criminals".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;135. The contention for the appellants was accepted by the Administrative Court in the case involving Al-Fawwaz, <i>R (Al-Fawwaz) v Governor of Brixton Prison</i> [2001] 1 WLR 1234.  In the words of Buxton LJ, at p 1243F-G, para 32, to constitute an extradition crime, the offence:</p>
<p></p><ul>"has to be committed within the territory of the requesting state so that it would, as transposed, be committed within the territory of England and Wales.  It is not enough that the latter crime would, as in Part III cases as recognised in <i>Ex p Pinochet (No 3)</i> [2000] 1 AC 147, be indictable under the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the United Kingdom.  We also think that the concept of jurisdiction in article I of the treaty annexed to the United States of America (Extradition) Order 1976 is subject to the same limitation.  Whether this is a sensible rule in a world of major international crime and of the regular passage of persons involved in such crime between different jurisdictions is no doubt not for us to say."<p></p></ul>
<p>In the proceedings against Eidarous and Abdel Bary the Administrative Court found it unnecessary to reconsider the point.  The United States government have taken the opportunity of these appeals to challenge the decision of the Administrative Court on this point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;136. Plainly, Buxton LJ did not regard the rule which he stated as being sensible in today's world where easy communications mean that schemes may readily be laid and plots hatched in one country with the aim of committing major crime in another country.  Drug trafficking is only the most obvious example.  Counsel for the appellants specifically acknowledged that modern circumstances might demand a different system which permitted extradition for crimes committed outside the territorial jurisdiction of the requesting state.  The only trouble is, he said, that the system which we have in schedule 1 to the 1989 Act is an old model, dating back to 1870, and it is not designed to operate in that way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;137. "Jurisdiction" is a word with a history in English stretching back some eight centuries.  It can be used in a variety of contexts - not all of them legal - and with different shades of meaning.  In this case we are concerned with "jurisdiction" in the definition of "fugitive criminal" in paragraph 20 of schedule 1 to the 1989 Act where it refers to the jurisdiction of the requesting state, under its internal law, to regulate and punish conduct.  Most of the conduct which states choose to regulate and punish is conduct occurring within their territory, including their ships and aircraft.  But states may also choose to regulate and punish certain conduct which takes place outside their territory.  For instance, the courts of England have for centuries had jurisdiction to try cases of murder allegedly committed by English and, later, British subjects anywhere in the world (<i>R v Page</i> [1954]  1 Q.B. 170).  More generally, civil law countries have traditionally exercised a wide jurisdiction to regulate and to punish within their own territory the conduct of their citizens while they are living or travelling abroad.  In the past, at least, this extensive jurisdiction meant that such states were often reluctant to extradite their own nationals.  During the course of the last century, as a result of various conventions, there was a great increase in the range of offences for which international law specifically permits, or even obliges, states to assert extraterritorial jurisdiction.  The present case concerns an alleged conspiracy entered into abroad to murder American citizens in the United States and elsewhere.  The appellants accept that, as a matter of the internal law of the United States, the American courts have jurisdiction to try that charge.  Moreover, while the exact extent of the right of a state under international law to exercise jurisdiction over the acts of aliens committed abroad may be a matter for debate (<i>Oppenheim's International Law</i>, vol 1, 9th ed (1992) (ed Jennings and Watts), para 139), no issue of that kind arises in these proceedings.  The appellants' contention is simply that "jurisdiction" in the relevant definition in paragraph 20 is to be interpreted as referring only to the requesting state's territorial jurisdiction, with the result that our system of extradition applies only to criminals who have offended within the territorial, as opposed to any wider, jurisdiction of the requesting state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;138. Of course, even if "jurisdiction" in paragraph 20 includes all kinds of criminal jurisdiction, in practice most extradition requests will concern crimes committed within the territory of the requesting state and so falling within its territorial jurisdiction.  Not surprisingly, therefore, in some extradition treaties the states agreed to surrender people accused of crimes committed within the "territory" of the requesting state.  That was the language used, for example, in the first article of the extradition treaty with France of 14 August 1876, given effect by an order in council of 16 May 1878 under section 2 of the 1870 Act.  The same applied in the case of the treaty with Norway which was given effect by a similar order in council of 30 September 1873.  In each case, however, the treaty went on to provide for the surrender of those accused of various crimes committed on the high seas.  The scope of the term "territory" in the Norwegian treaty came before the Divisional Court for decision in <i>R v Governor of Brixton Prison, Ex p Minervini</i> [1959] 1 QB 155.  Because the treaty covered the crimes on the high seas, Lord Parker CJ held, at p 162G - H, that "territory" in the first article was not being used in its strict sense but as an equivalent to "jurisdiction".  Similarly, when considering the term "jurisdiction" in the definition of "fugitive criminal" in paragraph 20, the courts must interpret it in such a way that it is apt to cover all the types of crime for which Parliament intended that a fugitive criminal could be extradited under schedule 1 to the 1989 Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;139. Embedded within the definition of "fugitive criminal" in paragraph 20 is another concept, "extradition crime", which is defined in the same paragraph.  The first distinctive characteristic of a "fugitive criminal" is indeed that he is alleged to have committed an extradition crime.  So the term "jurisdiction" must be sufficiently broad to cover all the kinds of jurisdiction which would be necessary to allow the criminal to be prosecuted by the requesting state for any of the crimes included in the term "extradition crime".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;140. According to the definition in section 26 of the 1870 Act, an extradition crime is one which, "if committed in England <i>or within English jurisdiction</i>," would constitute one of the crimes listed in the first schedule to the 1870 Act (emphasis added).  Here again we encounter the term "jurisdiction".  And here again the context provides the guide to the proper interpretation.  It shows clearly that the word is not being used to refer to the territorial jurisdiction of the English courts.  If given that narrow interpretation, the words "within English jurisdiction" would add nothing to the immediately preceding words "in England".  It is not difficult, however, to see that they were inserted for a sound practical reason.  They were intended to bring within the scope of "extradition crime" conduct which, though it could not be committed in England, could none the less be committed within the jurisdiction of the English courts and would then amount to one of the crimes in the first schedule to the 1870 Act.  As originally enacted, the schedule contained 19 items.  The crimes in the first 15 items relate to conduct which could be committed in England.  The last 4 items, by contrast, concern conduct which, by its very nature, could not be committed in England - piracy by the law of nations, sinking or destroying a vessel at sea, assaults on board a ship on the high seas and revolt or conspiracy to revolt by two or more persons on board a ship on the high seas.  The extended definition in section 26 was obviously designed to ensure that the term "extradition crime" would include conduct of this kind which would constitute an offence triable by the English courts and so would be within English jurisdiction, but which would be committed outside England.  There would, of course, have been no point in including such crimes within the definition of "extradition crimes" if, for some other reason, a criminal who committed them could never be a "fugitive criminal" for purposes of extradition under the Act.  The definition of fugitive criminal in paragraph 20 must therefore be wide enough to cover those who commit any of these four crimes on the high seas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;141. The term "jurisdiction" in the definition of a "fugitive criminal" has to be read as including the vessels of the requesting state (paragraph 19).  So, in the case of three of the four crimes committed on the high seas, it may be argued that the requesting state's jurisdiction would be founded on the fact that the crime was committed on, or in respect of, one of its vessels.  On that basis the crime would be committed "within the jurisdiction" of the requesting state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;142. It is unnecessary to decide whether that is the proper approach to these items.  What matters for present purposes is that the first of this group of extradition crimes is "piracy by law of nations".  The nature of the jurisdiction in such cases was described by Viscount Sankey LC when giving the advice of the Privy Council on a special reference in <i>In re Piracy Jure Gentium</i> [1934] AC 586, 589:</p>
<p></p><ul>"With regard to crimes as defined by international law, that law has no means of trying or punishing them.  The recognition of them as constituting crimes, and the trial and punishment of the criminals, are left to the municipal law of each country.  But whereas according to international law the criminal jurisdiction of municipal law is ordinarily restricted to crimes committed on its terra firma or territorial waters or its own ships, and to crimes by its own nationals wherever committed, it is also recognized as extending to piracy committed on the high seas by any national on any ship, because a person guilty of such piracy has placed himself beyond the protection of any State.  He is no longer a national, but 'hostis humani generis' and as such he is justiciable by any State anywhere:  Grotius (1583 - 1645) 'De Jure Belli ac Pacis,' vol 2, cap 20, para 40."<p></p></ul>
<p>Since the jurisdiction over piracy by the law of nations is of this extensive nature, it follows that the term "jurisdiction" in the definition of "fugitive criminal" is not synonymous with "territorial jurisdiction".  On the contrary, it must be wide enough to cover even the extreme form of extraterritorial jurisdiction which is applied to this kind of piracy. In other words even piracy committed on the high seas must be a crime "committed within the jurisdiction" of the requesting state in terms of paragraph 20 of schedule 1 to the 1989 Act.  The same must have applied to the equivalent provision in the 1870 Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;143. For this reason, I am respectfully unable to agree with the obiter observation of Lord Mackay of Clashfern in <i>R v Secretary of State for Home Department, Ex p Rees</i> [1986] AC 937, 955 F - H, to the effect that, when passed, the 1870 Act dealt only with crimes committed within the territorial jurisdiction of the requesting state.  Lord Mackay cites some words of Lord Reid in <i>R v Governor of Brixton Prison, Ex p Schtraks</i> [1964] AC 556, 579C.  That case concerned a request for the extradition of a man who was accused of various offences committed in a part of Jerusalem over which Israel asserted a sovereignty that the United Kingdom did not recognise.  One relatively minor question in the appeal was whether in these circumstances the offences had been committed "within the territory" of Israel, as required by the terms of the extradition treaty between the United Kingdom and Israel.  Lord Reid dealt with the issue shortly and, in the course of doing so, he observed that neither the 1870 Act nor the order in council embodying the extradition treaty with Israel was concerned with sovereignty:  "they are concerned with territory in which territorial jurisdiction is exercised".  Lord Reid's comment should be read in the context of the issue that he was deciding.  He was rejecting the argument that the treaty would apply only where the requesting state exercised sovereignty over the place where the offence had been committed.  In his view it was sufficient that the place was one over which the requesting state in fact exercised territorial jurisdiction.  It would be wrong to transform this very particular comment into a general statement about the nature of jurisdiction under the 1870 Act.  In any event, the observation was obiter, since the decision of the House was based essentially on their Lordships' acceptance of the reasoning of Lord Parker CJ as to the interpretation of the term "territory" in the treaty when the case was before the Divisional Court ([1963] 1 QB 55 at pp 74 G - 75 E).  In these circumstances I find nothing in <i>Ex p Rees </i>or <i>Ex p Schtraks </i>to displace the clear implication, as to jurisdiction, of the inclusion of piracy by the law of nations among the crimes for which criminals could be surrendered under the 1870 Act.</p>
