<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75.&nbsp;&nbsp;It will have been noticed that paragraphs (a) and (b) and the "unless" proviso in subsection (1) are in effect identical to their counterparts in section 7(1) of the HRA.  So what was the purpose of subsection (1)?  And what was the purpose of subsection (3)?  Subsection (1) is plainly concerned with <i>locus standi</i>.  Under section 7(1) only an HRA 'victim' can bring proceedings on the ground that an act is incompatible with a Convention right or rely on that incompatibility as a defence in proceedings brought by others.  This <i>locus standi </i>control would apply to any contention of incompatibility in any legal proceedings.  Bearing in mind that Convention incompatibility is a ground on which any enactment of the Scottish Parliament, any subordinate legislation made by the Scottish Ministers or the Scottish Executives or any act of any member of the Scottish Executive may be held to be outside devolved competence and therefore <i>ultra vires</i>, the need to place a strict limit on those entitled to raise such a point in litigation seems to me easy to understand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76.&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of subsection (3) is much more difficult to identify.  The appellants' contention, as I understand it, is that a sensible purpose can be attributed to subsection (3) only if it is accepted that the SA, without saying so expressly, has conferred on every person who claims to be an HRA victim the right to bring a damages action for loss caused by an alleged breach of a Convention right.  On that footing, subsection (3) limits the damages that the court can award in such an action to the damages that could be awarded if section 8(3) and (4) of the HRA applied.  That is the suggested purpose of subsection (3).  If it is right that the SA has impliedly created the suggested new right of action, additional and alternative to an action brought in reliance on section 7(1) of the HRA, it would be an action to which the time limit control prescribed by section 7(5) of the HRA would not apply.  Section 7(5) only applies to proceedings brought under section 7(1)(a).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, I find the premise on which the suggested purpose of subsection (3) is based very difficult to accept.  It seems to me almost unthinkable that Parliament could have intended to create a new cause of action for damages for a limited class of <i>ultra vires</i> acts by the new Scottish authorities, namely, acts that were <i>ultra vires</i> because in breach of Convention rights, a cause of action independent of an action that could be brought under section 7(1) of the HRA, without saying so expressly.  There is no question but that the terms of the SA have made the limits of competence of the new Scottish authorities, Parliament, Ministers and Executive of central importance to the operation of the devolution system.  Any enactment of the Scottish Parliament, any subordinate legislation made by the Scottish Ministers or the Scottish Executive, any act of the Scottish Executive or a member of the Scottish Executive may be challenged on the ground that it was outside devolved competence or otherwise <i>ultra vires</i>.  A whole new chapter of administrative law challenge to actions of these public authorities has been opened up by the SA.  A chapter of public law still, however, largely unwritten relates to the ability of courts, in actions where public law challenges to administrative action have succeeded, to award compensation to those who have sustained loss as a consequence of the administrative action in question.  As long ago as 1974 Lord Wilberforce in <i>Hoffmann-La Roche(F) &amp; Co AG v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry</i> [1975]  AC 295 referred at 359 to English law's "unwillingness to accept that a subject should be indemnified for loss sustained by invalid administrative action …"  Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead in <i>Stovin v Wise</i> [1996]  AC 923 at 933 referred to the "growing unease over the inability of public law, in some instances, to afford a remedy matching the wrong" and to the inability of public law "to give an effective remedy if a road user is injured as a result of an authority's breach of its public law obligations" (p.940).  Section 31(4) of the Supreme Court Act 1981 enables the High Court, on an application for judicial review, to award damages to the applicant if satisfied that, had the claim been made in an action begun at the time the judicial review application was made, damages could have been awarded (see also CPR 54.3(2)).  These provisions do nothing to cure the deficiency of English law to which Lord Nicholls had referred.  There is no general right to recover damages for loss caused by <i>ultra vires</i> acts of public authorities. Some recognised tort claim is necessary. I believe the law of Scotland to be in the same state.  So section 100(3) of the SA could not have been included in the statutory scheme of the SA in order to control damages awards made in proceedings brought to establish that some legislative or executive act of one or other of the Scottish institutions created by the SA was outside devolved competence and thus <i>ultra vires</i>.  Parliament must, I think, be taken to have known that damages for loss caused by <i>ultra vires </i>acts could not be recovered otherwise than in a delictual, or in England tortious, action under the ordinary law.  As to that, it is not hard to construct a case in which the success of an action in delict for damages against, say, the Scottish Executive depends upon the success of the claimant in establishing that a statutory provision, or a rule or regulation, or an act in the exercise of some asserted statutory function, was invalid as being outside devolved competence and accordingly <i>ultra vires.  </i>If that invalidity were established, with the consequence that the claimant was entitled to delictual damages, it would not, in my opinion, be arguable that the damages would be subject to the provisions of section 100(3).  In such a case it would be the Scottish law relating to the recovery of damages for the delict in question that would enable and control the award of damages to be made.  The statutory injunction in section 100(3) that "<i>This Act </i>does not enable a court or tribunal to award any damages …" etc. would beat the air.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in my opinion, it comes to this.  Either section 100(3) is contemplating a claim to damages pursuant to section 7(1) of the HRA - in which case the subsection achieves nothing; such an action would in any event have been subject to section 8(3) and (4).  Or the appellants are right in contending that section 100(3) requires imputing to Parliament the intention, in enacting the subsection, to create a new cause of action for damages for breach of a Convention right where the breach has had the result that an act of one of the Scottish institutions was <i>ultra vires</i> and thus unlawful but where no delict has been committed.  My Lords, after much hesitation and an embarrassing number of changes of mind, I prefer the first of these alternatives.  I prefer the alternative that assumes Parliament, like Homer, to have nodded, to the alternative that assumes Parliament to have intended, without expressly saying so, the creation of an entirely new and independent cause of action in damages.  I think section 100(3) was simply intended to make clear that any action for damages brought in respect of an act alleged to be <i>ultra vires</i> because incompatible with a Convention right would be subject to section 8(3) and (4) of the HRA.  I do not find the answer that that would have been clear anyway - which I agree it would - sufficient to deflect that conclusion.  My reason is the unacceptability of the premise on which the alternative argument rests.  Section 100(3) does not, in my opinion, warrant the implication of the creation by the SA of an independent cause of action in damages.  It is perhaps pertinent to note that subsection (3) was not in the Bill when introduced in Parliament in January 1998.  The provision came in late, on 6 October 1998, by amendment.  The Bill received the Royal Assent on 19 November 1998.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79.&nbsp;&nbsp;The pleadings in this case make clear that the appellants' damages claims are not delictual claims.  If they had been, they would have been subject not to section 7(5) of the HRA but to the time limits prescribed for the delicts in question by the general law of Scotland.  If viable at all, they must, in my opinion, be claims brought pursuant to section 7(1)(a) of the HRA and, as such, subject to section 7(5).  On this issue therefore I am in respectful agreement with the conclusion reached by the Inner House and in agreement, also, with the reasons of my noble and learned friend Lord Mance, expressed in his opinion which I have had the advantage of reading in draft, for coming to the same conclusion.</p>
<i><p>Issue 2</p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is whether the act of a prison governor, placing a prisoner in segregation in exercise of powers under Rule 80(1) of the 1994 Rules, is to be regarded as an act of the Scottish Executive.  I, like Lord Hope and Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, see force in the proposition that a governor exercising powers under the 1994 Rules is discharging an independent function given to him as governor and, in doing so, is not subject to direction or control of the Scottish Ministers.  If the appellants' appeal on Issue 1 fails, as I think it should, Issue 2 becomes academic.  If not, my view is that for the reasons given by Lord Rodger the appellants should fail on Issue 2 as well. </p>
<i><p>Issue 3</p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81.&nbsp;&nbsp;This Issue asks whether, for the purposes of section 7(5) of the HRA, time begins to run from the first date when a breach of Convention rights occurred.  A feature of the breach of Convention rights alleged by the appellant Blanco, namely, his segregation under a series of orders made by the prison Governor and extended by the Scottish Ministers, is that the Governor  had power, under rule 80(7) of the 1994 Rules, to cancel the segregation at any time.  If the orders directing, or extending, segregation were unlawful, as being in contravention of Blanco's Convention rights, it would seem to follow that for so long as the segregation continued there was a day by day breach of Blanco's Convention rights brought about by the Governor's failure to exercise his power to cancel the segregation.  Time under section 7(5) begins to run from "the date on which the act complained of took place" (s.7(5)(a)).  But "act" includes "a failure to act" so it follows, in my opinion, that the "one year beginning with the date on which the act complained of took place" should simply be calculated back from the date on which the section 7(1)(a) proceedings were commenced.  It is likely that, in Blanco's case, and in many similar cases, the commencement of the one year thus calculated would fall somewhere within a period of allegedly unlawful segregation.  Where that happened there would, in my opinion, be a clear case for the court to exercise its power under section 7(5)(b) to extend the one year limitation period so as to permit the action to cover the whole of that segregation period.  I would answer Issue 3 accordingly.</p>
<i><p>Issue 4</p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in full agreement with what Lord Hope and Lord Rodger say about Issue 4.</p>
<i><p>Issue 5</p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83.&nbsp;&nbsp;This Issue asks whether the Inner House erred in accepting the Lord Ordinary's refusal to inspect the redacted documents.  My Lords, I have no doubt that the Lord Ordinary should have inspected the documents and that the Inner House should have said so. The starting point for a consideration of this issue is that all the documents in question were relevant to the issues raised in the litigation and <i>prima facie</i>, therefore, should have been disclosed. The documents had been identified as relevant by the Scottish Ministers, in whose possession or power they were. The redactions to the documents had not been made on the ground that the parts redacted were said to be irrelevant but because, in the view of the Minister of Justice in the Scottish Executive, the disclosure of those parts would be damaging to the public interest. Reasons supporting that view were given in affidavits and public interest immunity protecting the redacted parts of the documents from disclosure was claimed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84.&nbsp;&nbsp;The public interest immunity claim was challenged by the appellants and an ad hoc procedure was devised under which counsel for the appellants were allowed to read the redacted parts of the documents on terms that they would not disclose the contents to anyone, including their clients, without the consent of the judge. After they had done so, there was an <i>in camera</i> hearing before the judge at which submissions for and against fuller disclosure of the documents were made. The judge was asked, presumably by the appellants' counsel, herself to read the documents so that she could decide whether the P11 claims should be upheld. But she declined to do so. She said, in effect, that counsel had not identified any particular part of any particular document that she should read. Her conclusion was that the appellants had not made out a sufficient case for overriding the P11 that had been claimed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, we were given to understand that the number of documents that had been redacted was 70 odd. This was not a case where trunk loads of documents were involved. The purpose of full discovery of relevant documents in civil litigation, as of all other procedural rules and practices, is an administration of justice reason, namely, to provide as good a chance as is practicable of the litigation culminating in a just result. It is in the public interest that a just result should be reached. It is also in the public interest that documents the disclosure of which would be damaging to the public interest should be protected from disclosure. These are conflicting public interests and in every case in which conflict between them arises one must give way to the other. A balance must be struck depending on the circumstances of each case and it is the judge who must strike it. We have come some distance from the days when the balance used to be struck by the Crown. In order to strike the balance the judge must weigh up the value of the documents - or rather, in the present case, the value of the redacted parts - to the issues for which the applicant seeking disclosure will be contending in the litigation and the weight of those issues in determining the outcome of the case. These are the administrations of justice reasons for disclosure that must go into the balance.  And it must be a rare case in which a judge is able to weigh up these matters without reading the documents, or perhaps a reasonable selection of the documents. On the other side of the balance will go the public interest reasons that have been given for withholding the documents from disclosure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, like my noble and learned friend Lord Hope, I do not believe the Lord Ordinary could have properly struck the balance without first examining the documents so as to assess the weight of the need for disclosure. I would therefore allow the appeal on this issue and make the order suggested by Lord Hope.</p>
<i></i><p><i>Summary</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reasons I have given I would dismiss the appeal on Issue 1 but in relation to each of the other issues I would make the order proposed by Lord Hope. </p>
<p><b>LORD RODGER OF EARLSFERRY</b></p>
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appellants all are, or were, prisoners in Scotland who were at some stage removed, by order of the governor, from general association with other prisoners.  The orders were made under rule 80 of the Prisons and Young Offenders Institutions (Scotland) Rules 1994 ("the Prison Rules") as amended by rule 10 of The Prisons and Young Offenders Institutions (Scotland) Amendment Rules 2000 (No. 187) ("the Amendment Rules") which came into effect on 7 July 2000.  The appellants have brought judicial review proceedings challenging the validity of those orders.  Their long pleadings are both confused and confusing.  But, among many other things, the appellants aver that the decisions to order their segregation and to authorise their continued segregation were incompatible with their article 7 and 8 Convention rights and so (1) unlawful under section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998 ("the HRA") and (2) ultra vires by virtue of section 57(2) of the Scotland Act 1998 ("the Scotland Act").  Furthermore the appellants seek damages for the alleged consequences of those decisions by reference to (1) section 8 of the HRA and (2) section 100(3) of the Scotland Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89.&nbsp;&nbsp;By virtue of section 7(5)(a) of the HRA, proceedings against a public authority under the HRA must be brought before the end of the period of twelve months beginning with the date on which the act complained of took place.  It is common ground that two of the appellants, Mr Henderson and Mr Blanco, presented their judicial review petitions after the end of the period of twelve months beginning with the date of some, at least, of the decisions relating to their segregation which they challenge in their proceedings.  So, if the proceedings are indeed "proceedings against [a public] authority under" the HRA in terms of section 7(1)(a) of that Act, then they were not brought within twelve months from the time of the relevant decisions.  On that hypothesis, they were out of time under section 7(5) unless the court considered it equitable, in all the circumstances, that they should have been brought within the actual periods that elapsed in each case:  section 7(5)(b).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Henderson and Mr Blanco contend, however, that they are not constrained by the time-limit in section 7(5) of the HRA.  They have based their proceedings on the provisions of the Scotland Act as well as of the HRA.  So they contend that, leaving aside the HRA, the relevant decisions were ultra vires the Scottish Ministers under the Scotland Act because they were incompatible with their article 7 and 8 Convention rights.  The Scotland Act contains no equivalent of the time-limit in section 7(5) of the HRA.  So, they submit, they can bring proceedings challenging the decisions of the Scottish Ministers as ultra vires and seeking damages by reference to the Scotland Act, even though those proceedings were begun after the expiry of the twelve-month period in section 7(5)(a) of the HRA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91.&nbsp;&nbsp;In response, the Scottish Ministers say that the decisions of the governors are not decisions of the Scottish Ministers and cannot therefore be challenged by reference to the Scotland Act.  I return to that point later.  But, even if they are wrong about that, they say that damages in respect of a violation of Convention rights cannot be obtained under the Scotland Act, but only in proceedings under the Human Rights Act, to which the time-limit in section 7(5) applies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the petition and in the courts below, the appellants based their contention that the decisions of the Scottish Ministers were ultra vires on section 57(2) of the Scotland Act.  It provides, inter alia, that a member of the Scottish Executive has no power to do any act so far as it is incompatible with any of the Convention rights.  Shortly before the hearing in your Lordships' House, however, Mr Iain Jamieson published an article on "The Somerville case" 2007 SLT (News) 111.  Although Mr O'Neill QC did not mention the article in his oral submissions for the appellants, it was obvious that he had taken account of what Mr Jamieson says about the scope and purpose of section 57(2).  Following Mr Jamieson's lead, instead of sticking to section 57(2), he referred to the limitations on the Ministers' powers that are to be found in other provisions in the Act.  Neither Mr Moynihan QC for the Scottish Ministers nor the Advocate General suggested that this particular part of the argument in Mr Jamieson's article was wrong.  For my part, I would acknowledge the assistance that I have derived from it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Scottish Ministers readily accept that any decision of theirs under rule 80 of the Prison Rules relating to the segregation of the prisoners was ultra vires if it was incompatible with their article 7 or 8 Convention rights, it is perhaps as well to spell out why this is so.</p>
<i><p><i>The Vires Controls in the Scotland Act</i></p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Scotland Act confers wide, but nevertheless limited, powers on the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Executive.  Essentially, the limitations on the powers of both institutions are similar.  In particular, it is beyond the competence of either to do anything that is incompatible with Convention rights.  This limitation ensures that the Scottish Parliament and Ministers have no power to do anything that would put the United Kingdom in violation of its international obligations under the European Convention.  The limitation also affords protection to the Convention rights of all those who are affected by the acts of the institutions.  This is important since the changes brought about by the Scotland Act are actually intended to benefit people by improving the government of Scotland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Scotland Act recognises that the Scottish Ministers have various functions, both statutory and non-statutory.  They exercise their statutory functions on behalf of Her Majesty (section 52(2)).  The functions in question are those conferred by any enactment (section 52(7)), the term "enactment" being widely defined (section 126(1)).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before devolution the existing statutory functions of Ministers of the Crown in relation to Scotland were imposed, according to the usual formula, on "the Secretary of State".  On devolution, those functions, so far as within devolved competence, became exercisable by the Scottish Ministers:  section 53(1)(c).  In terms of section 54(3), the restriction "so far as they are exercisable within devolved competence" has the effect that the Ministers cannot exercise the function conferred by any pre-commencement statute (or exercise it in any way) so far as a provision of an Act of the Scottish Parliament conferring the function, or conferring it so as to be exercisable in that way, would be outside the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament.  This is a reference back to section 29(2) under which, inter alia, a provision is outside the legislative competence of the Parliament if it is incompatible with any of the Convention rights.  The reference back ensures that the limitation is the same for both the Parliament and the Scottish Ministers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97.&nbsp;&nbsp;The upshot is that, by virtue of sections 53(1) and 54(3), the Scottish Ministers have no power under pre-devolution legislation to exercise a power, or to exercise it in a way, that would be incompatible with a Convention right.  In so far as they purport to do so, they are acting ultra vires.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98.&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as post-devolution legislation is concerned, section 52(1) recognises that statutory functions may be conferred on Scottish Ministers by that name.  This could happen in three ways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, functions could be conferred on the Scottish Ministers by an Act of the Scottish Parliament.  But any provision in such an Act is not law in so far as it is incompatible with any of the Convention rights (section 29(1) and (2)(d)).  It follows that an Act of the Scottish Parliament cannot confer a function on the Scottish Ministers that would be incompatible with a Convention right or confer a function so as to be exercisable in a way that would be incompatible with a Convention right.  (This way of more fully describing the limit on legislative competence is suggested by section 54(3).)  Therefore, when the function in question derives from an Act of the Scottish Parliament, the function itself cannot be incompatible with Convention rights.  And, if the Scottish Ministers exercise the function in a way that is incompatible with any Convention right, they must be acting ultra vires.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second possible case is where a member of the Scottish Executive makes subordinate legislation after devolution, but under a power in a pre-commencement Act of Parliament.  Then section 57(2) comes into play and provides that he has no power to make such legislation so far as it is incompatible with any of the Convention rights.  So a member of the Scottish Executive cannot make subordinate legislation conferring a function on the Scottish Ministers that would be incompatible with a Convention right or conferring a function so as to be exercisable in a way that would be incompatible with a Convention right.  Again, if the Scottish Ministers purport to exercise the function in a way that is incompatible with Convention rights, they must be acting ultra vires.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101.&nbsp;&nbsp;The third possible situation is where a post-devolution Act of Parliament confers a function on the Scottish Ministers.  Since Parliament is supreme, it could confer a function on Scottish Ministers that would be incompatible with a Convention right.  Unless the later Act of Parliament overrides it, however, section 57(2) prevents any member of the Scottish Executive (apart from the Lord Advocate) from doing anything that is incompatible with a Convention right, even if that would otherwise be authorised or required by the later Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, whether the functions of the Scottish Ministers are conferred by pre-commencement or post-devolution legislation, the proper, intra vires, exercise of their functions cannot be incompatible with Convention rights.  If what they do is incompatible with Convention rights, it is ultra vires.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103.&nbsp;&nbsp;In applying this analysis to the present case, the first thing to note is that the Scottish Ministers' functions in relation to the segregation of prisoners derive from rule 80 of the Prison Rules which were originally made in 1994 under section 30 of the Prisons (Scotland) Act 1989 ("the 1989 Act").  After devolution, a member of the Scottish Executive made the Amendment Rules, also under section 30.  So the functions of the Scottish Ministers under rule 80 are, in part, functions conferred on the Secretary of State by a pre-commencement enactment, but now exercisable "within devolved competence" by the Scottish Ministers, in terms of section 53(1), (2)(c) and (3)(b).  It would be outside the devolved competence of the Ministers to exercise those functions, or to exercise them in any way, so far as it would be incompatible with any Convention right to do so:  section 54(3).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104.&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally, by virtue of section 57(2), the member of the Scottish Executive who made the Amendment Rules under section 30 of the Prisons (Scotland) Act 1989 had no power to make any subordinate legislation so far as it was incompatible with any Convention rights.  To the extent that he did so, the legislation would be ultra vires.  It follows that any amendment to rule 80 made by the Amendment Rules did not permit the Scottish Ministers to exercise their functions incompatibly with Convention rights.</p>
