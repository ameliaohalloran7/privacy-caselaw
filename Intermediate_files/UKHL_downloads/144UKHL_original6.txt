<p align="right"><a href="jamie-5.htm">(back to preceding text)</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixthly, effectively as a result of the first four factors I have mentioned, it has been rightly accepted throughout by the appellants that the servitude not only extends to the coming and going of motor vehicles along the way, but also includes the right to turn round such vehicles, and to station such vehicles for the purpose of loading and unloading (people and goods), and even for short term visits (e.g. reading the meters, carrying out work and the like). Because of the relatively narrow width of the way throughout, it would have been impractical to turn a vehicle without going onto the servient tenement beyond the way. Similarly, it might have been impractical (and indeed unlawful, not least in the light of the fifth factor I have mentioned, to stop a vehicle on the way even for a relatively short period. Accordingly it must have been envisaged that vehicles visiting Da Store would turn, and from time to time be stationed, off the route of the way, on the servient tenement. That renders it much easier to conclude that it must also have been intended that there be a right to park vehicles (i.e. to station them on a longer term basis) near the end of the way, i.e. on the servient tenement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;124.&nbsp;&nbsp;In these circumstances, it appears to me that the unusual facts of the case justified the ultimate conclusion reached by the Sheriff, namely that a right to park vehicles on the servient tenement was included by implication in the Disposition. It is right to emphasise that, essentially in agreement with my noble and learned friend, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry (whose draft opinion I have had the privilege of seeing), I do not consider that any of the above six factors, on their own, would have been enough to justify the Sheriff's conclusion. To hold otherwise would fall foul of the need for necessity or obviousness to which I have referred. It is the combination of all the six factors which persuades me that the Sheriff was at least entitled to reach the conclusion that he did. Having said that, I prefer to base this decision on what may be a slightly different juridical basis from either of the two bases on which the Sheriff rested his conclusion. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have real doubts as to whether the Sheriff was correct to hold that the expressly granted servitude in this case could not reasonably be enjoyed without there being a right to park. It seems to me that there is force in the argument that the servitude could be fully enjoyed without there being such a right: its enjoyment would merely be of more limited value to the owner and occupier of Da Store. In paras 12.124 ff, Cusine and Paisley give examples of the application of the principle in <i>Jones v Pritchard, </i>and they are primarily concerned with ancillary rights required to enable a servitude, which has been granted, to be enjoyed (e.g. a right to repair a way over which a right exists, or a right to lay pipes to use a watercourse which has been granted). It appears to me that it would involve a questionable extension of the principle if it were applied to this case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;126.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also dubious about the alternative argument that the nature of the dominant tenement itself, at least if one ignores the right of way, must carry with it the right to park vehicles on the servient tenement. Thus, if the Disposition had not included a right of way, then (ignoring the possibility of a right of way being implied as a servitude of necessity) there would have been no right to park implied. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;127.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if one takes the combination of the land and the right of way granted by the Disposition, it appears to me that, when taken together, the six factors which I have identified justify the conclusion that the right to park was included by implication (subject to the two remaining arguments of the appellants). In other words, this is something of a hybrid case, as some of the facts which justify the implication of a right to park relate to the servitude and others relate to the nature of the dominant tenement. The combination of these factors justify the conclusion that the expressly granted right of way carried with it an implied right to park on the servient tenement, and it is on that basis that I would uphold the decision of the Sheriff, subject to the two outstanding points raised by the appellants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;128.&nbsp;&nbsp;If one is entitled to take into account events subsequent to 1973 (and it is unnecessary to express a view as to whether that is permissible), it seems to me that the facts set out in paragraphs 13 to 18 of Lord Hope's speech would serve to reinforce the conclusion reached by the Sheriff. </p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second argument: no limit on the number of parked vehicles</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;129.&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of the appellants, it was argued that the notion that the parties, and in particular the grantor, under the Disposition, would have intended it to carry with it the right to park must be called severely into question by the apparently unlimited extent of such a right. The terms of the servitude are unlimited, so that, subject to being so intense as to involve some sort of abuse of the servitude, any number of vehicles would, on the face of it, be entitled to use the way as a means of access to the dominant tenement, from which it would follow that any number of motor vehicles would be entitled to be parked near the gate at top of the stairway, if there is indeed a right to park. The right of way could, it is true, only be enjoyed by the owners of the dominant tenement together with their guests, visitors, employees and agents, but, unless somehow impliedly restrained, this could on occasion amount to a substantial number of people, and therefore a very substantial quantity of vehicles being parked on the servient tenement at any one time. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;130.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, this argument is wrong because it proceeds on the basis that the right to park is simply ancillary to the right of way granted by the Disposition: hence the extent of the vehicular right to park is said to be co-extensive with the vehicular use of the way, which is unlimited, subject only to its becoming an abuse. However, as I have sought to explain, it seems to me that the right to park was implied into the grant of the dominant tenement coupled with the right of way, and that the implication arises as a matter of necessity as a result of the six factors I have mentioned. The normal principle is that an implied right is limited to a case of necessity (or obviousness), and this principle is itself based on the presumed intention of the parties. On the same principle, it seems to me that the nature and extent of any such implied right is limited to what is necessary (or obvious), taking into account the presumed intention of the parties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;131.&nbsp;&nbsp;On that basis, in the present case, it appears to me, at least on the evidence available, that the parties would have envisaged that the dominant owner would only be able to park two, or at the most, three, motor cars on the servient tenement. More than that would not, as I see it, have been obvious or necessary, for the projected use of Da Store at the time of the Disposition, bearing in mind the natures of the dominant tenement, of the servient tenement, and of the way. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;132.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there is the character and use of the dominant tenement. At the time of the Disposition, it was unoccupied, and therefore no significant use of the way for the benefit of the dominant tenement would have been in the process of being enjoyed. Its anticipated use, in a relatively isolated location by the sea, particularly in the light of its immediately preceding (residential) use, would have been primarily (and probably exclusively) for residential purposes which would not have involved, let alone required, very intensive or frequent parking of motor cars. Secondly, there is the contemporaneous use of the servient tenement in the vicinity of the <i>terminus ad quem</i>, namely near the gate at the top of the stairway, which was for residential and agricultural purposes. This indicates that only a relatively limited use and parking of vehicles would have been expected, bearing in mind what would otherwise be a potential interference with the peaceful location of the residence and with the agricultural use, if many vehicles used the way or were parked. Thirdly, there is the nature of the way itself, namely the very steep incline of the land on which it was constructed, which would have led to the expectation of limited user.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;133.&nbsp;&nbsp;In all these circumstances, it seems to me, at least as at present advised, to be pretty unlikely that the parties would have envisaged more than two, or conceivably three, vehicles connected with the dominant tenement being parked on the servient tenement at any one time, save, conceivably, in unusual circumstances. It does not appear that this was an issue which was addressed in argument or canvassed in the evidence before the Sheriff in any significant detail. It may well be that, if it had been fully addressed and canvassed, there would have been more in the way of evidence and findings. Accordingly, it is difficult to express a concluded view on the topic. Fortunately, it is unnecessary for present purposes to reach such a view on this aspect. As already mentioned, the parties, or at least their respective predecessors, have effectively agreed that the dominant owners should be permitted to park two vehicles in a designated space, with the implication that, at the very least for the time being, that is indeed acceptable to the dominant owners and is acceptable to the servient owners. </p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third argument: the right to park cannot be a servitude </p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;134.&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of the appellants, it was contended that the right to park a motor vehicle cannot, as a matter of law, be a servitude. If that is right, then there is a powerful case for saying that it would defeat the respondents, at any rate on the second basis, and arguably also on the first basis, on which they rest their case - and, I think, on the basis upon which I would find for them. The fundamental point relied on to justify the contention that a right to park cannot, as a matter of law, be a servitude is that it would involve 'the partial, or total, exclusion of [the servient] proprietor': see para 3.50 of Cusine and Paisley. In my judgement, if a right to park a vehicle cannot, for this reason, be a servitude, then there is considerable force in the contention that, for the same reason, it cannot be claimed as a property (as opposed to a personal) right, whether implied or ancillary to a servitude. In other words, if the principle identified in para 3.50 of Cusine and Paisley does indeed prevent a right being a servitude, binding on successors of the grantor, then there is force in the contention that it also would prevent a right from being ancillary to a servitude, binding on such successors. I am prepared to assume in the appellants' favour, without deciding, that that contention is correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;135.&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision of Upjohn J in <i>Copeland v Greenhalf</i> [1952] 1 Ch. 488 has been relied on in England to support the contention that the right to park cannot be an easement. In that case, Upjohn J held that the right claimed in that case could not be an easement because "[p]ractically, the defendant is claiming the whole beneficial user" of the land in question - see at 498. This is consistent with what Lopes LJ said in <i>Reilly v Booth </i>(1890) 44 Ch D 12 at 26, namely that an easement could not give "exclusive and unrestricted use of a piece of land". Similarly in <i>Grigsby v Melville </i>[1972] 1 WLR 1355, Brightman J intimated that he considered, without having to decide, that an effectively exclusive right to use a cellar for storage could not have been an easement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;136.&nbsp;&nbsp;At least on the basis of the authorities to which we have been referred, the case law of England (which is more fully discussed in paragraphs 54 to 58 of Lord Scott's opinion) and of Scotland seem to me, at least so far, to have marched together on this issue. Not only is <i>Copeland v Greenhalf</i> one of the cases cited in this connection by Cusine and Paisley at para 3.50, but in that case Upjohn J relied on a Scottish case, <i>Dyce v Hay </i>(1852) 1 Macq 305, to support his conclusion. (However, given the differences between the principles governing land law in the two jurisdictions, and in particular the existence in Scots law of feudal conditions and real burdens, referred to by Lord Hope and unknown in English law, it would not be safe, in my view, to assume that the law on this issue in the two jurisdictions will necessarily be the same in every respect).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;137.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my judgment, the grant of a right to park a single vehicle anywhere on a servient tenement which is large enough to hold, say, twenty vehicles, must be capable of being a servitude or an easement. In such a case, there is no specific place where the vehicle is to be parked, so that there is no specific area from which the servient owner can be said to be excluded. In this connection I agree with the view expressed in Gale at paras 9-73 and 9-74, supported as it is by the unreported decision of Sir Robert Megarry V-C in <i>Newman v Jones </i>(1982), that provided, of course, there is a dominant tenement to which the right is appurtenant, there is 'no reason in principle why a right to park a car somewhere in the defined area should not be capable of being an easement'. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;138.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was on this basis that His Honour Judge Paul Baker QC held that the right to park granted in <i>London &amp; Blenheim Estates Ltd v Ladbroke Retail Parks Ltd</i> [1992] 1 WLR 1278 was a valid easement. At 1286, he said that '[t]he matter must be one of degree. A small coal shed in a large property is one thing. The exclusive use of a large part of the alleged servient tenement is another'.  A somewhat similar test was applied in <i>Batchelor v Marlow </i>[2003] 1 WLR 764, where the Court of Appeal held that a right to park vehicles for nine and a half hours a day was not an easement because it left "the servient owner without any reasonable use of his land whether for parking or anything else", and that it thereby rendered "his ownership of the land illusory".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;139.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, it seems to me that, on the respondents' case, a right to park could only be prevented from being a servitude or an easement if it resulted in the servient owner either being effectively excluded from the whole of the land in question or being left without any reasonable use of that land. If the right to park a vehicle in an area that can hold twenty vehicles is capable of being a servitude or an easement, then it would logically follow that the same conclusion should apply to an area that can hold two vehicles. On that basis, it can be said to be somewhat contrary to common sense that the arrangement is debarred from being a servitude or an easement simply because the parties have chosen to identify a precise space in the area, over which the right is to be exercised, and the space is just big enough to hold the vehicle. Also, presumably on the respondents' case, such a right would indeed be capable of being a servitude or an easement if the servient owner had the right to change the location of the precise space within the area from time to time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;140.&nbsp;&nbsp;At least as at present advised, I am not satisfied that a right is prevented from being a servitude or an easement simply because the right granted would involve the servient owner being effectively excluded from the property. In this connection, the Privy Council in <i>Attorney-General of Southern Nigeria v John Holt &amp; Company (Liverpool) Limited </i>[1915] AC 599 at 617 appears to have held that a right to store materials on land could be an easement although it involved the dominant owner enjoying an "exclusive" right to enjoy the property concerned. Citing <i>Dyce v Hay </i>in support, the Privy Council immediately went on to observe that, in considering arguments as to whether a right could be an easement "[t]he law must adapt itself to the conditions of modern society and trade". Further, the Court of Appeal in <i>Wright v Macadam</i> [1949] 2 KB 744 held that an apparently exclusive right to store coal in a small shed was capable of being an easement. Neither case was cited to Upjohn J in <i>Copeland v Greenhalf.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;141.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also Australian cases which support the notion that a right could be an easement even if the servient owner was thereby excluded from the land concerned - see for instance <i>Mercantile General Life Reinsurance Co v Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd </i>(1988) 4 BPR 9534, and per Handley JA (who described parking as "a form of storage") in <i>Wilcox v Richardson</i> (1997) 8 BPR 97652.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;142.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, as Lord Rodger pointed out during argument in this case, a right of aqueduct (or water rights) or a right of drainage is often granted over a specific route, so that that route may often be the full extent of the servient tenement. In such a case, the servient owner is effectively excluded from the whole of his tenement, yet such a right has always been assumed to be capable of constituting a valid servitude or easement - see the discussions at paragraphs 3.80 (aqueduct) and 3.82 (drainage) of Cusine and Paisley, and paragraphs 6-49 to 6-57 (drainage) and 6.71 to 6.72 (water rights) of Gale.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;143.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, I see considerable force in the views expressed by Lord Scott in paras 57 and 59 of his opinion, to the effect that a right can be an easement notwithstanding that the dominant owner effectively enjoys exclusive occupation, on the basis that the essential requirement is that the servient owner retains possession and control. If that were the right test, then it seems likely that <i>Batchelor v Marlow </i>was wrongly decided. However, unless it is necessary to decide the point to dispose of this appeal, I consider that it would be dangerous to try and identify degree of ouster is required to disqualify a right from constituting a servitude or easement, given the very limited argument your Lordships have received on the topic. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;144.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have mentioned, there are a number of cases which can be said to support the approach of the Court of Appeal in <i>Batchelor v Marlow</i>, although it may be possible to distinguish them. The point does not appear to be settled in Australia - see the difference of opinion in the recent case of <i>White v Betalli </i>[2007] NSWCA 243. I am also concerned that, if we were unconditionally to suggest that exclusion of the servient owner from occupation, as opposed to possession, would not of itself be enough to prevent a right from being an easement, it might lead to unexpected consequences or difficulties which have not been explored in argument in this case. Thus, if the right to park a vehicle in a one-vehicle space can be an easement, it may be hard to justify an effectively exclusive right to store any material not being an easement, which could be said to lead to the logical conclusion that an occupational licence should constitute an interest in land.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;145.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, it seems to me that no problem arises in this connection. The position on the ground as at the time of the Disposition, which can be judged by photographs which were in evidence before the Sheriff, indicates that there was open land all around the gate at the top of the stairway leading down to Da Store. Although this land seems to have been used for agricultural purposes, it does not appear that there would have been any difficulty, or any significant harm to the interests of the servient owner, in the dominant owner parking two or three vehicles in a number of different locations near the top of the steps. In my judgment, therefore, even if (which is open to doubt, but need not be decided on this appeal) a right to park a motor vehicle in a specific space is incapable of being a servitude, that would not present a problem for the appellants in the present case as at 1973, the date of the Disposition: any right to park two or three vehicles near the end of the way would have been over an area significantly larger than that represented by the aggregate area of the spaces needed for those vehicles. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;146.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1973, as Lord Hope has explained, the respective predecessors in title of the present parties effectively agreed that such a right to park as did exist would be limited to two vehicles at any time, and that it would be exercised in a space which effectively could only take two vehicles. The appellants, realistically to my mind, did not suggest that this agreement resulted in the loss of any servitude because it effectively barred any sensible use by the servient owner of the space. In my judgment, at worst from the point of view of the respondents, the agreement operated as an arrangement between the servient and dominant owners as to how the easement of parking would be enjoyed. If (which I would again leave open) the agreement was not binding on successors on title, then, once the servient or dominant tenement changed hands, the parties, unless they novated the agreement, would be thrown back on their respective rights and obligations prior to the agreement; in other words the right to park implied under the Disposition, free of any subsequent agreement, would revive. </p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;147.&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the permanent interdict, there is nothing I can usefully add to the observations of Lord Hope in paragraphs 41 to 43. </p>
