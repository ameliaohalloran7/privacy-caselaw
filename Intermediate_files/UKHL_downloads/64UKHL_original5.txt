<p align="right"><a href="earl-4.htm">(back to preceding text)</a></p>

<p class="para">112.&nbsp;&nbsp;     Where does the conclusion that hope value as against non-participating tenants in respect of their flats may be taken into account leave hope value in relation to participating tenants and their flats? If, as I have concluded, the bracketed words in the opening part of para 3(1) do not exclude the possibility of taking into account hope value arising from non-participating tenants seeking new leases of their flats, the same conclusion must apply to participating tenants. However, the effect of para 4 means that, for the reasons I have given when considering hope value under section 9(1A), it is not possible to include hope value in relation to participating tenants’ flats under para 3, as it has already been subsumed into the marriage value exercise mandated by para 4. That is clear not only as a matter of commercial sense and justice, but also because para 2 envisages the purchase price consisting of the aggregate of the sums in sub-paras (a) and (b), and it cannot have been envisaged that the same sum be included under both sub-paragraphs.</p>
<p class="para">113.&nbsp;&nbsp;     My conclusion that the hope value attributable to non-participating tenants’ flats may be taken into account under para 3 is consistent with a clear statement made in this House by Lord Strathclyde, the Minister promoting the bill which became the 1993 Act. On 18 May 1993, in relation to what became Schedule 6 in its original form, he said: </p>
<p class="para">“When valuing the landlord’s present interests, any hope value element in the open market value of non-participating tenants’ flats is included, as it is only nominee and participating tenants who are assumed not to be in the market…[N]on-participating tenants are outside the marriage-value, but they do come into hope value” (<i>Hansard </i>,18/5/93, col 1679).</p>
<p class="para">114.&nbsp;&nbsp;     The force of any argument based on this observation is, however, reduced by the fact that no such statement was made in relation to the bill which became the 1996 Act, which, crucially for present purposes, amended para 3(1) and added para 3(1A). However, there had been no change of government between the passing of the two statutes, and there is no suggestion that the amendments effected to Schedule 6 by the 1996 Act were intended to reverse the effect described so clearly by Lord Strathclyde. In the light of the amendments made in 1996, however, I have not thought it right to rely, as part of my reasoning, on what was said by Lord Strathclyde in 1993, but I do draw some comfort from it.</p>
<p class="para">115.&nbsp;&nbsp;     Accordingly, for these reasons, as well as those articulated by Lord Walker, I consider that hope value can be taken into account under para 3 of Schedule 6, in so far as it is attributable to the possibility of non-participating tenants wishing to obtain new leases of their flats in the open market (and not pursuant to Schedule 13).</p>
<i><p class="para">Disposal of these five appeals</p></i>
<p class="para">116.&nbsp;&nbsp;     In <i>Earl Cadogan and Cadogan Estates Ltd v Sportelli and Sportelli</i>, Mr and Mrs Sportelli sought a new lease of Flat 14, 85 Cadogan Gardens London SW3, pursuant to chapter II of the 1993 Act. The parties could not agree the price payable and that issue was referred to the LVT. One of the issues was whether the price should be assessed taking into account hope value. The LVT held that it should not, in the light of the bracketed words in the opening part of para 3(1) of Schedule 6 - LON/NL/2788/04, paras 142 to 148.</p>
<p class="para">117.&nbsp;&nbsp;     In<i> Earl Cadogan and Cadogan Estates Ltd v Grandeden Property Management Ltd</i>, tenants of some of the flats in a building, 59 Cadogan Square and 105 Cadogan Gardens London SW1 sought to acquire the freehold of the building pursuant to chapter I of the 1993 Act. Before the LVT there were a number of valuation issues, including the landlord’s claim for an allowance in respect of hope value. The LVT decided that “no quantified sums should be added for ‘hope value’ and that this aspect should be regarded as taken into account as an element in the yield” - LON/ENF/1370/05, para 20.</p>
<p class="para">118.&nbsp;&nbsp;     In <i>Earl Cadogan and Cadogan Estates Ltd v 27/29 Sloane Gardens Ltd and Mahdi</i>, tenants of some of the flats in a building, 27/29 Sloane Street London SW1, sought to acquire the freehold of the building pursuant to chapter 1 of the 1993 Act. By agreement between the parties, an agreed sum for hope value in respect of the two flats held by non-participating tenants was included in the sum assessed by the LVT, which had to resolve other valuation issues between the parties - LON/ENF/1102/04.</p>
<p class="para">119.&nbsp;&nbsp;     The LVT decisions in <i>Sportelli </i>and <i>Grandeden</i> were appealed to the Lands Tribunal, which also gave permission to the tenants in <i>27/29 Sloane </i>Gardens to withdraw the concession that the landlord was entitled to claim any hope value, and to mount an appeal on that issue.  The Lands Tribunal heard the three appeals together (with other appeals). In its illuminating decision, at [2007] 1 EGLR 153, paras 98 to 108, the Lands Tribunal concluded that, as a matter of law, no hope value could be included in valuations under para 3 of Schedule 13 or under para 3 of schedule 6, essentially because of the express exclusion of the tenant or the flat tenants, respectively, from the market. </p>
<p class="para">120.&nbsp;&nbsp;     The Court of Appeal agreed with the Tribunal’s conclusions in relation to schedule 6 and schedule 13, for reasons given in the closely reasoned judgment of Carnwath LJ (with which Ward LJ and Sir Peter Gibson agreed) - [2008] 1 WLR 2142, paras 43 to 59. While accepting, in para 54, that the issue was less clear in relation to schedule 6, where the absence of any right to hope value would give rise to “some problems", he concluded that under neither Schedule was the landlord entitled to hope value. </p>
<p class="para">121.&nbsp;&nbsp;     In <i>Earl Cadogan v Pitts and Wang</i>, the tenants were seeking to acquire the freehold of a house, 35 Hans Place, London SW1, and the valuation was effected pursuant to section 9(1C) of the 1967 Act, which incorporates the relevant provisions of section 9(1A). The LVT’s economically expressed determination (LON/LVT/1815/05) did not make it entirely clear whether hope value had been allowed for in its assessment of the investment value of the landlord’s interest, although the deferment rate it adopted suggested that it was. </p>
<p class="para">122.&nbsp;&nbsp;     In <i>Earl Cadogan v Atlantic Telecasters Ltd</i>, the tenant was also seeking to acquire the freehold of a house, namely 10 Holbein Mews London SW1 pursuant to section 9(1C) of the 1967 Act. In a fully reasoned decision, the LVT decided that, hope value was already “subsumed into the full marriage value reflected in the value of the interest at the valuation date” and that no additional amount was payable by way of hope value - LON/LVT/1957/05, paras 101 to 104. </p>
<p class="para">123.&nbsp;&nbsp;     These two LVT decisions under section 9(1A) were appealed to the Lands Tribunal, which heard the appeals together. As I have mentioned, in a clearly expressed decision, [2007] 3 EGLR 86, the Tribunal concluded that hope value should not be taken into account under section 9(1A) as a matter of principle - LRA/79/2006. </p>
<p class="para">124.&nbsp;&nbsp;     This decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal - see [2007] EWCA Civ 1280 - by Carnwath LJ, sitting on his own. In a very short judgment, he simply applied his conclusion on the point in <i>Sportelli </i>[2008] 1 WLR 2142, paras 58 and 59, where, although there was no appeal in relation to hope value under section 9(1A), he had said that hope value was excluded in the section 9(1A) valuation. (This course, adopted under section 54(2) of the Supreme Court Act 1981 with the agreement of the Master of the Rolls, seems to me to have been very sensible.)</p>
<p class="para">125.&nbsp;&nbsp;     In the light of the conclusions expressed earlier in this opinion, I consider that the appeal in <i>Sportelli </i>must be dismissed, as the landlord has no right to claim hope value under para 3 of Schedule 13, and that the appeals in <i>Pitts and Wang </i>and <i>Atlantic Telecasters</i> must similarly be dismissed as the landlord has no right to claim hope value under section 9(1A). However, the appeals in <i>Grandeden</i> and in <i>27/29 Sloane Gardens </i>must be allowed, as the landlord is entitled to claim hope value under para 3 of Schedule 6 in relation to non-participating tenants’ flats, albeit not in relation to participating tenants’ flats. </p>
<p class="para">126.&nbsp;&nbsp;     Two further points should be made. First, in relation to the two appeals under section 9(1A), it is right to acknowledge that it is possible that there could, at least in theory, be an inconsistency as a consequence. When it comes to assessing the marriage value, the value attributable to the relevant tenants’ interests might have included hope value, which may be inappropriate if the investment value of the landlord’s interest must ignore hope value, as I have concluded. However, the point is one of valuation, not law, and anyway the landlords raised no argument to that effect before your Lordships’ House. Indeed, so far as I can detect, there was no evidence that the valuation of the tenants’ interests included hope value.</p>
<p class="para">127.&nbsp;&nbsp;     The second point is that the landlords argued that, if their appeals, and in particular if the appeals in <i>Grandeden</i> and <i>27/29 Sloane Gardens </i>would otherwise have failed, their rights under article 1 of the First Protocol to the Convention would be infringed. Because I consider that hope value is subsumed into marriage value, and because the appeals in <i>Grandeden</i> and in <i>27/29 Sloane Gardens </i>have succeeded, no point can arise in that connection. However, it is right to add that I agree with the observation of Lord Walker in this connection.</p>
