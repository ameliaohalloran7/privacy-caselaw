<p align="right"><a href="smith-3.htm">(back to preceding text)</a></p>

<p class="para">75.&nbsp;&nbsp;The centrally relevant provisions of the Regulations and the more detailed facts and procedural history of this case are set out in the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Hope of Craighead, which I have had the benefit of reading in draft. </p>
<p class="para">76.&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem in the present case arises from the fact that the ramp was neither on premises owned, managed, or occupied by the Council nor was its condition (save if the 1998 Regulations otherwise require) the responsibility of the Council. It cannot be doubted that, if the injury in question had been suffered by Mrs Smith when pushing Mrs Cotter in her wheelchair on a ramp outside the front door of the day centre, then the ramp would have been “work equipment” “provided for use or used . . . at work". Similarly, if, when accompanying Mrs Cotter, Mrs Smith had suffered the injury as a result of a faulty lift in the day centre. On the other hand, it seems to me that Mrs Smith could not have relied on the Regulations if she suffered injury as a result of a faulty lift or escalator at a railway station, even if she was accompanying Mrs Cotter, and hence was “at work” at the time. However, the fact that equipment is not on premises owned, managed, or occupied by the employer is plainly not determinative of the issue: if Mrs Cotter’s wheelchair had been provided by the Council and, as a result of a defect, it injured Mrs Smith, she would have had a claim for breach of the Regulations.</p>
<p class="para">77.&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem thrown up by the present case is therefore to identify the extent to which the Regulations apply to equipment which is not within what my noble and learned friend Lord Mance calls “the direct sphere of [the employer’s] undertaking or control” in paragraph 64 of his opinion, which I have had the benefit of reading in draft. In this connection, prescriptive reformulations of the legislative test can be dangerous. This is partly because recasting the legislative test can lead to error, as it runs the inherent risk of unintentionally inventing a different test from that set out in the legislation. In addition, any reformulation can lead to problems not thrown up by the statutory wording, in which case it makes matters worse rather than better. </p>
<p class="para">78.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, there are undoubtedly legislative provisions which, either because they are so obscure or because they must be given some sort of limitation which is not expressed, may well benefit from judicial exegesis, in order to decide whether, and if so how, they apply in the particular case, and also to assist in their application in future occasions. The expression “provided for use or used . . . at work” in regulation 3(2) is such a provision. Nonetheless, particularly in relation to legislation such as the 1998 Regulations, which can apply in such multifarious circumstances, any judicial observations can normally be no more than helpful guidance, which at best can be of value in the great majority of cases. </p>
<p class="para">79.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not unknown, however, for judges to despair of being able to provide any such guidance, even where it would be of considerable value if they could. For instance, in <i>Armstrong, Whitworth &amp; Co Ltd v Redford </i>[1920] AC 757, 780, Lord Wrenbury said, in relation to somewhat similar legislation, the Workmen’s Compensation Act 1906, “I have long since abandoned the hope of deciding any case upon the words ‘out of and in the course of’ upon grounds satisfactory to myself or convincing to others".</p>
<p class="para">80.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, however, your Lordships consider, rightly in my respectful view, that judicial assistance can be given when it comes to considering the ambit of the words used in regulation 3(2). As to that, however, there are two differently expressed opinions. Lord Hope’s view is that the 1998 Regulations apply if the employee’s use of the equipment for the purpose of her work is known to (or <i>a fortiori</i> is authorised by) the employer, the employer can inspect and assess the equipment, and the employer could reasonably instruct the employee not to use it. Lord Mance considers that the Regulations apply to equipment which is incorporated into and adopted as part of the employer’s undertaking, and which is provided to the employee either by the employer or by someone else with the employer’s consent. </p>
<p class="para">81.&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer to these two formulations as “differently expressed", because I suspect that they will normally yield the same answer. Further, while I would expect that, whichever formulation is adopted will help clarify the law in this field significantly, neither is without its difficulties. In this case, for instance, each formulation could be invoked to support the opposite result which it is said to justify. On Lord Hope’s test, it might be said that the Council could not reasonably be expected to assess the ramp any more than a lift escalator or train at a railway station: in each case they could only effect a cursory inspection; it might also be said that there could not reasonably have been an alternative route for Mrs Smith to use when pushing Mrs Cotter from her home in her wheelchair. On Lord Mance’s test, the Council knew and effectively approved of Mrs Smith’s use of the ramp as the means of taking Mrs Cotter to and from her house, and, to that extent, it might be said that the ramp was incorporated into the Council’s undertaking, at least when it was being so used by Mrs Smith. </p>
<p class="para">82.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, of course, very easy to make such points, and they serve only to underline the substantial difficulties facing those who have to draft, and those who have to interpret, legislation such as the 1998 Regulations, when it comes to delineating their precise limits and scope. The Regulations are intended to impose absolute liability on an employer in a very wide, but not infinitely wide, range of factual circumstances, many of which it is impossible to envisage in abstract, and which are any way so multifarious that it is impossible to spell out even all those that can be foreseen. Having said all that, there is undoubtedly a difference between the two approaches, as the difference in outcome in this case suggests. In many ways, the difference seems to me to come down to the nature of the control which the employer has to have. </p>
<p class="para">83.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Hope’s approach appears to me to concentrate on the control which the employer has over the employee’s use of the equipment, although the degree to which he can inspect the equipment is also relevant. Lord Mance seems to me to focus more on the control which the employer has over the equipment itself, although his knowledge and approval of the employee’s use is relevant. When referring to control in what follows, I shall use it in the sense of control over the equipment.</p>
<p class="para">84.&nbsp;&nbsp;With considerable hesitation, and rather contrary to my initial impression, I have come to the conclusion that I agree with Lord Mance. So far as the definitions in regulation 2(1) and the actual words of regulation 3(2) are concerned, they do not appear to me to advance either view as against the other, save that the very fact that no express limitations are included could be said to support Lord Hope’s wider interpretation. However, on any view, some degree of limitation is to be implied, so one has to look elsewhere for guidance as to what it should be. When one does so, there are a number of factors which seem to me to have some force.</p>
<p class="para">85.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, subject at any rate to regulation 3(3)(b), some of the other provisions of the 1998 Regulations are more consistent with Lord Mance’s view. Thus, regulation 5(1) requires an employer to “ensure” that work equipment is appropriately “maintained", and regulation 5(2) obliges an employer to “ensure” that the “maintenance log” of any machinery “is kept up to date". Regulation 6(1)(a) requires an employer to ensure that, “where the safety of work equipment depends on … installation", “it is inspected … before being put into service …". It would be unrealistic, at least in my view, to contend that an employer would be in breach of such provisions in relation to equipment which he does not control and has not installed. I believe that regulation 7, which requires an employer to limit and train those who use “work equipment [whose use] is likely to involve a specific risk", similarly envisages that the use of such equipment will be in the control of the employer. Otherwise, it is hard to see how he could comply with it.</p>
<p class="para">86.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that employees normally may not be concerned about these regulations, given that claims based on breach of regulation 3(2) are not fault-based. But that is not the point: regulations 5, 6 and 7 can properly be referred to in order to identify what the draftsman of the 1998 Regulations had in mind when referring to work equipment and its use. It is also true that, if work equipment includes equipment not in the control of the employer, it may be possible to imply a term that those regulations only apply to the extent that it is legally possible for the employer to comply, but I am very doubtful whether such a reading would be permissible or appropriate.</p>
<p class="para">87.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, regulation 3(3)(b) provides that the requirements “imposed by these Regulations on an employer shall also apply” “to the extent of his control” to a person who has “control to any extent of” (i) work equipment, (ii) a “person at work who uses or supervises or manages the use” of such equipment, or (iii) the way such equipment is used. This supports the notion that control is an important feature; further, as I understand the provision, it extends liability in some cases where an employer is already liable under regulation 3(2) or a self-employed person is already liable under regulation 3(3)(a). However, I do not see it assisting Mrs Smith in the present case. The only sense in which the Council had control was in its ability to instruct Mrs Smith not to use the ramp, but that would mean that the lift, escalator, or train at the railway station would be work equipment “provided for use or used . . . at work".</p>
<p class="para">88.&nbsp;&nbsp;If anything, I consider that regulation 3(3)(b) supports the more limited meaning proposed by Lord Mance. It identifies what sort of control the 1998 Regulations had in mind, namely over the equipment itself, over the supervision and management of its use, and as to how it is used. The Council had no control over the ramp: what was done with it and to it was not a matter for the Council at all. The Council had no involvement in the way it was used or the management or supervision of its use. The only thing the Council could do was to forbid Mrs Smith from using it, unless that is within regulation 3(3)(b)(iii). However, that does not seem to me to accord with the natural meaning of paragraph (iii), especially if one contrasts its wording with regulation 4(1) and (2).</p>
<p class="para">89.&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I consider that Lord Mance’s conclusion deals more satisfactorily with the case of an injury caused to an employee, when travelling for work, by equipment such as a defective lift, escalator, or train at a railway station. Such equipment is simply out of the scope of the 1998 Regulations, on his approach, because it is not in the control of the employer. It is more difficult, in my view, to justify the exclusion of such items on Lord Hope’s approach, as it will not always be easy to say when and exactly why it would be appropriate to exclude, or appropriate to include, equipment not in the control of the employer from the ambit of the 1998 Regulations.</p>
<p class="para">90.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, it is worth considering an employee who is working at a third party’s premises - e.g. an accountant employed by a firm carrying out an audit at the offices of the company concerned. If she is injured by a defective piece of equipment (such as Rimer LJ’s example of an unsafe coffee machine at [2008] EWCA Civ 181, [2008] ICR 826, paragraph 40), liability to the accountant under the 1998 Regulations would, as I see it, lie with the Company, even though it did not employ her - see the <i>obiter </i>observations of Lord Hoffmann and Lord Rodger of Earlsferry in <i>Spencer-Franks v Kellogg Brown and Root Ltd </i>[2008] UKHL 46, [2008] ICR 863, paragraphs 26 and 44 respectively. It would not only be inherently a little surprising if the firm could be responsible; it would also be surprising if both the company and the firm were liable. Such a conclusion is consistent with the notion that an employer is not responsible under the 1998 Regulations if the equipment is not under his control, but under the control of someone else. Yet it is a little difficult to see why, on Lord Hope’s approach, the employer would not be liable in such a case.</p>
<p class="para">91.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, it seems to me that there is one judicial observation from a very high source, albeit <i>obiter</i>, which seems to me more consistent with the more limited scope given to the 1998 Regulations by Lord Mance. In <i>Spencer-Franks </i>[2008] ICR 863, paragraphs 23 and 26, Lord Hoffmann indicated that, at least in his opinion, where an employee of a motor repair company was injured by a defective car belonging to a customer, if anyone was liable under the Regulations, it would be the customer, rather than the employer. It is fair to say that the other members of your Lordships House who decided that case left the point open. However, such a conclusion is easily reconcilable with Lord Mance’s formulation, but perhaps a little more difficult in the case of Lord Hope’s. </p>
<p class="para">92.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, there is the provenance of the 1998 Regulations. The recital states that they are intended to give effect to proposals made by the Health and Safety Executive (“HSE”), which were in turn expressed to be “guided by the need to implement” EU Directive 89/655/EEC (“the Directive”), as explained more fully in <i>Spencer-Franks </i>[2008] ICR 863, paras 79-81. As is made clear in that case at [2008] ICR 863, paragraph 82, the Directive focusses on equipment “selected” by the employer and “made available to workers in the undertaking", which suggests a more limited scope than Lord Hope’s formulation would involve. It is true that the HSE’s proposals were in one specific respect intended to go further than the Directive required - hence regulations 3(3) to (5) - but nothing said by the HSE suggested any other intention to go further. I would therefore adopt the approach of Lord Hoffmann in <i>Spencer-Franks </i>[2008] ICR 863, paragraph 26 to an issue in that case, namely that the “1998 Regulations should in my opinion be interpreted to accord with the principle stated in the Directive". </p>
<p class="para">93.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixthly, there are the broader, policy, considerations. I consider that these point both ways in this case, and are therefore of no real assistance. There is much to be said in favour of the view that an employer should be liable for any injury suffered by an employee in the course of his employment, unless it was suffered as a result of unreasonable or unauthorised behaviour. However, whether legislation should so provide is a matter of policy for the legislature, which would be in a position to assess, for instance, its feasibility and cost and employment consequences. The 1998 Regulations have a less ambitious aim, being limited to work equipment. There are arguments for construing such regulations widely, as already mentioned. But there is also an argument for not landing employers with liabilities for equipment which they do not control. The fact that the liability imposed on an employer by the Regulations is irrespective of fault cuts both ways in this connection. On the one hand, if an employer can be liable for injury despite having been entirely careful, it can be said to render it less surprising that he should also be liable for injury caused by equipment he does not control. On the other hand, if liability is strict, that is a reason for giving the regulations which impose it the narrower of two alternative meanings.</p>
<p class="para">94.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I am unimpressed by the argument that the Council ought to be liable in this case because they actually inspected the ramp. If that fact could support any claim against the Council, it would be one based upon negligence, which, as it happens, cannot, on the facts, be made out. More generally, I would be reluctant to invoke the fact that the Council behaved responsibly in connection with the ramp as a reason for concluding that they were liable for an injury caused thereby. Of course, as already implied, if the inspection had revealed a defect which subsequently injured Mrs Smith, there would presumably be a good claim in negligence, but that would not be because the Council had inspected: it would be because the Council failed act appropriately as a result of discovering the defect.  </p>
