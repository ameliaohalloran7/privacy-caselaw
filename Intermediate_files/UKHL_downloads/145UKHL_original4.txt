<p align="right"><a href="obg-3.htm">(back to preceding text)</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87.&nbsp;&nbsp;I must, however, advert to the grounds upon which Mance LJ dissented on this point. He said, at para 86, that a "central question" was â€”</p>
<p></p><ul>"whether the tort of interference in the execution of a contract is capable of covering the situation of an unauthorised agent, who takes over the handling of a contract with a view to its performance by settlement of mutual contractual rights and obligations but with the result that the 'principal' suffers a loss which he would not otherwise have suffered.  The generality of the phrase 'interference in the execution of a contract' has so far only been held to extend to the 'procurement of a breach' or the 'prevention' or 'hindrance' of 'performance'.  The tort is not, however, limited to protecting contractual interests, and it must in my view extend to some situations where a person's pre-existing legal position is adversely affected in a more general manner than falls directly within any of the latter phrases."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would first observe that there was no finding that as a <i>result</i> of the unauthorized taking over of the handling of the contracts by the receivers, OBG suffered a loss which it would not otherwise have suffered.  As the claim was formulated by OBG, this question of causation was treated as irrelevant.  The judge simply held the receivers liable for the value of the contracts on 9 June 1992.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89.&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if there had been an investigation of this question, it is doubtful whether a causal connection between the assumption of control and the putative loss could have been established.  Mance LJ suggested that the acts of the receivers might have been binding upon OBG, and thereby committed it to a disadvantageous settlement, by virtue of section 232 of the Insolvency Act 1986:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The acts of an individual as administrator, administrative receiver, liquidator or provisional liquidator of a company are valid notwithstanding any defect in his appointment, nomination or qualifications."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90.&nbsp;&nbsp;For my part, I rather doubt, as the judge did, whether this section would have applied to the administrative receivers in this case. In <i>Morris v Kanssen</i> [1946]  AC 460, 471 this House considered the effect of a similar provision relating to the acts of directors, which was then contained in section 143 of the Companies Act 1929.  Lord Simonds said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"There is, as it appears to me, a vital distinction between (<i>a.</i>) an appointment in which there is a defect or, in other words, a defective appointment, and (<i>b.</i>) no appointment at all. In the first case it is implied that some act is done which purports to be an appointment but is by reason of some defect inadequate for the purpose; in the second case there is not a defect, there is no act at all. The section does not say that the acts of a person acting as director shall be valid notwithstanding that it is afterwards discovered that he was not appointed a director. Even if it did, it might well be contended that at least a purported appointment was postulated. But it does not do so, and it would, I think, be doing violence to plain language to construe the section as covering a case in which there has been no genuine attempt to appoint at all. These observations apply equally where the term of office of a director has expired, but he nevertheless continues to act as a director, and where the office has been from the outset usurped without the colour of authority."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case there was no colour of authority for the appointment of the receivers.  Although it is unnecessary to express a concluded view, I think that it follows from <i>Morris v Kanssen</i> that section 232 would have had no application.  If it had, it would have operated for the benefit of the receivers as well as anyone who dealt with them.  There is nothing in its language to suggest that its application is in any way restricted. (One may compare the explicit language of many other provisions for the protection of outside parties, such as section 14(6) of the Insolvency Act 1986.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92.&nbsp;&nbsp;That does not mean that a contract made by a person dealing in good faith with someone purporting to be a receiver, as in this case, can be repudiated by the company.  As Lord Simonds went on to point out in <i>Morris v Kanssen</i> [1946]  AC 460, such a person can rely on the principle of ostensible authority which in company law goes under the name of the rule in <i>Royal British Bank v Turquand</i> (1856)  6 E &amp; B 327. In this case, however, it was unnecessary to invoke either that rule or section 232, because NWW refused to rely upon the ostensible authority of the receivers.  They insisted upon the liquidator joining in the settlement.  The liquidator was at liberty to refuse, but he did so.  In order to establish a causal connection between the conduct of negotiations by the receivers and a loss which the company would not otherwise have suffered, it would be necessary to show that those negotiations somehow prejudiced the position of the company in a way which the liquidator could not repair by insisting that the deal be renegotiated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93.&nbsp;&nbsp;Be all that as it may, the question remains as to whether there is a tort of the breadth contemplated by Mance LJ, by which a purported agent can be strictly liable for causing the principal loss by making him liable, by virtue of ostensible authority, under a disadvantageous contract. In my opinion, there is not the slightest authority for such a tort.  It may be that, in some of the examples of unauthorized agency postulated by Mance LJ, there will be an implied contract which makes him liable for exceeding his actual authority, just as the agent gives an implied warranty of authority to the third party with whom he deals.  But there is, in my opinion, no such liability outside contract.  Mance LJ says (at [2005] QB 762, 789, para 90) "the tort protects from interference legal interests beyond the merely contractual".  If that is a reference to the tort of causing loss by unlawful means, then so it does.  But it requires unlawful means and an intention to cause loss, neither of which were present in this case.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conversion</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94.&nbsp;&nbsp;The case in conversion was unanimously rejected by all the judges who heard the <i>OBG</i> case and it might therefore be sufficient to say that I agree with them.  But the claim was given considerable prominence in argument, with a good deal of reference to North American authorities, and I shall therefore deal with it at greater length.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone agrees that conversion is historically a tort against a person's interest in a chattel, being derived from the action for trover, which included a fictitious allegation that the plaintiff had lost the chattel and that the defendant had found it. Secondly, and consistently with its ancient origin, conversion is a tort of strict liability.  Anyone who converts a chattel, that is to say, does an act inconsistent with the rights of the owner, however innocent he may be, is liable for the loss caused which, if the chattel has not been recovered by the owner, will usually be the value of the goods. <i>Fowler v Hollins</i> (1872)  LR 7 QB 616 was a claim for conversion of bales of cotton bought in good faith through a broker in Liverpool.  The purchasers were nevertheless held strictly liable. Cleasby J said robustly, at p 639, that:</p>
<p></p><ul>"the liability under it is founded upon what has been regarded as a salutary rule for the protection of property, namely, that persons deal with the property in chattels or exercise acts of ownership over them at their peril."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96.&nbsp;&nbsp;Advising the House of Lords on appeal from this decision, Blackburn J was more sympathetic. He said <i>(Hollins v Fowler</i> (1875)  LR 7 HL 757, 765) that the result was hard on the innocent purchasers but added:</p>
<p></p><ul>"If, as is quite possible, the changes in the course of business since the principles of law were established make them cause great hardships or inconvenience, it is the province of the Legislature to alter the law."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97.&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament has responded with legislation such as the Factors Act 1889, section 4 of the Cheques Act 1957 (which protects a collecting bank against liability for conversion of a cheque to which its customer had no title) and section 234(3) of the Insolvency Act, which, in the absence of negligence, protects an administrative receiver who "seizes or disposes of any property which is not property of the company" against liability. But there are no such protective provisions in relation to anything other than chattels.  Why not?  Obviously because Parliament thought them to be unnecessary. It would never have occurred to Parliament that strict liability for conversion could exist for anything other than chattels. The whole of the statutory modification of the law of conversion has been on the assumption that it applies only to chattels.  There has been no discussion of the question of whether an extension of conversion to choses in action would require a corresponding or even greater degree of protection for people acting in good faith.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Randall, who appeared for OBG, drew attention to paragraphs 829 and 830 of the Report of the Review Committee on Insolvency Law and Practice (the Cork Committee) (1982) Cmnd 8558, which endorsed a recommendation of the Jenkins Committee that the court should be given power to relieve an invalidly appointed receiver from liability for acts which would have been lawful if the appointment had been valid.  Parliament has not given effect to this recommendation.  He suggested that this omission should be regarded as somehow justifying a drastic <i>extension</i> of the liability of such receivers for conversion. The fallacy in this reasoning does not need to be underlined.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99.&nbsp;&nbsp;By contrast with the approving attitude of Cleasby J to the protection of rights of property in chattels, it is a commonplace that the law has always been very wary of imposing any kind of liability for purely economic loss. The economic torts which I have discussed at length are highly restricted in their application by the requirement of an intention to procure a breach of contract or to cause loss by unlawful means. Even liability for causing economic loss by negligence is very limited. Against this background, I suggest to your Lordships that it would be an extraordinary step suddenly to extend the old tort of conversion to impose strict liability for pure economic loss on receivers who were appointed and acted in good faith.  Furthermore, the effects of such a change in the law would of course not stop there. <i>Hunter v Canary Wharf</i> <i>Ltd </i>[1997]  AC 655, 694 contains a warning from Lord Goff of Chieveley (and other of their Lordships) against making fundamental changes to the law of tort in order to provide remedies which, if they are to exist at all, are properly the function of other parts of the law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100.&nbsp;&nbsp;As to authority for such a change, it hardly needs to be said that in English law there is none. I need go no further than Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th ed reissue (1999) vol 45(2), para 547, which says "The subject matter of conversion or trover must be specific personal property, whether goods or chattels." The Law Revision Committee was invited, in 1967, to consider "whether any changes are desirable in the law relating to conversion and detinue."  In its 18th Report in 1971 (Cmnd 4774) the Committee treated them both as confined to wrongful interference with chattels. They made various recommendations for changes in the law but none for the extension of conversion to intangible choses in action. On the contrary, the Torts (Interference with Goods) Act 1977, which was passed as a result of their recommendations, defined "wrongful interference with goods" to include "conversion of goods" (section 1) and defined "goods" in section 14(1) to include "all chattels personal other than things in action and money."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Randall relied upon authorities in Canada and the United States.  I can find no discussion in the Canadian cases of whether a claim for conversion can be made in respect of a chose in action. These cases are analysed by Peter Gibson LJ in his judgment in the Court of Appeal ([2005] QB at pp. 777-778) and I do not think that I should lengthen this judgment by adding to his comments.  For the reasons which he gives, I derive no assistance from them.  There are certainly cases in the United States which support Mr Randall's submission and which form part of the profligate extension of tort law which has occurred in that country.  Perhaps the most remarkable is the decision of the Federal Court of Appeals (9th Circuit) in <i>Kremen v Online Classifieds Inc</i> (2003)  337 F 3rd 1024, in which it was held that a publicly-funded company which provided gratuitous registration of internet domain names could be liable in conversion, on a footing of strict liability, for transferring a registered name to a third party, having acted in good faith on the authority of a forged letter.  The court held that the domain name was intangible property which could be converted in the same way as a chattel and that the registration company could be liable for its value.  I have no difficulty with the proposition that a domain name may be intangible property, like a copyright or trade mark, but the notion that a registrar of such property can be strictly liable for the common law tort of conversion is, I think, foreign to English law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102.&nbsp;&nbsp;The American cases make a good deal of the line of authority, which in England goes back to the beginning of the 19th century or earlier, by which a person who misappropriates a document which constitutes or evidences title to a debt can be liable in conversion for the face value of the document.  Surely, it was said, in such cases the action is in substance for conversion of the debt, a chose in action, and if that is right, then why not have conversion of any chose in action?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the document cases have been recognised to be an anomaly created by the judges to solve a particular problem, namely that a person who wrongfully secures payment of money due to another cannot be sued by the true creditor for money had and received to his use. That is because the creditor is not the owner of the money.  The wrongful payment was treated as a matter between the paying party and the recipient which did not affect the creditor's position.  Thus in <i>Rogers v Kelly</i> (1809)  2 Camp 123 a bank had mistakenly paid the defendant some money which the plaintiff had deposited.  Lord Ellenborough said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"There is no privity between the parties to this suit.  The plaintiff's claim is on the bankers, and they must seek their remedy against the defendant the best way they can."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104.&nbsp;&nbsp;But in cases in which the title to the debt was evidenced by a negotiable instrument, or even in some cases where it was not negotiable, the wrongful misappropriation of the document could cause actual loss to the true creditor, who might not be able to recover the debt. That left a gap in the law. The judges filled it by treating the misappropriation as a conversion of a chattel equal in value to the debt which it evidenced.  In <i>Morison v London County and Westminster Bank Ltd</i> [1914]  3 KB 356, 379 Phillimore LJ was not altogether confident about explaining the basis of the rule:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The defendant bank was the holder of the chequesâ€¦and â€¦collected the proceeds in its own rightâ€¦  Therefore the defendant bank converted the cheques.  That the damages for such conversion are (at any rate where the drawer has sufficient funds to his credit and the drawee bank is solvent) the face value of the cheques is established in a series of cases: â€¦ so well established that it is not necessary to inquire into the principle which may underlie the authority.  But the principle probably is that, though the plaintiff might at any moment destroy the cheques while they remained in his possession, they are potential instruments whereby the sums which they represent may be drawn from his bankers, and, if they get into other hands than his, he will be the loser to the extent of the sums which they represent.  It may also be that anyone who has obtained its value by presenting a cheque is estopped from asserting that it has only a nominal value."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Lloyds Bank Ltd v The Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China</i> [1929]  1 KB 40, 55-56, Scrutton LJ recognised the anomalous and limited nature of the principle:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Conversion primarily is conversion of chattels, and the relation of bank to customer is that of debtor and creditor.  As no specific coins in a bank are the property of any specific customer there might appear to be some difficulty in holding that a bank, which paid part of what it owed its customer to some other person not authorised to receive it, had converted its customer's chattels; but a series of decisions binding on this Court, culminating in <i>Morison's </i>case and <i>Underwood's</i> case [[1924] 1 KB 775] have surmounted the difficulty by treating the conversion as of the chattel, the piece of paper, the cheque under which the money was collected, and the value of the chattel converted as the money received under it: see the explanation of Phillimore LJ in <i>Morison's</i> case [cited above]"<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106.&nbsp;&nbsp;There do not appear to be any judicial statements offering a better explanation.  It is in my opinion an insecure base on which to erect a comprehensive system of strict liability for interference with choses in action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only point on which I would differ from Peter Gibson LJ in his admirable judgment in the Court of Appeal is in his expression of regret (in paragraph 58) that the liquidator had no cause of action.  This is not a case in which a wrongful appointment of receivers caused damage to a solvent company.  The judge found that the company was inevitably headed for insolvent liquidation. The liquidator sought immediate advice on the legality of the appointment of the receivers and then stood back for over three years, leaving the receivers to negotiate with NWW.  The receivers acted in good faith throughout and the liquidator concurred in the settlement they reached.  The liquidator then put his case on the basis of an allegation of strict liability which precluded any investigation into his own conduct or whether he could have produced a better result.  I can see no reason why such a claim should have succeeded. I would therefore dismiss the liquidator's appeal.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas v Hello! Ltd.</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108.&nbsp;&nbsp;Northern &amp; Shell plc publishes <i>OK!</i> magazine and I shall refer to it as <i>OK!</i>. In November 2000 <i>OK!</i> entered into a contract with Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones, whom I shall call "the Douglases", for the exclusive right to publish photographs of their forthcoming wedding on 18 November 2000 at the Plaza Hotel, New  York. The Douglases dealt with <i>OK!</i>, who paid them Â£1m for the rights, in preference to the rival magazine <i>Hello!</i>, published by the respondent. The Douglases agreed to engage a photographer and to supply <i>OK!</i> with pictures they had chosen. By clause 6 of the agreement they agreed to use their best efforts to ensure that no one else would take any photographs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Douglases went to some lengths to comply with this obligation and no criticism is made of their security precautions, but a freelance photographer named Rupert Thorpe infiltrated the wedding and took photographs which he sold to <i>Hello!.</i>  <i>OK!</i> obtained an ex parte injunction restraining publication by <i>Hello!</i> but on 23 November 2000 the injunction was discharged by the Court of Appeal and the photographs were published on the following day.  A few hours earlier on the same day <i>OK!</i> published its own photographs, having brought forward its date of publication on account of what it knew to be the imminent publication by <i>Hello!</i>  Also on the same day, some of the unauthorized pictures were, without objection by <i>Hello!</i>, published in national daily newspapers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>OK!</i> sued <i>Hello!</i> for breach of confidence and for the tort of causing loss by unlawful means. (The Douglases brought separate proceedings against <i>Hello!</i> and recovered modest damages, but these are not in issue in this appeal, to which the Douglases are not parties.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lindsay J held <i>Hello!</i> liable for breach of confidence. He applied the well-known criteria summarized by Megarry J in <i>Coco v AN Clark (Engineers) Ltd</i> [1969]  RPC 41, 47:</p>
<p></p><ul>"First, the information itselfâ€¦must 'have the necessary quality of confidence about it. Secondly, that information must have been imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence. Thirdly, there must be an unauthorised use of that information to the detriment of the party communicating it."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112.&nbsp;&nbsp;For this purpose the judge identified the information as being photographic images of the wedding.  Not information about the wedding generally; anyone was free to communicate the information that the Douglases had been married, describe what the bride wore and so forth.  The claim was only that there had been a breach of an obligation of confidence in respect of photographic images.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lindsay J held that the three conditions were satisfied.  As for the first, photographs of the wedding were confidential information in the sense that none were publicly available.  As to the second, the Douglases had made it clear that anyone admitted to the wedding was not to make or communicate photographic images. They allowed people to witness their marriage, but only on the basis that the information which the spectators thereby obtained was not communicated in the form of a photographic image. The judge said (at para 197):</p>
<p></p><ul>"the very facts that <i>Hello!</i> and <i>OK!</i> competed for exclusivity as they did and that each was ready to pay so much for it points to the commercial confidentiality of coverage of the event. The event was private in character and the elaborate steps to exclude the uninvited, to include only the invited, to preclude unauthorized photography, to control the authorized photography and to have had the claimants' intentions in that regard made clear all conduce to that conclusion. Such images as were, so to speak, radiated by the event were imparted to those present, including Mr Thorpe and his camera, in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence. Everyone there knew that was so."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114.&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, everyone knew that the obligation of confidence was imposed for the benefit of <i>OK!</i> as well as the Douglases. To no one could this have been clearer than to Mr Thorpe. The judge then went on to make findings about the circumstances in which <i>Hello! </i>had acquired his photographs:</p>
<p></p><ul>"198.&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the <i>Hello!</i> defendants, their consciences were, in my view, tainted; they were not acting in good faith nor by way of fair dealing. Whilst their position might have been worse had I held that the taking of unauthorised pictures for use by them had been truly commissioned in advance, even without that there is in my view enough to afflict their conscience. They knew that <i>OK!</i> had an exclusive contract; as persons long engaged in the relevant trade, they knew what sort of provisions any such contract would include and that it would include provisions intended to preclude intrusion and unauthorised photography. Particularly would that be so where, as they knew, a very considerable sum would have had to have been paid for the exclusive rights which had been obtained. â€¦ The surrounding facts were such that a duty of confidence should be inferred from them. The <i>Hello!</i> defendants had indicated to paparazzi in advance that they would pay well for photographs and they knew the reputation of the paparazzi for being able to intrude. The unauthorised pictures themselves plainly indicated they were taken surreptitiously. Yet these defendants firmly kept their eyes shut lest they might see what they undeniably knew would have become apparent to them."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115.&nbsp;&nbsp;The obligation of confidence was therefore binding upon <i>Hello!</i> and the third <i>Coco</i> requirement of use to the detriment of <i>OK!</i> was plainly satisfied. Lindsay J therefore decided that <i>Hello!</i> was liable to <i>OK!</i> for the loss caused by the publication, which he later assessed at Â£1,033,156.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal (Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers MR, Clarke and Neuberger LJJ) reversed the judge's decision on the ground that the obligation of confidence for the benefit of <i>OK!</i> attached only to the photographs which the Douglases authorized them to publish. <i> </i> They did not have the benefit of an obligation of confidence in respect of any other photographs.  Their publication may have invaded a residual right of privacy retained by the Douglases but did not infringe any right of <i>OK!</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion Lindsay J was right.  The point of which one should never lose sight is that OK! had paid Â£1m for the benefit of the obligation of confidence imposed upon all those present at the wedding in respect of <i>any</i> photographs of the wedding.  That was quite clear.  Unless there is some conceptual or policy reason why they should not have the benefit of that obligation, I cannot see why they were not entitled to enforce it.  And in my opinion there are no such reasons.  Provided that one keeps one's eye firmly on the money and why it was paid, the case is, as Lindsay J held, quite straightforward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is first necessary to avoid being distracted by the concepts of privacy and personal information.  In recent years, English law has adapted the action for breach of confidence to provide a remedy for the unauthorized disclosure of personal information: see <i>Campbell v MGN Ltd</i> [2004]  2 AC 457. This development has been mediated by the analogy of the right to privacy conferred by article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and has required a balancing of that right against the right to freedom of expression conferred by article 10. But this appeal is not concerned with the protection of privacy.  Whatever may have been the position of the Douglases, who, as I mentioned, recovered damages for an invasion of their privacy, <i>OK!'s</i> claim is to protect commercially confidential information and nothing more. So your Lordships need not be concerned with Convention rights. <i>OK!</i> has no claim to privacy under article 8 nor can it make a claim which is parasitic upon the Douglases' right to privacy. The fact that the information happens to have been about the personal life of the Douglases is irrelevant.  It could have been information about anything that a newspaper was willing to pay for. What matters is that the Douglases, by the way they arranged their wedding, were in a position to impose an obligation of confidence.  They were in control of the information.</p>
