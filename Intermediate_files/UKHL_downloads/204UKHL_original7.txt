<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;146.&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the effect on the <i>Bruton</i> tenancies of the grant of the 1995 lease to LQHT and the termination of that lease in 2000, there are two points to be made.  First, I agree with the appellants that when in 1995 LQHT were granted a term of years by Lambeth the <i>Bruton </i>tenancies became, vis-à-vis Lambeth, no longer "non estate" tenancies but estate tenancies.  The <i>Bruton </i>tenancies were, so to speak, fed by the estate that their landlord, LQHT, had acquired.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;147.&nbsp;&nbsp;But that estate was from the outset subject to the terms of the 1995 lease.  The termination of that lease in 2000 in accordance with the termination provisions contained in it terminated the entitlement of the <i>Bruton </i>tenants to claim an estate derived from and binding on Lambeth:  see <i>Barrett v Morgan</i> [2000]  2 AC 264 where, at 272, Lord Millett referred to a sub-tenant's derivative title as precarious "… for it cannot survive the natural termination of the head tenancy in accordance with its terms agreed before his subtenancy was created."  The "estate" tenancies held by the appellants were derived from and could not survive the termination of the 1995 lease.  The "non-estate" <i>Bruton </i>tenancies could survive as against the grantor of them, LQHT, but they were not binding as against Lambeth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;148.&nbsp;&nbsp; In my opinion, therefore, in agreement with Judge Cooke and the Court of Appeal, the appellants had no right under ordinary domestic law to retain possession of their respective properties after the termination of the 1995 lease.  They had become, vis-à-vis Lambeth, the owner of their properties, trespassers with no right to remain.</p>
<i><p>The article 8 issue</p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;149.&nbsp;&nbsp;These appeals have proceeded on the footing that at the heart is the issue whether there is an inconsistency between the Strasbourg court's judgment in <i>Connors</i> and the judgment of this House in <i>Qazi </i>and, if so, to what extent.  The Court of Appeal in <i>Leeds </i>thought that the two were inconsistent.  A differently constituted Court of Appeal in <i>Lambeth </i>distinguished <i>Connors </i>as being applicable only to cases involving gypsies (see para 106) but Mr Luba QC's article 8 submissions to the House on both these appeals were based on the proposition that there were substantial inconsistencies between <i>Qazi </i>and <i>Connors</i>.  My Lords I believe this focus to be misdirected.  There are, I would accept, inconsistencies between <i>Qazi </i>and <i>Connors </i>but they are minor.  Much more important is an analysis of the Strasbourg article 8 jurisprudence, ending with <i>Connors </i>and <i>Blecic</i>.  If that is done then I think it becomes apparent that such differences as there are between the approach of the majority in <i>Qazi </i>to article 8 defences in possession cases and the approach of the Strasbourg court to article 8 defences in possession cases is of no relevance to cases like those now before the House or, indeed, to a case such as <i>Qazi</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;150.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me start with the state of Strasbourg article 8 jurisprudence as it stood when the House heard the appeal in <i>Qazi</i>.  The Strasbourg case law as it then stood was examined and analysed by my noble and learned friends Lord Bingham of Cornhill and Lord Hope of Craighead.  In the opinion I gave, I expressed the view that in a case where the person occupying the property as his home had no legal or contractual right to remain there, as against the legal owner of the property, a claim by the owner to recover possession would not engage article 8 at all.  But Lord Bingham, Lord Hope, Lord Steyn and Lord Millett thought differently and I would accept that it is now settled that such a claim does engage article 8.  The contrary view is not, and has not been since <i>Qazi</i>, in issue.  It follows that article 8(2) comes into play in all such possession cases.  But the Strasbourg jurisprudence showed, also, that where an ordinary housing possession claim is being made, whether by a local authority landlord eg <i>S v United Kingdom</i> (1986) 47 DR 274, a private landlord eg <i>Di Palma v United Kingdom</i> (1986)  10 EHRR 149,  a mortgagee eg <i>Wood v United Kingdom </i> (1997) 24 EHRR CD 69, an article 8 defence cannot assist the occupier to resist a possession order sought by the legal owner.  <i>A fortiori </i>article 8 could not assist an occupier who had entered and remained on the property as a trespasser.  In each of the cases to which I have referred the ex-occupier's article 8 complaint was dismissed.  In <i>S </i> the Commission said that the possession order</p>
<p></p><ul>" … was clearly in accordance with the law and was also necessary for the protection of the contractual rights of the landlord to have the property back at the end of the tenancy".  (para 4)<p></p></ul>
<p>In <i>Di Palma</i>, the Commission said that the interference with the applicant's article 8 rights brought about by the forfeiture of her lease on account of her failure to pay a service charge</p>
<p></p><ul>" … was in conformity with Art.8(2) as a measure which was in accordance with the law and necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the rights of others" (pp 155 - 156).<p></p></ul>
<p>For "the rights of others", read "the rights of the landlord".</p>
<p>In <i>Wood </i>the Commission said that the re-possession of the applicant's home on account of her failure to keep up repayments of the mortgage loan</p>
<p></p><ul>" … was in accordance with the terms of the loan and the domestic law and was necessary for the protection of the rights and freedom of others, namely the lender" (pp 70 -71).<p></p></ul>
<p>In none of these cases did the Commission undertake a balancing exercise which put into the scale the personal difficulties and problems of the occupier whose home had been the subject of the possession order.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;151.&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrast, on the other hand, the Strasbourg approach to the article 8 cases where the interference with the "right to respect" for the home did not consist of an application for possession by the owner.</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Gillow v United Kingdom</i> (1986)  11 EHRR 335, a Guernsey case, the issue concerned a provision of the housing legislation under which a person not resident in Guernsey required a licence to take up residence there.  This provision was applied to Mr and Mrs Gillow.  They were refused a licence and their occupation of the residence they had acquired for themselves some years earlier was declared unlawful by the domestic courts.  On their complaint to Strasbourg the court examined all the facts, held that the housing law provisions were not <i>per se </i>inconsistent with article 8 but that the decision to refuse Mr and Mr Gillow the requisite licence did constitute an article 8 breach (see para 58).</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Buckley v United Kingdom</i> (1996)  23 EHRR 101  is an important case.  This was a gypsy case.  The article 8 issue arose because the applicant, who with her family lived in caravans on land that she had acquired for that purpose, had been refused planning permission for that use of the land.  An enforcement notice had been served.  The Commission had held that the enforcement notice was "excessive and disproportionate" (para 84 at p120) but the case then went to the full court.  The court looked carefully at the justification for the application of the statutory planning controls to the applicant, noted that it was for the national authorities to make the initial assessment of the necessity for the enforcement measures (para 74) and said (at para 76) that</p>
<p></p><ul>"Whenever discretion capable of interfering with the enjoyment of a Convention right such as the one at issue in the present case is conferred on national authorities, the procedural safeguards available to the individual will be especially material in determining whether the respondent state has, when fixing the regulatory framework, remained within its margin of appreciation.  Indeed it is settled law that … the decision making process leading to measures of interference must be fair and such as to afford due respect to the interests safeguarded to the individual by Article 8."<p></p></ul>
<p>The court then (in para 84) held that the planning authorities, in deciding to apply enforcement measures, had paid proper regard to the applicants' interests.  The court emphasised that "… it is not the court's task to sit in appeal on the merits of [the planning authorities'] decision." So no violation of the applicant's article 8 rights was found.  I would, however, draw particular attention to the court's emphasis on the need for "procedural safeguards".  This emphasis is found also in <i>Connors</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;152.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have mentioned <i>Gillow </i>and <i>Buckley</i>, neither of which was a possession order case, for the purpose of the contrast they present when compared with the ordinary housing possession cases.  There are several other non-possession order cases but none adds anything to assist in the clarification of the Strasbourg jurisprudence relating to the possession cases.  I should mention, however, <i>Larkos v Cyprus</i> (1999)  30 EHRR 597.  This was a possession case which, on analysis, seems to me to have had a good deal in common with, and therefore to be of assistance in understanding, <i>Connors</i>.  The applicant, Larkos, was a tenant of the house in which he lived.  His landlord was the government.  His tenancy was terminated by the government and an eviction order was made against him.  This, as I would now accept, was an interference with his article 8 right to respect for his home.  Statutory provisions applicable in Cyprus gave a degree of security of tenure to domestic tenants that did not extend to domestic tenants of government owned property.  The applicant complained that this statutory discrimination constituted a violation of his rights under article 14 of the Convention in conjunction with article 8.  He said there was no good reason why he should enjoy less protection than tenants of private landlords.  Both the Commission and the Court agreed.  The Court said that</p>
<p></p><ul>" … the legislation was intended as a measure of social protection for tenants ….  A decision not to extend that protection to government tenants living side by side with tenants in privately-owned dwellings requires specific justification …"  (para 31)<p></p></ul>
<p>and that the government had failed to provide "any convincing explanation" for that decision (para 31).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;153.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Qazi </i>the majority, of whom I was one, held that "contractual and proprietary rights to possession cannot be defeated by a defence based on article 8" (per Lord Hope of Craighead at para 84).  Mr Qazi and his wife had been tenants of a local authority house.  They had parted company and Mrs Qazi had served a notice to quit on the landlords.  This had the effect in law of terminating the tenancy.  Mr Qazi wanted to remain in the house and applied for a new tenancy in his sole name; but his application was refused.  The council said they wanted to let the house to someone else on their housing list.  They instituted possession proceedings in the county court.  Mr Qazi had no right under ordinary domestic law to remain in the house but he resisted the possession application on the ground that his article 8 right to respect for his home was being unlawfully interfered with.  The trial judge held that once his legal and equitable right to occupy the house had come to an end the house could not constitute his "home" for article 8 purposes.  So the judge made a possession order.  The Court of Appeal did not agree that the house no longer constituted Mr Qazi's home and remitted the case to the county court in order for the issue as to whether the interference with his article 8 right could be justified under article 8(2) to be decided.  On the council's appeal to this House we all agreed that the Court of Appeal's conclusion on the "home" issue was correct but the majority took the view that it would be pointless to remit the case to the county court since it was plain that the article 8(2) point would have to be decided in the council's favour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;154.&nbsp;&nbsp;The conformity of the majority's opinion on the article 8(2) point with Strasbourg jurisprudence was confirmed when Mr Qazi took his article 8 complaint to Strasbourg where it was peremptorily dismissed.  The Court dismissed his complaint as being manifestly ill-founded and inadmissible.  This decision by the Court was entirely consistent with their 1995 decision in <i>Ure v United Kingdom </i>(Application No 28027/95).  My noble and learned friend Lord Bingham has expressed doubt whether any reliable inference can be drawn from the finding of inadmissibility made in respect of Mr Qazi's application (para 23).  The inference I would draw is the obvious one, namely, that the Court thought his article 8 complaint could not succeed because his eviction could clearly be justified under article 8(2).  His tenancy had come to an end and there was nothing more to be said.  I would draw comparable inferences from the decisions in  <i>S</i>, in <i>Di Palma</i> and in <i>Wood</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;155.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that the Strasbourg jurisprudence is not entirely consistent.  In <i>Ure v United Kingdom </i>(Application No 28027/95), for instance, the Commission appear to have reviewed the manner in which the council had "balanced the various interests involved, such as the interest of the leaving co-tenant, of those in need of accommodation, and of the applicant" before concluding that the council's decision to evict the applicant was neither arbitrary nor unreasonable (p 3).  And in <i>Marzari v Italy</i> (1999)  28 EHRR CD 175, where the applicant had been evicted for failure to pay his rent and had prayed in aid, in support of his article 8 complaint, his serious medical condition, the Court said that</p>
<p></p><ul>"To the extent that the ITEA aimed at recovering possession of the apartment on the ground that the applicant had ceased to pay the rent, the Court considers that the impugned decision had a legitimate purpose under paragraph 2 of Article 8, namely the protection of the rights of others" (p 180)<p></p></ul>
<p>but then went on to consider the applicant's medical condition in connection with the question whether the eviction was necessary in a democratic society.  The Court found that it was, mainly, I think, because the applicant had been "never co-operative" and had not "use[d] the avenues which were available to him and which were even pointed out to him in order to avoid the eviction."  Very similar comments could have been made about the applicant in <i>Di Palma</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;156.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, despite some inconsistencies, the state of Strasbourg jurisprudence, at the time <i>Connors </i>was decided, exhibited, in relation to article 8 defences to possession applications made by the owners of properties that constituted the homes of the occupiers from whom possession was sought, the following features:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;There had been no case in which the grant of a possession order to enable the owner to evict from possession a person who was, or had become, a trespasser had been held to constitute a breach of the latter's article 8 right to respect for his home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;In the majority of cases the right of the owner to a possession order had been treated as axiomatic once it had become clear that the occupier had no contractual or proprietary right as against the owner to remain in possession.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;But if the domestic law rules applicable to the relationship between the owner and the occupier included some unusual feature that placed the occupier in a position of particular disadvantage, that feature of the law, if insufficiently or unconvincingly justified, might lead to a finding of an article 8 infringement.  It may be that <i>Larkos v Turkey </i>should be regarded as an example of this.  It so happens that the complaint made was an article 14 complaint.  But the grounds on which the complaint was held to be well-founded seem to me to show that if the complaint had been couched as an article 8 complaint it would, for the same reasons, have been held to be well-founded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;157.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both <i>Connors </i>and <i>Blecic </i>are, in my opinion, consistent with this analysis of the pre <i>Connors </i>jurisprudence.  There are three features of <i>Connors </i>that contributed to the Court's conclusion that the eviction of the family from the local authority caravan site constituted a breach of their article 8 right to respect for their home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;158.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the security of tenure given by the Mobile Homes Act 1983 to travellers licensed to station their caravans on privately owned caravan sites was not extended to travellers licensed to station their caravans on local authority owned sites.  The Court was not persuaded by the government's attempt to justify this discrimination which raised an issue of the same nature as that which in <i>Larkos v Turkey </i>had been successfully raised as an article 14 issue.  In <i>Larkos </i>the result would have been the same if the complaint had been an article 8 complaint.  In <i>Connors </i>the result on this point would have been the same if the complaint had been dealt with as an article 14 complaint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;159.&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Strasbourg jurisprudence in relation to article 8 and gypsies has established that contracting states have a positive obligation "to facilitate the gypsy way of life" (see para 84 of the <i>Connors </i>judgment).  The Court said that:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Some special consideration should be given to their needs and their different lifestyle both in the relevant regulatory framework and in reaching decisions in particular cases."<p></p></ul>
<p>It was this requirement for "special consideration" to be given to gypsies that led the Court of Appeal in <i>Lambeth </i>to conclude that the principles expressed by the Strasbourg court in <i>Connors </i>were not applicable to Kay and the other <i>Bruton</i> tenants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;160.&nbsp;&nbsp;The third notable feature of <i>Connors </i>is the importance placed by the court on "procedural safeguards".  The applicant had sought permission to apply for judicial review of the local authority's decision to terminate his licence to remain on the caravan site.  But the High Court had refused permission.  In consequence, the reasons why the local authority had wanted him off the site were never challenged in court proceedings.  Under the applicable domestic law the local authority did not have to justify their decision to terminate his licence but in fact their reason had been that they thought Mr Connors and his family had been making a nuisance of themselves on the site.  Mr Connors denied that that was so but, his attempt to seek judicial review of the decision having foundered, the issue was never judicially tested.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;161.&nbsp;&nbsp;The three features to which I have referred provide the context for the Strasbourg court's <i>Connors </i>judgment, a context that has no counterpart in the facts of either of the appeals now before the House (nor in the facts of the <i>Qazi</i> case).  There is no unusual or discriminatory feature of the legal framework under which Lambeth in the <i>Bruton</i> tenancy appeals and Leeds in the Maloney appeal became entitled to possession orders in respect of their respective properties.  In the Maloney case, whatever positive obligation there may be for Leeds to provide sites for gypsies and their caravans, the Maloney family cannot claim that two days of trespassing with their caravans on a local authority recreation ground enabled them to claim an article 8 right of respect for the patch of recreation ground on which they happen to have parked the caravans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;162.&nbsp;&nbsp;As to "procedural safeguards", each of the <i>Bruton</i> tenants filed a pleading setting out the basis on which his article 8 defence, as well as his domestic law defence, was based.  The article 8 defences were given due judicial consideration but were struck out as being incapable of constituting a defence to Lambeth's possession claim.  Whatever "procedural safeguards" are requisite, they cannot bar a court from ruling in a particular case that the pleaded facts and matters relied on are not capable of outweighing in the balance the contractual and/or proprietary right to possession of the owner of the property in question.  If the home occupier thinks the judge's ruling to be in error, the ruling can, as happened in the <i>Bruton</i> tenancy cases, be reviewed on appeal, or on an application for permission to appeal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;163.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Blecic v Croatia </i> (2004)  41 EHRR 185 is an interesting example of the Strasbourg court's approach to a case where the interference with the home has involved an unusual statutory provision.  <i>Blecic </i> was not a case of an owner of property seeking possession from a home occupier.  Mrs Blecic had left her flat in Zadar, Croatia, which she occupied under a "specially protected" tenancy granted by the local authority, in order to visit her daughter in Rome.  While she was away armed conflict erupted in the area, her pension ceased to be paid and she lost the right to medical insurance.  So she stayed in Rome for some nine months.  During her absence another family moved into her flat and the local authority commenced proceedings to terminate her tenancy.  The proceedings were taken in reliance on a provision of the applicable housing legislation which said that a specially protected tenancy could be terminated if the tenant ceased to occupy the flat for a period exceeding six months without justified reasons.  So the issue was whether Mrs Blecic had justified reasons for staying away for nine months.  The course of the proceedings was somewhat convoluted but, despite some successes in the lower courts, Mrs Blecic lost both in the Croatian Supreme Court and in the Constitutional Court.  She then took her complaint to Strasbourg and lost there as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;164.&nbsp;&nbsp;In para 65 of its judgment the Strasbourg court explained its approach.  They said that in socio-economic matters such as housing the domestic authorities should be accorded a wide margin of appreciation and that the judgment of the domestic authorities as to what was necessary to achieve its objectives should be respected unless that judgment was manifestly without reasonable foundation.  They said that the court  </p>
<p></p><ul>"…will accept the judgment of the domestic authorities as to what is necessary in a democratic society unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation, that is, unless the measure employed is manifestly disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued."<p></p></ul>
<p>The court held, further, (in para 70) that they were satisfied</p>
<p></p><ul>"… that the procedural requirements implicit in Art. 8 of the Convention were complied with and that [Mrs Blecic] was involved in the decision-making process to a degree sufficient to provide her with the requisite protection of her interests."<p></p></ul>
<p>So Mrs Blecic lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;165.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is informative, I think, to compare what was said in <i>Blecic </i>with what had been said nine months earlier in <i>Connors</i>.  Where interference with gypsies' article 8 rights had happened, the court said that "particularly weighty reasons of public interest by way of justification" were required and that the margin of appreciation to be afforded to the national authorities "must be regarded as correspondingly narrowed" (para.86 of <i>Connors</i>).  Accordingly, the court was not persuaded that "the necessity for a statutory scheme which permitted the summary eviction of the applicant and his family [had] been sufficiently demonstrated" (para 94 of <i>Connors</i>).  But in <i>Blecic</i>, a housing case, the margin of appreciation was held to be wide and the judgment of the domestic authorities was to be accepted unless manifestly ill-founded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;166.&nbsp;&nbsp;In both <i>Connors </i>and <i>Blecic </i>the Strasbourg court reviewed with article 8 spectacles, first, the legal framework under which the home occupier had been deprived of his home.  In <i>Blecic </i>that framework passed muster.  In <i>Connors</i> it did not.  Second, the court reviewed the manner in which the legal framework had been applied.  In <i>Blecic </i>that, too, passed muster.  In <i>Connors</i>, the review was of the local authority's decision to seek a court order to evict the Connors family.  The only domestic law review of that decision consisted of the adverse ruling on the application for permission to seek judicial review of the decision.  That review was held to be inadequate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;167.&nbsp;&nbsp;So what are the implications of these two Strasbourg judgments, first, for the House's decision in <i>Qazi </i>and, more important, for the appeals now before the House?  As to <i>Qazi</i>, the domestic law which left Mr Qazi, one of the joint tenants, without a tenancy once his wife, the other joint tenant, had served a notice to quit terminating the tenancy, had no special or discriminatory feature which might have attracted the attention of the Strasbourg court on an article 8 review - as, indeed, the result when the <i>Qazi </i>case did reach Strasbourg demonstrated.  As to the decision of the local authority to seek possession of the property from Mr Qazi and not to grant him a new tenancy, that decision, on the approach exemplified in <i>Blecic</i>, was within the wide margin of appreciation available to local housing authorities faced with conflicting demands for a scarce commodity.  This, too, is demonstrated by Strasbourg's rejection of Mr <i>Qazi</i>'s article 8 complaint.  The conclusion that the decision in <i>Qazi </i>is consistent with Strasbourg jurisprudence is further supported by the absence of any mention of <i>Qazi</i> either by counsel in the course of the <i>Connors </i>hearing or by the Strasbourg court in its <i>Connors </i>judgment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;168.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is right to notice, however, that <i>Connors </i>and <i>Blecic </i>do show that in two types of case where an owner is seeking to recover possession of his property the absence of any contractual or proprietary right of the home occupier to remain in possession may not be conclusive.  The first type of case is where an arguable article 8 objection can be taken to some aspect of the statutory and common law rules that entitle the owner to possession.  <i>Connors </i>was such a case.  So was <i>Larkos</i>.  So, too, was <i>Blecic </i>although the argument in the end failed.  The second type of case is where the procedural means available to the home occupier for challenging the decision by the owner of the property to evict him are inadequate.  <i>Connors </i>was thought by the Strasbourg court to be such a case.  Subject to that qualification, the conclusion of the Court of Appeal in <i>Leeds </i>that <i>Connors </i>and <i>Qazi</i> could not stand together and that a decision had to be taken as to which to follow is a conclusion with which I respectfully disagree.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;169.&nbsp;&nbsp;As for these appeals, may I consider first the <i>Lambeth </i>appeals.  The possession orders sought by Lambeth engage the article 8 right to respect for the home of the respective occupiers from whom possession was sought.  But an order for possession was in accordance with domestic law.  As against Lambeth the occupiers had become trespassers with no right to remain in occupation.  There was nothing discriminatory or unusual about the statutory and common law framework that produced that result nor about the absence of any statutory protection given to the occupiers by the housing legislation.  I respectfully agree with my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill's remarks in para 36 of his opinion that the balance required by article 8(2) to be struck was struck by the general law, that the public authority owner had a right to manage and control its property within the bounds set by statute, that the occupier acquired only a limited right to occupy and that on due determination of that right, a claim by the owner must ordinarily succeed.  The appellants, the <i>Bruton</i> tenants of LQHT, could not resist Lambeth's possession applications on article 8 grounds unless either they mounted an article 8 attack on the legal framework that entitled Lambeth to possession or they attacked on article 8 grounds Lambeth's decision to seek possession.  The first attack was not attempted, and, if it had been, would in my opinion have been bound to fail.  There is nothing the matter, from an article 8 standpoint, with a common law rule which gives the owner of property, which is occupied as a home by a person who has no right as against the owner to remain there, the right to recover possession of the property.  Parliament's omission to provide any statutory security of tenure for home occupiers in the position in which the <i>Bruton </i>tenants found themselves is well within the wide margin of appreciation referred to in <i>Blecic</i>.</p>
