        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, one is intensely aware that <i>Rondel 
          v. Worsley</i> [1969] 1 A.C. 191 was a carefully reasoned and unanimous 
          decision of the House. On the other hand, it is now clear that when 
          the balance is struck between competing factors it is no longer in the 
          public interest that the immunity in favour of barristers should remain. 
          I am far from saying that <i>Rondel v. Worsley</i> was wrongly decided. 
          But on the information now available and developments since <i>Rondel 
          v. Worsley </i>I am satisfied that in today's world that decision no 
          longer correctly reflects public policy. The basis of the immunity of 
          barristers has gone. And exactly the same reasoning applies to solicitor 
          advocates. There are differences between the two branches of the profession 
          but not of a character to differentiate materially between them in respect 
          of the issue before the House. I would treat them in the same way.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That brings me to the argument that the ending 
          of the immunity, if it is to be undertaken, is a matter for Parliament. 
          This argument is founded on section 62 of the Courts and Legal Services 
          Act 1990. It reads as follows:</p>
        <p>
        </p><ul>
          "(1) A person - 
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
          <p>a) who is not a barrister; but </p>
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
          (b) who lawfully provides any legal services in relation to any proceedings, 
          shall have the same immunity from liability for negligence in respect 
          of his acts or omissions as he would have if he were a barrister lawfully 
          providing those services. 
        </ul>
        <ul>
          (2) No act or omission on the part of any barrister or other person 
          which is accorded immunity from liability for negligence shall give 
          rise to an action for breach of any contract relating to the provision 
          by him of the legal services in question." 
        </ul>
        <p>The background to this provision is, of course, the judicially created 
          immunity of barristers, which in 1967 was held by the House to be founded 
          on public policy. And it will be recollected that Lord Reid observed 
          that public policy is not immutable. Against this background the meaning 
          of section 62 is clear. It provides that solicitor advocates will have 
          the same immunity as barristers have. In other words, the immunity of 
          solicitors will follow the fortunes of the immunity of barristers, or 
          track it. Section 62 did not either expressly or by implication give 
          Parliamentary endorsement to the immunity of barristers. In these circumstances 
          the argument that it is beyond the power of the House of Lords, which 
          created the immunity spelt out in <i>Rondel v. Worsley</i>, to reverse 
          that decision in changed circumstances involving a different balance 
          of policy considerations is not right. Should the House as a matter 
          of discretion leave it to Parliament? This issue is more finely balanced. 
          It would certainly be the easy route for the House to say "let us leave 
          it to Parliament." On balance my view is that it would be an abdication 
          of our responsibilities with the unfortunate consequence of plunging 
          both branches of the legal profession in England into a state of uncertainty 
          over a prolonged period. That would be a disservice to the public interest. 
          On the other hand, if the decision is made to end the immunity now, 
          both branches of the profession will know where they stand. They ought 
          to find it relatively easy to amend their rules where necessary and 
          to adjust their already existing insurance arrangements insofar as that 
          may be necessary.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, the cards are now heavily stacked 
          against maintaining the immunity of advocates. I would rule that there 
          is no longer any such immunity in criminal and civil cases. In doing 
          so I am quite confident that the legal profession does not need the 
          immunity.</p>
        <p align="center">The <i>Hunter</i> case</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as the <i>Hunter</i> case involves a 
          separate question before the House I would refer to my discussion of 
          this topic under the heading of Immunity of Barristers.</p>
        <i> 
        <p align="center">The Disposal Of The Appeals </p>
        </i> 
        <div align="center"></div>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the conclusion that the immunity no longer 
          exists, it follows that the appeals must fail. I would dismiss the three 
          appeals.</p>
        <p><b>LORD BROWNE-WILKINSON</b></p>
        <p>My Lords,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the advantage of reading the speeches 
          of my noble and learned friends Lord Steyn and Lord Hoffmann. I agree 
          with them and for the reasons they give, I would dismiss these appeals. 
          However, since the point at issue is important and your Lordships' views 
          are not unanimous, I will state shortly my views on the point on which 
          your Lordships are divided.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me initially consider the points on which 
          your Lordships are all agreed. First that, given the changes in society 
          and in the law that have taken place since the decision in <i>Rondel 
          v</i>. <i>Worsley</i> [1969] 1 A.C. 191, it is appropriate to review 
          the public policy decision that advocates enjoy immunity from liability 
          for the negligent conduct of a case in court. Second, that the propriety 
          of maintaining such immunity depends upon the balance between, on the 
          one hand, the normal right of an individual to be compensated for a 
          legal wrong done to him and, on the other, the advantages which accrue 
          to the public interest from such immunity. Third, that in relation to 
          claims for immunity for an advocate in civil proceedings, such balance 
          no longer shows sufficient public benefit as to justify the maintenance 
          of the immunity of the advocate.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point on which your Lordships are divided 
          is whether the same rules should apply whether the negligence alleged 
          against the advocate relates to his conduct of a civil action or to 
          a criminal prosecution. Are there, as some of your Lordships think, 
          special reasons which require the immunity of the advocate in a criminal 
          trial to be maintained? Of the four main grounds relied upon as justifying 
          the immunity, only one seems to me to be capable of justifying the immunity, 
          namely that to allow an action for negligence against the advocate for 
          his conduct in earlier litigation is necessarily going to involve the 
          risk that different conclusions on issues decided in the first case 
          will be reached in the later case. In the context of civil proceedings 
          (i.e. where the advocate is sought to be made liable for his conduct 
          of a civil action) although such conflicting decisions are undesirable, 
          they are far from unknown. But in the context of criminal proceedings 
          (i.e. when the advocate's negligence occurred in the course of a criminal 
          trial) the decision is far more difficult. In the overwhelming majority 
          of cases, the action in negligence will not be capable of succeeding 
          unless the verdict of guilty in the original trial is held to have been 
          incorrect; if the complainant was in any event guilty of the alleged 
          crime, the negligence of his advocate, even if proved, would not have 
          been shown to be causative of any loss. Therefore, if there is to be 
          a successful action for negligence in criminal matters, so long as the 
          plaintiff's criminal conviction stands there will be two conflicting 
          decisions of the court, one (reached by judge and jury on the criminal 
          burden of proof) saying that he is guilty, the other (reached by a judge 
          alone on balance of probability) that he is not guilty. My Lords, I 
          would find such conflicting decisions quite unacceptable. If a man has 
          been found guilty of a crime in a criminal trial, for all the purposes 
          of society he is guilty unless and until his conviction is set aside 
          on appeal. Therefore, if the removal of the advocate's immunity in criminal 
          cases would produce these conflicting decisions, I would have no doubt 
          that the public interest demanded that the advocate's immunity be preserved.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in my judgment the law has already provided 
          a solution where later proceedings are brought which directly or indirectly 
          challenge the correctness of a criminal conviction. <i>Hunter v. Chief 
          Constable of the West Midlands Police </i> [1982] A.C. 529 establishes 
          that the court can strike out as an abuse of process the second action 
          in which the plaintiff seeks to re-litigate issues decided against him 
          in earlier proceedings if such re-litigation would be manifestly unfair 
          to the defendant or would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 
          In view of the more restrictive rules of res judicata and issue estoppel 
          it is not clear to me how far the <i>Hunter </i>case goes where the 
          challenge is to an earlier decision in a civil case. But in my judgment 
          where the later civil action must, in order to succeed, establish that 
          a subsisting conviction is wrong, in the overwhelming majority of cases 
          to permit the action to continue would bring the administration of justice 
          into disrepute. Save in truly exceptional circumstances, the only permissible 
          challenge to a criminal conviction is by way of appeal.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows that, in the ordinary case, an action 
          claiming that an advocate has been negligent in criminal proceedings 
          will be struck out as an abuse of process so long as the criminal conviction 
          stands. Only if the conviction has been set aside will such an action 
          be normally maintainable. In these circumstances there is no need to 
          preserve an advocate's immunity for his conduct of a criminal case since, 
          in my judgment, the number of cases in which negligence actions are 
          brought after a conviction is quashed is likely to be small and actions 
          in which the conviction has not been quashed will be struck out as an 
          abuse of process.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, and the much fuller reasons 
          given by Lord Steyn and Lord Hoffmann, I would dismiss these appeals.</p>
        <p><b>LORD HOFFMANN</b></p>
        <p>My Lords,</p>
        <p>1. <i>The facts</i>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these appeals three clients are suing their 
          solicitors for negligence. In the first, Mr. Simons says that his solicitors 
          negligently allowed him to become involved in lengthy and expensive 
          litigation when they should have advised him to settle. In the second, 
          Mr. Barratt says that his solicitors negligently advised him to settle 
          his divorced wife's claim for a share of the matrimonial home on disadvantageous 
          terms. In the third, Mrs. Harris has a similar complaint about the terms 
          upon which her solicitors advised her to settle her claim for maintenance 
          against her ex-husband. None of these allegations has been investigated. 
          The solicitors may or may not have a complete answer to them. But they 
          say that even if they were negligent, they cannot be sued. They claim 
          immunity under a modern version of an ancient rule of common law which 
          prevented barristers from being sued for negligence. </p>
        <p>2. <i>The immunity rule</i></p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old rule for barristers survived until 
          1967. The way in which it was usually explained was that barristers, 
          unlike solicitors, had no contract with their clients. They could not 
          sue for their fees. And in the absence of a contract there could be 
          no liability. But that reason was undermined when the House of Lords 
          decided in <i>Hedley Byrne &amp; Co. Ltd. v. Heller &amp; Partners Ltd.</i> 
          [1964] A.C. 465 that, even without a contract, a person who negligently 
          performed professional or other duties which he had undertaken could 
          be sued in tort. So the whole question was re-examined by the House 
          in <i>Rondel v. Worsley</i> [1969] 1 A.C. 191. What emerged was a different 
          rule of immunity, in some respects wider and in others narrower, not 
          based upon any technicalities but upon what the House perceived as the 
          public interest in the administration of justice. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new rule was narrower because, although 
          their Lordships were not unanimous about its precise limits, they agreed 
          that it should in general terms be confined to acts concerned with the 
          conduct of litigation. None of them thought that it could apply to non-contentious 
          work. Barristers had previously been immune from liability for anything. 
          On the other hand, the new rule was wider in that it also applied to 
          solicitors.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the speeches in <i>Rondel v. Worsley</i> 
          [1969] 1 A.C. 191 were devoted to explaining why the new immunity was 
          necessary. The old cases had not relied solely upon the technicalities 
          of contract. The rule was also said to be an expression of public policy. 
          But Lord Reid said, at p. 227B-C, that public policy was "not immutable" 
          and that because "doubts appear to have arisen in many quarters whether 
          that rule is justifiable in present day conditions in this country" 
          it was proper to "re-examine the whole matter." The grounds upon which 
          their Lordships considered that public policy required a modified immunity 
          may be summarised under four heads: divided loyalty, the cab rank, the 
          witness analogy and collateral challenge.</p>
        <i> 
        <p>3. Divided loyalty</p>
        </i> 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawyers conducting litigation owe a divided 
          loyalty. They have a duty to their clients, but they may not win by 
          whatever means. They also owe a duty to the court and the administration 
          of justice. They may not mislead the court or allow the judge to take 
          what they know to be a bad point in their favour. They must cite all 
          relevant law, whether for or against their case. They may not make imputations 
          of dishonesty unless they have been given the information to support 
          them. They should not waste time on irrelevancies even if the client 
          thinks that they are important. Sometimes the performance of these duties 
          to the court may annoy the client. So, it was said, the possibility 
          of a claim for negligence might inhibit the lawyer from acting in accordance 
          with his overriding duty to the court. That would be prejudicial to 
          the administration of justice.</p>
        <i> 
        <p>4. The cab rank </p>
        </i> 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a valuable professional ethic of the 
          English bar that a barrister may not refuse to act for a client on the 
          ground that he disapproves of him or his case. Every barrister not otherwise 
          engaged is available for hire by any client willing and able to pay 
          the appropriate fee. This rule protects barristers against being criticised 
          for giving their services to a client with a bad reputation and enables 
          unpopular causes to obtain representation in court. It was said that 
          barristers would be less inclined to honour this professional obligation 
          if they suspected that the client was the sort of person who would, 
          if he lost his case, turn on his barrister and sue for negligence. This 
          consideration was said to apply with particular force to the criminal 
          bar, where the unsuccessful client, like Mr. Rondel, was likely to have 
          leisure to ponder the way his trial had been conducted and access to 
          legal aid if he could persuade another lawyer that he had an arguable 
          case.</p>
        <i> 
        <p>5. The witness analogy</p>
        </i> 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can be sued in defamation for anything 
          said in court. The rule confers an absolute immunity which protects 
          witnesses, lawyers and the judge. The administration of justice requires 
          that participants in court proceedings should be able to speak freely 
          without being inhibited by the fear of being sued, even unsuccessfully, 
          for what they say. The immunity has also been extended to statements 
          made out of court in the course of preparing evidence to be given in 
          court. So it is said that a similar immunity against proceedings for 
          negligence is necessary to enable advocates to conduct the litigation 
          properly.</p>
        <p>6. <i>Collateral challenge</i>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a client could sue his lawyer for negligence 
          in conducting his litigation, he would have to prove not only that the 
          lawyer had been negligent but also that his negligence had an adverse 
          effect upon the outcome. This would usually mean proving that he would 
          have won a case which he lost. But this gives rise to the possibility 
          of apparently conflicting judgments which could bring the administration 
          of justice into disrepute. A client is convicted and sent to prison. 
          His appeal is dismissed. In prison, he sues his lawyer for negligence. 
          The lawyer's defence is that he was not negligent but that, in any case, 
          the client has suffered no injustice because whatever the lawyer did 
          would not have secured an acquittal. In seeking to establish the latter 
          point, the lawyer may or may not be able to re-assemble the witnesses 
          who gave evidence for the prosecution. The question of whether the client 
          should have been acquitted is then tried on evidence which is bound 
          in some respects to be different, before a different tribunal and in 
          the absence of the prosecution. The civil court finds, on a balance 
          of probability, that the lawyer was negligent and that if he had conducted 
          the defence with reasonable skill, the client would have been acquitted. 
          Or perhaps that he would have had a 50% chance of being acquitted. Damages 
          are awarded. But what happens then? Does the client remain in prison, 
          despite the fact that a judge has said there was an even chance that 
          he would have been acquitted? Should he be released, notwithstanding 
          that the prosecution has had no opportunity to say that his conviction 
          was correct? Should it be referred back to the Court of Appeal and what 
          happens if the Court of Appeal, on the material before it, takes a different 
          view from the civil judge? The public would not understand what was 
          happening. So it was said that to allow clients to sue for negligence 
          would allow a "collateral challenge" to a previous decision of another 
          court. Even though the parties were different, this would be contrary 
          to the public interest.</p>
        <p>7. <i>The scope of the immunity</i> </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eleven years later, after <i>Rondel v. Worsley</i> 
          [1969] 1 A.C. 191, the House of Lords in <i>Saif Ali v. Sydney Mitchell 
          &amp; Co. </i>[1980] A.C. 198 had to consider the limits of the immunity. 
          There was no challenge to the decision itself or the core immunity for 
          the conduct of litigation in court. The question was the extent to which 
          that immunity cast its shadow upon acts done out of court. In the particular 
          case, it was a barrister's failure to advise joining additional parties 
          before the limitation period had expired. The test for the out of court 
          immunity adopted by the majority of the House was whether the work was 
          so "intimately connected" with the conduct of the case in court as to 
          amount to a decision as to how it would be conducted at the hearing. 
          By this test, the barrister's conduct fell outside the immunity.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the immunity itself was not under 
          challenge in <i>Saif Ali v. Sydney Mitchell &amp; Co. </i>[1980] A.C. 198, 
          Lord Diplock considered that the need to delimit its scope required 
          a reconsideration of its rationale. He was unimpressed by the divided 
          loyalty argument which had been in the forefront of the reasoning in 
          <i>Rondel v. Worsley</i> [1969] 1 A.C. 191. He thought no better of 
          the cab rank rule. But he considered that the analogy with witness immunity 
          and the collateral challenge argument were sufficient to justify a limited 
          immunity.</p>
        <i> 
        <p>8. A reconsideration</p>
        </i> 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cases now under appeal, the Court of 
          Appeal was of course bound by <i>Rondel v. Worsley</i> [1969] 1 A.C. 
          191 and <i>Saif Ali v. Sydney Mitchell &amp; Co. </i>[1980] A.C. 198. It 
          decided that in all three cases the alleged negligence of the solicitors 
          was not within the scope of the immunity as extended to out of court 
          work. Their advice was not intimately connected with the way in which 
          the case, if it had not settled, would have been conducted in court. 
          But before your Lordships, the respondent clients have made a root and 
          branch attack on the immunity. They say that it should be altogether 
          abolished. Over 30 years have passed since <i>Rondel v. Worsley</i> 
          [1969] 1 A.C. 191; public policy, as Lord Reid said at the time, is 
          not immutable, and there have been great changes in the law of negligence, 
          the functioning of the legal profession, the administration of justice 
          and public perceptions. They say that it is once again time to re-examine 
          the whole matter. My Lords, I agree. In reconsidering these questions, 
          I have been greatly assisted by a wealth of writing on the subject by 
          judges, practitioners and academics, in the United Kingdom and overseas. 
          I hope that I will not be thought ungrateful if do not encumber this 
          speech with citations. The question of what the public interest now 
          requires depends upon the strength of the arguments rather than the 
          weight of authority.</p>
        <i> 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. The principle of equal treatment</p>
        </i> 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, my point of departure is that in 
          general English law provides a remedy in damages for a person who has 
          suffered injury as a result of professional negligence. The landmark 
          cases by which this principle was developed are <i>Hedley Byrne &amp; Co. 
          Ltd. v. Heller &amp; Partners Ltd.</i> [1964] A.C. 465, to which I have 
          already referred, and <i>Henderson v. Merrett Syndicates Ltd.</i> [1995] 
          2 A.C. 145. It follows that any exception which denies such a remedy 
          requires a sound justification. Otherwise your Lordships would fail 
          to observe the fundamental principle of justice which requires that 
          people should be treated equally and like cases treated alike.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In considering whether such a justification 
          still exists, your Lordships cannot ignore the fact that you are yourselves 
          members of the legal profession. Members of other professions, and the 
          public in general, are bound to view with some scepticism the claims 
          of lawyers that the public interest requires them to have a special 
          immunity from liability for negligence. If your Lordships are convinced 
          that there are compelling arguments for such an immunity, you should 
          not of course be deterred from saying so by fear of unfounded accusations 
          of collective self-interest. But those arguments need to be strong enough 
          to convince a fair-minded member of the public. They cannot be based 
          merely upon intuitions. This is a case in which what Professor Peter 
          Cane has described as an "empathy heuristic" will not do. (See <i>Oxford 
          Essays in Jurisprudence</i>, ed. J. Morder 4th series (2000) , p. 56, 
          footnote 35.)</p>
        <i> 
        <p>10. The divided loyalty argument analysed</p>
        </i> 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, there is apt to be a certain amount 
          of confusion about the exact nature of the divided loyalty argument. 
          There are two distinct versions in circulation but they are not always 
          recognised to be different.</p>
        <i> 
        <p>(a) Effect on behaviour of lawyers</p>
        </i> 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first argument is that the possibility 
          of being sued for negligence would actually inhibit the lawyer, consciously 
          or unconsciously, from giving his duty to the court priority to his 
          duty to his client, or, as Lord Diplock preferred to put it in <i>Saif 
          Ali v. Sydney Mitchell &amp; Co. </i>[1980] A.C. 198, 219H from observing 
          the rules. This argument involves a prediction about the way in which 
          the removal of the immunity would affect the way in which lawyers behave 
          in court. It claims that their behaviour would change in a way which 
          was contrary to the public interest in the administration of justice. 
          This was the argument advanced by Mr. Sumption to your Lordships on 
          behalf of the defendant solicitors. He said that if there was no immunity, 
          lawyers would in marginal cases prefer the interests of their clients 
          to the interests of justice. It is an argument which in view of the 
          eminence of its proponents in <i>Rondel v. Worsley </i>[1969] 1 A.C. 
          191 and elsewhere must be taken seriously I shall in due course return 
          to it.</p>
        <i> 
        <p>(b) A difficult art</p>
        </i> 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second version of the argument is that 
          the divided loyalty is a special factor that makes the conduct of litigation 
          a very difficult art. It is easy to commit what appear in retrospect 
          to have been errors of judgment. Even if there is no real danger that 
          a court would hold such errors to have been negligent, the advocate 
          would be exposed to vexatious claims by difficult clients. The argument 
          is pressed most strongly in connection with advocacy in criminal proceedings, 
          where the clients are said to be more than usually likely to be vexatious. 
          Your Lordships will observe that this version of the argument does not 
          depend upon the proposition that lawyers will be deterred from observing 
          the rules or their duty to the court. It is advanced as a good argument 
          even if your Lordships think that there are no sufficient grounds for 
          the prediction which Mr. Sumption invites you to make. It is rather 
          an argument that the imposition of liability would be unfair. The efforts 
          of lawyers in good faith to comply with their public duties should not 
          leave them open to vexatious claims by dissatisfied clients. This is 
          the argument which my noble and learned friend Lord Hutton calls the 
          "second strand" of the divided loyalty argument. As he puts it, "it 
          is not right that a person performing an important public duty by taking 
          part in a [criminal] trial should be vexed by an unmeritorious action 
          . . . ." I shall deal with this argument, which I propose to call the 
          "vexation argument," before returning to the one advanced by Mr. Sumption.</p>
        <i> 
        <p>11. The vexation argument</p>
        </i> 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, I do not think that the vexation 
          argument, taken by itself, has any validity. It is true that the conduct 
          of litigation is a difficult art and that one of the reasons why it 
          sometimes requires delicate judgment is the advocate's duty to the court. 
          But there are many professional activities which require delicate judgment 
          and advocacy is not the only one which may involve a divided loyalty. 
          The doctor, for example, owes a duty to the individual patient. But 
          he also owes a duty to his other patients which may prevent him from 
          giving one patient the treatment or resources he would ideally prefer. 
          We do not say that they should have immunity merely because they do 
          a difficult job in which it is easy to make a bona fide error of judgment. 
          And although the criminal advocate is engaged in an activity of great 
          public importance, I do not think it would be right to claim that he 
          is in this respect unique among professional men. The fact is that the 
          advocate, like other professional men, undertakes a duty to his client 
          to conduct his case, subject to the rules and ethics of his profession, 
          with proper skill and care. No other participant in the trial undertakes 
          such a duty. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is some overlap between the vexatious 
          claims argument and the witness analogy, to which I shall come in due 
          course. Essentially it depends upon the same reasoning as Fry L.J. used 
          in the famous passage in <i>Munster v. Lamb</i> (1883) 11 Q.B.D. 588, 
          607 in defence of the absolute privilege of witnesses giving evidence 
          in court:</p>
        <p>
        </p><ul>
          "It is not a desire to prevent actions from being brought in cases where 
          they ought to be maintained that has led to the adoption of the present 
          rule of law; but it is the fear that if the rule were otherwise, numerous 
          actions would be brought against persons who were merely discharging 
          their duty. It must always be borne in mind that it is not intended 
          to protect malicious and untruthful persons, but that it is intended 
          to protect persons acting bonâ fide, who under a different rule 
          would be liable, not perhaps to verdicts and judgments against them, 
          but to the vexation of defending actions." 
          <p></p>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this argument depends upon the assumption 
          that there is a powerful public interest which makes this degree of 
          protection necessary. In the case of witnesses, it is the assumption 
          that they would otherwise be less willing to come forward and tell the 
          truth in court. In other words, that their behaviour would be affected 
          in a particular way which was contrary to the interests of the administration 
          of justice. It is not simply the general proposition that people doing 
          their best in a difficult job should not be exposed to vexatious claims. 
          This argument could apply to many people besides lawyers. So in my opinion 
          it is only the first version of the divided loyalty argument which can 
          have any prospect of success. The second is in principle misconceived.</p>
