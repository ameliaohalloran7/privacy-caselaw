<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;64.&nbsp;&nbsp;That brings me to the fourth question.  Everything I have said in regard to the previous three questions has been on the footing that only a single injurious agent was involved (and as at present advised I would regard different types of asbestos as constituting a single agent).  If, however, the case were not one of an eventual outcome produced by a single agent but of an outcome that might have been produced by one of a number of different agents and where the guilty agent could not be identified eg cases like<i> Wilsher v Essex Area Health Authority</i> [1988]  AC 1074 or <i>Hotson v East Berkshire Area Health Authority</i> [1987]  AC 750, I would not regard the <i>Fairchild</i> principle as applicable.  <i>Fairchild </i>did not establish an overarching principle.  It established a narrow exception to the causation requirements applicable to single agent cases.  I would not extend the exception to cover multi-agent cases as well.  One reason why I would not do so is that the identification of the proportion of risk of the eventual outcome attributable to each particular agent would, to my mind, be well nigh impossible and highly artificial.  At least in the asbestos cases it is known that asbestos was responsible for the eventual outcome and that the negligent defendants are to be held liable for subjecting the victim to a risk that has materialised.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;65.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, for these reasons and in agreement with those of Lord Hoffmann, deal with these appeals in the manner he has suggested in paragraph 49 of his opinion.</p>

LORD RODGER OF EARLSFERRY

<p>My Lords,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66.&nbsp;&nbsp;In these appeals the House is called on to decide two issues arising out of <i>Fairchild v Glenhaven Funerals Ltd </i>[2003] 1 AC 32.  As argued at the hearing, the first relates to the prerequisites for the application of the exceptional rule on causation enunciated in that decision ("the <i>Fairchild </i>exception"), while the second, and by far the more important, relates to the nature of a defendant's liability where the exception applies.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;67.&nbsp;&nbsp;As my noble and learned friend, Lord Hoffmann, pointed out early in the hearing, the answer to the first issue may well depend, in part at least, on the answer to the second.  This is because, in <i>Fairchild</i>, when deciding whether or not to adopt an exceptional approach to causation modelled on <i>McGhee v National Coal Board </i>[1973] 1 WLR 1, the House was concerned to weigh the potential injustices of either course to the defendants and plaintiffs respectively.  The House held that, in the circumstances of that case, there would be greater injustice in sticking to the usual test and giving no remedy to the plaintiffs than in applying the exceptional rule and holding the defendants liable.  Counsel for the <i>Fairchild </i>defendants did not dispute that, if they were found liable on that basis, their liability would be joint and several (in solidum).  In the present case, however, the second issue is whether that is correct or whether, rather, the defendants should be held severally liable to the claimants in proportion to their responsibility for creating the risk to the victims.  In order to be in a position to consider the potential injustices to the parties in applying the <i>Fairchild</i> exception to a new situation, the court must know the nature of the defendants' liability where the exception applies.  I therefore begin with the issue of the apportionment of liability.</p>

<i><p>Apportionment of Liability</p>

</i>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;68.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Hoffmann describes the issue as being whether the damage caused by a defendant in a <i>Fairchild </i>case is the creation of a risk that the claimant will contract the disease so that each defendant will be liable only for his aliquot contribution to that total risk which has materialised.  But, at the hearing, Mr Stuart-Smith QC, on behalf of Corus UK Ltd ("Corus") was at very considerable pains to say that he was <i>not</i> advancing an argument along those lines.  On the contrary, he accepted that in a <i>Fairchild </i>case the defendant was liable for causing the mesothelioma, not for causing the risk of developing mesothelioma:  the damage was the mesothelioma, not the risk of developing mesothelioma.  He eschewed any suggestion that the "gist" of the tort was creating the risk of harm rather than causing harm to the victim.  The approach now adopted by your Lordships is, accordingly, not one advocated by the appellants.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;69.&nbsp;&nbsp;Counsel simply argued that, since the House had adjusted the law of causation to allow for difficulties of proof in this type of situation, equally it should be prepared to make a corresponding adjustment by dividing up the liability for the victim's death among the defendants.  Leaving other objections aside for the moment, counsel's approach runs into an immovable roadblock.  By any reckoning, death brought on by mesothelioma is indivisible, indeed the classically indivisible injury.  Viscount Dunedin once said scornfully of a hypothetical case where two dogs had worried a sheep to death, "Would we then have to hold that each dog had half killed the sheep…?":  <i>Arneil v Paterson </i>[1931] AC 560, 565.  It is similarly unthinkable that the law would hold that, vis à vis the claimant, defendant A one-fifth killed the victim of mesothelioma, defendant B one-quarter killed him, defendant C forty per cent killed him and so forth.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Hoffmann acknowledges that this objection would be unanswerable if in <i>Fairchild </i>the House had proceeded upon "the fiction" that a defendant who had created a material risk of mesothelioma was deemed to have caused or materially contributed to the contraction of the disease.  But, on his analysis, the majority of the House proceeded on the simple basis that the creation of a material risk of mesothelioma was sufficient for liability.  Hence the damage which the defendant should be regarded as having caused is the creation of such a risk or chance.  Since chances are infinitely divisible, the roadblock of the indivisibility of death is removed and the way lies open to attributing liability according to the relative degree of any defendant's contribution to the chance of the disease being contracted.  All that remains is for the first instance judges to redetermine the damages by reference to the share of the risk attributable to the breaches of duty by the relevant defendants.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;71.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, I accept, of course, that the problem in <i>Fairchild </i>can be analysed as Lord Hoffmann now proposes and, indeed, had already suggested in <i>Gregg v Scott </i>[2005] 2 AC 176.  But that is quite different from saying that the House actually chose to analyse it in that way.  By adopting the proposed analysis your Lordships are not so much reinterpreting as rewriting the key decisions in <i>McGhee </i>[1973] 1 WLR 1 and <i>Fairchild</i> [2003] 1 AC 32.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72.&nbsp;&nbsp;To see what these cases actually decided, it is first necessary to go back for a moment to <i>Bonnington Castings Ltd v Wardlaw</i> [1956] AC 613.  I need not repeat the analysis which I made of this decision in <i>Fairchild</i>, [2003] 1 AC 32, 98-100, paras 127-129.<i> </i> Lord Reid held that the pursuer, who had been exposed to dust from two sources (one being "innocent"), did not require to prove that his pneumoconiosis had been caused solely by the dust which the defenders had negligently failed to intercept when it came from the swing grinders.  His Lordship said, [1956] AC 613, 621:</p>

<p></p><ul>"It appears to me that the source of his disease was the dust from both sources, and the real question is whether the dust from the swing grinders materially contributed to the disease.  What is a material contribution must be a question of degree.  A contribution which comes within the exception de minimis non curat lex is not material, but I think that any contribution which does not fall within that exception must be material.  I do not see how there can be something too large to come within the de minimis principle but yet too small to be material."<p></p></ul>

<i></i><p><i>Bonnington Castings </i>soon became established as the classic authority for the proposition that, to succeed and recover damages in full against any defendant, a plaintiff need prove no more than that the defendant's wrongful act  materially contributed to his injury.  Since anything above de minimis will do, this means that a claimant can succeed even though the injury would have occurred without the defendant's act.  The "but for" or sine qua non test of causation gives way to this considerably more generous test based on the defendant's material contribution to the victim's injury.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73.&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision in <i>Bonnington Castings </i>was invoked in <i>McGhee v National Coal Board </i>[1973] 1 WLR 1.  The pursuer had developed dermatitis as a result of exposure to brick dust in a kiln in the course of his work with the defenders.  At the end of his shift he could not wash thoroughly and had to cycle home with dust on his skin because the Board had not provided showers.  The Lord Ordinary rejected the allegations that the exposure to dust in the kilns had been delictual, but accepted that the defenders had been at fault in failing to provide showers.  In that situation it was impossible for medical science to tell whether the dermatitis had been caused by the effects of the initial lawful exposure rather than by the effects of the dust operating on the pursuer's skin during the period when, because of the Board's failure to provide showers, he had to cycle home without first being able to wash thoroughly.  The medical evidence showed, however, that the longer the pursuer's skin was exposed to injury by abrasion by the dust, the greater was his chance of developing dermatitis.  The House held that, since the failure to provide the showers had materially increased the risk of the pursuer developing dermatitis, the Board was liable.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr McGhee succeeded on his common law case.  In terms of his averments on record he had offered to prove that his "dermatitis was caused by the fault and negligence of the defenders" and his first plea-in-law, in standard form, was that, "having sustained loss, injury and damage through the fault and negligence of the defenders, as condescended upon, [the pursuer] is entitled to reparation therefor."  There was no mention of the pursuer suffering damage in the form of a risk that he would develop dermatitis.  His pleadings remained unamended when the House allowed his appeal and found the Board liable.  It follows that the defenders can have been found liable only on the basis that Mr McGhee had proved that <i>his dermatitis </i>had been caused by their fault and negligence.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed what Lord Reid held when, invoking the approach in <i>Bonnington Castings</i>, he said, [1973] 1 WLR 1, 5B:  "From a broad and practical viewpoint I can see no substantial difference between saying that what the defender did materially increased the risk of injury to the pursuer and saying that what the defender did made a material contribution to his injury."  Similarly, Lord Simon of Glaisdale said, at p 8E, that in his view "a failure to take steps which would bring about a material reduction of the risk involves, in this type of case, a substantial contribution to the injury."  Lord Salmon too proceeded, at pp 11H-12A, on the basis that "In the circumstances of the present case it seems to me unrealistic and contrary to ordinary common sense to hold that the negligence which materially increased the risk of injury did not materially contribute to causing the injury."  He concluded, at pp 12H-13A:</p>

<p></p><ul>"In the circumstances of the present case, the possibility of a distinction existing between (a) having materially increased the risk of contracting the disease, and (b) having materially contributed to causing the disease may no doubt be a fruitful source of interesting academic discussions between students of philosophy.  Such a distinction is, however, far too unreal to be recognised by the common law."<p></p></ul>

<p>In <i>Fairchild</i>, [2003] 1 AC 32, 55F, para 21, Lord Bingham of Cornhill summarised the position by saying that Lord Reid, Lord Simon and Lord Salmon had expressly held that "in the circumstances no distinction was to be drawn between making a material contribution to causing the disease and materially increasing the risk of the pursuer contracting it."</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Wilberforce, [1973] 1 WLR 1, 7E-F, wrapped up his conclusion in less distinct language, but nevertheless seems to be describing a similar approach:</p>

<p></p><ul>"But I find in the cases quoted an analogy which suggests the conclusion that, in the absence of proof that the culpable addition had, in the result, no effect, the employers should be liable for an injury, squarely within the risk which they created and that they, not the pursuer, should suffer the consequence of the impossibility, foreseeably inherent in the nature of his injury, of segregating the precise consequence of their default."<p></p></ul>

<p>By "the cases quoted" Lord Wilberforce must have been referring to <i>Bonnington Castings Ltd  v Wardlaw </i>[1956] AC 613, <i>Nicholson v Atlas Steel Foundry and Engineering Co Ltd </i>[1957] 1 WLR 613 and <i>Gardiner v Motherwell Machinery and Scrap Co Ltd </i>[1961] 1 WLR 1424.  In all of them the pursuer was held to have proved that the wrongful act of the defenders in exposing him to conditions liable to injure him had materially contributed to his injuries and so had "caused" them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77.&nbsp;&nbsp;The radical step which this House took in <i>McGhee </i>was accordingly to hold that, in the particular circumstances, by proving that the defenders had materially increased the risk of injury, the pursuer had proved that they had materially contributed to his injury.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Fairchild</i>, [2003] 1 AC 32, 75H, para 65,<i> </i>Lord Hoffmann commented on the approach of the members of the House in <i>McGhee</i>:</p>

<p></p><ul>"So when some members of the House said that in the circumstances there was no distinction between materially increasing the risk of disease and materially contributing to the disease, what I think they meant was that, in the particular circumstances, a breach of duty which materially increased the risk should be treated <i>as if </i>it had materially contributed to the disease.  I would respectfully prefer not to resort to legal fictions and to say that the House treated a material increase in risk as sufficient in the circumstances to satisfy the causal requirements for liability."<p></p></ul>

<p>The passage begins by acknowledging that in <i>McGhee </i>the members of the House did actually say that in the circumstances there was no distinction between materially increasing the risk of disease and materially contributing to the disease.  Lord Hoffmann then goes on to explain that, in his view, their Lordships meant that in those circumstances a breach of duty which materially increased the risk should be treated <i>as if </i>it had materially contributed to the disease.  I see no reason to quarrel with that.  He then respectfully declines to resort to legal fictions, preferring to say that the House treated a material increase in risk as sufficient in the circumstances to satisfy the causal requirements for liability.  This is more difficult if it means resorting to a fiction that the members of the House did not link proof that the defenders had materially increased the risk of injury to the pursuer with proof that the defenders had materially contributed to his injury.  I would respectfully prefer not to resort to such legal fictions but to recognise what their Lordships actually said and did in <i>McGhee</i> [1973] 1 WLR 1.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before looking at the speeches in <i>Fairchild</i>, it is likewise worth recalling what the three plaintiffs had to prove.  In two of the cases the victims of mesothelioma were dead and the actions were brought by their widows under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976.  In terms of section 1(1) defendants are liable to widows "if death is caused by any wrongful act, neglect or default which is such as would (if death had not ensued) have entitled the person injured to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof…."  Therefore, Mrs Fairchild and Mrs Fox had to prove that their husbands' deaths had been caused by the defendants' wrongful act towards their husbands.  In her statement of claim Mrs Fox, for example, began her Particulars of Injury by saying that the deceased suffered a malignant mesothelioma of the pleura and she ended them by referring to his lingering and exquisitely painful death.  Similarly, Mr Matthews gave as the Particulars of Injury:  "Malignant mesothelioma".  His claim was brought at common law rather than under statute, but he too set out to prove that his mesothelioma had been caused by the defendants' wrongful act.  In each case, proving that the defendants' wrongful act had materially contributed to the victims developing mesothelioma would have been sufficient, of course.  In none of the cases did the plaintiff claim damages for the creation of a risk or chance that the victim would develop mesothelioma.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Hoffmann suggests that in <i>Fairchild</i> the majority did not proceed on the basis that a defendant who had created a material risk of mesothelioma was deemed to have caused or materially contributed to the contraction of the disease.  That may well be true of his own speech, given the interpretation which he had sought to place on the speeches in <i>McGhee</i>.  In my view, however, it is not true of the speech of Lord Bingham who referred to six conditions and said, [2003] 1 AC 32, 68B, para 34:</p>

<p></p><ul>"Where those conditions are satisfied, it seems to me just and in accordance with common sense to treat the conduct of A and B in exposing C to a risk to which he should not have been exposed as making a material contribution to the contracting by C of a condition against which it was the duty of A and B to protect him."<p></p></ul>

<p>That is an exact transposition of the reasoning of Lord Reid to the circumstances of <i>Fairchild.  </i>And Lord Bingham is indeed saying that in these circumstances someone who exposes the victim to a risk to which he should not have been exposed is to be treated as making a material contribution to the victim's contraction of the condition against which it was his duty to protect him.  It was on this basis that Lord Bingham concluded that the appeals should be allowed - because the plaintiffs had proved that the defendants had caused the men's death or injury.  This is scarcely surprising since the plaintiffs' appeals were argued on exactly that basis.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead puts the point somewhat differently, at p 70B-C, para 42:</p>

<p></p><ul>"So long as it was not insignificant, each employer's wrongful exposure of its employee to asbestos dust, and, hence, to the risk of contracting mesothelioma, should be regarded by the law as a sufficient degree of causal connection.  This is sufficient to justify requiring the employer to assume responsibility for causing or materially contributing to the onset of the mesothelioma when, in the present state of medical knowledge, no more exact causal connection is ever capable of being established."<p></p></ul>

<p>For Lord Nicholls, proof that an employer wrongfully exposed his employee to the risk of contracting mesothelioma should be regarded as a sufficient degree of causal connexion to justify requiring the employer to assume responsibility for causing or materially contributing to the onset of mesothelioma.  He does not go on to adopt the formula of equating materially contributing to the risk of the illness with materially contributing to the contraction of the illness.  On the other hand, there is nothing to suggest that he considered that the damage which the defendants should be regarded as having caused was the creation of a risk that the victim would develop mesothelioma.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Hutton adopted an entirely traditional analysis, but felt able to infer, as a matter of fact, that the defendants had materially contributed to the victims' mesothelioma.  For my own part, in the passage from para 168 of my speech which Lord Hoffmann quotes, I was doing nothing more than applying the approach in <i>McGhee </i>and, quite openly, making the connexion between proof that the defendants had increased the risk of the victims developing mesothelioma and proof that the defendants had materially contributed to their illness.  Naïvely - as your Lordships' speeches must now convince me - I had thought that, whether under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 or at common law, this was a necessary step in the chain of reasoning if the appeals were to be allowed on the basis of <i>McGhee</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83.&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the terms of Lord Bingham's speech, with which I agreed, and given the terms of my own speech, it respectfully appears to me to be impossible to say that in <i>Fairchild</i> the majority of the House decided the case simply on the basis that the creation of a material risk of mesothelioma "would suffice" for liability.  That is to ignore the further stage in the reasoning - derived fair and square from the reasoning of the majority in <i>McGhee </i>- that in cases of this kind there is, in Lord Bingham's words, at p 55F-G, para 21, "no distinction" between making a material contribution to causing the disease and materially increasing the risk of the victim contracting it.  When that stage was included, by proving that the defendants had materially increased the risk of the victim contracting mesothelioma, the plaintiffs had proved that the defendants had made a material contribution to causing the disease and were accordingly liable for causing it.  Reading the speeches as though they were saying something different is unlikely to make an already difficult topic any easier.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84.&nbsp;&nbsp;In para 36 of his speech today Lord Hoffmann says:</p>

<p></p><ul>"consistency of approach would suggest that if the basis of liability is the wrongful creation of a risk or chance of causing the disease, the damage which the defendant should be regarded as having caused is the creation of such a risk or chance."<p></p></ul>

<p>That may well be so if the dominant aim is to secure internal consistency between the basis of liability and the nature of the damage.  But the reasoning in <i>McGhee </i>[1973] 1 WLR 1 and <i>Fairchild </i>[2003] 1 AC 32 indicates that the House was primarily concerned to maintain a consistency of approach with the main body of law on personal injuries.  Under that law victims recover damages because the defendants' wrongful act has materially contributed to them becoming ill, not because it has created a risk that they will become ill.  By reasoning as they did, the members of the House minimised the disruption to this long-settled aspect of the law.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85.&nbsp;&nbsp;The new analysis which the House is adopting will tend to maximise the inconsistencies in the law by turning the <i>Fairchild </i>exception into an enclave where a number of rules apply which have been rejected for use elsewhere in the law of personal injuries.  Inside the enclave victims recover damages for suffering the increased risk of developing mesothelioma (or suffering the loss of a chance of not developing mesothelioma) while, just outside, patients cannot recover damages for suffering the increased risk of an unfavourable outcome to medical treatment (or suffering the loss of a chance of a favourable outcome to medical treatment).  On the other hand, if such a claim had been recognised outside the enclave, the patient would have been entitled to recover damages for the increased likelihood that he would suffer a premature death, whereas inside the enclave a victim who suffers an increased risk of developing mesothelioma cannot recover damages unless he actually develops it.  Inside the enclave claimants whose husbands die of mesothelioma receive only, say, 60% of their damages if the court considers that there is a 60% chance that the defendant caused the death and no other wrongdoer is solvent or insured.  Outside the enclave, claimants whose husbands are killed in an accident for which the only solvent defendant is, say, 5% to blame recover the whole of their damages from that defendant.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86.&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, then, is the House spontaneously embarking upon this adventure of redefining the nature of the damage suffered by the victims?  The majority are not just on a mission to tidy up the reasoning in <i>McGhee</i> and <i>Fairchild.  </i>Their aim is to open the way to making each defendant severally liable for a share of the damages, rather than liable in solidum for the whole of the damages.  This is said to be a preferable, fairer, solution when the defendants are found liable for creating the risk of illness rather than for causing it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87.&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, as a matter of legal logic, it would be open to the House to hold that since on the reasoning in <i>McGhee </i>and <i>Fairchild</i> the defendants are ultimately held liable for materially contributing to the victims' mesothelioma, they should be held liable in solidum like any other concurrent tortfeasors whose separate wrongful acts combine to produce indivisible harm.  That was indeed one of the main submissions for the claimants - and I would accept it.  Mr Stuart-Smith countered by arguing that, since the <i>Fairchild </i>exception involved adjusting the rules on causation, so equally the House should be prepared to adjust the rules on liability and apportion it among the defendants.  That would be a powerful argument indeed if there were actually any logical or otherwise compelling connexion between the <i>Fairchild </i>exception and the introduction of several liablity which the defendants seek.  In truth, there is not.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88.&nbsp;&nbsp;So long as all the defendants and possible defendants are solvent or insured, the application of liability in solidum causes them no problems and makes life simple for the claimant.  A defendant or insurer who pays the claimant's damages can recover the appropriate contribution from the other defendants and their insurers under the Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978.  In asbestosis cases insurers have been operating such a system among themselves for decades, with contributions being based on the plaintiff or pursuer's periods of work with various employers.  And, following the judgment of the House in <i>Fairchild </i>which, in the absence of argument, provided for joint and several liability, insurers introduced a somewhat similar scheme for mesothelioma cases in England and Wales in their <i>Guidelines for Apportioning and Handling Employers' Liability Mesothelioma Claims</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89.&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Gore QC rightly emphasised on behalf of Mr Patterson, the real reason why the defendants want to get rid of liability in solidum is that quite a number of the potential defendants and their insurers in the field of mesothelioma claims are insolvent.  So, if held liable in solidum, solvent defendants or, more particularly, their insurers will often find that they have to pay the whole of the claimant's damages without in fact being able to obtain a contribution from the other wrongdoers or their insurers, if any.  So their only hope of minimising the amount they have to pay out by way of damages is to have liability to the claimant apportioned among the wrongdoers.  Therefore they are asking for the introduction of apportionment because of this entirely contingent aspect of the situation regarding mesothelioma claims.  If <i>Fairchild</i>-exception claims had first arisen in an area where the wrongdoers and their insurers were in good financial heart, matters could have been resolved satisfactorily for all concerned on the basis of liability in solidum and the use of the Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978.</p>
