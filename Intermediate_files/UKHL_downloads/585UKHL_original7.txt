<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is more to it than causation.  The disallowance of the shareholder's claim in respect of reflective loss is driven by policy considerations.  In my opinion, these preclude the shareholder from going behind the settlement of the company's claim.  If he were allowed to do so then, if the company's action were brought by its directors, they would be placed in a position where their interest conflicted with their duty; while if it were brought by the liquidator, it would make it difficult for him to settle the action and would effectively take the conduct of the litigation out of his hands.  The present case is a fortiori; Mr. Johnson cannot be permitted to challenge in one capacity the adequacy of the terms he agreed in another.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflective loss extends beyond the diminution of the value of the shares; it extends to the loss of dividends (specifically mentioned in <i>Prudential</i>) and all other payments which the shareholder might have obtained from the company if it had not been deprived of its funds.  All transactions or putative transactions between the company and its shareholders must be disregarded.  Payment to the one diminishes the assets of the other.  In economic terms, the shareholder has two pockets, and cannot hold the defendant liable for his inability to transfer money from one pocket to the other.  In principle, the company and the shareholder cannot together recover more than the shareholder would have recovered if he had carried on business in his own name instead of through the medium of a company.  On the other hand, he is entitled (subject to the rules on remoteness of damage) to recover in respect of a loss which he has sustained by reason of his inability to have recourse to the company's funds and which the company would not have sustained itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same applies to other payments which the company would have made if it had had the necessary funds even if the plaintiff would have received them qua employee and not qua shareholder and even if he would have had a legal claim to be paid.  His loss is still an indirect and reflective loss which is included in the company's claim.  The plaintiff's primary claim lies against the company, and the existence of the liability does not increase the total recoverable by the company, for this already includes the amount necessary to enable the company to meet it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the assumption which we are bound to make for the purpose of this appeal, which is that the firm was in breach of a duty of care owed to Mr. Johnson personally, he is in principle entitled to recover damages in respect of all heads of non-reflective consequential loss which are not too remote.  Mr. Johnson's principal complaint is that the firm negligently failed to exercise the Company's option in a manner which would be incontestable.  Even if this constituted the breach of a duty owed to Mr. Johnson personally as well as to the Company, there was a single breach which made it impossible for the Company to establish that it had exercised the option without litigation.  In the event this delayed by four years the commencement of the development by the Company and the time when the Company could raise money at normal commercial rates of interest on the security of the land and commence the proposed development.  Damages in respect of these heads of damage are recoverable by the Company, and insofar as they are reflected in the diminution in the value of Mr. Johnson's shares in the Company are not recoverable by him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a subsidiary complaint, that the firm represented both to the Company and to Mr. Johnson personally that the Chancery proceedings were certain of success and that judgment would be obtained within a relatively short time.  These are separate representations which may be separately sued upon by each representee.  Insofar as Mr. Johnson relied upon the representation made to him and suffered a separate and distinct loss qua representee and not merely qua shareholder or potential recipient of money from the Company, he is entitled to recover.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Bingham of Cornhill has identified the various heads of financial loss alleged in the Statement of Claim.  I agree with his analysis and do not wish to add anything except in relation to Mr. Johnson's pension.  Mr. Johnson claims that, but for its lack of funds resulting from the firm's failure to exercise the option properly, the Company would have continued to make contributions to Mr. Johnson's pension scheme.  For the reasons I have endeavoured to state, Mr. Johnson cannot recover the amount of the contributions which the Company would have made if it had had the necessary funds; this merely reflects the Company's loss and is included in its own claim.  Nor can Mr. Johnson claim interest in respect of the lost contributions for the same reason.  But Mr. Johnson's claim in respect of the enhancement of his pension is a different matter.  The problem here is one of remoteness of damage, not reflective loss, for the loss (or strictly the net loss) is one which the Company could not have sustained itself.  Had Mr. Johnson carried on business in his own name instead of through the medium of the Company, then (subject only to the question of remoteness) he would have been entitled to recover a sum representing the lost increase in the value of his pension after giving credit for the amount saved in respect of the contributions and interest.  Such loss is separate and distinct from the loss suffered by the Company, and while Mr. Johnson's claim to recover it faces obvious difficulties it should not be struck out at this stage.  But if he does establish his claim, he will have to give credit for the contributions which would have been required, whether by the Company (reflective loss) or himself (which he has saved) together with interest thereon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reasons given by Lord Bingham of Cornhill, I too would strike out Mr. Johnson's claims to damages for mental distress and anxiety and aggravated damages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, I would dismiss the cross-appeal while varying the order of the Court of Appeal in the manner proposed.</p>
