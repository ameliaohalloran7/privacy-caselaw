<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97.&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 4.34(5) of the Report provides further confirmation of the intended breadth of section 9(3)(c) in this regard. In relation to the transfer without committal procedure which it recommended, the Report said that:</p>
<p></p><ul>"A defendant should be able to apply to the nominated judge for a preparatory hearing in open court at which he would have the right to make an application for discharge on the ground that the prosecution's evidence fails to disclose a <i>prima facie </i>case."<p></p></ul>
<p>The 1987 Act gave effect to this in section 6(1) and 9(3)(a), which as originally enacted read as follows:</p>
<p></p><ul>"6(1) Where notice of transfer has been given, the person charged may at any time before he is arraigned apply orally or in writing to the Crown Court for the charge to be dismissed on the ground that the evidence which has been disclosed would not be sufficient for a jury properly to convict him of it". <p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>9(1) At the preparatory hearing the judge may exercise any of the powers specified in this section.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(2) The judge may adjourn a preparatory hearing from time to time.<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(3) He may determine-<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;an application under section 6 above;<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;any question as to the admissibility of evidence; and<p></p></ul>
<p></p><ul>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;any other question of law relating to the case."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;98.&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows that, although it was incumbent on a defendant to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support a charge transferred to the Crown Court <i>before </i>arraignment, the 1987 Act envisaged that the actual hearing of any such challenge would or could, as the Roskill Report had contemplated, take place <i>during</i> a preparatory hearing. It may be that the inter-relationship of sections 6 and 9 was not sufficiently thought through, and left unclear the position if the judge did not order a preparatory hearing. That may explain their subsequent amendment and replacement by the 1988 Act by a new section 6 simply enabling a defendant to apply before arraignment and to obtain the judge's ruling on any such challenge without more. But it remains true that, if the preparatory hearing was treated as the appropriate occasion to determine a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence in respect of a transferred count, it can hardly have been regarded as an inappropriate occasion for a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support charges which were before the court on a basis other than transfer (cf <i>Hedworth</i>), or for any other challenge going to the validity of the indictment or of the whole proceedings (cf <i>Moore</i>, <i>W</i> and <i>Van Hoogstraaten</i>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have concluded in paragraph 92 above, that, once a preparatory hearing has validly been ordered, the power to make rulings under section 9 is on any view exercisable whenever the judge reasonably considers that it would also serve a useful trial purpose within one of the heads in section 7(1) to make such a ruling.  In the light of paragraphs 94 to 98 above, I would further hold that the power under section 9 enables the judge, if he so decides, to determine, as part of the preparatory hearing and to the extent that it involves the determination of "any question of law relating to the case" any other application, whether or not it might be aimed at precluding or terminating trial entirely or on any particular count, including therefore any challenge going to the validity of all or part of the proceedings or indictment as well as any application seeking to sever counts (covered in any event with effect from 4th April 2005 by the amendment made by the 2003 Act), or to put the prosecution to election between counts. </p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Disclosure</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this appeal it is the area of disclosure that is critical and gives rise to difficulty. The 1987 Act makes no express reference to disclosure. The Roskill Report had barely mentioned the subject. At paragraph 6.43 the Report identified as part of the "large amount of work" to be done before the first preparatory hearing, the submission by the prosecution to the defence of "copies of any witness statements and documentary exhibits intended to be used at the trial, not already served on them" and in a footnote added "In accordance with the guidelines issued by the Attorney General (in December 1981) on the disclosure of certain categories of information to the defence ….". The Attorney General's Guidelines in fact went further and covered unused material as well as witness statements and exhibits, but the text and footnote in the Roskill Report indicate that disclosure was primarily a matter to be resolved prior to any preparatory hearing. Elsewhere, in paragraphs 6.55, 6.58 and 6.61, the Report referred to the prosecution statement which it recommended that the judge should be able to order as a "part of the process of disclosure of the evidence which the prosecution proposes to call" and as perfecting "the prosecution's obligation of disclosure of the evidence". The Report's summary of procedural steps in paragraph 6.104 included under the heading "Before the first preparatory hearing": "(4) Service by prosecution of any remaining witness statements and documentary exhibits on the court and the defence", and under the heading "At the first preparatory hearing": "(15) Judge to ensure that all the above steps have been carried out, where appropriate, and, in any case where they have not, to give the necessary orders and directions to the parties. (16) Points of law going to the root of the case or relating to the admissibility of evidence intended to be raised at the trial should be dealt with." Disclosure, to the very limited extent that the Report addressed it, thus appears to have been a process of disclosure of evidence and exhibits which the Report envisaged would be completed before the preparatory hearing or, if not, made the subject of a direction under a provision along the lines of section 9(4) of the 1987 Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101.&nbsp;&nbsp;The House has in reality now to consider whether and how far the language of the 1987 Act covers issues of disclosure which, largely it appears, did not exist and were not positively in mind at the time of its enactment. Lord Wilberforce stated the relevant principle in <i>Royal College of Nursing v. D.H.S.S. </i>[1981] AC 800, 822B-C:</p>
<p></p><ul>"….. when a new state of affairs, or a fresh set of facts bearing on policy, comes into existence, the courts have to consider whether they fall within the Parliamentary intention. They may be held to do so, … if there can be detected a clear purpose in the legislation which can only be fulfilled if the extension is made. How liberally these principles may be applied must depend upon the nature of the enactment, and the strictness or otherwise of the words in which it has been expressed."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;102.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>H </i>(see paragraph 89 above) the House summarised the history of the law and practice relating to disclosure. This and earlier summaries by Steyn LJ in the Court of Appeal and the House in <i>Brown (Winston) </i>[1994] 1 WLR 1599; [1998] AC 367 show the climate change in the area since 1987. Prior to <i>Ward</i> in June 1992, <i>Keane </i>[1994] 1 WLR 746 and <i>Brown (Winston)</i>, issues relating to disclosure were far less prominent and common than they have since become.<i> </i>The disclosure contemplated by the Attorney General's December 1981 Guidelines fell to be made at an early stage, before or at or as soon as possible after committal. In three cases in the 1980s and early 1990s, when it became apparent during or after trial that full disclosure had not been made, the failure was treated as a "material irregularity in the course of the trial" giving grounds for an appeal under the terms of section 2(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 which at that time governed criminal appeals. This approach was affirmed in <i>Maguire </i>[1992] 1 QB 936, 956A to 957F. The rationale was that the duty to disclose was a continuous duty, arising pre-trial and continuing throughout the trial: see also <i>Ward </i>[1993] 1 WLR 619, 674B-C. However, there was limited scope for challenges to any disclosure made. Under the Attorney General's Guidelines decisions on disclosure were left to the judgment of the prosecution and prosecuting counsel. <i>Ward </i>marked in this respect a watershed: see <i>Davis</i> [1993] 1 WLR 613, per Lord Taylor LCJ at p.615G-H and <i>Brown (Winston)</i> per Steyn LJ at p.1605D-H, where he said inter alia:</p>
<p></p><ul>"…. today the guidelines do not conform to the requirements of the law of disclosure in a number of critically important respects. First, the judgment in <i>R v. Ward </i>[1993] 1 WLR 619 established that it is for the court, not prosecuting counsel, to decide on disputed questions as to disclosable materials and on any asserted legal ground to withhold production of relevant material. The procedure to be adopted, whether it be by way of inter partes hearing, or exceptionally in an ex parte hearing, is governed by the rules of practice laid down in …. <i>R v. Davis</i> [1993] 1 WLR 613 and <i>R v. Keane </i>[1994] 1 WLR 746."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Taylor v. SFO </i>[1999] 2 AC 177, Lord Hoffmann observed that "the perception by prosecuting authorities of their disclosure obligations was substantially widened" by the decisions in <i>Ward </i>and <i>Keane</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103.&nbsp;&nbsp;The procedure envisaged by Lord Taylor in <i>Davis</i> at p.618E-F recognised that any informal pre-trial ruling by the judge on disclosure was "not necessarily final", that the situation might change and that such rulings could be revisited at trial. Steyn LJ observed in <i>Brown (Winston)</i> at p.1609E-F that</p>
<p></p><ul>"The extent of discovery permitted in a particular case, in the light of the issues in that case, must be left to the good sense of the trial judge, who must, of course, firmly discourage unnecessary and oppressive requests for discovery".<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Counsel on the present appeal informed the House that, under the procedure followed at that time, applications for disclosure were indeed commonly revisited at trial in order to obtain a ruling at trial on which an appeal could be based if the trial concluded in a conviction (see the potentially limited scope of the right of appeal under the language of section 2 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968, noted by Henry LJ in <i>Claydon</i>). Disclosure issues could thus occupy time before the jury which would be spared if they could be resolved at a preparatory hearing. The position in this respect may thus be said to have presented some analogy to that relating to issues of admissibility of evidence prior to the amendment of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 by the Criminal Appeal Act 1995 to introduce safety as the single test on an appeal after conviction. However, the position has changed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1996, following <i>Ward</i>, <i>Davis</i> and <i>Keane</i>, the new procedure was introduced by sections 3 to 6 of the 1996 Act enabling a judge to make binding rulings on disclosure prior to trial. This is a procedure available in any criminal proceedings, irrespective of whether a preparatory hearing could be or is ordered. Sections 3 to 6 of the 1996 Act give criminal judges a general power to make binding rulings on disclosure at any time without introducing any general possibility of an immediate appeal. No amendment was made to sections 7 to 9 of the 1987 Act (and no provision was introduced in sections 29 to 31 and 35 of the 1996 Act) referring to rulings on disclosure in the context of preparatory hearings ordered under these special provisions applicable to serious fraud or other serious or complex cases. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rees submits that the determination of a question relating to disclosure, under the modern principles now enshrined in sections 7 to 9 of the 1996 Act, may constitute the determination of an "other question of law relating to the case", so as to fall within the ambit of a preparatory hearing under section 9(3) of the 1987 Act and to give rise potentially to a right of appeal under section 9(11). It is not, and could not sensibly be, suggested that the fact that the ruling is made under a power contained in another statute means that it cannot fall within section 9(3) (cf e.g. <i>Claydon</i>, where the ruling was under section 78). Mr Rees' submission does however face the difficulty that, while applications and rulings on disclosure under section 8 of the 1996 Act may turn on questions of law (relating e.g. to the scope of the charges or the issues), they often also involve questions of fact and judgment - for example, whether documents exist, and, in certain respects at least, whether they contain material that may assist the defence and whether the Crown has, or there is reasonable cause to believe that the Crown has, them in its possession. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;106.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, section 8 of the 1996 Act enables a defendant to apply for disclosure and the court to determine whether there is reasonable cause to believe that the prosecution has unused material that might assist the defence and whether, if so, there is under section 8(5) a public interest justifying a refusal to order such disclosure. In ruling on any such application the court must apply the correct legal test under the 1996 Act to the facts found. That alone, in Mr Rees' submission, means that, at least once the facts are ascertained, the court's ultimate ruling is one of law, and is subject potentially to an appeal in all its aspects under section 9(11).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107.&nbsp;&nbsp;The proper construction of a statute is a question of law. But a ruling as to the application of a statute to particular facts belongs to a complex category. It has been said (in a case where the issue was whether a person was an employee) that "once the primary facts are found, then it is a pure question of law as to what is the reasonable inference based on the legal interpretation of the contract": <i>Morren v. Swinton and Pendlebury B.C.</i> [1965] 1 WLR 576, 583; and see <i>Benmax v. Austin</i> [1955] ACT 370. But in other authorities such as <i>Edwards v. Bairstow </i>[1956] AC 14, <i>O'Kelly v. Trusthouse Forte plc</i> [1984] QB 90 and <i>Cozens v. Brutus</i> [1973] AC 854, courts, in each case appellate courts with jurisdiction only in respect of questions of law, have stated that the question whether facts fall one side or the other of some notional conceptual line drawn by the law is a question of fact. In <i>Moyna v. Secretary of State for Work and Pensions</i> [2003] UKHL 44; [2003] 1 WLR 1929, paragraphs 22-28, Lord Hoffmann said that this usage might seem "rather odd", and rationalised it on the basis that "there are questions of law as to which lawyers have decided that it would be inexpedient for an appellate tribunal to have to form an independent judgment", and that this "causes no difficulty as long as it is understood that the degree to which an appellate court will be willing to substitute its own judgment for that of the tribunal will vary with the nature of the question" (paragraphs 26-27).  However, what is critical on this appeal is not whether a question may be regarded as a question of law in the abstract, but whether, without more, issues of disclosure fall generally within the intended meaning of the phrase "question of law relating to the case" used in section 9(3)(c). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also true that the use of the word "other" in section 9(3)(c) suggests that section 9 is approaching questions as to the admissibility of evidence as basically questions of law, and, as I have indicated in paragraph 86 above, I would not wish to throw any doubt on the sensible jurisprudence developed by the Court of Appeal in <i>Claydon</i>, whereby all aspects of evidential issues can be examined and determined under section 9(3)(b). Nor did the Crown in its submissions to the House seek to do so. But there is a contrast between the generality of section 9(3)(b) and the limited language of section 9(3)(c).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;109.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have in these circumstances found the application of section 9(3)(c) in relation to rulings on disclosure difficult, and was for some time attracted by Mr Rees' wide approach. I remain unimpressed by suggestions that considerations relating to custody time limits (not in any event explored before the House) have any part to play in the resolution of the difficulty. The Roskill Report is silent about custody time limits. They had not at the date of the Report in 1986 been introduced under the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985, and were first introduced only shortly before the enactment of the 1987 Act by the Prosecution of Offences (Custody Time Limits) Regulations S.I. 1987/299. Far from concerning itself about over-early resort to a preparatory hearing or about any impact on any future custody limits, the Report urged that "the first preparatory hearing should take place as soon as possible after committal or the issue of a transfer certificate" and that "There should …. be such number of preparatory hearings as each case requires" (paragraphs 6.49 and 6.51 and recommendations 44 and 47 in paragraph 6.104). The impact on custody limits of a preparatory hearing does not therefore seem material. I am also unimpressed by fears that lawyers might defer applications for disclosure until after the commencement of a preparatory hearing simply in order to be able to seek permission to appeal, or might make last-minute applications which could delay trials. The primary duty is on the prosecution to make proper disclosure, but the lawyers on all sides have a duty not to engage in delaying tactics. Further, any appeal would not only be restricted to any question of law, but would also depend on obtaining leave. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have however ultimately concluded for other reasons that section 9(3)(c) does not cover rulings on disclosure as such and without more:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Roskill Report appears by "points of law relating to the case" to have had at the forefront of its mind matters going to "the root of the case" (see paragraphs 95 and 100 above), by which I take it to have meant broadly matters which would identify the material issues before the jury (matching the idea behind section 7(1)(a)). Disclosure is an ancillary obligation in respect of issues which have been or are identified.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Roskill Report treats disclosure (so far as it envisages it in any sense) as a matter arising prior to any preparatory hearing or to be covered by case management directions during such a hearing under section 9(4) of the 1987 Act, rather than by a ruling of law (see paragraph 100 above).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only by an unusually broad interpretation of "points of law relating to the case" that questions of disclosure could, as such and without more, be treated as questions of law, and even then only if one excluded any preliminary issues of fact that would require determination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1996 Act placing disclosure on a statutory basis made no reference at all in the context of disclosure to the preparatory hearing procedure (despite extending the availability of the preparatory hearing procedure to all cases of sufficient seriousness or length: see paragraph 80 above).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;There would seem to be some incongruity in a result which gave rise to a right of appeal in respect of disclosure rulings made after, but not before, the start of a preparatory hearing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Bingham's dictum regarding disclosure in <i>Shayler </i>(paragraph 88 above) can be read consistently with the analysis in points (a) and (b) above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ruling on disclosure in this case required the judge to do no more than identify the facts and considerations and apply the proper statutory test in their light. In the light of what I have said, I consider that such a ruling lay outside the scope of the preparatory hearing under sections 7 to 9 of the 1987 Act and outside the scope of a possible appeal under section 9(11). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112.&nbsp;&nbsp;This result, which flows from the history and limits of statutory language developed originally before disclosure came to the fore as a major issue in modern criminal proceedings, may be regretted and in my view merits further consideration by the Law Commission and others. The more relaxed attitude in recent years to appeals in relation to disclosure does not appear to have led to any repetition of the concerns about over-loading of the appellate system (cf e.g. the cases of <i>H</i> [2004] 2 AC 134, <i>G</i> [2004] 1 WLR 2932 and <i>Goldstone</i> [[2005] EWCA Crim 2461). The present appeal in particular may be seen as highlighting the potential advantages of a right to seek leave to appeal - it is a case with a long trial in prospect, and a ruling which might affect the fairness of the whole trial, but which cannot be considered on any appeal until after the trial. It appears at least arguable that the judge may have erred in his determination - in the test he applied and in the considerations which he took into account as relevant. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reasons given I would answer the questions certified by the Court of Appeal in the present case (paragraph 78 above) as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, once a preparatory hearing has validly been ordered for one or more of the purposes listed in section 7(1) of the Criminal Justice Act 1987, an order or ruling made during such a hearing within the scope of the powers conferred in section 9 need not itself be for any of such purposes, and may thus, if made within the scope of the powers conferred by section 9(3)(b) or (c), give rise, with leave, to an appeal under section 9(11). If this analysis is not, however, accepted, then an order or ruling made during such a hearing within the scope of the powers specified in section 9 will, at least in any case that can readily be envisaged, fall within one or more of such purposes listed in section 7(1), broadly interpreted as they should in this context be. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of my answer to question (a), the critical question is not whether any such order or ruling falls within one of the purposes set out in section 7(1), but whether it falls within section 9.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;An order or ruling, made under section 8 of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 during the course of a validly ordered preparatory hearing does not, as such and without more, constitute the determination of a question of law or fall within section 9(3)(c) of the 1987 Act, or enable leave to appeal to be sought or given under section 9(11) of the 1987 Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114.&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows from the above that the Court of Appeal was, albeit for reasons other than those given in previous authorities by which the Court of Appeal rightly felt itself bound, correct in its conclusion that it had no jurisdiction in the circumstances to hear an appeal against HHJ Hodson's ruling under section 8 of the 1996 Act; and that this appeal falls to be dismissed accordingly.</p>
