<p class="para">76.&nbsp;&nbsp;The third theme of the judge’s analysis was its discussion of earlier cases in which estoppel had been claimed in a commercial context. Apart from those mentioned in the last paragraph, the most important, in chronological order, are <i>Holiday Inns Inc v Broadhead </i>(1974) 232 EG 951; <i>Crabb v Arun District Council</i> [1976] Ch 179 and <i>Pridean v Forest Taverns Ltd</i> (1998) 75 P &amp; CR 447. </p>
<p class="para">77.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Holiday Inns</i> the defendant behaved very badly indeed. The judge described his conduct as deceitful as well as unconscionable. He repeatedly assured his American partners in the joint venture “that we had his word; that he was an English gentleman; and that we could count on him.” The two principal witnesses for Holiday Inns (Mr Wilson and Mr Tigrett, who were businessmen, not lawyers) believed implicitly that they had a deal with Mr Broadhead: see their evidence as summarised by Goff J at pp 1089-1091, and his findings on it.  It is also very important to note that <i>Holiday Inns</i> was not a case in which Mr Broadhead was bringing land of his own into a joint venture.  He obtained an option over the site at the request of Mr Wilson, but then failed to keep Mr Wilson informed about it: see at pp 953-954.  It was the commercial strength and reputation of Holiday Inns that secured planning permission for the hotel development.  Mr Broadhead could not have got it on his own.  Mr Wilson regarded Mr Broadhead as totally committed to granting Holiday Inns a lease on agreed terms (see at p 1089): </p>
<p class="qt">“I want to repeat that Mr Broadhead would never have got this piece of property.  If he had not told me he was going out and try and get the property, then I would have sent somebody else out to get the property.  Mr Broadhead understood our 3 and 1 lease and was happy for my friend Mr Broadhead to buy this ground and us to lease it from him on that kind of terms.  This was our complete understanding and agreement.”</p>
<p class="para">78.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Holiday Inns</i> can therefore be seen as a case where one joint venturer permitted another to acquire legal rights (in that case, an option to purchase the site) in the belief that the property would be used for the joint venture.  It was therefore akin to <i>Pallant v Morgan</i> [1953]  Ch 43, which Goff J referred to in his discussion of the law (at p1087).  Chadwick LJ recognised that as a possible analysis in <i>Banner Homes Group Plc v Luff Developments Ltd</i> [2000]  Ch 372, 397-399, although in his discussion Chadwick LJ ultimately favoured proprietary estoppel (see also the discussion by Lewison J in <i>Kilcarne Holdings Ltd v Targetfollow (Birmingham) Ltd</i> [2005]  2 P &amp; CR 105, 159-162).  In the present case, of course, Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring and YRML owned the property (subject only to some outstanding tenancies) long before Mr Cobbe came on the scene.</p>
<p class="para">79.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Crabb v Arun District Council,</i> the facts of which are well known, is a difficult case, not least because of different views taken by different members of the Court (Lord Denning MR, and Lawton and Scarman LJJ). The situation was that of a commercial negotiation in which both sides expected formal legal documents to be agreed and executed. The case is best explained, I think, by recognising that the Council’s erection of the two sets of gates was an act so unequivocal that it led to Mr Crabb irretrievably altering his position, putting the matter beyond the stage at which it was open to negotiation: see at pp 186 (Lord Denning MR), 191 (Lawton LJ) and 197 (Scarman LJ).</p>
<p class="para">80.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Pridean </i>the Court of Appeal upheld the County Court judge’s rejection of the estoppel claim on the grounds that the negotiations still left one crucial point still to be decided.  In the present case, by contrast, the judge found (in para 68 of his judgment, quoted above) that all the critical commercial terms had been agreed in principle. Mr Dowding did not directly challenge that conclusion, but he pointed out that the successful redevelopment involved many uncertainties which were not simply a matter for Mr Cobbe and Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring to agree between themselves; I will come back to that aspect of the matter.</p>
<p class="para">81.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion none of these cases casts any doubt on the general principle laid down by this House in <i>Ramsden v Dyson</i>, that conscious reliance on honour alone will not give rise to an estoppel.  Nor do they cast doubt on the general principle that the court should be very slow to introduce uncertainty into commercial transactions by over-ready use of equitable concepts such as fiduciary obligations and equitable estoppel. That applies to commercial negotiations whether or not they are expressly stated to be subject to contract.</p>
<p class="para">82.&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge went on to consider how he should exercise his discretion so as to give effect to the estoppel which he had found to be established.  The difficulties that he encountered are a further indication, I think, of the incongruity of trying to apply the doctrine of equitable estoppel to a complicated commercial negotiation in which one crucial element—how Mr Cobbe was going to fund the project, and provide security both for the funding and for Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring’s overage interest—had hardly been addressed.  </p>
<p class="para">83.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal (Mummery and Dyson LJJ and Sir Martin Nourse) unanimously dismissed Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring’s appeal from the judge’s main judgment (her appeal against being made personally liable, a matter covered in the judge’s second judgment, was allowed, and nothing now turns on that).  Mummery LJ gave the leading judgment in the Court of Appeal.  He summarised the five main grounds of appeal:</p>
<p class="para">&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;the mutual promises point: that Mr Cobbe had not&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;performed all (or substantially all) of his side of a complex &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bargain;</p>
<p class="para">&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;the uncertainty point: that Mr Cobbe’s expectation was of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"a contract", which was meaningless unless the terms of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the contract were clear;</p>
<p class="para">&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;the “subject to contract” point: this has been sufficiently</p>
<p class="para">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;explained already;</p>
<p class="para">&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;the unconscionability point: that it was not, in all the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circumstances, unconscionable for Yeoman’s Row &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management Ltd (“YRML”) to continue to allow Mr &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cobbe to spend money, after Christmas 2003, in seeking &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;planning permission; and</p>
<p class="para">&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;a point on section 2 of the Law of Property (Miscellanous &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions) Act 1989.</p>
<p class="para">84.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mummery LJ disposed of the first four of these points relatively briefly (paras 45-61) and then went on to the fifth point, to the relief granted and to the problems raised by the judge’s second judgment.  Dyson LJ agreed with Mummery LJ and added some further reasoning on the issue of relief.  Sir Martin Nourse agreed with both judgments.  </p>
<p class="para">85.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, I yield to no one in my respect for Etherton J and for the three very experienced judges in the Court of Appeal who upheld his main judgment.  But I have after anxious consideration reached the clear conclusion that they stretched the boundaries of the doctrine of equitable estoppel too far in granting relief going well beyond the restitutionary relief to which I would hold Mr Cobbe to be entitled.  In my opinion the Court of Appeal’s decision, if it were to stand, would tend to introduce considerable uncertainty into commercial negotiations, and not only in the field of property development (compare <i>Baird Textile Holdings Ltd v Marks &amp; Spencer plc</i> [2001]  EWCA Civ 274, [2002] 1 All ER (Comm) 737 which the editors of Meagher, Gummow &amp; Lehane, 4th ed. Para 17-050, contrast with recent developments in Australia).  Equity has some important functions in regulating commercial life, but those functions must be kept within proper bounds:  see generally Sir Peter Millett, “Equity’s Place in the Law of Commerce", (1998) 114 LQR 214.</p>
<p class="para">86.&nbsp;&nbsp;My reasons for differing from the courts below are three-fold (although, as always seems to happen in this area of law, the points are not completely distinct; they rub shoulders together).  They broadly correspond to the first four grounds of appeal in the Court of Appeal, but taking the first and second grounds together.</p>
<p class="para">87.&nbsp;&nbsp;The informal bargain made in this case was unusually complex, as both courts below acknowledged.  When a claim based on equitable estoppel is made in a domestic setting the informal bargain or understanding is typically on the following lines:  if you live here as my carer/companion/lover you will have a home for life.  The expectation is of acquiring and keeping an interest in an identified property.  In this case, by contrast, Mr Cobbe was expecting to get a contract.  Under that contract he (or much more probably a company controlled by him) would have been entitled to acquire the property for a down-payment of £12m, but only as part of a deal under which the block of flats on the site was to be demolished, the site cleared, and six very expensive townhouses were to be erected instead, and sold for the best prices that they would fetch.  The interests of Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring and YRML were not restricted to the £12m down-payment.  She was to receive a further sum amounting (together with the £12m) to one-half of the gross proceeds of sale of the six townhouses.  She would expect this future sum to be secured on the property.  The bank or other institution providing the development finance would also expect its lending to be fully secured.  At some point a very large sum of money was going to be secured on an empty site.  None of these matters seems to have been under negotiation before the deal collapsed in March 2004.  Mr Ivory made a virtue of that point, arguing that the absence of any active negotiations between September 2002 and March 2004 shows that the parties did not expect to encounter any difficulty in agreeing these matters.  It is more likely, to my mind, that they both accepted that there was no point in tackling them until planning permission had been obtained.</p>
<p class="para">88.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already mentioned the judge’s finding that Mr Cobbe believed (para 68),</p>
<p class="qt">“that the Second Agreement comprised all the critical commercial terms, that any outstanding terms were of secondary importance and in the nature of legal mechanics, which would inevitably be agreed one way or another.”</p>
<p class="para">Mr Dowding did not directly attack this conclusion, but he did submit (to my mind convincingly) that the matters which were not agreed (or even under negotiation) were far from trivial.  The fact that one or both parties may have expected that all outstanding points would be resolved does not mean that that outcome was certain or near-certain (as is confirmed by recent events in the mortgage lending and property sectors).  </p>
<p class="para">89.&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge may also have taken rather too broad a view of the commercial reality of the proposed deal.  In discussing the issue of relief he observed (para 140), </p>
<p class="qt">“The Second Agreement, broadly speaking, reflected an intention that [YRML], through Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring, and Mr Cobbe should share equally the increased value or commercial potentiality arising from the grant of the planning permission.”</p>
<p class="para">That was no doubt true, in a very broad sense.  But Mr Cobbe’s prospective rewards were much more highly geared, and vulnerable to changing economic and financial circumstances.  Not that there was anything unfair in that: after all, Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring and her company were bringing the property into the venture, and Mr Cobbe’s main contribution was his entrepreneurial skill and experience.  But it is important, I think, to grasp the degree of risk which Mr Cobbe was undertaking, on any view of the relationship of trust between himself and Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring.</p>
<p class="para">90.&nbsp;&nbsp;These considerations (which are loosely connected with the first and second grounds of appeal in the Court of Appeal, and more closely with points made at various places between paragraphs 52 to 78 in the appellant’s printed case) are not in themselves decisive.  It may be possible to imagine a situation in which an equitable estoppel might arise even though the expected outcome was not really within the gift of the party estopped.  But the considerations which I have mentioned do at the least indicate that the estoppel claimed in this case is a very unusual one, which calls for rigorous and even sceptical examination.</p>
<p class="para">91.&nbsp;&nbsp;When examined in that way, Mr Cobbe’s case seems to me to fail on the simple but fundamental point that, as persons experienced in the property world, both parties knew that there was no legally binding contract, and that either was therefore free to discontinue the negotiations without legal liability—that is liability in equity as well as at law, to echo the words of Lord Cranworth quoted in para 53 above.  Mr Cobbe was therefore running a risk, but he stood to make a handsome profit if the deal went ahead, and the market stayed favourable.  He may have thought that any attempt to get Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring to enter into a written contract before the grant of planning permission would be counter-productive.  Whatever his reasons for doing so, the fact is that he ran a commercial risk, with his eyes open, and the outcome has proved unfortunate for him.  It is true that he did not expressly state, at the time, that he was relying solely on Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring’s sense of honour, but to draw that sort of distinction in a commercial context would be as unrealistic, in my opinion, as to draw a firm distinction depending on whether the formula “subject to contract” had or had not actually been used.</p>
<p class="para">92.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Dowding devoted a separate section of his printed case to arguing that even if the elements for an estoppel were in other respects present, it would not in any event be unconscionable for Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring to insist on her legal rights.  That argument raises the question whether “unconscionability” is a separate element in making out a case of estoppel, or whether to regard it as a separate element would be what Professor Peter Birks once called “a fifth wheel on the coach” (Birks &amp; Pretto (eds) Breach of Trust (2002) p.226).  But Birks was there criticising the use of “unconscionable” to describe a <i>state of mind</i> (<i>Bank of Credit &amp; Commerce International (Overseas) Ltd v Akindele</i> [2001] Ch 437, 455).  Here it is being used (as in my opinion it should always be used) as an objective value judgment on <i>behaviour</i> (regardless of the state of mind of the individual in question).  As such it does in my opinion play a very important part in the doctrine of equitable estoppel, in unifying and confirming, as it were, the other elements.  If the other elements appear to be present but the result does not shock the conscience of the court, the analysis needs to be looked at again.  In this case Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring’s conduct was unattractive.  She chose to stand on her rights rather than respecting her non-binding assurances, while Mr Cobbe continued to spend time and effort, between Christmas 2003 and March 2004, in obtaining planning permission.  But Mr Cobbe knew that she was bound in honour only, and so in the eyes of equity her conduct, although unattractive, was not unconscionable.</p>
<p class="para">93.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Cobbe cannot in my opinion obtain any further assistance from the doctrine of the constructive trust.  I do not think it is necessary or appropriate to consider the issue on section 2 of the Law of Property (Miscellanous Provisions) Act 1989.  I would (in common, as I understand it, with all of your Lordships) allow this appeal and direct an inquiry with a view to reimbursing Mr Cobbe on a generous scale not only for his out of pocket expenditure in seeking and obtaining planning permission, but also for his time and trouble in doing so. </p>
