<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114. The use of solicitors has given rise to further practical (and, to a limited extent, legal) problems.  The first is ensuring that the solicitor is in possession of the relevant facts as known to the bank.  The advantage of an officer of the bank conducting the interview with the wife is that he has the file and access to the relevant facts.  The solicitor on the other hand may have nothing except the documents which are to be signed.  It is within the control of the bank what it sends to the solicitor.  If the solicitor is to conduct the interview with the wife, the bank must give him the information.  The next difficulty is that the bank's information about the affairs of its customer is confidential and the bank may need to obtain the husband's consent to give this information to the solicitor and the wife.  However, if the husband refuses to give his consent, this would be a clear indication to the bank and the solicitor that something may be amiss and that it ought not to rely upon the wife being bound.  A further point is that contracts of suretyship are not contracts of the utmost good faith.  There is no general duty of disclosure: see the authorities cited by my noble and learned friends in their speeches, to which I would add the speech of Lord Clyde in <i>Smith v Bank of Scotland</i> 1997 SLT 1061.  Seeing that the solicitor is adequately informed is not the performance of a <i>duty</i> owed by the bank to the wife.  It is simply a necessary step to be taken by the bank so that it may be satisfied that the wife entered into the obligation freely and in knowledge of the true facts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115. Another consequence of using solicitors is the risk of confusion about what the solicitor's role is to be.  The solicitor will normally have been instructed by the bank to act for it.  The solicitor will often already be acting for the husband.  The solicitor may not be acting for the wife at all, let alone separately and independently from the solicitor's other clients.  Similarly, the solicitor's instructions may simply be to explain to the signatories the character and legal effect of the documents.  This is a low order of advice which can be given solely by reference to the formal documents to be signed.  It is also important to appreciate that the solicitor's role may simply be to witness a signature.  Such a role involves no necessary relationship whatsoever between the solicitor and the signatory.  Indeed they may have or represent conflicting interests.  The solicitor may simply have been instructed by one party to see and be prepared to provide evidence that the relevant document was signed and delivered by the other party.  Seeing that a solicitor has witnessed a signature itself means nothing.  Even when a solicitor is instructed to explain the character and legal effect of a document, he will not without more concern himself at all with the interests of the wife or whether she is accepting the obligations freely and with knowledge of the true facts.  Under these circumstances it is scarcely surprising, as the facts of these cases and many others show, that wives are still signing documents as a result of undue influence.  The involvement of a solicitor has too often been a formality or merely served to reinforce the husband's wishes and undermine any scope for the wife to exercise an independent judgment whether to comply.  Lord Browne-Wilkinson observed at [1994] 1 AC p.188,</p>
<p></p><ul>"The number of recent cases in this field shows that in practice many wives are still subjected to, and yield to, undue influence by their husbands.  Such wives can reasonably look to the law for some protection when their husbands have abused the trust and confidence reposed in them."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of the practice of relying upon solicitors' certificates has been described by Sir Peter Millett (as he then was) in his lecture to the Chancery Bar Association (114 LQR 214 at p.220), referring to an article by Sir Anthony Mason (110 LQR 238),</p>
<p></p><ul>"What Sir Anthony Mason has described as 'ritual reliance on the provision of legal advice' is foreign to the traditional approach of a court of equity and is manifestly failing to give adequate protection to the wife or cohabitant who acts as surety.  We have substituted an inappropriate bright line rule for a proper investigation of the facts and have failed the vulnerable in the process.  The Australians are turning to the jurisdiction to relieve against harsh and unconscionable bargains as an alternative, and there is much merit in this approach.  It is certainly better than allowing the bank to assume that the surety has received adequate legal advice, an assumption which the bank almost always knows to be false."<p></p></ul>
<p>The crux of this situation is that the bank requests the solicitor to give a certificate which the bank then treats as conclusive evidence that it has no notice of any undue influence which has occurred.  But the wife may have no knowledge that this certificate is to be given and will not have authorised the solicitor to give it and, what is more, the solicitor will deny that he is under any obligation to the wife (or the bank) to satisfy himself that the wife is entering into the obligations freely and in knowledge of the true facts.  The law has, in order to accommodate the commercial lenders, adopted a fiction which nullifies the equitable principle and deprives vulnerable members of the public of the protection which equity gives them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116. Lord Browne-Wilkinson contemplated a two stage exercise, the first stage being an interview between the lender and the wife (for which the lender would be responsible) and the second being the wife taking independent advice from a solicitor (for which the lender would not be responsible).  The practice of banks has been to run these two stages together thus creating confusion about the role of the solicitor.  I accept that the best solution is that adopted by Lord Nicholls in his speech.  The solicitor in communicating with and advising the wife should be doing so solely as her solicitor.  The solicitor's certificate which the bank asks for is something which the bank is asking the wife to procure and which the solicitor is providing as her solicitor.  I am satisfied that, provided that the guidance which Lord Nicholls gives (in the paragraphs which I have identified at the outset of this speech) is complied with, the wife will have a reasonable chance of receiving the protection she may need.  But it will be appreciated that an essential feature of the scheme is that the wife has to be aware of what is going on, that the bank is asking for the certificate and why, that she is being asked to instruct a solicitor to advise her and that she is being asked to authorise the solicitor to provide the certificate.  This is a far cry from the situation which has been tolerated in the past where the wife has not appreciated that she had any solicitor or was being advised and did not know of the existence of the certificate or its significance; indeed it has been that type of situation which has given rise to the most scandalous cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117. Illuminating evidence was given at the trial of the <i>Gill</i> action relevant to what was practical from the bank's point of view.  The bank there was the National Westminster Bank.  The bank manager gave evidence.  In answer to direct questions he accepted without qualification that he foresaw the potential for undue influence by a husband where his wife is being asked to stand surety for the debts of her husband's business.  His solution was to procure that the wife received <i>separate</i> legal advice.  In saying this he was following the practice of his bank as set out in a document (which he produced during his evidence in chief) with which he said he was already familiar in December 1988 (that is to say well before <i>O'Brien</i> in the House of Lords) headed "Charged Security - Separate Legal Advice - Action Sheet".  It includes the following passages - </p>
<p></p><ul>"The security may be voidable if undue influence can be established.  Therefore, great care is needed when there is any likelihood that a potential guarantor or third-party chargor may be unduly influenced by a borrower.<p></p></ul>
Undue influence may exist where there is a special relationship between the parties, eg:  husband and wife  ...
Do not regard the above list as exhaustive.  The background always requires careful thought ...
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...   where the guarantor/chargor is a customer of the Bank  ...  - the Bank has a duty, where any doubts exist, to INSIST that independent legal advice is given regarding: (a) the nature of the guarantee/charge, (b) the viability of the underlying proposition  - advise the guarantor/chargor to obtain full details from the principal debtor, whose consent is required before disclosures, as to the underlying transaction, can be made to the grantor/chargor or legal advisor. Always consider, in detail, the circumstances surrounding a transaction, as undue influence may arise where direct security is taken for joint borrowing, eg (i) joint borrowing for purposes ostensibly in the interest of only one of the borrowers  ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where there is any suspicion of undue influence, the Manager must ensure that all guarantors/third-party chargors take separate legal advice from a firm of solicitors nominated by the guarantor/chargor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Send the charge form directly to the solicitor concerned  ...  - To avoid a conflict of interest, ensure that the witnessing solicitor is not also acting for the borrower.  In such circumstances another solicitor, who may be a partner in the same firm, must be used."  (emphasis as in the original)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118. My Lords I have quoted from this document because it discloses the response of a major high street bank to the question of undue influence.  It does not seek to play down the risk.  It puts husbands and wives at the top of the list.  It requires that independent/separate legal advice be taken by the guarantor/chargor.  It stresses the importance of having regard to the viability of the underlying proposition or transaction and where necessary obtaining full details from the principal debtor.  It requires that the solicitor be the solicitor nominated by the guarantor/chargor and that the actual solicitor must not be acting for the borrower as well.  These points are all of practical as well as legal importance.  Banks were prepared to accommodate them.  They did not need to be told that they had to by Lord Browne-Wilkinson.  It represented a pragmatic response to the practical as well as the legal questions.  In some respects, the National Westminster Bank "action sheet" goes quite a bit further than what is required by Lord Nicholls.  It shows that the speech of Lord Nicholls does not require banks to go further than they had already been prepared to go before <i>O'Brien</i> and that what Lord Nicholls requires is and was in fact reasonable and practical.</p>
<i></i><p><i>(3) Reasonable Steps</i>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119. Lord Browne-Wilkinson favoured a personal interview with the wife conducted in the absence of the husband by a representative of the bank.  The wife would then be urged to take independent/separate legal advice.  It followed that the bank would be responsible for the first of these steps but not the second.  The banks were not following this course.  They were not doing anything themselves.  They were instructing a solicitor, asking him to supply a formal certificate limited to comprehension and that is all.  This is what had given rise to the fiction of free and informed consent where none existed and no steps had been taken to discover the true position.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120. Given the state of the authorities since the speeches in <i>O'Brien</i> and <i>Pitt</i> were delivered and the need to provide fresh guidance, I agree that your Lordships should adopt the scheme spelled out by Lord Nicholls.  The central feature is that the wife will be put into a proper relationship with a solicitor who is acting for her and accepts appropriate duties towards her.  Likewise the bank or other lender must communicate directly with the wife to the end that that relationship is established and that any certificate upon which it may seek to rely is the fruit of such a professional relationship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121. If the bank follows this procedure then the fiction of independent advice and consent should be replaced by true independent advice and real consent.  It will probably be less onerous for the lender than what was required by Lord Browne-Wilkinson and the  National Westminster "action sheet".  It will also be observed that it is consistent with the duty of the solicitor towards his client, the wife.  He will appreciate that he cannot give the statement and certificate unless it conforms to the reality.  Similarly, the wife will not be left in ignorance of what has been going on and will know what she is entitled to get from the solicitor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122. It also resolves the question of what knowledge of the solicitor will affect the bank either under the common law or under s.199 of the Law of Property Act 1925.  The solicitor in question will not be acting for the bank.  Any knowledge the solicitor acquires from the wife will be confidential as between the two of them.  If it renders untruthful the statement or certificate, the solicitor cannot sign them without being in breach of his professional obligation to the wife and committing a fraud on the bank.  The wife's remedy will be against the solicitor and not against the bank.  If the solicitor does not provide the statement and certificate for which the bank has asked, then the bank will not, in the absence of other evidence, have reasonable grounds for being satisfied that the wife's agreement has been properly obtained.  Its legal rights will be subject to any equity existing in favour of the wife.</p>
<p align="center">INDIVIDUAL CASES</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123. Turning to the individual appeals, the cases fall into 3 different categories.  There are three cases - <i>Harris</i>, <i>Wallace</i> and <i>Moore</i> - which have not got beyond the interlocutory stage, the wives' pleadings having been struck out as disclosing no defence to the banks' claims for possession.  There are four cases - <i>Etridge</i>, <i>Gill</i>, <i>Coleman</i> and <i>Bennett</i> - which have proceeded to trial and in which, at trial and/or on appeal, the wife has been unsuccessful.  Finally there is a single case - <i>Kenyon-Brown</i> - in which the wife was suing her solicitor for damages for breach of duty.  Your Lordships are in favour of allowing the appeals in <i>Kenyon-Brown</i>, <i>Harris</i>, <i>Wallace</i>, <i>Moore</i> and <i>Bennett</i>: I agree.  I also agree that the appeals in <i>Etridge</i>, <i>Gill</i> and <i>Coleman</i> should be dismissed.  There is an important distinction to be drawn between cases which have been tried where the parties have been able to test the opposing case and the trial judge was able to make findings of fact having seen the critical witnesses and evaluated the evidence.  By contrast, in those cases where the lender is applying for an immediate possession order without a trial or to have the defence struck out, the court is being asked to hold that, even if the wife's allegations of fact be accepted, the wife's case is hopeless and bound to fail and that there is no reason why the case should go to trial.  This conclusion is not to be arrived at lightly nor should such an order be made simply on the basis that the lender is more likely to succeed.  Once it is accepted that the wife has raised an arguable case that she was in fact the victim of undue influence and that the bank had been put on enquiry, it will have to be a very clear case before one can say that the bank should not have to justify its conduct at a trial. </p>
<i>
</i><p><i>Kenyon-Brown</i>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;124. I take this case first because it falls into a different category to the others.  The wife was claiming damages against a firm of solicitors on the basis that, under the undue influence of her husband, she had entered into an adverse suretyship transaction for the benefit of her husband, which also involved charging a cottage which they jointly owned, and that the solicitors had failed to give her appropriate advice to prevent this happening.  The guarantee was unlimited.  The wife was unable to give specific or reliable evidence in support of her case against the solicitors but relied upon the fact that the transaction was manifestly disadvantageous to her and upon the duty of the solicitor, as stated by the Court of Appeal in <i>Etridge No2</i> [1998] 4 All ER 705 at para 19, to satisfy himself that she was free from improper influence.  The certificate which the solicitor gave to the lender was that he had given her legal advice.  In <i>Kenyon-Brown</i>, the majority of the Court of Appeal, in disagreement with the trial judge, considered that this led inexorably to the conclusion that the solicitor must have been negligent.  I agree with your Lordships that the conclusion of the Court of Appeal was not justified upon the evidence adduced at the trial.  The burden of proof was upon the wife to establish that the solicitor had been negligent.  She could not say that she had not been given comprehensive advice which included a full warning of the consequences of her entering into the transaction.  She could not contradict that he had told her specifically that the mortgage would only benefit her husband and was without limit.  He was her solicitor and advised her as his client.  The judge was right: she failed to make out her case against the solicitor on the facts.  If she had been able to give reliable evidence and be clearer about what she said had happened and had been in a position to challenge the solicitor's attendance note, she might have succeeded.  The solicitor's duty towards her was as stated by my noble and learned friend Lord Nicholls.  It seems that it was substantially observed and in so far as the solicitor might be criticised, no causative relevance was established. </p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wallace:</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125. This was an interlocutory case.  The bank claimed the possession of a flat in Priory Road, Hampstead, which was jointly owned by Mr and Mrs Wallace.  The bank claimed possession on the basis of an all monies legal charge signed by the husband and the wife against which the bank had advanced money to the husband.  It was accepted that she had an arguable case that she had been unduly influenced to sign by her husband.  The bank did not at any stage communicate with the wife or anyone acting for her.  It sent the charge to its own solicitor with instructions to attend to the necessary formalities in the signing of the charge.  The husband and wife went together to the bank's solicitor's office.  The wife's case was that she was there 3 or 4 minutes at most; she signed as directed by the solicitor; there was no other discussion; her impression was that the solicitor had been instructed by the bank merely to take and witness her signature.  On this case the bank had no basis for rebutting the risk that her signature had not been properly obtained.  It had no basis for any belief that she had been separately advised by a solicitor who was acting for her.  The only solicitor of which the bank knew was a solicitor acting for itself alone which had in a side letter to the bank, of which the wife knew nothing, told the bank no more than that the documents had been explained.  The wife clearly had an arguable case for defending the possession action.  The reasoning of the Court of Appeal in arriving at the contrary conclusion was that the bank was (or, perhaps, would have been) entitled to assume that the solicitor had been acting as the wife's solicitor and had discharged his duty to her as her solicitor.  As stated, this assumption would have been without foundation.  I agree that this appeal should be allowed.</p>
<i><p>Harris:</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;126. This was also an interlocutory case.  The judge struck out her defence and counterclaim as disclosing no arguable defence to the bank's action for the possession of the house owned jointly by the husband and wife where they lived.  The husband had, through the medium of two companies, two businesses one of which had effectively failed leaving him with a heavy personal liability.  He consulted solicitors, Wragge &amp; Co, to find a way of carrying on his other business.  They advised him to negotiate a new facility with the bank with new security.  The outcome was an offer from the bank of new finance for the second company secured by unlimited guarantees from both the husband and wife and a legal charge on their house.  The bank was clearly put on enquiry.  It was accepted that for striking out purposes the wife had an arguable case on undue influence.  The relevant question was therefore whether the bank took reasonable steps to satisfy itself that the wife's agreement had not been improperly obtained.  Wragge &amp; Co were only known to the bank as the husband's solicitors.  The bank took no steps to communicate with the wife who was allowed to remain in ignorance of what precisely was the position between her husband and the bank.  The wife was never told that she would be required to be separately advised nor that she should instruct a solicitor to certify to the bank that she had been so advised.  In her pleading the wife had pleaded that the solicitors were acting for the bank, her husband and herself.  However before the judge the affidavit sworn by her solicitor in the action (Mr Holt of Evans Derry Binnion) in response to the bank's striking out application deposed (para 6) -</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is important to note that insofar as my client is concerned Wragge &amp; Co were not her solicitors.  Wragge &amp; Co were solicitors who had been instructed by Mr Harris personally previously and he had a personal connection with one of the partners at that [firm]."<p></p></ul>
<p>The wife therefore has an arguable case that Wragge &amp; Co were never her solicitors and that the case is in this respect the same as the <i>Wallace</i> case.  There is however a further feature of this case.  The bank wrote to Wragge &amp; Co, knowing them only as the husband's solicitors, asking them, among other things, "to explain the nature of the document to both parties and confirm to us that independent legal advice has been given".  The letter in reply from Wragge &amp; Co did not give the bank that confirmation, a fact which the bank did not pick up until about nine months later.  The bank then wrote to Wragge &amp; Co pointing this out and asking for confirmation that independent legal advice had nevertheless been given.  On receiving this further letter, the partner at Wragge &amp; Co commented: "I do not think that independent legal advice was given."  On this, it would appear that the bank appreciated that it needed confirmation that the wife had been independently advised.  Patently it did not get it.  The bank realised that it had not got it and that she may well never have been independently advised.  This was clearly a case where the judge should have allowed the case to go to trial.  The wife had an arguable defence on more than one ground.  The Court of Appeal dismissed the wife's appeal giving only brief reasons - "The solicitors were acting for Mrs Harris and the bank were entitled to assume that they had given appropriate advice and were entitled to accept the solicitors' letter as confirmation that this had been done."  These reasons fly in the face of the evidence and cannot be supported.  This appeal should be allowed.</p>
<i></i><p><i>Moore</i>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;127. This is the third of the interlocutory cases.  It is less clear cut than the other two.  But it is not a case in which it should be said, in my judgment, that no trial is justified and that, on the basis of her pleaded case, the wife is bound to fail in her defence of the possession action.  It is accepted for present purposes that she has an arguable case of undue influence and misrepresentation by her husband.  Her case is that she had in fact instructed no solicitors to act for her and received no advice whatsoever.  The charge was unlimited in amount.  The loan transaction was not wholly straightforward in that, whilst it included the refinancing of indebtedness which was already secured on the matrimonial home in Pangbourne, it was as to 3/5ths composed of a substantial additional advance to the company run by the husband which was already in financial trouble (and was to fail within two years).  In this connection, the company and the husband used an independent insurance broker, Mr Zerfahs and his brother (a credit broker), as a go-between with the lender.  The lender had no direct communication with the wife, nor did Mr Zerfahs communicate with her.  Were it not for one fact, this would be a case which fell into the same category as <i>Wallace</i>.  The potential saving fact for the lender was that the husband had started his deception by persuading his wife to sign the mortgage application form in blank.  One of the boxes in the form was "solicitor's details".  The husband, who was the primary applicant, filled this in with the name of the solicitors who had been instructed by Mr Zerfahs without informing the wife or obtaining her authority: "Quiney &amp; Harris (Nigel Whittaker)" and their address in Wootton Bassett near Swindon.  As a result, on the face of the form sent to the lender there was a single solicitor who was to act on behalf of both applicants.  The wife says that the husband had not obtained her authority to fill in the form in this way; it is agreed that the husband undoubtedly filled in other parts of the form fraudulently.  Having received instructions from Mr Zerfahs, the solicitors, without obtaining confiration from the wife, referred to her and her husband in correspondence as "our clients".  The lender did not obtain any assurance that the wife had received independent advice before signing.  It is the wife's case that she received no advice at all.  This is a disturbing case.  It may turn out (if there is a trial) that the wife is an unreliable witness and that her case cannot be accepted.  But, for present purposes, the lender's case has to depend wholly upon an estoppel arising from her having signed the application form in blank and, it is argued, an inference that she had been separately advised as an independent client by the solicitor.  I do not believe that this is a sound basis for disposing of this case without a trial.  The true facts need to be known.  She was the victim of misrepresentation; the solicitors purported to act on her behalf without any authority to do so; the only document which the lender saw did not suggest anything other than a joint retainer; the lender never checked the position with the wife or sought any confirmation that she was being separately advised.  Discovery of documents and a morning in the County Court would have sorted the matter out more expeditiously and cheaply.  I agree that this appeal should be allowed.</p>
<i></i><p><i>Royal Bank of Scotland v Etridge</i>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;128. This is a case which, after some delay and contested interlocutory proceedings, went to a trial before Judge Behrens.  The wife gave evidence.  The judge found that, on the evidence, she had not been the victim of any actual undue influence.  However he went on to deal with the case on the basis of <i>presumed</i> undue influence.  On appeal, the Court of Appeal upheld the Judge's finding of no actual undue influence; nor did she at either level obtain a finding in her favour that she had been induced to sign by any misrepresentation.  Accordingly, on the correct view of the law, her case failed <i>in limine</i> and none of the other points arose.  Judgment was rightly entered for the bank.  On this ground, I agree that this appeal should be dismissed.  This case provides an object lesson in the dangers of attempting a summary resolution of issues of mixed law and fact without having ascertained the facts.</p>
<i></i><p><i>Gill</i>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;129. This too is a case which went to trial.  The evidence discloses what might have been a case of misrepresentation which possibly could have led to the wife succeeding.  The transaction was presented in a fashion which may have led the wife and the solicitors mistakenly to believe that only an advance of £36,000 was involved, not a probable £100,000.  However, be that as it may, the case advanced by the wife at the trial was that she had been the victim of actual undue influence.  This case was rejected by the Judge and, in any event, there was evidence that the extended scope of the transaction is something which she would in fact have supported and was not causative.  Therefore this case is, in the critical respect, similar to the <i>Etridge</i> case.  She failed to prove the allegation necessary to found her case.  I agree that this appeal should be dismissed.</p>
