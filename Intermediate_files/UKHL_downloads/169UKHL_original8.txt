<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;191.&nbsp;&nbsp;S.129(2) of the Scotland Act also provided that if various provisions of the Scotland Act should come into force before the Human Rights Act had "come into force (or come fully into force)", these provisions should have the same effect as they would have after the Human Rights Act was fully in effect.  Such provisions included sections 29(2)(d) and 57(2) and (3) (making it competent for the Scottish Parliament or Executive to legislate or act incompatibly with Convention rights) as well as section 100. I do not consider that anything can be deduced from the wholesale reference here to section 100. It was on any view necessary to refer to sections 100(1), (2) and (4) and, since section 129(2) covered the possibility that unspecified parts of the Human Rights Act might not yet have come into force, there was reason to cover every possibility by embracing s.100(3) also. In any event, however, I regard this point as marginal and incapable of determining the first issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;192.&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventh, when considering the proper interpretation of the Scotland Act, it is improbable that Parliament envisaged or intended that damages claims in respect of breaches of Convention rights could be brought under the Scotland Act free of the one year time limit applicable to such claims under the Human Rights Act. The improbability is increased when arguments of competence under the Scotland Act only arise in relation to legislation or acts of the Scottish Parliament, Ministers and Executive. Such arguments cannot arise in relation to the acts of other public authorities not part of and not treated (under the principle in <i>Carltona Ltd v. Commissioners of Works </i>[1943] 2 AER 560) as acting on behalf of the Scottish Executive. This latter category includes judges (cf s.9 of the Human Rights Act), and other office-holders with a role independent of the Executive. In answering issue (2) (below) the House is at one in concluding that this category also includes a Prison Governor. It is doubly improbable that Parliament intended that certain Scottish public authorities should benefit by the time limit in s.7(5) of the Human Rights Act in the defence of claims against them for conduct incompatible with Convention rights, whereas others certainly do not.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Conclusion on issue 1</p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;193.&nbsp;&nbsp;I find myself, as a result, in full agreement with Lord Reed in the High Court of Justiciary in <i>HM Advocate v R </i>2001 SLT 1366, para. 40, when he said that "Where the act is not delictual under the ordinary law, then section 57(2) [of the Scotland Act] does not confer upon the court a power to award damages" and that in that situation "the only effective remedy may lie under sections 7 to 9 of the Human Rights Act". The same conclusion is spelled out by the Inner House in para. 80 of its opinion in the present case, where, while recognising that issues of vires could be raised under the Scotland Act, the Inner House held that "there is no need to look for a basis for a claim for damages in the Scotland Act" when ss.7 and 8 of the Human Rights Act provided one. With this, I agree. On appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in <i>HM Advocate</i> <i>v R </i>[2002] UKPC D3; [2004] 1 AC 462, I understand my noble and learned friends, Lord Hope of Craighead (at para. 50-51) and Lord Rodger of Earlsferry (at paras. 121-123) to have been addressing an either-or choice between two extreme analyses - <i>either</i> the Scotland Act gave rise to no constitutional remedies at all <i>or</i> all remedies including damages in respect of any infringement of Convention rights leading under the Scotland Act to invalidity of Scottish legislation or of an act or omission of the Scottish Ministers or Executive had to be found in or by reference to that Act. Neither analysis would in my opinion be correct. The situation is different from that considered in <i>Simpson v. Attorney-General (Baigent's Case) </i>[1994] 3 NZLR 667, where the unattractive argument advanced to the New Zealand Court of Appeal was that there was no relevant remedy in damages at all in respect of breach of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. Here there is a closely related constitutional measure, the Human Rights Act, which explicitly provides for the relevant remedy. The correct analysis is a nuanced analysis which recognises the different functions of the two Acts. The Scotland Act regulates the competence of the Scottish Parliament and Executive and enables its control (at the instance of a "victim", or of the Lord Advocate, Advocate General or Attorney General representing the public interest).  One (though only one) aspect of competence is compatibility with the Convention. But claims for damages for conduct incompatible with Convention rights belong to the context of the Human Rights Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;194.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal on issue 1 and hold that the appellants' damages claims against the Scottish Ministers can only be pursued under ss.6-8 and are subject, therefore, in particular to the time limit in s.7(5) of the Human Rights Act.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Issue 2 - does a Prison Governor's order under rule 80(1) count as an act of the Scottish Ministers? </p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;195.&nbsp;&nbsp;This question arises from the submission made by both the Scottish Ministers and the Lord Advocate as intervener that the appellants' complaints about the Prison Governors' exercise of their powers under rule 80(1) of The Prisoners and Young Offenders Institutions (Scotland) Rules 1994 (1994 No. 1931 (S.85)) do not involve any claim against the Scottish Ministers, and, even if the appeal succeeds on issue 1, can therefore only be pursued under ss.6-8 of the Human Rights Act.  Although I consider that the appeal on issue 1 should fail, issue 2 is not entirely academic, since it raises the question to what extent the Scottish Ministers (the only respondents in the present proceedings) are answerable for the alleged acts or defaults of the Prison Governors. In my view the Scottish Ministers' and Lord Advocate's submission on this point is correct for the reasons more fully given by my noble and learned friend Lord Rodger or Earlsferry in his opinion. The <i>Carltona </i>principle does not apply to the acts or omissions of persons exercising an independent decision-making function, not as part of or on behalf of the Scottish Ministers. Such persons have of course to exercise their functions compatibly with the Convention rights. But the remedy in the event of failure to do so is, on any view of the answer to issue 1, under the Human Rights Act.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Issue 3 - the running of time under s.7(5) of the Human Rights Act</p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;196.&nbsp;&nbsp;As Lord Hope explains (para. 5) this issue only affects the petitioners Henderson and Blanco. Henderson commenced proceedings more than one year after the end of four of the periods of segregation of which he complains. Blanco commenced proceedings on 6 November 2003, in respect of his segregation under a series of orders made over time between 1 August 2002 and 7 January 2003. Each order made in the cases of Henderson and Blanco was initially made by the Prison Governor for a maximum period of 72 hours, but was within that period authorised and so extended by the Scottish Ministers for one month from the expiry of the 72 hour period: cf rule 80(1), (5) and (6). It was under rule 80(7) open to the Prison Governor at any time to cancel such an order or to vary it to restrict its effect. Potentially, therefore, Henderson and Blanco have complaints about the making and/or authorisation of each order and/or about the Prison Governor's failure to cancel or vary it during its operation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;197.&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming that s.7(5) of the Human Rights Act applies, the language of s.7(5) appears to me clear-cut. The starting point is to identify "the date on which the act complained of took place".  Each monthly order and authorisation constitutes for that purpose a separate act. Subject to any shorter time limit, a segregated prisoner who complains of segregation pursuant to any such order or authorisation must do so within one year of the relevant order or authorisation under s.7(5)(a), or ask the court to grant an "equitable" extension under s.7(5)(b). Similarly, so far as the complaint is that during any monthly period the Prison Governor failed to exercise his power under rule 80(7) to cancel or vary, that complaint can under s.7(5)(a) only relate to any such failure occurring within the year prior to the bringing of proceedings, or otherwise the court's discretion must be invoked under s.7(5)(b). No doubt, the court's equitable discretion would be exercised to take account of the fact of continuing segregation (although segregation does not equate with absence of access to legal assistance) as well as the undesirability of confining attention to only part of an overall picture. The fact of any prior segregation (even if the time limit did prevent it being the subject of any claim) would also be relevant when considering the justification for any subsequent segregation in relation to which any complaint was not time barred.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Issue 4 - proportionality </p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;198.&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Lord Hope's observations on this issue and his conclusion that it would not be appropriate to decide it in the present circumstances.</p>
<i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Issue 5 - inspection by the judge of the redacted documents</p>
</i><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;199.&nbsp;&nbsp;On 21 July and 18th August 2004 the Lord Ordinary granted diligence, or made an order, against the havers, the Scottish Ministers, for the recovery, or disclosure, of documents listed in a specification. These included documents showing or tending to show the applications and grants of authority to segregate, assessments of the need to segregate and incident and intelligence reports. Evidently, the Lord Advocate had already made plain that documents or parts of documents would be withheld on grounds of public interest immunity ("PII"), since, on the same occasion, the Lord Ordinary acceded to a procedure set out in a protocol agreed between counsel, whereby counsel for the petitioners was to be permitted to inspect such documents, with the names and addresses obscured of any informer and of any other person whose identity, if disclosed, would put that person at risk of harm. This procedure was explained to be for the purpose of counsel for the petitioners advancing any argument that the court should override the claim to PII. Counsel undertook not to disclose the contents of the documents to any other person, including his clients or their agents, unless and to the extent that the court should override the PII claim. Counsel was permitted to make laptop notes of the documents seen, but not to print them out or transmit them elsewhere, and undertook to delete them from the hard drive after all issues relating to the assertion of PII had finally been resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;200.&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspection took place on this basis. Subsequently, the Minister for Justice by certificate dated 21 October 2004 stated that she had inspected the full unredacted text of the documents and on that basis made a formal PII claim in respect of references, names and passages in the documents. The claim went extensively beyond the limited redactions in the documents inspected by counsel for the petitioners. Its effect was that in a number of cases the whole document was blanked out, while in others a highly redacted version was provided. The public interest claimed related to matters such as the identity of informers, the nature and source of information received, the identity, deployment or training of staff and operational information, capabilities, techniques, tactics and methods, all capable of giving rise to considerations of public interest immunity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;201.&nbsp;&nbsp;The House was shown examples of the more extensively redacted documents, and was told that there are some 75 now in issue. No comment is possible on those documents which are completely blanked out. It cannot be known into what category they fall. Some comments may be made about the documents which are partially obscured. For example, the standard prison information and intelligence report form lists four possible categories of source, ranging from a source which has "proved to be reliable in all instances and where there is no doubt about authenticity and competence" to "a previously untried source or a source who so far has proved unreliable". Mr O'Neill submits with force that the justification for segregation on the basis of information and intelligence may well depend upon which category of source has provided the same. Yet the category of source (and not simply any name) is obscured in many documents. So also is the evaluation and even the action taken. Contemporaneous accounts of alleged incidents leading to segregation orders have also been deleted. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;202.&nbsp;&nbsp;The petitioners in these circumstances sought full disclosure (subject to the redactions made to the documents as seen by their counsel), and they invited the Lord Ordinary to inspect the relevant documents for herself to form a judgment on the balance between the public interest and the interests of justice in relation to the petitioners' claims. She declined to inspect and the Inner House upheld her decision.  She said that counsel had failed specifically to identify any particular document as required in the furtherance of any specific issue or as relating to any particular period of segregation. Her primary reason for rejecting the submission that matters bearing on the evaluation of intelligence material should be revealed was her decision that the case that the segregation was disproportionate was inadmissible. But whether the segregation was disproportionate remains a potentially relevant issue in relation to the petitioners' claims which are based on the Convention. The Lord Ordinary nevertheless declined herself to inspect, taking the view that this would fall foul of Lord Fraser of Tullybelton's injunction in <i>Air Canada v. Secretary of State for Trade </i>[1983] 2 AC 394, 436C-D that it "should …. not be encouraged to 'take a peep' just on the off chance of finding something useful".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;203.&nbsp;&nbsp;I must start by expressing disagreement with the Inner House's view that the course adopted under the parties' protocol and endorsed by the Lord Ordinary is to be encouraged. On the contrary, in my view. It involves disclosure to another party's (here the petitioners') counsel of material which the public interest may require should not be disclosed to anyone other than the Scottish Executive. It puts counsel in an invidious and unsustainable position in relation to his or her client. In this respect the observations in <i>R v. Davis </i>[1993] 1 WLR 613, 616H-617H per Lord Taylor of Gosforth CJ, <i>R v. Preston </i>[1994] 2 AC 130, 152H-153D, per Lord Mustill and <i>R v. B &amp; G </i>[2004] EWCA Crim 1368, para. 13, per Rose V-P are relevant, although made in a criminal context. As in this case, such a procedure may also put counsel into a position where he or she is uncertain what it is permissible to disclose or say when making submissions to the court about PII. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;204.&nbsp;&nbsp;The procedure has no precedent of which I am aware in the present context, and should not become one. As in a criminal context, issues of PII should so far as possible be discussed in open court in the presence of both parties. In some circumstances, the nature of the documents may make it appropriate for the judge to hear submissions (and if necessary evidence) from the haver in the absence of anyone else, and even for the claim to PII itself only to be made ex parte.  If a PII claim cannot be determined on the basis on which it is advanced without further consideration of the content of the relevant documents, it is for the court itself to undertake the task of inspecting the documents to confirm whether or not the documents should be provided to the party applying for them and with what if any redactions. The court may in exceptional circumstances consider it appropriate to invite the appointment of independent counsel to give it assistance (compare <i>R v. H </i>[2004] 2 AC 134, paras. 22 and 36(4) per Lord Bingham of Cornhill). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;205.&nbsp;&nbsp;The House in the <i>Air Canada </i>case considered that there was a threshold to be crossed before a court would agree to inspect documents for itself. There was some variation in the language in which this threshold was expressed. Mere relevance is clearly not sufficient, since a claim to PII necessarily postulates relevance. The test of inspection adopted by Lord Scarman was "likelihood that the documents will be necessary for disposing fairly of the case or saving costs" (p.445B); he added that "if …. the court should think that the documents might be 'determinative' of the issues …., the court should inspect" (p.445B). As Professor Adrian Zuckerman observes in <i>Civil Procedure </i>(2nd ed.) para. 18.19, too rigid an application of the threshold requirement would mean that a claim to PII would become automatic in many cases, depriving the balancing exercise of meaningful content. Different considerations may, as he goes on to point out, apply where national security is in issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;206.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case the matters in respect of PII is claimed are unrelated to national security, but they centre on decisions to segregate and to continue segregation which are said by the petitioners to have been unjustified and/or unreasonable or disproportionate. The documents are presently redacted in a way which appears likely to make it either impossible or extremely difficult to understand or evaluate the actual decision-making process. The basis for and reasoning behind the decisions are central to any resolution of the issues raised by the petitioners' claims. The petitioners by their claims challenge any suggestion that they were involved in any conduct justifying their segregation or continued segregation. The apparent centrality of the contents of the documents to the issues raised by the claims cannot or should not be dismissed at this stage on a basis which comes close to simply assuming that the claims have no real foundation. Whether this is so, and what support the documents may give to the petitioners' evidence, can only sensibly be judged by inspection. Counsel for the petitioners, who has (however inappropriately) seen the documents in a largely unredacted form, was able to submit to the judge that they were of real importance to his clients' claims.  He felt, not surprisingly, inhibited about the extent to which he could base any specific submissions on the fuller contents of documents that he had seen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;207.&nbsp;&nbsp;I consider that, in the circumstances of this case and bearing in mind the apparent centrality of the documents to the issues which it involves, the Lord Ordinary ought to have acceded to the application to inspect the documents for herself. Neither the number nor the nature of the documents involved would appear to have presented any obstacle. It would also have proved a simpler, quicker and certainly more appropriate procedure than that which has led to the appeal on this issue.</p>
