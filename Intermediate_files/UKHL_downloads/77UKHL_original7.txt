<p class="para">165.&nbsp;&nbsp;As already mentioned, it seems to me that these problems are much easier to solve if, as I believe it should be, the comparator issue is determined in favour of the narrower construction. Once one decides that discrimination under section 24(1)(a) involves comparing the treatment of the disabled person with the treatment of a non-disabled person who is otherwise in the same position, the attention to the reason for the treatment becomes more focussed, and there is much less room for uncertainty or injustice. The sort of problem thrown up by facts such as those in <i>Richmond Court </i>simply does not arise. Further, on this approach, there is no policy reason for adopting anything other than a comparatively generous approach to the question of the link between the treatment and the disability.</p>
<p class="para">166.&nbsp;&nbsp; In my view, it is plain that the “reason” in section 24(1)(a) cannot be confined to the legal ground, because a prospective landlord, under section 22(1)  has a legal right to refuse to let as, and on the terms, he chooses. Also, if a landlord voluntarily agreed with all but one of his tenants in a block of flats to vary the user covenants in their leases in some beneficial way, but did not accord that privilege to a tenant because he was disabled, it would be absurd if that was not a “reason” within section 24(1)(a). Additionally, the fact that knowledge of the disability (including what should be known) is required, supports the argument that one is normally primarily concerned with the state of mind of the alleged discriminator. Crucially, this is also supported by the language of section 22(1): the reference to the “reason” for the treatment supports the notion that one is concerned with the alleged discriminator’s subjective motivation, rather than with the objective legal ground.</p>
<p class="para">167.&nbsp;&nbsp;For similar reasons, I consider that, when identifying “the reason” for the purposes of section 24(1)(a), in the context of a claim for possession which concerns an individual tenant rather than a group of tenants, it would normally not be appropriate simply to look at the landlord’s broad policy ground. What requires to be identified is the specific ground which applies to the particular case. Thus, in the present case, I do not believe that the “reason” should be treated as being Lewisham’s desire to manage its housing stock or not to have a non-resident tenant or to enforce its tenants’ covenants. As already mentioned, such a reason would, at least normally, be outside the ambit of section 24(1)(a), and consequently would enable a landlord to avoid the reach of the section in almost every case; for instance, by saying that his policy was to obtain possession of any property in his portfolio whenever he had a legal ground for doing so.</p>
<p class="para">168.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, that obviously does not mean that the legal ground will be irrelevant to the “reason". Indeed, where there is a legal ground, it will be centrally important given my conclusion on the comparator issue, as the legal ground would be assumed to apply to the comparator.</p>
<p class="para">169.&nbsp;&nbsp;The words “relates to” suggest that a relatively loose or indirect connection between the reason and the disability would suffice. In agreement with Toulson LJ (at para 146 in the Court of Appeal), I would expect that the link between the “treatment” and the “disability” would always, or at least almost always, be causal, but not in the limited sense in which that term is used in other fields - e.g. in tort. I find it very hard to conceive of circumstances where the “but for” test was satisfied without the link being established, but I am not prepared to say that such a case could not arise. It may also be that in some cases the link could exist where that test was not satisfied. Given that the comparator required by section 24(1)(a) leads to the section having a relatively narrow ambit, it would be more consistent with the purpose of the 1995 Act, and unlikely to be unfairly prejudicial to alleged discriminators, if a broad and flexible effect is given to the words “relating to".</p>
<p class="para">170.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, I consider that there would have been a causal link between the reason and the disability, if, contrary to the conclusion of the Judge, the subletting was in some way linked to Mr Malcolm’s schizophrenia. The treatment to which he was subjected was eviction, and the reason for this can fairly be characterised as being that he had sublet. However, because it cannot, and was not, suggested that Lewisham would have treated any other secure tenant who had sublet differently from Mr Malcolm, there could be no discrimination in the light of the conclusion I have reached on the comparator issue. </p>
<p class="para">171.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the wider comparator construction (adopted by the Court of Appeal<i> </i>and preferred by Baroness Hale) is correct, then there would have been discrimination, if there had been a sufficient link between the disability and the subletting. Lewisham would not have sought, or have been able to seek, possession against Mr Malcolm if the flat had not been sublet, as it was the subletting which deprived Mr Malcolm of security of tenure and which put him in breach of covenant. Accordingly, on the wider construction of the comparator test, if there was a causal link between Mr Malcolm’s schizophrenia and the subletting, there would be a sufficient connection between the “reason” and the “treatment” to engage section 24(1)(a). I therefore turn to consider that issue, although, on my view, it is academic. </p>
<i><p class="para">The link between Mr Malcolm’s subletting and his disability</p>
</i>
<p class="para">172.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the facts, the Judge found that the subletting “was a planned decision closely linked with [the]… proposed purchase on mortgage” and that she could “not conclude, on all the evidence … that [it] was an irrational act … caused by [Mr Malcolm’s] illness". For reasons given in paras 105 to 108 of Arden LJ’s judgment, she and Longmore LJ (at para 132) overruled that finding, although Toulson LJ had doubts on the point<i> </i>(para 150).  </p>
<p class="para">173.&nbsp;&nbsp;I share Toulson LJ’s doubts; indeed, I am of the view that the Court of Appeal ought not to have overruled the Judge’s conclusion on this issue. She saw Mr Malcolm and heard him give evidence, which did not generally impress her as reliable, and she took into account documents he had executed, conversations he had had, and transactions he had entered into, around the time of the subletting. </p>
<p class="para">174.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am unpersuaded by the point that the Judge’s conclusion on this issue was somehow infected by her mistaken conclusion on the anterior issue of whether Mr Malcolm was “disabled". Her mistake was not as to the nature or extent of his schizophrenia: it was as to whether it was sufficiently serious to fall within section 1(1) of the 1995 Act. Nor does it appear to me that the Judge overlooked any relevant facts. Dr Sivasathan did not help on this issue. Dr Steadman was not able to say that Mr Malcolm’s schizophrenia was so severe as to make it likely that the subletting was relevant to his decision and action in subletting the flat; he merely said that it “may well have been". Thus, it was a matter for the Judge to decided, on the basis of the evidence, whether what “may well” have been the case was in fact what happened. </p>
<p class="para">175.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true, as pointed out by Arden LJ, that the Judge did not mention that Mr Malcolm was not advised by solicitors about subletting. However, that was consistent with the behaviour of a sensible non-disabled person, who wished to save money or appreciated that a breach of covenant was involved. The notion that Mr Malcolm appreciated the need to keep the subletting secret is consistent with his subsequent denial to Lewisham that it had taken place. Nor does it appear to me that there was anything inherently unlikely in a secure tenant subletting, thereby imperilling his tenancy and his right to buy. It involved a commercial risk which no doubt many people in Mr Malcolm’s position would not have taken, but it was a risk which both experience and perusal of housing law reports suggest secure tenants are not uncommonly prepared to run, and no doubt frequently get away with. It is true that Mr Malcolm had worked in Lewisham’s housing department and, for many years before that, with a housing association, but, for all one knows, his experience may have suggested to him that his subletting would remain undiscovered by Lewisham.</p>
<p class="para">176.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also said that the Judge misdirected herself by setting too high a standard when she asked herself the question: “was the subletting caused by Mr Malcolm’s schizophrenic illness?” I do not agree. The word “caused” was not in my judgment used by the Judge to indicate any higher standard of linkage between Mr Malcolm’s schizophrenia and his subletting of the flat than was warranted. It is clear from her reasoning that she took the view that Mr Malcolm had taken a risk by subletting the flat before he completed the purchase, and that his assessment of the risk was not influenced by his schizophrenia. If that conclusion had been inconsistent with the medical evidence, or had been one that no reasonable judge could have reached in the light of other evidence, there would have been grounds for interfering. But it was not. </p>
