<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112.&nbsp;&nbsp;In reaching this conclusion Lord Bingham had regard to the well-known words of Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead in <i>In re S (Minors) (Care Order:  Implementation of Care Plan)</i> <i> </i>[2002] 2 AC 291, 313, para 39, where the relevant distinction is drawn:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The Human Rights Act reserves the amendment of primary legislation to Parliament.  By this means the Act seeks to preserve parliamentary sovereignty.  The Act maintains the constitutional boundary.  Interpretation of statutes is a matter for the courts; the enactment of statutes, and the amendment of statutes, are matters for Parliament."<p></p></ul>
<p>Whatever can be done by way of interpretation must be done by the courts and anyone else who is affected by the legislation in question.  The rest is left to Parliament and amounts to amendment of the legislation.  As Lord Nicholls pointed out, it is by no means easy to decide in the abstract where the boundary lies between robust interpretation and amendment, but, he added, at p 313, para 40: </p>
<p></p><ul>"For present purposes it is sufficient to say that a meaning which departs substantially from a fundamental feature of an Act of Parliament is likely to have crossed the boundary between interpretation and amendment.  This is especially so where the departure has important practical repercussions which the court is not equipped to evaluate.  In such a case the overall contextual setting may leave no scope for rendering the statutory provision Convention compliant by legitimate use of the process of interpretation.  The boundary line may be crossed even though a limitation on Convention rights is not stated in express terms."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113.&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem facing the House in <i>In re S </i>was, in some ways, the opposite of the problem that was to come before the House in <i>R (Anderson) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</i>.  In the earlier case, the interpretation of the Children Act 1989 which the Court of Appeal had adopted in reliance on articles 6 and 8 of the Convention did not involve removing any power from a statutory body.  Rather, in the view of the House, the starring system devised by the Court of Appeal involved conferring on the courts a power to supervise the way in which local authorities discharged their parental responsibilities under final care orders.  This was to depart substantially from "a cardinal principle" of the Children Act, that the courts are not empowered to intervene in the way local authorities discharge their responsibilities under such orders:  [2002] 2 AC 291, 314, para 42.  Lord Nicholls, with whom all the other members of the House agreed, went on to hold, in para 43, that the innovation made by the Court of Appeal "passes well beyond the boundary of interpretation".  There was no provision in the Children Act that lent itself to the interpretation that Parliament was conferring this supervisory function on the court.  On the contrary, conferring such a function was inconsistent in an important respect with the scheme of the Act.  "It would constitute amendment of the Children Act, not its interpretation."  In that situation it was not possible to "read in" to the Act or any of its provisions a power to set up such a system.  That would be to produce a meaning that departed substantially from a fundamental feature of the Act and so crossed the boundary between interpretation and amendment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114.&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, it is important to notice that the problem identified by the House did not derive from any perceived difficulty in finding language to frame a power to require a report on the progress of the local authority; rather, the problem was that, however the courts might frame the power, they would be introducing something which was not to be found in the Children Act - and, more particularly, something which was actually inconsistent with one of its cardinal principles.  If such a change to the Act was to be made, Parliament would have to make it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second passage from his speech in <i>In re S </i>which I have quoted in paragraph 112 above, Lord Nicholls made the further point that a departure from a fundamental feature of an Act of Parliament may be more readily treated as crossing the boundary into the realm of amendment where it has important practical repercussions which the court is not equipped to evaluate.  It appears to me that difficult questions may also arise where, even if the proposed interpretation does not run counter to any underlying principle of the legislation, it would involve reading into the statute powers or duties with far-reaching practical repercussions of that kind.  In effect these powers or duties, if sufficiently far-reaching, would be beyond the scope of the legislation enacted by Parliament.  If that is right, the answer to such questions cannot be clear-cut and will involve matters of degree which cannot be determined in the abstract but only by considering the particular legislation in issue.  In any given case, however, there may come a point where, standing back, the only proper conclusion is that the scale of what is proposed would go beyond any implication that could possibly be derived from reading the existing legislation in a way that was compatible with the Convention right in question.  In that event, the boundary line will have been crossed and only Parliament can effect the necessary change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he was disagreeing with the other members of the House on the interpretation point, the approach of Lord Hope of Craighead in <i>R v A (No 2) </i>[2002] 1 AC 45, 87, para 109, is similar to the reasoning of Lord Nicholls in <i>In re S</i>.  In Lord Hope's view, "the entire structure of section 41" of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 contradicted the idea of reading into it a new provision entitling the court to give leave for evidence to be led of the complainant's previous sexual behaviour with the accused whenever this was required to ensure a fair trial.  It seemed to him that "it would not be possible" to read in such a provision "without contradicting the plain intention of Parliament" in section 41(2) to forbid the exercise of such a discretion unless the court is satisfied as to the matters identified by that subsection.  In his view Parliament had taken a deliberate decision not to follow examples to be found elsewhere of provisions giving the court an overriding discretion to admit such evidence.  In the phraseology of Lord Nicholls in <i>In re S</i>, for Lord Hope this was a "cardinal principle" of section 41 and it was not open to the courts to read the section in such a way as to depart substantially from it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was in this context that Lord Hope expressed the view, [2002] 1 AC 45, 87, para 108, that it will not be possible to achieve compatibility with Convention rights by using section 3(1) "if the legislation contains provisions which expressly contradict the meaning which the enactment would have to be given to make it compatible" or, indeed, if the legislation contains provisions which do so by necessary implication.  Lord Hope repeated this observation in <i>R v Lambert </i>[2002] 2 AC 545, 585, para 79, and, for the reasons I have already given, I agree with it.  But this is not to say that, where a provision can be read compatibly with the Convention without contradicting any principle that it enshrines or the principles of the legislation as a whole, such an interpretation is not possible simply because it may involve reading into the provision words which go further than the specific words used by the draftsman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;118.&nbsp;&nbsp;When Parliament provided that, "so far as it is possible to do so", legislation must be read and given effect compatibly with Convention rights, it was referring, at the least, to the broadest powers of interpreting legislation that the courts had exercised before 1998.  In particular, Parliament will have been aware of what the courts had done in order to meet their obligation to interpret domestic legislation "<i>so far as possible</i>, in the light of the wording and the purpose of the [Community] directive in order to achieve the result pursued by the latter…": <i>Marleasing SA v La Comercial  Internacional de Alimentación SA </i>(Case C-106/89) [1990] ECR I-4135, 4159, para 8 (emphasis added).  Both <i>Pickstone v Freemans plc </i>[1989] AC 66 and <i>Litster v Forth Dry Dock &amp; Engineering Co Ltd </i>[1990] 1AC 546 show how, long before 1998, this House had found it possible to read words into domestic regulations so as to give them a construction which accorded with the provisions of the underlying Community directive.  As Lord Oliver of Aylmerton noted in <i>Litster</i>, at p 577A - B, <i>Pickstone </i>had established that</p>
<p></p><ul>"the greater flexibility available to the court in applying a purposive construction to legislation designed to give effect to the United Kingdom's Treaty obligations to the Community enables the court, where necessary, to supply by implication words appropriate to comply with those obligations…."<p></p></ul>
<p>Lord Oliver was satisfied that the implication which he judged appropriate in that case was entirely consistent with the general scheme of the domestic regulations and was necessary if they were effectively to fulfil their purpose of giving effect to the provisions of the directive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;119.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Lordships are also familiar with the exercise which has to be carried out under some Caribbean constitutions to bring existing laws into conformity with the rights guaranteed by the constitution.  In <i>R v Lambert </i>[2002] 2 AC 545, 587, paras 85 and 86, Lord Hope cites two examples, <i>Vasquez v The Queen </i>[1994] 1 WLR 1304 and <i>Yearwood v The Queen </i>[2001] UKPC 31;  [2001] 5 LRC 247.  Both of them show how far the Privy Council has been prepared to go in substituting very different words for the words of the relevant provision in order to bring it into conformity with the relevant rights guaranteed by the constitution.  Such cases are instructive in suggesting that, where the court finds it possible to read a provision in a way which is compatible with Convention rights, such a reading may involve a considerable departure from the actual words.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120.&nbsp;&nbsp;In other respects, however, the Privy Council decisions may not provide a sure guide to the approach to be adopted under section 3(1).  They are all concerned with constitutions that are the supreme law, with which other laws must conform on pain of invalidity.  Clearly, that applies irrespective of whether the effect of the constitution is to make the whole, or only part, of a law invalid and also irrespective of the legislature's intention in enacting the law.  The typical constitution, or constitutional order-in-council, contains a provision to the effect that existing laws are to be "construed with such modifications, adaptations, qualifications and exceptions as may be necessary to bring them into conformity with" the constitution.  I have taken these words from section 134(1) of the Constitution of Belize, which was under consideration in <i>Vasquez v The Queen</i>.  The language of such provisions may be thought to go even further than the language of section 3(1) of the 1998 Act, especially in saying that existing laws are to be construed with such modifications etc "as may be <i>necessary</i>" to bring them into conformity with the constitution.  In particular, since the constitution is supreme, the necessary modifications to a law may well involve making what, in the present context, would properly be regarded as amendments to the legislation.  I refer in particular to the judgment of Lord Nicholls in <i>Rojas v Berllaque (Attorney General for Gibraltar intervening)</i>  [2004] 1 WLR 201, 208-209, para 24 where, in relation to a similar "far-reaching obligation on courts" in Gibraltar, he said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The court is enjoined, without any qualification, to construe the offending legislation with whatever modifications are necessary to bring it into conformity with the Constitution."<p></p></ul>
<p>He added:</p>
<p></p><ul>"There may of course be cases where an offending law does not lend itself to a sensible interpretation which would conform to the relevant Constitution."<p></p></ul>
<p>By contrast, the 1998 Act deliberately maintains the sovereignty of Parliament and section 3(1) is framed accordingly.  For that reason, the Privy Council authorities should be treated with some caution since they are the product of constitutional systems which differ from that of the United Kingdom in this important respect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121.&nbsp;&nbsp;For present purposes, it is sufficient to notice that cases such as <i>Pickstone v Freemans plc </i> and <i>Litster v Forth Dry Dock &amp; Engineering Co Ltd </i>suggest that, in terms of section 3(1) of the 1998 Act, it is possible for the courts to supply by implication words that are appropriate to ensure that legislation is read in a way which is compatible with Convention rights.  When the court spells out the words that are to be implied, it may look as if it is "amending" the legislation, but that is not the case.  If the court implies words that are consistent with the scheme of the legislation but necessary to make it compatible with Convention rights, it is simply performing the duty which Parliament has imposed on it and on others.  It is reading the legislation in a way that draws out the full implications of its terms and of the Convention rights.  And, by its very nature, an implication will go with the grain of the legislation.  By contrast, using a Convention right to read in words that are inconsistent with the scheme of the legislation or with its essential principles as disclosed by its provisions does not involve any form of interpretation, by implication or otherwise.  It falls on the wrong side of the boundary between interpretation and amendment of the statute.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122.&nbsp;&nbsp;When Housman addressed the meeting of the Classical Association in Cambridge in 1921, he reminded them that the key to the sound emendation of a corrupt text does not lie in altering the text by changing one letter rather than by supplying half a dozen words.  The key is that the emendation must start from a careful consideration of the writer's thought.  Similarly, the key to what it is possible for the courts to imply into legislation without crossing the border from interpretation to amendment does not lie in the number of words that have to be read in.  The key lies in a careful consideration of the essential principles and scope of the legislation being interpreted.  If the insertion of one word contradicts those principles or goes beyond the scope of the legislation, it amounts to impermissible amendment.  On the other hand, if the implication of a dozen words leaves the essential principles and scope of the legislation intact but allows it to be read in a way which is compatible with Convention rights, the implication is a legitimate exercise of the powers conferred by section 3(1).  Of course, the greater the extent of the proposed implication, the greater the need to make sure that the court is not going beyond the scheme of the legislation and embarking upon amendment.  Nevertheless, what matters is not the number of words but their effect.  For this reason, in the Community law context, judges have rightly been concerned with the effect of any proposed implication, but have been relaxed about its exact form.  See, for example, Lord Keith of Kinkel and Lord Oliver in<i> Pickstone v Freemans plc </i>[1989] AC 66, 112D and 126A - B.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123.&nbsp;&nbsp;Attaching decisive importance to the precise adjustments required to the language of any particular provision would reduce the exercise envisaged by section 3(1) to a game where the outcome would depend in part on the particular turn of phrase chosen by the draftsman and in part on the skill of the court in devising brief formulae to make the provision compatible with Convention rights.  The statute book is the work of many different hands in different parliaments over hundreds of years and, even today, two different draftsmen might choose different language to express the same proposition.  In enacting section 3(1), it cannot have been the intention of Parliament to place those asserting their rights at the mercy of the linguistic choices of the individual who happened to draft the provision in question.  What matters is not so much the particular phraseology chosen by the draftsman as the substance of the measure which Parliament has enacted in those words.  Equally, it cannot have been the intention of Parliament to place a premium on the skill of those called on to think up a neat way round the draftsman's language.  Parliament was not out to devise an entertaining parlour game for lawyers, but, so far as possible, to make legislation operate compatibly with Convention rights.  This means concentrating on matters of substance, rather than on matters of mere language.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;124.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes it may be possible to isolate a particular phrase which causes the difficulty and to read in words that modify it so as to remove the incompatibility.  Or else the court may read in words that qualify the provision as a whole.  At other times the appropriate solution may be to read down the provision so that it falls to be given effect in a way that is compatible with the Convention rights in question.  In other cases the easiest solution may be to put the offending part of the provision into different words which convey the meaning that will be compatible with those rights.  The preferred technique will depend on the particular provision and also, in reality, on the person doing the interpreting.  This does not matter since they are simply different means of achieving the same substantive result.  However, precisely because section 3(1) is to be operated by many others besides the courts, and because it is concerned with interpreting and not with amending the offending provision, it respectfully seems to me that it would be going too far to insist that those using the section to interpret legislation should match the standards to be expected of a parliamentary draftsman amending the provision:  cf <i>R v Lambert </i>[2002] 2 AC 545, 585, para 80 per Lord Hope of Craighead.  It is enough that the interpretation placed on the provision should be clear, however it may be expressed and whatever the precise means adopted to achieve it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lords, in the light of that discussion, I can deal fairly briefly with the particular provisions with which the House is concerned in the present case, paragraphs 2 and 3 of Schedule 1 to the Rent Act 1977.  The House considered them in detail in <i>Fitzpatrick v Sterling Housing Association Ltd </i>[2001] 1 AC 27 which concerned the claim by the survivor of a long-term homosexual relationship to be treated as "the surviving spouse" of the original tenant in terms of para 2.  The House unanimously rejected that claim, but, by a majority, held that he fell to be considered as "a member of the original tenant's family" in terms of para 3.  So he was entitled to an assured tenancy rather than a statutory tenancy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;126.&nbsp;&nbsp;In reaching the conclusion that the appellant should be regarded as a member of the original tenant's family, the majority identified the characteristics of such a person for the purposes of the Rent Act.  Lord Nicholls put the matter in this way [2001] 1 AC 27, 44A - D:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The question calling for decision in the present case is a question of statutory interpretation.  It is whether a same sex partner is capable of being a member of the other partner's family for the purposes of the Rent Act legislation.  I am in no doubt that this question should be answered affirmatively.  A man and woman living together in a stable and permanent sexual relationship are capable of being members of a family for this purpose.  Once this is accepted, there can be no rational or other basis on which the like conclusion can be withheld from a similarly stable and permanent sexual relationship between two men or between two women.  Where a relationship of this character exists, it cannot make sense to say that, although a heterosexual partnership can give rise to membership of a family for Rent Act purposes, a homosexual partnership cannot.  Where sexual partners are involved, whether heterosexual or homosexual, there is scope for the intimate mutual love and affection and long-term commitment that typically characterise the relationship of husband and wife.  This love and affection and commitment can exist in same sex relationships as in heterosexual relationships.  In sexual terms a homosexual relationship is different from a heterosexual relationship, but I am unable to see that the difference is material for present purposes.  As already emphasised, the concept underlying membership of a family for present purposes is the sharing of lives together in a single family unit living in one house."<p></p></ul>
<p>Lord Slynn of Hadley and Lord Clyde reasoned to similar effect:  [2001] 1 AC 27, 38B - 39C and 51H - 52E respectively.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;127.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, some homosexual relationships of the type described by Lord Nicholls will have lasted longer and will have been happier than others. The same goes for the equivalent long-term heterosexual relationships. What these passages make clear, however, is that a long-term homosexual relationship is to be treated as being the same as a long-term heterosexual relationship in all respects save in sexual terms.  There is no material difference between them, so far as membership of the original tenant's family is concerned for the purposes of the Rent Act.  As Lord Nicholls pointed out, [2001] 1 AC 27, 42A - B, the wife is a member of her husband's family and the husband is a member of his wife's family.  Therefore, the only reason why the House held that a homosexual partner could not be regarded as "the surviving spouse" of the original tenant in terms of para 2(1) was that the extended definition of "spouse" in para 2(2) ("a person who was living with the original tenant as his or her wife or husband") was framed in a way that connoted a relationship between two persons of opposite sexes.  That must be the starting point of any consideration of the matter in the present case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;128.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reasons which Lord Nicholls has given in his speech, I am satisfied that treating the survivors of long-term homosexual partnerships less favourably than the survivors of long-term heterosexual partnerships for purposes of the Rent Act 1977 violates their right under article 14 in relation to article 8(1) of the Convention.  Nor, in respectful disagreement with Lord Millett on this particular point, can I discern any principle underlying the Act as a whole, or Schedule 1 in particular, which requires that only the survivor of a long-term heterosexual relationship should be treated as a statutory tenant.  All that seems to have happened is that, when Schedule 1 was amended in 1988, Parliament chose to extend the concept of "spouse" to someone who had lived with the original tenant in a long-term heterosexual relationship, but did not go any further.  As was recognised in <i>Fitzpatrick v Sterling Housing Association Ltd</i>, society has moved on since 1988.  In this particular context, even if there once was, there is no longer any reason in principle for not including within the concept of "spouse" someone who had lived with the original tenant in an equivalent long-term, but homosexual, relationship.  To interpret para 2 so as to include such a person would, of course, involve extending the reach of para 2(2), but it would not contradict any cardinal principle of the Rent Act.  On the contrary, it would simply be a modest development of the extension of the concept of "spouse" which Parliament itself made when it enacted para 2(2) in 1988.  The position might well have been different if Parliament had not enacted para 2(2) and had continued to confine the right to succeed to the husband or wife of the original tenant.  But that bridge was crossed in 1988.  So the fact that the partners in a homosexual relationship are not, and indeed cannot be, married is not to be regarded as a critical factor limiting the way that para 2(2) may be interpreted under section 3(1) of the 1998 Act.  Nor is there any reason to fear that the proposed interpretation would entail far-reaching practical repercussions which the House is not in a position to evaluate.  Certainly, counsel for the Secretary of State, who made submissions in favour of interpreting para 2(2) in this way, did not foresee any such problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;129.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, in reliance on section 3(1) of the 1998 Act I would interpret para 2(2) as providing that, for the purposes of para 2, a person, whether of the same or of the opposite sex, who was living with the original tenant in a long-term relationship shall be treated as the spouse of the original tenant.  By this means it is possible to read and give effect to para 2 in a way which is compatible with the respondent's article 8(1) and 14 Convention rights.</p>
BARONESS HALE OF RICHMOND
<p>My Lords,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;130.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not so very long ago in this country that people might be refused access to a so-called 'public' bar because of their sex or the colour of their skin; that a woman might automatically be paid three quarters of what a man was paid for doing exactly the same job; that a landlady offering rooms to let might lawfully put a 'no blacks' notice in her window.  We now realise that this was wrong.  It was wrong because the sex or colour of the person was simply irrelevant to the choice which was being made: to whether he or she would be a fit and proper person to have a drink with others in a bar, to how well she might do the job, to how good a tenant or lodger he might be.  It was wrong because it depended on stereotypical assumptions about what a woman or a black person might be like, assumptions which had nothing to do with the qualities of the individual involved: even if there were any reason to believe that more women than men made bad customers this was no justification for discriminating against all women.  It was wrong because it was based on an irrelevant characteristic which the woman or the black did not choose and could do nothing about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;131.&nbsp;&nbsp;When this country legislated to ban both race and sex discrimination, there were some who thought such matters trivial, but of course they were not trivial to the people concerned.  Still less trivial are the rights and freedoms set out in the European Convention.  The state's duty under article 14, to secure that those rights and freedoms are enjoyed without discrimination based on such suspect grounds, is fundamental to the scheme of the Convention as a whole.  It would be a poor human rights instrument indeed if it obliged the state to respect the homes or private lives of one group of people but not the homes or private lives of another.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;132.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a guarantee of equal treatment is also essential to democracy.  Democracy is founded on the principle that each individual has equal value.  Treating some as automatically having less value than others not only causes pain and distress to that person but also violates his or her dignity as a human being.  The essence of the Convention, as has often been said, is respect for human dignity and human freedom: see <i>Pretty v United Kingdom</i> (2002) 35 EHRR 1, 37, para 65.  Second, such treatment is damaging to society as a whole.  Wrongly to assume that some people have talent and others do not is a huge waste of human resources.  It also damages social cohesion, creating not only an under-class, but an under-class with a rational grievance.  Third, it is the reverse of the rational behaviour we now expect of government and the state.  Power must not be exercised arbitrarily.  If distinctions are to be drawn, particularly upon a group basis, it is an important discipline to look for a rational basis for those distinctions.  Finally, it is a purpose of all human rights instruments to secure the protection of the essential rights of members of minority groups, even when they are unpopular with the majority.  Democracy values everyone equally even if the majority does not.</p>
