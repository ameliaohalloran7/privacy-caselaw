<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123.&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the hearing on 30 May 2003 the Parole Board notified the appellant's solicitors by letter dated 13 June 2003 that it considered that the balance of interests was firmly in favour of the appointment of an SAA to represent the appellant in relation to the sensitive material.  Disclosure of that material would be made only to him and not to the appellant or his legal representatives.  The directions did not spell out what Mr Blake was to do but, as Tuckey LJ set out in paragraph 7 of his judgment in the Court of Appeal [2005] QB 410, 415:</p>
<p></p><ul>"It is common ground that it was intended that he would perform the same functions and be subject to the same restrictions as a special advocate appointed under the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (Procedure Rules) 1998 (SI 1998/1881).  Thus he was required to represent the interest of the [appellant] by making submissions to the board at any closed hearings, cross examine witnesses at any such hearing and make written submissions to the board.  In performing these functions he was not to disclose any sensitive material to or obtain instructions from the prisoner or his representatives, although they could and had provided him with as much information about the case as possible."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;124.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appellant then commenced the proceedings for judicial review of the Parole Board's decision of 13 June 2003 which are before the House.  The matter came before Maurice Kay J, who heard argument both on the principle of appointing an SAA and, in closed session at which he considered the sensitive material, on the issue whether it was appropriate in the case before him.  He gave a written judgment on 19 December 2003 [2003] EWHC 3120 (Admin), [2004] 2 All ER 776, on the "open" matters, dismissing the application.  He gave a separate judgment on the "closed" matters, but this has not been the subject of appeal and the House has not seen or considered any of the sensitive material or heard any argument based upon it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the appeal came before the Court of Appeal it was confined to a point of principle, the contention that it was not open to the Parole Board to adopt the procedure of appointing an SAA.  By a judgment dated 28 July 2004 [2004] EWCA Civ 1031, [2005] QB 410 the court dismissed the appeal.  Tuckey LJ, with whom the other members agreed, held that the Parole Board had power to adopt the SAA procedure, notwithstanding the absence of specific provision in the Rules.  He did not accept the appellant's argument that if there was such power its exercise was confined to cases involving national security.  He also held that adoption of the SAA procedure did not in principle infringe proper standards of fairness and did not involve a breach of article 5(4) of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms ("the Convention").  It was therefore open to the Parole Board to adopt it in a suitable case, though he agreed with the judge that such a solution should only be adopted in exceptional circumstances and should not become the norm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;126.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is undeniable that to have material withheld from his legal representatives as well as himself and to have his interests represented only by an SAA is a substantial handicap to a prisoner in a hearing before the Parole Board.  Lord Woolf in para 60 of his opinion justifiably described the disadvantages of being left in ignorance of the case against him as grave, repeating the epithet which he used in <i>M v Secretary of State for the Home Department  </i>[2004] 2 All ER 863 when describing the problems facing appellants before the SIAC.  I would not seek in any way to minimise those disadvantages.  A prisoner against whom unfounded allegations have been made is in a Kafka-esque situation, as my noble and learned friend Lord Steyn has graphically indicated.  He may be altogether in the dark about the allegations made and unable to divine what they may be and give instructions about rebutting them.  The SAA is necessarily limited in the steps which he can take to challenge them, bearing in mind his inability to take instructions from the prisoner.  The difficulties faced by SAAs were authoritatively described in the written evidence given by a number of SIAC special advocates to the House of Commons Constitutional Affairs Committee:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Special Advocates can identify (by cross-examination and submissions) any respects in which the allegations made by the Home Secretary are unsupported by the evidence relied upon and check the Home Secretary's evidence for inconsistencies.  But Special Advocates have no means of knowing whether the appellant has an answer to any particular closed allegation, except insofar as the appellant has been given the gist of the allegation and has chosen to answer it.  Yet the system does not require the Secretary of State necessarily to provide even a gist of the important parts of the case against the appellants in the open case which is provided to the appellants.  In these situations, the Special Advocates have no means of pursuing or deploying evidence in reply.  If they put forward a positive case in response to the closed allegations, that positive case is inevitably based on conjecture.  They have no way of knowing whether it is the case that the appellant himself would wish to advance.  The inability to take instructions on the closed material fundamentally limits the extent to which the Special Advocates can play a meaningful part in any appeal." (Seventh Report of Session 2004-2005, HC 323-II, Ev 55, para 10).<p></p></ul>
<p>Other practical difficulties involved in the use of SAAs were outlined by Lord Bingham of Cornhill in para 22 of his opinion in <i>R v H </i>[2004] 2 AC 134.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;127.&nbsp;&nbsp;Against that one has to set the risks to the informant if the material is disclosed.  I have little doubt that the fears entertained by an informant confined in prison of dangerous and unpleasant consequences if it were discovered that he had given information about the nefarious activities of fellow prisoners are very real.  Unlike persons who are free to move about in ordinary society, he is very limited in the actions he can take to protect himself.  Prisoners who did not wish their activities to be exposed would undoubtedly make considerable efforts to find out who had given information, if they received the slightest inkling that this had occurred.  This factor provides the reason for the restrictive rules under which SAAs have to work.  Even though the prisoner's legal representatives may be of the highest integrity - and it should be emphasised that the integrity of the appellant's advisers is unquestioned - their inquiries of their client, however carefully and skilfully conducted, may well give him or his associates sufficient information for them to make a serviceable guess at the source of the information on which the allegations are based.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;128.&nbsp;&nbsp;The third element in the triangulation of interests is the public interest in the performance by the Parole Board of its function of deciding whether it is safe to release prisoners who have been imprisoned for grave crimes, a matter which is one of serious public concern and the subject of anxious consideration by the Board.  And as Sir Thomas Bingham MR observed in <i>R v Parole Board, Ex parte Watson </i>[1996] 1 WLR 906, 916-917,</p>
<p></p><ul>" … in the final balance, the board is bound to give preponderant weight to the need to protect innocent members of the public against any significant risk of serious injury."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;129.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before your Lordships' House Mr Owen QC for the appellant focused on two issues, the Board's power to adopt the SAA procedure and the contention that to do so would constitute a breach of article 5(4).  Lord Woolf has set out in paras 64 et seq of his opinion the core submissions advanced by Mr Owen and I need not repeat them.  I agree with his conclusions on each of these submissions and I shall express my opinion on the issues in fairly brief compass.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;130.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that in the absence of specific statutory authority the Parole Board did not have power to adopt the SAA procedure.  Mr Owen contrasted the Board with other tribunals which had been given such specific power (for a review of a number of such tribunals: see <i>R v H </i>[2004] 2 AC 134 at para 21, per Lord Bingham of Cornhill).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;131.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was argued on behalf of the Parole Board that the power to appoint an SAA arose by necessary implication from its functions, as specified by or derived from the terms of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 and the Crimes (Sentences) Act 1997.  That may well be correct, although the test of necessary implication is demanding.  It seems to me, however, that the Board can more simply and easily satisfy the test contained in para 1(2) of Schedule 5 to the 1991 Act, which provides that it is within its capacity to do such things as are "incidental to or conducive to the discharge of its functions."  The functions of the Board are to assess whether it is safe to release offenders or whether they would constitute a danger to the public if set free from prison.  In order to discharge these functions it is essential that it has before it all material information necessary for determination of that issue of public safety.  If the only effective way to get that information from reluctant informants is to use the SAA procedure, then I consider that the use of that procedure incidental to or conducive to the discharge of its functions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;132.&nbsp;&nbsp;This conclusion is reinforced by the point made both by Tuckey LJ at para 29 of his judgment and by Lord Woolf in several places in his opinion, that the Parole Board has power to withhold material altogether from the prisoner and his representatives.  That power is now specifically conferred by rule 6 of the Parole Board Rules 2004, but probably existed by necessary implication under earlier rules: see para 56 of Lord Woolf's opinion.  The use of the SAA procedure is in these circumstances a mitigation to some extent of the considerable disadvantage which the prisoner would suffer if the material were altogether withheld.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;133.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Owen argued as a fallback position that if it were held that the Parole Board has power to use the SAA procedure, it should be confined to cases where protection of the information is necessary in the interests of national security.  He pointed to other instances in which statutory power was conferred to use the SAA procedure, but only for that purpose.  The context of the work of most of these, eg the Special Immigration Appeals Commission and the Pathogens Access Appeal Commission, is such that information affecting national security is the only sort of sensitive material likely to be considered by them.  It is therefore not remarkable that the power to use the SAA procedure is specifically directed towards such information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;134.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is notable that the authority of several bodies in Northern Ireland to use the SAA procedure is wider, and for reasons which apply <i>mutatis mutandis </i>to the Parole Board.  The three bodies in question are the Sentence Review Commissioners appointed under the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998, the Life Sentence Review Commissioners appointed under the Life Sentences (Northern Ireland) Order 2001 (SI 2001/2564) and the Commissioner appointed to advise the Secretary of State in the discharge of his functions under the Northern Ireland (Remission of Sentences) Act 1995.  The Rules made under the 1998 Act, in pursuance of which the Sentence Review Commissioners have the function of considering the early release of persons imprisoned for terrorist offences, provide for the withholding of "damaging information" and the appointment of an SAA.  One of the heads of damaging information is information whose disclosure would be likely to "adversely affect the health, welfare or safety of the person concerned or any other person."  The Life Sentence Review Commissioners have the duty of considering the release of prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment, in the same way as the Parole Board in England and Wales.  The Rules made under the 2001 Order provide for withholding of certified "confidential information" and the appointment of an SAA.  Confidential information is defined as including material whose disclosure would affect the safety of any individual.  Finally, the Secretary of State adopted safeguards for the discharge of his duty under the 1995 Act of considering the recall of prisoners released from prison on licence.  The Commissioner appointed to advise him is not to reveal to the prisoner any information certified by the Secretary of State as "damaging information" within the meaning of the Rules made under the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998, and provision is made for the appointment of an SAA.  I do not think that it is possible to draw from these examples the conclusions which Mr Owen seeks to draw; on the contrary, the example of the several sets of Northern Ireland provisions shows that a wider range of sensitive material can in a suitable case be brought before a tribunal.  The Parole Board regularly has such cases in the course of its work and in my view a restriction to national security has no foundation in principle or practice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;135.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second major issue argued on behalf of the appellant was the compatibility with the Convention of the use of the SAA procedure by the Parole Board, which as a public authority is required by section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 not to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right.  The right in question is contained in article 5(4), which provides:</p>
<p></p><ul>"Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful."<p></p></ul>
<p>It was common case that this provision was engaged.  A prisoner whose tariff period has expired is entitled to have his continued detention decided by a "court", and for these purposes the Parole Board has the essential features of a court.  An adversarial procedure involving oral representation and the opportunity to call and question witnesses is required: <i>Hussain v United Kingdom </i>(1996) 22 EHRR 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;136.&nbsp;&nbsp;The submission advanced on behalf of the appellant was that the use of an SAA imposed such grave disadvantages upon him that the Parole Board's procedure did not satisfy the requirements of fairness which would make it compatible with article 5(4).  Mr Owen did not contend, however, that the power under the Parole Board Rules to withhold material altogether was incompatible.  In support of this submission he cited a number of decisions in which it was held that complainants did not have a hearing compatible with the requirements of article 5(4) when deprived of access to documentation material to the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;137.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Owen relied on several cases decided by the European Court of Human Rights in which it was held that the inability to challenge the prosecution case in various respects constituted a breach of article 5(4).  In <i>Lamy v Belgium </i>(1989) 11 EHRR 529 when the complainant, who had been arrested on charges relating to his bankruptcy and detained on remand, sought to challenge the detention, the Indictments Chamber of the Court of Appeal relied in rejecting his appeal on two material documents which were not communicated to the complainant.  The Court held that access to the documents was essential, that there had been inequality of arms, the procedure was not truly adversarial and there was accordingly a breach of article 5(4).  In so concluding it examined the reasons put forward by the Government to justify withholding the documents and found them insufficient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;138.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Nikolova v Bulgaria </i>(1999) 31 EHRR 64 the issue was again the legality of an order continuing the complainant's detention on remand when challenged by her.  She had been charged with false accounting and misappropriation of State funds.  The Regional Court failed to consider facts invoked by her which it was claimed were capable of placing in doubt the conditions requiring to be satisfied for continuing detention.  Nor were her lawyers able to consult any of the documents in file in order to challenge the reasons put forward by the prosecutor for her detention.  The Court held that there had been a breach of the guarantees afforded by article 5(4).  Again no sufficient justification was put forward for depriving the complainant of access to the documents or failing to consider the facts on which she relied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;139.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ECtHR decision on which the appellant placed most reliance was <i>Garcia Alva v Germany </i>(2001) 37 EHRR 335.  The complainant had been arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking and was detained on remand.  When he brought an application for review of his detention his lawyers were not given access to a number of documents in the file, including the depositions of a witness whose testimony was key evidence against him.  The ground for withholding these was that consultation of these documents would endanger the purpose of the investigations.  The Court held that there had been a violation of article 5(4).  It stated at para 41 of its judgment:</p>
<p></p><ul>"In the Court's opinion, it is hardly possible for an accused to challenge the reliability of such an account properly without being made aware of the evidence on which it is based."<p></p></ul>
<p>It went on at para 42:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The Court acknowledges the need for criminal investigations to be conducted efficiently, which may imply that part of the information collected during them is to be kept secret in order to prevent suspects from tampering with evidence and undermining the course of justice.  However, this legitimate goal cannot be pursued at the expense of substantial restrictions on the rights of the defence.  Therefore, information which is essential for the assessment of the lawfulness of a detention should be made available in an appropriate manner to the suspect's lawyer."<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;140.&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference in approach to deciding cases of the European Court of Human Rights by comparison with that of our courts determines the way in which its decisions should be used.  Lord Bingham of Cornhill said, when giving the opinion of the Appellate Committee in <i>R v H </i>[2004] 2 AC 134, para 33, that following these decisions in too narrow a manner would place judges in a straitjacket.  He went on:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The consistent partice of the [Strasbourg] court, in this and other fields, has been to declare principles, and apply those principles on a case-by-case basis according to the particular facts of the case before it, but to avoid laying down rigid or inflexible rules … The overriding requirement is that the guiding principles should be respected and observed, in the infinitely diverse situations with which trial judges have to deal, in all of which the touchstone is to ascertain what justice requires in the circumstances of the particular case."<p></p></ul>
<p>In the same vein he said in the earlier case of <i>Brown v Stott </i>[2003] 1 AC 681, 704:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The jurisprudence of the European court very clearly establishes that while the overall fairness of a criminal trial cannot be compromised, the constituent rights comprised, whether expressly or implicitly, within article 6 are not themselves absolute.  Limited qualification of these rights is acceptable if reasonably directed by national authorities towards a clear and proper public objective and if representing no greater qualification than the situation calls for.  The general language of the Convention could have led to the formulation of hard-edged and inflexible statements of principle from which no departure could be sanctioned whatever the background or the circumstances.  But this approach has been consistently eschewed by the court throughout its history.  The case law shows that the court has paid very close attention to the facts of particular cases coming before it, giving effect to factual differences and recognising differences of degree.  Ex facto oritur jus.  The court has also recognised the need for a fair balance between the general interest of the community and the personal rights of the individual, the search for which balance has been described as inherent in the whole of the Convention …"<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;141.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the context of article 6 it was recognised by the ECtHR that the entitlement to disclosure of relevant evidence is not absolute, but there may be competing interests.  In <i>Edwards and Lewis v United Kingdom </i>(2003) 15 BHRC 189 at para 53 the Court said:</p>
<p></p><ul>"The entitlement to disclosure of relevant evidence is not, however, an absolute right.  In any criminal proceedings there may be competing interests, such as national security or the need to protect witnesses at risk of reprisals …, which must be weighed against the rights of the accused.  In some cases it may be necessary to withhold certain evidence from the defence so as to preserve the fundamental rights of another individual or to safeguard an important public interest …"<p></p></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;142.&nbsp;&nbsp;The passages which I have quoted from <i>Garcia Alva v Germany </i>state very clearly the strength of the imperative requiring the detained person to be afforded sufficient knowledge of the case against him if a decision on his continued detention is to satisfy the requirements of article 5(4).  The common feature of the three ECtHR decisions on which the appellant relied was that the countervailing reasons militating against production of the material in question were insufficiently strong to outweigh the necessity for its production.  In <i>Lamy </i>and <i>Nikolova </i>the reasons were not apparently compelling, while in <i>Garcia Alva </i>they were significant but still not strong enough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;143.&nbsp;&nbsp;The present case is a classic instance of weighing up competing interests.  The appellant's interest in presenting his case effectively with sufficient knowledge of the allegations made against him is clear and strong.  The informant has a compelling interest in being protected from dangerous consequences which might ensue if any indication leaked out which could lead to his identification.  Thirdly, there is the public interest in ensuring that the Parole Board has all proper material before it to enable it to decide which prisoners are safe to release from prison.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;144.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having balanced these interests, I conclude that the interests which I have outlined of the informant and the public must prevail over those of the appellant, strong though the latter may be.  I emphasise, however, that my conclusions relating to the powers of the Parole Board to use the SAA procedure and their compatibility with article 5(4) are a decision in principle, for that was all that was before the House.  We were not asked, nor were we in a position to decide, whether it was proper in the instant case of the appellant.  I accept that there may well be cases in which it would not be sufficiently fair to be justifiable and each case will require consideration on its own facts.  I would agree that the SAA procedure should be used only in rare and exceptional cases and, as Lord Bingham of Cornhill said in <i>R v H </i>[2004] 2 AC 134 at para 22, as a course of last and never first resort. The appellant's case was, however, founded on the proposition that in no case would it lawfully be used, and this I cannot accept.</p>
