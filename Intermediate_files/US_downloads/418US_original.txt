PER CURIAM.
<p>
</p><h2>I</h2>
On December 8, 2000, the Supreme Court of Florida
ordered that the Circuit Court of Leon County tabulate by
hand 9,000 ballots in Miami-Dade County. It also ordered
the inclusion in the certified vote totals of 215 votes identified in Palm Beach County and 168 votes identified in
Miami-Dade County for Vice President Albert Gore, Jr.,
and Senator Joseph Lieberman, Democratic Candidates
for President and Vice President. The Supreme Court
noted that petitioner, Governor George W. Bush asserted
that the net gain for Vice President Gore in Palm Beach
County was 176 votes, and directed the Circuit Court to
resolve that dispute on remand. ___ So. 2d, at ___ (slip
op., at 4, n. 6). The court further held that relief would
require manual recounts in all Florida counties where so-called "undervotes" had not been subject to manual tabulation. The court ordered all manual recounts to begin at
once. Governor Bush and Richard Cheney, Republican
Candidates for the Presidency and Vice Presidency, filed
an emergency application for a stay of this mandate. On
December 9, we granted the application, treated the application as a petition for a writ of certiorari, and granted
certiorari. Post, p. ___.
<p>
The proceedings leading to the present controversy are
discussed in some detail in our opinion in Bush v. Palm
Beach County Canvassing Bd., ante, p. ____ (per curiam)
(Bush I). On November 8, 2000, the day following the
Presidential election, the Florida Division of Elections
reported that petitioner, Governor Bush, had received
2,909,135 votes, and respondent, Vice President Gore, had
received 2,907,351 votes, a margin of 1,784 for Governor
Bush. Because Governor Bush's margin of victory was
less than "one-half of a percent . . . of the votes cast," an
automatic machine recount was conducted under
§102.141(4) of the election code, the results of which
showed Governor Bush still winning the race but by a
diminished margin. Vice President Gore then sought
manual recounts in Volusia, Palm Beach, Broward, and
Miami-Dade Counties, pursuant to Florida's election
protest provisions. Fla. Stat. §102.166 (2000). A dispute
arose concerning the deadline for local county canvassing
boards to submit their returns to the Secretary of State
(Secretary). The Secretary declined to waive the November 14 deadline imposed by statute. §§102.111, 102.112.
The Florida Supreme Court, however, set the deadline at
November 26. We granted certiorari and vacated the
Florida Supreme Court's decision, finding considerable
uncertainty as to the grounds on which it was based.
Bush I, ante, at ___-___ (slip. op., at 6-7). On December
11, the Florida Supreme Court issued a decision on remand reinstating that date. ___ So. 2d ___, ___ (slip op. at
30-31).
</p><p>
On November 26, the Florida Elections Canvassing
Commission certified the results of the election and declared Governor Bush the winner of Florida's 25 electoral
votes. On November 27, Vice President Gore, pursuant to
Florida's contest provisions, filed a complaint in Leon County Circuit Court contesting the certification. Fla.
Stat. §102.168 (2000). He sought relief pursuant to
§102.168(3)(c), which provides that "[r]eceipt of a number
of illegal votes or rejection of a number of legal votes
sufficient to change or place in doubt the result of the
election"shall be grounds for a contest. The Circuit Court
denied relief, stating that Vice President Gore failed to
meet his burden of proof. He appealed to the First District
Court of Appeal, which certified the matter to the Florida
Supreme Court.
</p><p>
Accepting jurisdiction, the Florida Supreme Court affirmed in part and reversed in part. Gore v. Harris, ___
So. 2d. ____ (2000). The court held that the Circuit Court
had been correct to reject Vice President Gore's challenge
to the results certified in Nassau County and his challenge
to the Palm Beach County Canvassing Board's determination that 3,300 ballots cast in that county were not, in the
statutory phrase, "legal votes."
</p><p>
The Supreme Court held that Vice President Gore had
satisfied his burden of proof under §102.168(3)(c) with
respect to his challenge to Miami-Dade County's failure to
tabulate, by manual count, 9,000 ballots on which the
machines had failed to detect a vote for President ("undervotes"). ___ So. 2d., at ___ (slip. op., at 22-23).
Noting
the closeness of the election, the Court explained that "[o]n
this record, there can be no question that there are legal
votes within the 9,000 uncounted votes sufficient to place
the results of this election in doubt." Id., at ___ (slip. op.,
at 35). A "legal vote," as determined by the Supreme
Court, is "one in which there is a 'clear indication of the
intent of the voter. '" Id., at ____ (slip op., at 25). The
court therefore ordered a hand recount of the 9,000 ballots
in Miami-Dade County. Observing that the contest provisions vest broad discretion in the circuit judge to "provide
any relief appropriate under such circumstances," Fla.
Stat. §102.168(8) (2000), the Supreme Court further held that the Circuit Court could order "the Supervisor of Elections and the Canvassing Boards, as well as the necessary
public officials, in all counties that have not conducted a
manual recount or tabulation of the undervotes . . . to do
so forthwith, said tabulation to take place in the individual counties where the ballots are located." ____ So. 2d, at
____ (slip. op., at 38).
</p><p>
The Supreme Court also determined that both Palm
Beach County and Miami-Dade County, in their earlier
manual recounts, had identified a net gain of 215 and 168
legal votes for Vice President Gore. Id., at ___ (slip. op., at
33-34). Rejecting the Circuit Court's conclusion that Palm
Beach County lacked the authority to include the 215 net
votes submitted past the November 26 deadline, the Supreme Court explained that the deadline was not intended
to exclude votes identified after that date through ongoing
manual recounts. As to Miami-Dade County, the Court
concluded that although the 168 votes identified were the
result of a partial recount, they were "legal votes [that]
could change the outcome of the election." Id., at (slip op.,
at 34). The Supreme Court therefore directed the Circuit
Court to include those totals in the certified results, subject to resolution of the actual vote total from the Miami-Dade partial recount.
</p><p>
The petition presents the following questions: whether
the Florida Supreme Court established new standards for
resolving Presidential election contests, thereby violating
Art. II, §1, cl. 2, of the United States Constitution and
failing to comply with 3 U. S. C. §5, and whether the use of
standardless manual recounts violates the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses. With respect to the equal
protection question, we find a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.
</p><h2>II</h2>
<h2>A</h2>
The closeness of this election, and the multitude of legal
challenges which have followed in its wake, have brought
into sharp focus a common, if heretofore unnoticed, phenomenon. Nationwide statistics reveal that an estimated
2% of ballots cast do not register a vote for President for
whatever reason, including deliberately choosing no candidate at all or some voter error, such as voting for two
candidates or insufficiently marking a ballot. See Ho,
More Than 2M Ballots Uncounted, AP Online (Nov. 28,
2000); Kelley, Balloting Problems Not Rare But Only In A
Very Close Election Do Mistakes And Mismarking Make A
Difference, Omaha World-Herald (Nov. 15, 2000). In
certifying election results, the votes eligible for inclusion
in the certification are the votes meeting the properly
established legal requirements.
<p>
This case has shown that punch card balloting machines
can produce an unfortunate number of ballots which are
not punched in a clean, complete way by the voter. After
the current counting, it is likely legislative bodies nationwide will examine ways to improve the mechanisms and
machinery for voting.
</p><h2>B</h2>
The individual citizen has no federal constitutional right
to vote for electors for the President of the United States
unless and until the state legislature chooses a statewide
election as the means to implement its power to appoint
members of the Electoral College. U. S. Const., Art. II, §1.
This is the source for the statement in McPherson v.
Blacker, 146 U. S. 1, 35 (1892), that the State legislature's
power to select the manner for appointing electors is plenary; it may, if it so chooses, select the electors itself,
which indeed was the manner used by State legislatures
in several States for many years after the Framing of our
Constitution. Id., at 28-33. History has now favored the
voter, and in each of the several States the citizens themselves vote for Presidential electors. When the state legislature vests the right to vote for President in its people,
the right to vote as the legislature has prescribed is fundamental; and one source of its fundamental nature lies in
the equal weight accorded to each vote and the equal
dignity owed to each voter. The State, of course, after
granting the franchise in the special context of Article II,
can take back the power to appoint electors. See id., at 35
("[T]here is no doubt of the right of the legislature to resume the power at any time, for it can neither be taken
away nor abdicated") (quoting S. Rep. No. 395, 43d Cong.,
1st Sess.).
<p>
The right to vote is protected in more than the initial
allocation of the franchise. Equal protection applies as
well to the manner of its exercise. Having once granted
the right to vote on equal terms, the State may not, by
later arbitrary and disparate treatment, value one person's vote over that of another. See, e.g., 
Harper v. Virginia Bd. of Elections, 383 U. S. 663, 665 (1966) ("[O]nce the
franchise is granted to the electorate, lines may not be
drawn which are inconsistent with the Equal Protection
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment"). It must be remembered that "the right of suffrage can be denied by a debasement or dilution of the weight of a citizen's vote just as
effectively as by wholly prohibiting the free exercise of the
franchise." 
Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533, 555 (1964).
</p><p>
There is no difference between the two sides of the
present controversy on these basic propositions. Respondents say that the very purpose of vindicating the right to
vote justifies the recount procedures now at issue. The
question before us, however, is whether the recount procedures the Florida Supreme Court has adopted are consistent with its obligation to avoid arbitrary and disparate
treatment of the members of its electorate.
</p><p>
Much of the controversy seems to revolve around ballot
cards designed to be perforated by a stylus but which,
either through error or deliberate omission, have not been
perforated with sufficient precision for a machine to count
them. In some cases a piece of the card -- a chad -- is hanging, say by two corners. In other cases there is no separation at all, just an indentation.
</p><p>
The Florida Supreme Court has ordered that the intent
of the voter be discerned from such ballots. For purposes
of resolving the equal protection challenge, it is not necessary to decide whether the Florida Supreme Court had the
authority under the legislative scheme for resolving election disputes to define what a legal vote is and to mandate
a manual recount implementing that definition. The
recount mechanisms implemented in response to the
decisions of the Florida Supreme Court do not satisfy the
minimum requirement for non-arbitrary treatment of
voters necessary to secure the fundamental right. Florida's basic command for the count of legally cast votes is to
consider the "intent of the voter." Gore v. Harris, ___
So. 2d, at ___ (slip op., at 39). This is unobjectionable as
an abstract proposition and a starting principle. The
problem inheres in the absence of specific standards to
ensure its equal application. The formulation of uniform
rules to determine intent based on these recurring circumstances is practicable and, we conclude, necessary.
</p><p>
The law does not refrain from searching for the intent of
the actor in a multitude of circumstances; and in some
cases the general command to ascertain intent is not
susceptible to much further refinement. In this instance,
however, the question is not whether to believe a witness
but how to interpret the marks or holes or scratches on an
inanimate object, a piece of cardboard or paper which, it is
said, might not have registered as a vote during the machine count. The factfinder confronts a thing, not a person. The search for intent can be confined by specific rules
designed to ensure uniform treatment.
</p><p>
The want of those rules here has led to unequal evaluation of ballots in various respects. See Gore v. Harris, ___
So. 2d, at ___ (slip op., at 51) (Wells, J., dissenting)
("Should a county canvassing board count or not count a
'dimpled chad' where the voter is able to successfully
dislodge the chad in every other contest on that ballot?
Here, the county canvassing boards disagree"). As seems
to have been acknowledged at oral argument, the standards for accepting or rejecting contested ballots might
vary not only from county to county but indeed within a
single county from one recount team to another.
</p><p>
The record provides some examples. A monitor in
Miami-Dade County testified at trial that he observed that
three members of the county canvassing board applied
different standards in defining a legal vote. 3 Tr. 497, 499
(Dec. 3, 2000). And testimony at trial also revealed that at
least one county changed its evaluative standards during
the counting process. Palm Beach County, for example,
began the process with a 1990 guideline which precluded
counting completely attached chads, switched to a rule
that considered a vote to be legal if any light could be seen
through a chad, changed back to the 1990 rule, and then
abandoned any pretense of a per se rule, only to have a
court order that the county consider dimpled chads legal.
This is not a process with sufficient guarantees of equal
treatment.
</p><p>
An early case in our one person, one vote jurisprudence
arose when a State accorded arbitrary and disparate
treatment to voters in its different counties. 
Gray v.
Sanders, 372 U. S. 368 (1963). The Court found a constitutional violation. We relied on these principles in the
context of the Presidential selection process in 
Moore v.
Ogilvie, 394 U. S. 814 (1969), where we invalidated a
county-based procedure that diluted the influence of citizens
in larger counties in the nominating process. There we
observed that "[t]he idea that one group can be granted
greater voting strength than another is hostile to the one
man, one vote basis of our representative government." Id.,
at 819.
</p><p>
The State Supreme Court ratified this uneven treatment. It mandated that the recount totals from two counties, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach, be included in the
certified total. The court also appeared to hold sub silentio
that the recount totals from Broward County, which were
not completed until after the original November 14 certification by the Secretary of State, were to be considered
part of the new certified vote totals even though the
county certification was not contested by Vice President
Gore. Yet each of the counties used varying standards to
determine what was a legal vote. Broward County used a
more forgiving standard than Palm Beach County, and
uncovered almost three times as many new votes, a result
markedly disproportionate to the difference in population
between the counties.
</p><p>
In addition, the recounts in these three counties were
not limited to so-called undervotes but extended to all of
the ballots. The distinction has real consequences. A
manual recount of all ballots identifies not only those
ballots which show no vote but also those which contain
more than one, the so-called overvotes. Neither category
will be counted by the machine. This is not a trivial concern. At oral argument, respondents estimated there are
as many as 110,000 overvotes statewide. As a result, the
citizen whose ballot was not read by a machine because he
failed to vote for a candidate in a way readable by a machine may still have his vote counted in a manual recount;
on the other hand, the citizen who marks two candidates
in a way discernable by the machine will not have the
same opportunity to have his vote count, even if a manual
examination of the ballot would reveal the requisite indicia of intent. Furthermore, the citizen who marks two
candidates, only one of which is discernable by the machine, will have his vote counted even though it should
have been read as an invalid ballot. The State Supreme
Court's inclusion of vote counts based on these variant
standards exemplifies concerns with the remedial processes that were under way.
</p><p>
That brings the analysis to yet a further equal protection problem. The votes certified by the court included a
partial total from one county, Miami-Dade. The Florida
Supreme Court's decision thus gives no assurance that the
recounts included in a final certification must be complete.
Indeed, it is respondent's submission that it would be
consistent with the rules of the recount procedures to
include whatever partial counts are done by the time of
final certification, and we interpret the Florida Supreme
Court's decision to permit this. See ____ So. 2d, at ____,
n. 21 (slip op., at 37, n. 21) (noting "practical difficulties"
may control outcome of election, but certifying partial
Miami-Dade total nonetheless). This accommodation no
doubt results from the truncated contest period established by the Florida Supreme Court in Bush I, at respondents'own urging. The press of time does not diminish the constitutional concern. A desire for speed is not a
general excuse for ignoring equal protection guarantees.
</p><p>
In addition to these difficulties the actual process by
which the votes were to be counted under the Florida
Supreme Court's decision raises further concerns. That
order did not specify who would recount the ballots. The
county canvassing boards were forced to pull together ad
hoc teams comprised of judges from various Circuits who
had no previous training in handling and interpreting
ballots. Furthermore, while others were permitted to
observe, they were prohibited from objecting during the
recount.
</p><p>
The recount process, in its features here described, is
inconsistent with the minimum procedures necessary to
protect the fundamental right of each voter in the special
instance of a statewide recount under the authority of a
single state judicial officer. Our consideration is limited to
the present circumstances, for the problem of equal protection in election processes generally presents many complexities.
</p><p>
The question before the Court is not whether local entities, in the exercise of their expertise, may develop different systems for implementing elections. Instead, we are
presented with a situation where a state court with the
power to assure uniformity has ordered a statewide recount with minimal procedural safeguards. When a court
orders a statewide remedy, there must be at least some
assurance that the rudimentary requirements of equal
treatment and fundamental fairness are satisfied.
</p><p>
Given the Court's assessment that the recount process
underway was probably being conducted in an unconstitutional manner, the Court stayed the order directing the
recount so it could hear this case and render an expedited
decision. The contest provision, as it was mandated by the
State Supreme Court, is not well calculated to sustain the
confidence that all citizens must have in the outcome of
elections. The State has not shown that its procedures
include the necessary safeguards. The problem, for instance, of the estimated 110,000 overvotes has not been
addressed, although Chief Justice Wells called attention to
the concern in his dissenting opinion. See ____ So. 2d, at
____, n. 26 (slip op., at 45, n. 26).
</p><p>
Upon due consideration of the difficulties identified to
this point, it is obvious that the recount cannot be conducted in compliance with the requirements of equal
protection and due process without substantial additional
work. It would require not only the adoption (after opportunity for argument) of adequate statewide standards for
determining what is a legal vote, and practicable procedures to implement them, but also orderly judicial review
of any disputed matters that might arise. In addition, the
Secretary of State has advised that the recount of only a
portion of the ballots requires that the vote tabulation
equipment be used to screen out undervotes, a function for
which the machines were not designed. If a recount of
overvotes were also required, perhaps even a second
screening would be necessary. Use of the equipment for
this purpose, and any new software developed for it, would
have to be evaluated for accuracy by the Secretary of
State, as required by Fla. Stat. §101.015 (2000).
</p><p>
The Supreme Court of Florida has said that the legislature intended the State's electors to "participat[e] fully in
the federal electoral process," as provided in 3 U. S. C. §5.
___ So. 2d, at ___ (slip op. at 27); see also Palm Beach
Canvassing Bd. v. Harris, 2000 WL 1725434, *13 (Fla.
2000). That statute, in turn, requires that any controversy or contest that is designed to lead to a conclusive
selection of electors be completed by December 12. That
date is upon us, and there is no recount procedure in place
under the State Supreme Court's order that comports with
minimal constitutional standards. Because it is evident
that any recount seeking to meet the December 12 date
will be unconstitutional for the reasons we have discussed,
we reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida
ordering a recount to proceed.
</p><p>
Seven Justices of the Court agree that there are constitutional problems with the recount ordered by the Florida
Supreme Court that demand a remedy. See post, at 6
(SOUTER, J., dissenting); post, at 2, 15 (BREYER, J., dissenting). The only disagreement is as to the remedy.
Because the Florida Supreme Court has said that the
Florida Legislature intended to obtain the safe-harbor
benefits of 3 U. S. C. §5, JUSTICE BREYER's proposed remedy -- remanding to the Florida Supreme Court for its
ordering of a constitutionally proper contest until December 18-contemplates action in violation of the Florida
election code, and hence could not be part of an "appropriate"order authorized by Fla. Stat. §102.168(8) (2000).

None are more conscious of the vital limits on judicial
authority than are the members of this Court, and none
stand more in admiration of the Constitution's design to
leave the selection of the President to the people, through
their legislatures, and to the political sphere. When contending parties invoke the process of the courts, however,
it becomes our unsought responsibility to resolve the
federal and constitutional issues the judicial system has
been forced to confront.
<p>
The judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
not inconsistent with this opinion.

<p>
<b>CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST</b>, with whom <b>JUSTICE SCALIA</b>
and <b>JUSTICE THOMAS</b> join, concurring.
</p><p>
We join the per curiam opinion. We write separately because we believe there are additional grounds
that require us to reverse the Florida Supreme Court's
decision.
</p><p>
</p><h2>I</h2>
We deal here not with an ordinary election, but with an
election for the President of the United States. In 
Burroughs v. United States, 290 U. S. 534, 545 (1934), we said:
<p></p><blockquote>
"While presidential electors are not officers or
agents of the federal government (In re Green, 134
U. S. 377, 379), they exercise federal functions under,
and discharge duties in virtue of authority conferred
by, the Constitution of the United States. The President is vested with the executive power of the nation.
The importance of his election and the vital character
of its relationship to and effect upon the welfare and
safety of the whole people cannot be too strongly
stated."
</blockquote><p>
Likewise, in Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780, 794-795
(1983) (footnote omitted), we said: "[I]n the context of a
Presidential election, state-imposed restrictions implicate
a uniquely important national interest. For the President
and the Vice President of the United States are the
only elected officials who represent all the voters in the
Nation."
</p><p>
In most cases, comity and respect for federalism compel
us to defer to the decisions of state courts on issues of
state law. That practice reflects our understanding that
the decisions of state courts are definitive pronouncements
of the will of the States as sovereigns. Cf. 
Erie R. Co. v.
Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938). Of course, in ordinary cases,
the distribution of powers among the branches of a State's
government raises no questions of federal constitutional
law, subject to the requirement that the government be
republican in character. See U. S. Const., Art. IV, §4. But
there are a few exceptional cases in which the Constitution
imposes a duty or confers a power on a particular branch of
a State's government. This is one of them. Article II, §1,
cl. 2, provides that "[e]ach State shall appoint, in such
Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct," electors for
President and Vice President. (Emphasis added.) Thus,
the text of the election law itself, and not just its interpretation by the courts of the States, takes on independent
significance.
</p><p>
In McPherson v. Blacker, 146 U. S. 1 (1892), we explained that Art. II, §1, cl. 2, "convey[s] the broadest power
of determination" and "leaves it to the legislature exclusively to define the method" of appointment. Id., at 27. A
significant departure from the legislative scheme for
appointing Presidential electors presents a federal constitutional question.
</p><p>
3 U. S. C. §5 informs our application of Art. II, §1, cl. 2,
to the Florida statutory scheme, which, as the Florida
Supreme Court acknowledged, took that statute into
account. Section 5 provides that the State's selection of
electors "shall be conclusive, and shall govern in the
counting of the electoral votes" if the electors are chosen
under laws enacted prior to election day, and if the selection process is completed six days prior to the meeting of
the electoral college. As we noted in Bush v. Palm Beach
County Canvassing Bd., ante, at 6.
</p><p></p><blockquote>
"Since §5 contains a principle of federal law that
would assure finality of the State's determination if
made pursuant to a state law in effect before the election, a legislative wish to take advantage of the 'safe
harbor'would counsel against any construction of the
Election Code that Congress might deem to be a
change in the law."
</blockquote><p>
If we are to respect the legislature's Article II powers,
therefore, we must ensure that postelection state-court
actions do not frustrate the legislative desire to attain the
"safe harbor"provided by §5.
</p><p>
In Florida, the legislature has chosen to hold statewide
elections to appoint the State's 25 electors. Importantly,
the legislature has delegated the authority to run the
elections and to oversee election disputes to the Secretary
of State (Secretary), Fla. Stat. §97.012(1) (2000), and to
state circuit courts, §§102.168(1), 102.168(8). Isolated
sections of the code may well admit of more than one
interpretation, but the general coherence of the legislative
scheme may not be altered by judicial interpretation so as
to wholly change the statutorily provided apportionment
of responsibility among these various bodies. In any
election but a Presidential election, the Florida Supreme
Court can give as little or as much deference to Florida's
executives as it chooses, so far as Article II is concerned,
and this Court will have no cause to question the court's
actions. But, with respect to a Presidential election, the
court must be both mindful of the legislature's role under
Article II in choosing the manner of appointing electors
and deferential to those bodies expressly empowered by
the legislature to carry out its constitutional mandate.
</p><p>
In order to determine whether a state court has infringed upon the legislature's authority, we necessarily
must examine the law of the State as it existed prior to the
action of the court. Though we generally defer to state
courts on the interpretation of state law -- see, e.g., Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684 (1975) -- there are of course
areas in which the Constitution requires this Court to
undertake an independent, if still deferential, analysis of
state law.
</p><p>
For example, in NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson,
357 U. S. 449 (1958), it was argued that we were without
jurisdiction because the petitioner had not pursued the
correct appellate remedy in Alabama's state courts. Petitioners had sought a state-law writ of certiorari in the
Alabama Supreme Court when a writ of mandamus, according to that court, was proper. We found this state-law
ground inadequate to defeat our jurisdiction because we
were "unable to reconcile the procedural holding of the
Alabama Supreme Court" with prior Alabama precedent.
Id., at 456. The purported state-law ground was so novel,
in our independent estimation, that "petitioner could not
fairly be deemed to have been apprised of its existence."
Id., at 457.
</p><p>
Six years later we decided Bouie v. City of Columbia,
378 U. S. 347 (1964), in which the state court had held,
contrary to precedent, that the state trespass law applied
to black sit-in demonstrators who had consent to enter
private property but were then asked to leave. Relying
upon NAACP, we concluded that the South Carolina Supreme Court's interpretation of a state penal statute had
impermissibly broadened the scope of that statute beyond
what a fair reading provided, in violation of due process.
See 378 U. S., at 361-362. What we would do in the present case is precisely parallel: Hold that the Florida Supreme Court's interpretation of the Florida election laws impermissibly distorted them beyond what a fair reading
required, in violation of Article II.<a aria-label="Move to footnote 1" href="#r1">1</a><a name="rr1"></a>
</p><p>
This inquiry does not imply a disrespect for state courts
but rather a respect for the constitutionally prescribed role
of state legislatures. To attach definitive weight to the
pronouncement of a state court, when the very question at
issue is whether the court has actually departed from the
statutory meaning, would be to abdicate our responsibility
to enforce the explicit requirements of Article II.

</p><h2>II</h2>
Acting pursuant to its constitutional grant of authority,
the Florida Legislature has created a detailed, if not perfectly crafted, statutory scheme that provides for appointment of Presidential electors by direct election. Fla. Stat.
§103.011 (2000). Under the statute, "[v]otes cast for the
actual candidates for President and Vice President shall
be counted as votes cast for the presidential electors supporting such candidates." Ibid. The legislature has designated the Secretary of State as the "chief election officer,"
with the responsibility to "[o]btain and maintain uniformity in the application, operation, and interpretation of the
election laws." §97.012. The state legislature has delegated to county canvassing boards the duties of administering elections. §102.141. Those boards are responsible
for providing results to the state Elections Canvassing
Commission, comprising the Governor, the Secretary of
State, and the Director of the Division of Elections.
§102.111. Cf. Boardman v. Esteva, 323 So. 2d 259, 268, n.
5 (1975) ("The election process . . . is committed to the
executive branch of government through duly designated
officials all charged with specific duties . . . .
[The] judgments [of these officials] are entitled to be regarded by the
courts as presumptively correct . . . ").
<p>
After the election has taken place, the canvassing
boards receive returns from precincts, count the votes, and
in the event that a candidate was defeated by .5% or less,
conduct a mandatory recount. Fla. Stat. §102.141(4)
(2000). The county canvassing boards must file certified
election returns with the Department of State by 5 p.m. on
the seventh day following the election. §102.112(1). The
Elections Canvassing Commission must then certify the
results of the election. §102.111(1).
</p><p>
The state legislature has also provided mechanisms
both for protesting election returns and for contesting
certified election results. Section 102.166 governs protests. Any protest must be filed prior to the certification
of election results by the county canvassing board.
§102.166(4)(b). Once a protest has been filed, "the county
canvassing board may authorize a manual recount."
§102.166(4)(c). If a sample recount conducted pursuant to
§102.166(5) "indicates an error in the vote tabulation
which could affect the outcome of the election," the county
canvassing board is instructed to: "(a) Correct the error
and recount the remaining precincts with the vote tabulation system; (b) Request the Department of State to verify
the tabulation software; or (c) Manually recount all ballots," §102.166(5). In the event a canvassing board chooses to conduct a manual recount of all ballots,
§102.166(7) prescribes procedures for such a recount.
</p><p>
Contests to the certification of an election, on the other
hand, are controlled by §102.168. The grounds for contesting an election include "[r]eceipt of a number of illegal
votes or rejection of a number of legal votes sufficient to
change or place in doubt the result of the election."
§102.168(3)(c). Any contest must be filed in the appropriate Florida circuit court, Fla. Stat. §102.168(1), and the
canvassing board or election board is the proper party
defendant, §102.168(4). Section 102.168(8) provides that
"[t]he circuit judge to whom the contest is presented may
fashion such orders as he or she deems necessary to ensure that each allegation in the complaint is investigated,
examined, or checked, to prevent or correct any alleged
wrong, and to provide any relief appropriate under such
circumstances." In Presidential elections, the contest
period necessarily terminates on the date set by 3 U. S. C.
§5 for concluding the State's "final determination" of election controversies."
</p><p>
In its first decision, Palm Beach Canvassing Bd. v.
Harris, ___ So. 2d, ___ (Nov. 21, 2000) (Harris I), the
Florida Supreme Court extended the 7-day statutory
certification deadline established by the legislature.<a aria-label="Move to footnote 2" href="#r2">2</a><a name="rr2"></a> This
modification of the code, by lengthening the protest period,
necessarily shortened the contest period for Presidential
elections. Underlying the extension of the certification
deadline and the shortchanging of the contest period was,
presumably, the clear implication that certification was a
matter of significance: The certified winner would enjoy
presumptive validity, making a contest proceeding by the
losing candidate an uphill battle. In its latest opinion,
however, the court empties certification of virtually
all legal consequence during the contest, and in doing
so departs from the provisions enacted by the Florida
Legislature.
</p><p>
The court determined that canvassing boards'decisions
regarding whether to recount ballots past the certification
deadline (even the certification deadline established by
Harris I) are to be reviewed de novo, although the election
code clearly vests discretion whether to recount in the
boards, and sets strict deadlines subject to the Secretary's
rejection of late tallies and monetary fines for tardiness.
See Fla. Stat. §102.112 (2000). Moreover, the Florida
court held that all late vote tallies arriving during the
contest period should be automatically included in the
certification regardless of the certification deadline (even
the certification deadline established by Harris I), thus
virtually eliminating both the deadline and the Secretary's
discretion to disregard recounts that violate it.<a aria-label="Move to footnote 3" href="#r3">3</a><a name="rr3"></a>
</p><p>
Moreover, the court's interpretation of "legal vote," and
hence its decision to order a contest-period recount, plainly
departed from the legislative scheme. Florida statutory
law cannot reasonably be thought to require the counting
of improperly marked ballots. Each Florida precinct
before election day provides instructions on how properly
to cast a vote, §101.46; each polling place on election day
contains a working model of the voting machine it uses,
§101.5611; and each voting booth contains a sample ballot,
§101.46. In precincts using punch-card ballots, voters are
instructed to punch out the ballot cleanly:


</p><p></p><blockquote>
AFTER VOTING, CHECK YOUR BALLOT CARD TO
BE SURE YOUR VOTING SELECTIONS ARE
CLEARLY AND CLEANLY PUNCHED AND THERE
ARE NO CHIPS LEFT HANGING ON THE BACK
OF THE CARD.
</blockquote><p>

Instructions to Voters, quoted in Touchston v. McDermott,
2000 WL 1781942, *6 &amp; n. 19 (CA11) (Tjoflat, J., dissenting). No reasonable person would call it "an error in the
vote tabulation," FLA. STAT. §102.166(5), or a "rejection of
legal votes,"FLA. STAT. §102.168(3)(c),<a aria-label="Move to footnote 4" href="#r4">4</a><a name="rr4"></a> when electronic or
electromechanical equipment performs precisely in the
manner designed, and fails to count those ballots that are
not marked in the manner that these voting instructions
explicitly and prominently specify. The scheme that the
Florida Supreme Court's opinion attributes to the legislature is one in which machines are required to be "capable
of correctly counting votes," §101.5606(4), but which nonetheless regularly produces elections in which legal votes
are predictably not tabulated, so that in close elections
manual recounts are regularly required. This is of course
absurd. The Secretary of State, who is authorized by law
to issue binding interpretations of the election code,
§§97.012, 106.23, rejected this peculiar reading of the
statutes. See DE 00-13 (opinion of the Division of Elections). The Florida Supreme Court, although it must defer
to the Secretary's interpretations, see Krivanek v. Take
Back Tampa Political Committee, 625 So. 2d 840, 844 (Fla.
1993), rejected her reasonable interpretation and embraced the peculiar one. See Palm Beach County Canvassing Board v. Harris, No. SC00-2346 (Dec. 11, 2000) (Harris III).


</p><p>
But as we indicated in our remand of the earlier case, in
a Presidential election the clearly expressed intent of the
legislature must prevail. And there is no basis for reading
the Florida statutes as requiring the counting of improperly marked ballots, as an examination of the Florida
Supreme Court's textual analysis shows. We will not
parse that analysis here, except to note that the principal
provision of the election code on which it relied,
§101.5614(5), was, as the Chief Justice pointed out in his
dissent from Harris II, entirely irrelevant. See Gore v.
Harris, No. SC00-2431, slip op., at 50 (Dec. 8, 2000). The
State's Attorney General (who was supporting the Gore
challenge) confirmed in oral argument here that never
before the present election had a manual recount been
conducted on the basis of the contention that "undervotes"
should have been examined to determine voter intent. Tr.
of Oral Arg. in Bush v. Palm Beach County Canvassing
Bd., 39-40 (Dec. 1, 2000); cf. Broward County Canvassing
Board v. Hogan, 607 So. 2d 508, 509 (Fla. Ct. App. 1992)
(denial of recount for failure to count ballots with "hanging
paper chads"). For the court to step away from this established practice, prescribed by the Secretary of State, the
state official charged by the legislature with "responsibility to . . . [o]btain and maintain uniformity in the application, operation, and interpretation of the election laws,"
§97.012(1), was to depart from the legislative scheme.

</p><h2>III</h2>

The scope and nature of the remedy ordered by the
Florida Supreme Court jeopardizes the "legislative wish"
to take advantage of the safe harbor provided by 3 U. S. C.
§5. Bush v. Palm Beach County Canvassing Bd., ante, at
6. December 12, 2000, is the last date for a final determination of the Florida electors that will satisfy §5. Yet in
the late afternoon of December 8th -- four days before this
deadline -- the Supreme Court of Florida ordered recounts
of tens of thousands of so-called "undervotes" spread
through 64 of the State's 67 counties. This was done in a
search for elusive -- perhaps delusive -- certainty as to the
exact count of 6 million votes. But no one claims that
these ballots have not previously been tabulated; they
were initially read by voting machines at the time of the
election, and thereafter reread by virtue of Florida's automatic recount provision. No one claims there was any
fraud in the election. The Supreme Court of Florida ordered this additional recount under the provision of the
election code giving the circuit judge the authority to
provide relief that is "appropriate under such circumstances." Fla. Stat. §102.168(8) (2000).
<p>
Surely when the Florida Legislature empowered the
courts of the State to grant "appropriate" relief, it must
have meant relief that would have become final by the cutoff date of 3 U. S. C. §5. In light of the inevitable legal
challenges and ensuing appeals to the Supreme Court of
Florida and petitions for certiorari to this Court, the entire
recounting process could not possibly be completed by that
date. Whereas the majority in the Supreme Court of
Florida stated its confidence that "the remaining undervotes in these counties can be [counted] within the required time frame,"___ So. 2d. at ___, n. 22 (slip op., at 38,
n. 22), it made no assertion that the seemingly inevitable
appeals could be disposed of in that time. Although the
Florida Supreme Court has on occasion taken over a year
to resolve disputes over local elections, see, e.g., Beckstrom
v. Volusia County Canvassing Bd., 707 So. 2d 720 (1998)
(resolving contest of sheriff's race 16 months after the
election), it has heard and decided the appeals in the
present case with great promptness. But the federal
deadlines for the Presidential election simply do not permit even such a shortened process.
</p><p>
As the dissent noted:
</p><p></p><blockquote>
"In [the four days remaining], all questionable ballots must be reviewed by the judicial officer appointed
to discern the intent of the voter in a process open to
the public. Fairness dictates that a provision be made
for either party to object to how a particular ballot is
counted. Additionally, this short time period must
allow for judicial review. I respectfully submit this
cannot be completed without taking Florida's presidential electors outside the safe harbor provision, creating the very real possibility of disenfranchising
those nearly 6 million voters who are able to correctly
cast their ballots on election day." ___ So. 2d, at ___
(slip op., at 55) (Wells, C. J., dissenting).
</blockquote><p>
The other dissenters echoed this concern: "[T]he majority
is departing from the essential requirements of the law by
providing a remedy which is impossible to achieve and
which will ultimately lead to chaos." Id., at ___ (slip op.,
at 67 (Harding, J., dissenting, Shaw, J. concurring).
</p><p>
Given all these factors, and in light of the legislative
intent identified by the Florida Supreme Court to bring
Florida within the "safe harbor"provision of 3 U. S. C. §5,
the remedy prescribed by the Supreme Court of Florida
cannot be deemed an "appropriate" one as of December 8.
It significantly departed from the statutory framework in
place on November 7, and authorized open-ended further
proceedings which could not be completed by December 12,
thereby preventing a final determination by that date.
</p><p>
For these reasons, in addition to those given in the per
curiam, we would reverse.
</p><p>



</p><hr>

<a aria-label="Move to footnote 1" name="r1"></a><a aria-label="Move to footnote 1" href="#rr1">1</a> Similarly, our jurisprudence requires us to analyze the "background
principles" of state property law to determine whether there has been a
taking of property in violation of the Takings Clause. That constitutional guarantee would, of course, afford no protection against state
power if our inquiry could be concluded by a state supreme court
holding that state property law accorded the plaintiff no rights. See
Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U. S. 1003 (1992). In one of
our oldest cases, we similarly made an independent evaluation of state
law in order to protect federal treaty guarantees. In Fairfax's Devisee v.
Hunter's Lessee, 7 Cranch 603 (1813), we disagreed with the Supreme
Court of Appeals of Virginia that a 1782 state law had extinguished the
property interests of one Denny Fairfax, so that a 1789 ejectment order
against Fairfax supported by a 1785 state law did not constitute a
future confiscation under the 1783 peace treaty with Great Britain.
See id., at 623; Hunter v. Fairfax's Devisee, 1 Munf. 218 (Va. 1809). 

<p>

<a aria-label="Move to footnote 2" name="r2"></a><a aria-label="Move to footnote 2" href="#rr2">2</a> We vacated that decision and remanded that case; the Florida Supreme Court reissued the same judgment with a new opinion on December 11, 2000, ___ So. 2d, ___.

<br>
GEORGE W. BUSH, ET AL., PETITIONERS v.<br>
ALBERT GORE, JR., ET AL.<br>
<br>
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE FLORIDA SUPREME COURT<br>
<br>
[December 12, 2000]<br>
</div>
<hr>
<p>
<b>JUSTICE STEVENS</b>, with whom <b>JUSTICE GINSBURG</b> AND
<b>JUSTICE BREYER</b> join, dissenting.
</p><p>
The Constitution assigns to the States the primary
responsibility for determining the manner of selecting the
Presidential electors. See Art. II, §1, cl. 2.
When questions arise about the meaning of state laws, including
election laws, it is our settled practice to accept the opinions of the highest courts of the States as providing the
final answers. On rare occasions, however, either federal
statutes or the Federal Constitution may require federal
judicial intervention in state elections. This is not such an
occasion.
</p><p>
The federal questions that ultimately emerged in this
case are not substantial. Article II provides that "[e]ach
State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature
thereof may direct, a Number of Electors." Ibid. (emphasis
added). It does not create state legislatures out of whole
cloth, but rather takes them as they come -- as creatures
born of, and constrained by, their state constitutions. Lest
there be any doubt, we stated over 100 years ago in
McPherson v. Blacker, 146 U. S. 1, 25 (1892), that "[w]hat
is forbidden or required to be done by a State" in the Article II context "is forbidden or required of the legislative
power under state constitutions as they exist." In the
same vein, we also observed that "[t]he [State's] legislative
power is the supreme authority except as limited by the constitution of the State." Ibid.; cf. Smiley v. Holm, 285
U. S. 355, 367 (1932).<a aria-label="Move to footnote 1" href="#st1">1</a><a name="stt1"></a> 
The legislative power in Florida is
subject to judicial review pursuant to Article V of the
Florida Constitution, and nothing in Article II of the Federal Constitution frees the state legislature from the
constraints in the state constitution that created it.
Moreover, the Florida Legislature's own decision to employ a unitary code for all elections indicates that it intended the Florida Supreme Court to play the same role in
Presidential elections that it has historically played in
resolving electoral disputes. The Florida Supreme Court's
exercise of appellate jurisdiction therefore was wholly
consistent with, and indeed contemplated by, the grant of
authority in Article II.
</p><p>
It hardly needs stating that Congress, pursuant to 3
U. S. C. §5, did not impose any affirmative duties upon the
States that their governmental branches could "violate."
Rather, §5 provides a safe harbor for States to select electors in contested elections "by judicial or other methods"
established by laws prior to the election day. Section 5,
like Article II, assumes the involvement of the state judiciary in interpreting state election laws and resolving
election disputes under those laws. Neither §5 nor Article
II grants federal judges any special authority to substitute
their views for those of the state judiciary on matters of
state law.

</p><p>
Nor are petitioners correct in asserting that the failure
of the Florida Supreme Court to specify in detail the precise manner in which the "intent of the voter," Fla. Stat.
§101.5614(5) (Supp. 2001), is to be determined rises to the
level of a constitutional violation.<a aria-label="Move to footnote 2" href="#st2">2</a><a name="stt2"></a> We found such a viola
tion when individual votes within the same State were



weighted unequally, see, e.g., Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S.
533, 568 (1964), but we have never before called into
question the substantive standard by which a State determines that a vote has been legally cast.
And there is
no reason to think that the guidance provided to the factfinders, specifically the various canvassing boards, by the
"intent of the voter"standard is any less sufficient -- or will
lead to results any less uniform -- than, for example, the
"beyond a reasonable doubt" standard employed everyday
by ordinary citizens in courtrooms across this country.<a aria-label="Move to footnote 3" href="#st3">3</a><a name="stt3"></a>
</p><p>
Admittedly, the use of differing substandards for determining voter intent in different counties employing similar voting systems may raise serious concerns. Those
concerns are alleviated -- if not eliminated -- by the fact
that a single impartial magistrate will ultimately adjudicate all objections arising from the recount process. Of
course, as a general matter, "[t]he interpretation of constitutional principles must not be too literal. We must remember that the machinery of government would not
work if it were not allowed a little play in its joints." Bain
Peanut Co. of Tex. v. Pinson, 282 U. S. 499, 501 (1931)
(Holmes, J.). If it were otherwise, Florida's decision to
leave to each county the determination of what balloting
system to employ -- despite enormous differences in accuracy<a aria-label="Move to footnote 4" href="#st4">4</a><a name="stt4"></a> -- might run afoul of equal protection. So, too, might



the similar decisions of the vast majority of state legislatures to delegate to local authorities certain decisions with
respect to voting systems and ballot design.
</p><p>
Even assuming that aspects of the remedial scheme
might ultimately be found to violate the Equal Protection
Clause, I could not subscribe to the majority's disposition
of the case. As the majority explicitly holds, once a state
legislature determines to select electors through a popular
vote, the right to have one's vote counted is of constitutional stature. As the majority further acknowledges,
Florida law holds that all ballots that reveal the intent of
the voter constitute valid votes. Recognizing these principles, the majority nonetheless orders the termination of
the contest proceeding before all such votes have been
tabulated. Under their own reasoning, the appropriate
course of action would be to remand to allow more specific
procedures for implementing the legislature's uniform
general standard to be established.
</p><p>
In the interest of finality, however, the majority effectively orders the disenfranchisement of an unknown number of voters whose ballots reveal their intent -- and are
therefore legal votes under state law -- but were for some
reason rejected by ballot-counting machines.
It does so on
the basis of the deadlines set forth in Title 3 of the
United States Code. Ante, at 11. But, as I have already
noted, those provisions merely provide rules of decision for
Congress to follow when selecting among conflicting slates
of electors. Supra, at 2. They do not prohibit a State from
counting what the majority concedes to be legal votes until
a bona fide winner is determined. Indeed, in 1960, Hawaii
appointed two slates of electors and Congress chose to
count the one appointed on January 4, 1961, well after the
Title 3 deadlines. See Josephson &amp; Ross, Repairing the
Electoral College, 22 J. Legis. 145, 166, n. 154 (1996).<a aria-label="Move to footnote 5" href="#st5">5</a><a name="stt5"></a>
Thus, nothing prevents the majority, even if it properly
found an equal protection violation, from ordering relief
appropriate to remedy that violation without depriving
Florida voters of their right to have their votes counted.
As the majority notes, "[a] desire for speed is not a general
excuse for ignoring equal protection guarantees." Ante, at
10.
</p><p>
Finally, neither in this case, nor in its earlier opinion in
Palm Beach County Canvassing Bd. v. Harris, 2000 WL
1725434 (Fla., Nov. 21, 2000), did the Florida Supreme
Court make any substantive change in Florida electoral
law.<a aria-label="Move to footnote 6" href="#st6">6</a><a name="stt6"></a> Its decisions were rooted in long-established precedent and were consistent with the relevant statutory
provisions, taken as a whole. It did what courts do <a aria-label="Move to footnote 7" href="#st7">7</a><a name="stt7"></a> -- it
decided the case before it in light of the legislature's intent
to leave no legally cast vote uncounted. In so doing, it


relied on the sufficiency of the general "intent of the voter"
standard articulated by the state legislature, coupled with
a procedure for ultimate review by an impartial judge, to
resolve the concern about disparate evaluations of contested ballots. If we assume -- as I do -- that the members
of that court and the judges who would have carried out
its mandate are impartial, its decision does not even raise
a colorable federal question.
</p><p>
What must underlie petitioners'entire federal assault
on the Florida election procedures is an unstated lack of
confidence in the impartiality and capacity of the state
judges who would make the critical decisions if the vote
count were to proceed. Otherwise, their position is wholly
without merit. The endorsement of that position by the
majority of this Court can only lend credence to the most
cynical appraisal of the work of judges throughout the
land. It is confidence in the men and women who administer the judicial system that is the true backbone of the
rule of law. Time will one day heal the wound to that
confidence that will be inflicted by today's decision. One
thing, however, is certain. Although we may never know
with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this
year's Presidential election, the identity of the loser is
perfectly clear. It is the Nation's confidence in the judge
as an impartial guardian of the rule of law.
</p><p>
I respectfully dissent.
</p><p>

</p><hr>
<a aria-label="Move to footnote 1" name="st1"></a><a aria-label="Move to footnote 1" href="#stt1">1</a> "Wherever the term 'legislature'is used in the Constitution it is necessary to consider the nature of the particular action in view." 285 U. S., at
367. It is perfectly clear that the meaning of the words "Manner" and
"Legislature"as used in Article II, §1, parallels the usage in Article I, §4,
rather than the language in Article V. U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U. S. 779, 805 (1995). Article I, §4, and Article II, §1, both call
upon legislatures to act in a lawmaking capacity whereas Article V simply
calls on the legislative body to deliberate upon a binary decision. As a
result, petitioners'reliance on Leser v. Garnett, 258 U. S. 130 (1922), and
Hawke v. Smith (No. 1), 253 U. S. 221 (1920), is misplaced. 
<p>
<a aria-label="Move to footnote 2" name="st2"></a><a aria-label="Move to footnote 2" href="#stt2">2</a> The Florida statutory standard is consistent with the practice of the
majority of States, which apply either an "intent of the voter" standard
or an "impossible to determine the elector's choice" standard in ballot
recounts. The following States use an "intent of the voter" standard:
Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §16-645(A) (Supp. 2000) (standard for canvassing
write-in votes); Conn. Gen. Stat. §9-150a(j) (1999) (standard for absentee ballots, including three conclusive presumptions); Ind. Code §3-12-1-1 (1992); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 21-A, §1(13) (1993); Md. Ann.
Code, Art. 33, §11-302(d) (2000 Supp.) (standard for absentee ballots);
Mass. Gen. Laws §70E (1991) (applying standard to Presidential
primaries); Mich. Comp. Laws §168.799a(3) (Supp. 2000); Mo. Rev.
Stat. §115.453(3) (Cum. Supp. 1998) (looking to voter's intent where
there is substantial compliance with statutory requirements); Tex. Elec.
Code Ann. §65.009(c) (1986); Utah Code Ann. §20A-4-104(5)(b) (Supp.
2000) (standard for write-in votes), §20A-4-105(6)(a) (standard for
mechanical ballots); Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17, §2587(a) (1982); Va. Code
Ann. §24.2-644(A) (2000); Wash. Rev. Code §29.62.180(1) (Supp. 2001)
(standard for write-in votes); Wyo. Stat. Ann. §22-14-104 (1999). The
following States employ a standard in which a vote is counted unless it
is "impossible to determine the elector's [or voter's] choice": Ala. Code
§11-46-44(c) (1992), Ala. Code §17-13-2 (1995); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.
§16-610 (1996) (standard for rejecting ballot); Cal. Elec. Code Ann.
§15154(c) (West Supp. 2000); Colo. Rev. Stat. §1-7-309(1) (1999)
(standard for paper ballots), §1-7-508(2) (standard for electronic
ballots); Del. Code Ann., Tit. 15, §4972(4) (1999); Idaho Code §34-1203
(1981); Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 10, §5/7-51 (1993) (standard for primaries),

2000); Minn. Stat. §204C.22(1) (1992); Mont. Code Ann. §13-15-202
(1997) (not counting votes if "elector's choice cannot be determined");
Nev. Rev. Stat. §293.367(d) (1995); N. Y. Elec. Law §9-112(6) (McKinney 1998); N. C. Gen. Stat. §§163-169(b), 163-170 (1999); N. D. Cent.

(1994); 26 Okla. Stat., Tit. 26, §7-127(6) (1997); Ore. Rev. Stat.

total of 3,718,305 votes were cast under punch-card systems, and
2,353,811 votes were cast under optical-scan systems. Ibid.

<br>
GEORGE W. BUSH, ET AL., PETITIONERS v.<br>
ALBERT GORE, JR., ET AL.<br>
<br>
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE FLORIDA SUPREME COURT<br>
<br>
[December 12, 2000]<br>
</div>
<hr>
<p>
<b>JUSTICE SOUTER</b>, with whom <b>JUSTICE BREYER</b> joins and
with whom <b>JUSTICE STEVENS</b> and <b>JUSTICE GINSBURG</b> join
with regard to all but Part C, dissenting.
</p><p>
The Court should not have reviewed either Bush v.
Palm Beach County Canvassing Bd., ante, p. ___ (per
curiam), or this case, and should not have stopped Florida's attempt to recount all undervote ballots, see ante at
___, by issuing a stay of the Florida Supreme Court's
orders during the period of this review, see Bush v. Gore,
post at ____ (slip op., at 1). If this Court had allowed the
State to follow the course indicated by the opinions of its
own Supreme Court, it is entirely possible that there
would ultimately have been no issue requiring our review,
and political tension could have worked itself out in the
Congress following the procedure provided in 3 U.S. C.
§15. The case being before us, however, its resolution by
the majority is another erroneous decision.
</p><p>
As will be clear, I am in substantial agreement with
the dissenting opinions of JUSTICE STEVENS, JUSTICE
GINSBURG and JUSTICE BREYER. I write separately only to
say how straightforward the issues before us really are.
</p><p>
There are three issues: whether the State Supreme
Court's interpretation of the statute providing for a contest of the state election results somehow violates 3
U. S. C. §5; whether that court's construction of the state
statutory provisions governing contests impermissibly changes a state law from what the State's legislature has
provided, in violation of Article II, §1, cl. 2, of the national
Constitution; and whether the manner of interpreting
markings on disputed ballots failing to cause machines to
register votes for President (the undervote ballots) violates
the equal protection or due process guaranteed by the
Fourteenth Amendment. None of these issues is difficult
to describe or to resolve.

</p><h2>A</h2>
The 3 U. S. C. §5 issue is not serious. That provision
sets certain conditions for treating a State's certification of
Presidential electors as conclusive in the event that a
dispute over recognizing those electors must be resolved in
the Congress under 3 U. S. C. §15.
Conclusiveness requires selection under a legal scheme in place before the
election, with results determined at least six days before
the date set for casting electoral votes. But no State is
required to conform to §5 if it cannot do that (for whatever
reason); the sanction for failing to satisfy the conditions of
§5 is simply loss of what has been called its "safe harbor."
And even that determination is to be made, if made anywhere, in the Congress.

<h2>B</h2>
The second matter here goes to the State Supreme
Court's interpretation of certain terms in the state statute
governing election "contests," Fla. Stat. §102.168 (2000);
there is no question here about the state court's interpretation of the related provisions dealing with the antecedent process of "protesting" particular vote counts,
§102.166, which was involved in the previous case, Bush v.
Palm Beach County Canvassing Board. The issue is
whether the judgment of the state supreme court has
displaced the state legislature's provisions for election
contests: is the law as declared by the court different from
the provisions made by the legislature, to which the national Constitution commits responsibility for determining
how each State's Presidential electors are chosen? See
U. S. Const., Art. II, §1, cl. 2.
Bush does not, of course,
claim that any judicial act interpreting a statute of uncertain meaning is enough to displace the legislative provision and violate Article II; statutes require interpretation,
which does not without more affect the legislative character of a statute within the meaning of the Constitution.
Brief for Petitioners 48, n. 22, in Bush v. Palm Beach
County Canvassing Bd., et al., 531 U. S. ___ (2000). What
Bush does argue, as I understand the contention, is that
the interpretation of §102.168 was so unreasonable as to
transcend the accepted bounds of statutory interpretation,
to the point of being a nonjudicial act and producing new
law untethered to the legislative act in question.
<p>
The starting point for evaluating the claim that the
Florida Supreme Court's interpretation effectively rewrote §102.168 must be the language of the provision on
which Gore relies to show his right to raise this contest:
that the previously certified result in Bush's favor was
produced by "rejection of a number of legal votes sufficient
to change or place in doubt the result of the election." Fla.
Stat. §102.168(3)(c) (2000). None of the state court's interpretations is unreasonable to the point of displacing the
legislative enactment quoted. As I will note below, other
interpretations were of course possible, and some might
have been better than those adopted by the Florida court's
majority; the two dissents from the majority opinion of
that court and various briefs submitted to us set out alternatives. But the majority view is in each instance within
the bounds of reasonable interpretation, and the law as
declared is consistent with Article II.
</p><p>
1. The statute does not define a "legal vote," the rejection of which may affect the election. The State Supreme
Court was therefore required to define it, and in doing
that the court looked to another election statute,
§101.5614(5), dealing with damaged or defective ballots,
which contains a provision that no vote shall be disregarded "if there is a clear indication of the intent of the
voter as determined by a canvassing board." The court
read that objective of looking to the voter's intent as indicating that the legislature probably meant "legal vote" to
mean a vote recorded on a ballot indicating what the voter
intended. Gore v. Harris, __ So. 2d __ (slip op., at 23-25)
(Dec. 8, 2000). It is perfectly true that the majority might
have chosen a different reading. See, e.g., Brief for Respondent Harris et al. 10 (defining "legal votes" as "votes
properly executed in accordance with the instructions
provided to all registered voters in advance of the election
and in the polling places"). But even so, there is no constitutional violation in following the majority view; Article II
is unconcerned with mere disagreements about interpretive merits.
</p><p>
2. The Florida court next interpreted "rejection" to
determine what act in the counting process may be attacked in a contest. Again, the statute does not define the
term. The court majority read the word to mean simply a
failure to count. ____ So. 2d, at___ (slip op., at 26-27).
That reading is certainly within the bounds of common
sense, given the objective to give effect to a voter's intent if
that can be determined. A different reading, of course, is
possible. The majority might have concluded that "rejection" should refer to machine malfunction, or that a ballot
should not be treated as "reject[ed]" in the absence of
wrongdoing by election officials, lest contests be so easy to
claim that every election will end up in one. Cf. id., at
____ (slip op., at 48) (Wells, C. J., dissenting). There is,
however, nothing nonjudicial in the Florida majority's
more hospitable reading.
</p><p>
3. The same is true about the court majority's understanding of the phrase "votes sufficient to change or place
in doubt" the result of the election in Florida. The court
held that if the uncounted ballots were so numerous that
it was reasonably possible that they contained enough
"legal" votes to swing the election, this contest would be
authorized by the statute.<a aria-label="Move to footnote 1" href="#so1">1</a><a name="soo1"></a> While the majority might have
thought (as the trial judge did) that a probability, not a
possibility, should be necessary to justify a contest, that
reading is not required by the statute's text, which says
nothing about probability. Whatever people of good will
and good sense may argue about the merits of the Florida
court's reading, there is no warrant for saying that it
transcends the limits of reasonable statutory interpretation to the point of supplanting the statute enacted by the
"legislature"within the meaning of Article II.
</p><p>
In sum, the interpretations by the Florida court raise no
substantial question under Article II. That court engaged
in permissible construction in determining that Gore had
instituted a contest authorized by the state statute, and it
proceeded to direct the trial judge to deal with that contest
in the exercise of the discretionary powers generously
conferred by Fla. Stat. §102.168(8) (2000), to "fashion such
orders as he or she deems necessary to ensure that each
allegation in the complaint is investigated, examined, or
checked, to prevent or correct any alleged wrong, and to
provide any relief appropriate under such circumstances."
As JUSTICE GINSBURG has persuasively explained in her
own dissenting opinion, our customary respect for state
interpretations of state law counsels against rejection of



the Florida court's determinations in this case.

</p><h2>C</h2>

It is only on the third issue before us that there is a
meritorious argument for relief, as this Court's Per Curiam opinion recognizes. It is an issue that might well
have been dealt with adequately by the Florida courts if
the state proceedings had not been interrupted, and if not
disposed of at the state level it could have been considered
by the Congress in any electoral vote dispute. But because
the course of state proceedings has been interrupted, time
is short, and the issue is before us, I think it sensible for
the Court to address it.
<p>
Petitioners have raised an equal protection claim (or,
alternatively, a due process claim, see generally Logan v.
Zimmerman Brush Co., 455 U. S. 422 (1982)), in the
charge that unjustifiably disparate standards are applied
in different electoral jurisdictions to otherwise identical
facts. It is true that the Equal Protection Clause does not
forbid the use of a variety of voting mechanisms within a
jurisdiction, even though different mechanisms will have
different levels of effectiveness in recording voters'intentions; local variety can be justified by concerns about cost,
the potential value of innovation, and so on. But evidence
in the record here suggests that a different order of disparity obtains under rules for determining a voter's intent
that have been applied (and could continue to be applied)
to identical types of ballots used in identical brands of
machines and exhibiting identical physical characteristics
(such as "hanging" or "dimpled" chads).
See, e.g., Tr., at
238-242 (Dec. 2-3, 2000) (testimony of Palm Beach
County Canvassing Board Chairman Judge Charles Burton describing varying standards applied to imperfectly
punched ballots in Palm Beach County during precertification manual recount); id., at 497-500 (similarly describing varying standards applied in Miami-Dade County); Tr.
of Hearing 8-10 (Dec. 8, 2000) (soliciting from county
canvassing boards proposed protocols for determining
voters'intent but declining to provide a precise, uniform
standard). I can conceive of no legitimate state interest
served by these differing treatments of the expressions of
voters'fundamental rights. The differences appear wholly
arbitrary.
</p><p>
In deciding what to do about this, we should take account of the fact that electoral votes are due to be cast in
six days. I would therefore remand the case to the courts
of Florida with instructions to establish uniform standards
for evaluating the several types of ballots that have
prompted differing treatments, to be applied within and
among counties when passing on such identical ballots in
any further recounting (or successive recounting) that the
courts might order.
</p><p>
Unlike the majority, I see no warrant for this Court to
assume that Florida could not possibly comply with this
requirement before the date set for the meeting of electors,
December 18. Although one of the dissenting justices of
the State Supreme Court estimated that disparate standards potentially affected 170,000 votes, Gore v. Harris,
supra, ___ So. 2d, at ___ (slip op., at 66), the number at
issue is significantly smaller. The 170,000 figure apparently represents all uncounted votes, both undervotes
(those for which no Presidential choice was recorded by a
machine) and overvotes (those rejected because of votes for
more than one candidate). Tr. of Oral Arg. 61-62. But as
JUSTICE BREYER has pointed out, no showing has been
made of legal overvotes uncounted, and counsel for Gore
made an uncontradicted representation to the Court that
the statewide total of undervotes is about 60,000. Id., at
62. To recount these manually would be a tall order, but
before this Court stayed the effort to do that the courts of
Florida were ready to do their best to get that job done.
There is no justification for denying the State the opportunity to try to count all disputed ballots now.
</p><p>
I respectfully dissent.
</p><p>

</p><hr>
<a aria-label="Move to footnote 1" name="so1"></a><a aria-label="Move to footnote 1" href="#soo1">1</a> When the Florida court ruled, the totals for Bush and Gore were
then less than 1,000 votes apart. One dissent pegged the number of
uncounted votes in question at 170,000. Gore v. Harris, supra, __
So. 2d __ , (slip op., at 66) (opinion of Harding, J.). Gore's counsel
represented to us that the relevant figure is approximately 60,000, Tr.
of Oral Arg. 62, the number of ballots in which no vote for President
was recorded by the machines.

as to Part I, dissenting.

</p><h2>I</h2>

The CHIEF JUSTICE acknowledges that provisions of
Florida's Election Code "may well admit of more than one
interpretation." Ante, at 3. But instead of respecting the
state high court's province to say what the State's Election
Code means, THE CHIEF JUSTICE maintains that Florida's
Supreme Court has veered so far from the ordinary practice of judicial review that what it did cannot properly be
called judging. My colleagues have offered a reasonable
construction of Florida's law. Their construction coincides
with the view of one of Florida's seven Supreme Court
justices. Gore v. Harris, __ So. 2d __, __ (Fla. 2000) (slip
op., at 45-55) (Wells, C. J., dissenting); Palm Beach
County Canvassing Bd. v. Harris, __ So. 2d __, __ (Fla.
2000) (slip op., at 34) (on remand) (confirming, 6-1, the
construction of Florida law advanced in Gore). I might
join THE CHIEF JUSTICE were it my commission to interpret Florida law. But disagreement with the Florida
court's interpretation of its own State's law does not warrant the conclusion that the justices of that court have
legislated. There is no cause here to believe that the members of Florida's high court have done less than "their
mortal best to discharge their oath of office," Sumner v.
Mata, 449 U. S. 539, 549 (1981), and no cause to upset
their reasoned interpretation of Florida law.
<p>
This Court more than occasionally affirms statutory,
and even constitutional, interpretations with which it
disagrees. For example, when reviewing challenges to
administrative agencies' interpretations of laws they
implement, we defer to the agencies unless their interpretation violates "the unambiguously expressed intent of
Congress." Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources
Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843 (1984). We do so
in the face of the declaration in Article I of the United
States Constitution that "All legislative Powers herein
granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United
States." Surely the Constitution does not call upon us to
pay more respect to a federal administrative agency's
construction of federal law than to a state high court's
interpretation of its own state's law. And not uncommonly, we let stand state-court interpretations of federal
law with which we might disagree. Notably, in the habeas
context, the Court adheres to the view that "there is 'no
intrinsic reason why the fact that a man is a federal judge
should make him more competent, or conscientious, or
learned with respect to [federal law] than his neighbor in
the state courthouse.'" Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465,
494, n. 35 (1976) (quoting Bator, Finality in Criminal Law
and Federal Habeas Corpus For State Prisoners, 76 Harv.
L. Rev. 441, 509 (1963)); see O'Dell v. Netherland, 521
U. S. 151, 156 (1997) ("[T]he Teague doctrine validates
reasonable, good-faith interpretations of existing precedents made by state courts even though they are shown to
be contrary to later decisions.") (citing Butler v. McKellar,
494 U. S. 407, 414 (1990)); O'Connor, Trends in the Relationship Between the Federal and State Courts from the
Perspective of a State Court Judge, 22 Wm. &amp; Mary
L. Rev. 801, 813 (1981) ("There is no reason to assume
that state court judges cannot and will not provide a
'hospitable forum' in litigating federal constitutional
questions.").
</p><p>
No doubt there are cases in which the proper application
of federal law may hinge on interpretations of state law.
Unavoidably, this Court must sometimes examine state
law in order to protect federal rights. But we have dealt
with such cases ever mindful of the full measure of respect
we owe to interpretations of state law by a State's highest
court. In the Contract Clause case, General Motors Corp.
v. Romein, 503 U. S. 181 (1992), for example, we said that
although "ultimately we are bound to decide for ourselves
whether a contract was made," the Court "accord[s] respectful consideration and great weight to the views of the
State's highest court." Id., at 187 (citation omitted). And
in Central Union Telephone Co. v. Edwardsville, 269 U. S.
190 (1925), we upheld the Illinois Supreme Court's interpretation of a state waiver rule, even though that interpretation resulted in the forfeiture of federal constitutional rights. Refusing to supplant Illinois law with a
federal definition of waiver, we explained that the state
court's declaration "should bind us unless so unfair or
unreasonable in its application to those asserting a federal
right as to obstruct it." Id., at 195.<a aria-label="Move to footnote 1" href="#gi1">1</a><a name="gii1"></a>

</p><p>
In deferring to state courts on matters of state law, we
appropriately recognize that this Court acts as an " 'outside[r]'lacking the common exposure to local law which
comes from sitting in the jurisdiction." Lehman Brothers
v. Schein, 416 U. S. 386, 391 (1974). That recognition has
sometimes prompted us to resolve doubts about the
meaning of state law by certifying issues to a State's highest court, even when federal rights are at stake. Cf. Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U. S. 43, 79
(1997) ("Warnings against premature adjudication of constitutional questions bear heightened attention when a federal
court is asked to invalidate a State's law, for the federal
tribunal risks friction-generating error when it endeavors to
construe a novel state Act not yet reviewed by the State's
highest court."). Notwithstanding our authority to decide
issues of state law underlying federal claims, we have used
the certification devise to afford state high courts an opportunity to inform us on matters of their own State's law
because such restraint "helps build a cooperative judicial
federalism." Lehman Brothers, 416 U. S., at 391.
</p><p>
Just last Term, in Fiore v. White, 528 U. S. 23 (1999), we
took advantage of Pennsylvania's certification procedure.
In that case, a state prisoner brought a federal habeas
action claiming that the State had failed to prove an essential element of his charged offense in violation of the
Due Process Clause. Id., at 25-26. Instead of resolving
the state-law question on which the federal claim depended, we certified the question to the Pennsylvania
Supreme Court for that court to "help determine the
proper state-law predicate for our determination of the
federal constitutional questions raised." Id., at 29; id., at
28 (asking the Pennsylvania Supreme Court whether its
recent interpretation of the statute under which Fiore was
convicted "was always the statute's meaning, even at the
time of Fiore's trial").
THE CHIEF JUSTICE's willingness to
reverse the Florida Supreme Court's interpretation of Florida law in this case is at least in tension with our reluctance
in Fiore even to interpret Pennsylvania law before seeking
instruction from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. I would
have thought the "cautious approach" we counsel when
federal courts address matters of state law, Arizonans, 520
U. S., at 77, and our commitment to "build[ing] cooperative
judicial federalism," Lehman Brothers, 416 U. S., at 391,
demanded greater restraint.
</p><p>
Rarely has this Court rejected outright an interpretation of state law by a state high court.
Fairfax's Devisee v.
Hunter's Lessee, 7 Cranch 603 (1813), NAACP v. Alabama
ex rel. Patterson, 357 U. S. 449 (1958), and Bouie v. City of
Columbia, 378 U. S. 347 (1964), cited by THE CHIEF
JUSTICE, are three such rare instances. See ante, at 4, 5,
and n. 2. But those cases are embedded in historical
contexts hardly comparable to the situation here.
Fairfax's Devisee, which held that the Virginia Court of
Appeals had misconstrued its own forfeiture laws to deprive a British subject of lands secured to him by federal
treaties, occurred amidst vociferous States'rights attacks
on the Marshall Court. G. Gunther &amp; K. Sullivan, Constitutional Law 61-62 (13th ed. 1997). The Virginia court
refused to obey this Court's Fairfax's Devisee mandate to
enter judgment for the British subject's successor in interest. That refusal led to the Court's pathmarking decision
in Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304 (1816).
Patterson, a case decided three months after Cooper v. Aaron,
358 U. S. 1 (1958), in the face of Southern resistance to the
civil rights movement, held that the Alabama Supreme
Court had irregularly applied its own procedural rules to
deny review of a contempt order against the NAACP
arising from its refusal to disclose membership lists. We
said that "our jurisdiction is not defeated if the nonfederal
ground relied on by the state court is without any fair or
substantial support." 357 U. S., at 455.
Bouie, stemming
from a lunch counter "sit-in" at the height of the civil
rights movement, held that the South Carolina Supreme
Court's construction of its trespass laws -- criminalizing
conduct not covered by the text of an otherwise clear
statute -- was "unforeseeable" and thus violated due process when applied retroactively to the petitioners. 378
U. S., at 350, 354.
</p><p>
THE CHIEF JUSTICE's casual citation of these cases
might lead one to believe they are part of a larger collection of cases in which we said that the Constitution impelled us to train a skeptical eye on a state court's portrayal of state law. But one would be hard pressed, I
think, to find additional cases that fit the mold. As
JUSTICE BREYER convincingly explains, see post, at 5-9
(dissenting opinion), this case involves nothing close to the
kind of recalcitrance by a state high court that warrants
extraordinary action by this Court. The Florida Supreme
Court concluded that counting every legal vote was the
overriding concern of the Florida Legislature when it
enacted the State's Election Code. The court surely should
not be bracketed with state high courts of the Jim Crow
South.
</p><p>
THE CHIEF JUSTICE says that Article II, by providing
that state legislatures shall direct the manner of appointing electors, authorizes federal superintendence over the
relationship between state courts and state legislatures,
and licenses a departure from the usual deference we give
to state court interpretations of state law. Ante, at 5 ("To
attach definitive weight to the pronouncement of a state
court, when the very question at issue is whether the court
has actually departed from the statutory meaning, would
be to abdicate our responsibility to enforce the explicit
requirements of Article II."). The Framers of our Constitution, however, understood that in a republican government, the judiciary would construe the legislature's enactments. See U. S. Const., Art. III; The Federalist No. 78
(A. Hamilton). In light of the constitutional guarantee to
States of a "Republican Form of Government," U. S.
Const., Art. IV, §4, Article II can hardly be read to invite
this Court to disrupt a State's republican regime. Yet THE
CHIEF JUSTICE today would reach out to do just that. By
holding that Article II requires our revision of a state
court's construction of state laws in order to protect one
organ of the State from another, THE CHIEF JUSTICE
contradicts the basic principle that a State may organize
itself as it sees fit. See, e.g., Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S.
452, 460 (1991) ("Through the structure of its government,
and the character of those who exercise government
authority, a State defines itself as a sovereign."); Highland
Farms Dairy, Inc. v. Agnew, 300 U. S. 608, 612 (1937)
("How power shall be distributed by a state among its
governmental organs is commonly, if not always, a question for the state itself.").<a aria-label="Move to footnote 2" href="#gi2">2</a><a name="gii2"></a> Article II does not call for the
scrutiny undertaken by this Court.
</p><p>
The extraordinary setting of this case has obscured the



ordinary principle that dictates its proper resolution:
Federal courts defer to state high courts'interpretations of
their state's own law. This principle reflects the core of
federalism, on which all agree. "The Framers split the
atom of sovereignty. It was the genius of their idea that
our citizens would have two political capacities, one state
and one federal, each protected from incursion by the
other." Saenz v. Roe, 526 U. S. 489, 504, n. 17 (1999)
(citing U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U. S. 779,
838 (1995) (KENNEDY, J., concurring)). THE CHIEF
JUSTICE's solicitude for the Florida Legislature comes at
the expense of the more fundamental solicitude we owe to
the legislature's sovereign. U. S. Const., Art. II, §1, cl. 2
("Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct," the electors for President and
Vice President) (emphasis added); ante, at 1-2 (STEVENS,
J., dissenting).<a aria-label="Move to footnote 3" href="#gi3">3</a><a name="gii3"></a> Were the other members of this Court as
mindful as they generally are of our system of dual sovereignty, they would affirm the judgment of the Florida
Supreme Court.

</p><h2>II</h2>

I agree with JUSTICE STEVENS that petitioners have not
presented a substantial equal protection claim. Ideally,
perfection would be the appropriate standard for judging
the recount. But we live in an imperfect world, one in



which thousands of votes have not been counted. I cannot
agree that the recount adopted by the Florida court,
flawed as it may be, would yield a result any less fair or
precise than the certification that preceded that recount.
See, e.g., McDonald v. Board of Election Comm'rs of Chicago, 394 U.S. 802, 807 (1969) (even in the context of the
right to vote, the state is permitted to reform " 'one step at
a time'") (quoting Williamson v. Lee Optical of Oklahoma,
Inc., 348 U.S. 483, 489 (1955)).
<p>
Even if there were an equal protection violation, I would
agree with JUSTICE STEVENS, JUSTICE SOUTER, and
JUSTICE BREYER that the Court's concern about "the December 12 deadline," ante, at 12, is misplaced. Time is
short in part because of the Court's entry of a stay on
December 9, several hours after an able circuit judge in
Leon County had begun to superintend the recount process. More fundamentally, the Court's reluctance to let the
recount go forward -- despite its suggestion that "[t]he
search for intent can be confined by specific rules designed
to ensure uniform treatment,"ante, at 8 -- ultimately turns
on its own judgment about the practical realities of implementing a recount, not the judgment of those much
closer to the process.
</p><p>
Equally important, as JUSTICE BREYER explains, post, at
12 (dissenting opinion), the December 12 "deadline" for
bringing Florida's electoral votes into 3 U. S. C. §5's safe
harbor lacks the significance the Court assigns it. Were
that date to pass, Florida would still be entitled to deliver
electoral votes Congress must count unless both Houses
find that the votes "ha[d] not been . . . regularly given." 3
U. S. C. §15. The statute identifies other significant dates.
See, e.g., §7 (specifying December 18 as the date electors
"shall meet and give their votes"); §12 (specifying "the
fourth Wednesday in December" -- this year, December
27 -- as the date on which Congress, if it has not received a
State's electoral votes, shall request the state secretary of
state to send a certified return immediately). But none of
these dates has ultimate significance in light of Congress'
detailed provisions for determining, on "the sixth day of
January,"the validity of electoral votes. §15.
</p><p>
The Court assumes that time will not permit "orderly
judicial review of any disputed matters that might arise."
Ante, at 12. But no one has doubted the good faith and
diligence with which Florida election officials, attorneys
for all sides of this controversy, and the courts of law have
performed their duties. Notably, the Florida Supreme
Court has produced two substantial opinions within 29
hours of oral argument. In sum, the Court's conclusion
that a constitutionally adequate recount is impractical is a
prophecy the Court's own judgment will not allow to be
tested. Such an untested prophecy should not decide the
Presidency of the United States.

due process entitled him to deduct a state gasoline excise tax in computing the amount of his sales subject to a state sales tax, on the
grounds that the legal incidence of the excise tax fell on his customers
and that he acted merely as a collector of the tax. The Mississippi
Supreme Court held that the legal incidence of the excise tax fell on
petitioner. Observing that "a State's highest court is the final judicial
arbiter of the meaning of state statutes," we said that "[w]hen a state
court has made its own definitive determination as to the operating

GEORGE W. BUSH, ET AL., PETITIONERS v.<br>

<br>
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE FLORIDA SUPREME COURT<br>
<br>
[December 12, 2000]<br>
<hr>

<p>
<b>JUSTICE BREYER</b>, with whom <b>JUSTICE STEVENS</b> and
<b>JUSTICE GINSBURG</b> join except as to Part I-A-1, and with
whom <b>JUSTICE SOUTER</b> joins as to Part I, dissenting.
The Court was wrong to take this case. It was wrong to
grant a stay. It should now vacate that stay and permit
the Florida Supreme Court to decide whether the recount
should resume.

</p><h2>I</h2>
The political implications of this case for the country are
momentous. But the federal legal questions presented,
with one exception, are insubstantial.

<h2>A</h2>
<h2>1</h2>
The majority raises three Equal Protection problems
with the Florida Supreme Court's recount order: first, the
failure to include overvotes in the manual recount; second,
the fact that all ballots, rather than simply the undervotes, were recounted in some, but not all, counties; and
third, the absence of a uniform, specific standard to guide
the recounts. As far as the first issue is concerned, petitioners presented no evidence, to this Court or to any
Florida court, that a manual recount of overvotes would
identify additional legal votes. The same is true of the
second, and, in addition, the majority's reasoning would
seem to invalidate any state provision for a manual recount of individual counties in a statewide election.
<p>
The majority's third concern does implicate principles of
fundamental fairness. The majority concludes that the
Equal Protection Clause requires that a manual recount
be governed not only by the uniform general standard of
the "clear intent of the voter,"but also by uniform subsidiary standards (for example, a uniform determination
whether indented, but not perforated, "undervotes" should
count). The opinion points out that the Florida Supreme
Court ordered the inclusion of Broward County's undercounted "legal votes" even though those votes included
ballots that were not perforated but simply "dimpled,"
while newly recounted ballots from other counties will
likely include only votes determined to be "legal" on the
basis of a stricter standard. In light of our previous remand, the Florida Supreme Court may have been reluctant to adopt a more specific standard than that provided
for by the legislature for fear of exceeding its authority
under Article II. However, since the use of different standards could favor one or the other of the candidates, since
time was, and is, too short to permit the lower courts to
iron out significant differences through ordinary judicial
review, and since the relevant distinction was embodied in
the order of the State's highest court, I agree that, in these
very special circumstances, basic principles of fairness
may well have counseled the adoption of a uniform standard to address the problem. In light of the majority's
disposition, I need not decide whether, or the extent to
which, as a remedial matter, the Constitution would place
limits upon the content of the uniform standard.

</p><h2>2</h2>

Nonetheless, there is no justification for the majority's
remedy, which is simply to reverse the lower court and
halt the recount entirely. An appropriate remedy would
be, instead, to remand this case with instructions that,
even at this late date, would permit the Florida Supreme
Court to require recounting all undercounted votes in
Florida, including those from Broward, Volusia, Palm
Beach, and Miami-Dade Counties, whether or not previously recounted prior to the end of the protest period, and
to do so in accordance with a single-uniform substandard.
<p>
The majority justifies stopping the recount entirely on
the ground that there is no more time. In particular, the
majority relies on the lack of time for the Secretary to
review and approve equipment needed to separate undervotes. But the majority reaches this conclusion in the
absence of any record evidence that the recount could not
have been completed in the time allowed by the Florida
Supreme Court. The majority finds facts outside of the
record on matters that state courts are in a far better
position to address. Of course, it is too late for any such
recount to take place by December 12, the date by which
election disputes must be decided if a State is to take
advantage of the safe harbor provisions of 3 U. S. C. §5.
Whether there is time to conduct a recount prior to December 18, when the electors are scheduled to meet, is a
matter for the state courts to determine. And whether,
under Florida law, Florida could or could not take further
action is obviously a matter for Florida courts, not this
Court, to decide. See ante, at 13 (per curiam).
</p><p>
By halting the manual recount, and thus ensuring that
the uncounted legal votes will not be counted under any
standard, this Court crafts a remedy out of proportion to
the asserted harm. And that remedy harms the very
fairness interests the Court is attempting to protect. The
manual recount would itself redress a problem of unequal
treatment of ballots. As JUSTICE STEVENS points out, see
ante, at 4 and n. 4 (STEVENS, J., dissenting opinion), the
ballots of voters in counties that use punch-card systems
are more likely to be disqualified than those in counties
using optical-scanning systems. According to recent news
reports, variations in the undervote rate are even more
pronounced. See Fessenden, No-Vote Rates Higher in
Punch Card Count, N. Y. Times, Dec. 1, 2000, p. A29
(reporting that 0.3% of ballots cast in 30 Florida counties
using optical-scanning systems registered no Presidential
vote, in comparison to 1.53% in the 15 counties using Votomatic punch card ballots). Thus, in a system that allows
counties to use different types of voting systems, voters
already arrive at the polls with an unequal chance that
their votes will be counted. I do not see how the fact that
this results from counties' selection of different voting
machines rather than a court order makes the outcome
any more fair. Nor do I understand why the Florida Supreme Court's recount order, which helps to redress this
inequity, must be entirely prohibited based on a deficiency
that could easily be remedied.

</p><h2>B</h2>

The remainder of petitioners' claims, which are the
focus of the CHIEF JUSTICE's concurrence, raise no significant federal questions. I cannot agree that the CHIEF
JUSTICE's unusual review of state law in this case, see
ante, at 5-8 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting opinion), is justified
by reference either to Art. II, §1, or to 3 U. S. C. §5.
Moreover, even were such review proper, the conclusion
that the Florida Supreme Court's decision contravenes
federal law is untenable.
<p>
While conceding that, in most cases, "comity and respect
for federalism compel us to defer to the decisions of state
courts on issues of state law," the concurrence relies on
some combination of Art. II, §1, and 3 U. S. C. §5 to justify
the majority's conclusion that this case is one of the few in
which we may lay that fundamental principle aside. Ante,
at 2 (Opinion of REHNQUIST, C. J. The concurrence's
primary foundation for this conclusion rests on an appeal
to plain text: Art. II, §1's grant of the power to appoint
Presidential electors to the State "Legislature." Ibid. But
neither the text of Article II itself nor the only case the
concurrence cites that interprets Article II, McPherson v.
Blacker, 146 U. S. 1 (1892), leads to the conclusion that
Article II grants unlimited power to the legislature, devoid
of any state constitutional limitations, to select the manner of appointing electors. See id., at 41 (specifically
referring to state constitutional provision in upholding
state law regarding selection of electors). Nor, as JUSTICE
STEVENS points out, have we interpreted the Federal
constitutional provision most analogous to Art. II, §1 - Art. I, §4 -- in the strained manner put forth in the concurrence. Ante, at 1-2 and n. 1 (dissenting opinion).
</p><p>
The concurrence's treatment of §5 as "inform[ing]" its
interpretation of Article II, §1, cl. 2, ante, at 3 (REHNQUIST, C. J., concurring), is no more convincing. The
CHIEF JUSTICE contends that our opinion in Bush v. Palm
Beach County Canvassing Bd., ante, p. ____, (per curiam)
(Bush I), in which we stated that "a legislative wish to
take advantage of [§5] would counsel against" a construction of Florida law that Congress might deem to be a
change in law, id., (slip op. at 6), now means that this
Court "must ensure that post-election state court actions
do not frustrate the legislative desire to attain the 'safe
harbor'provided by §5." Ante, at 3. However, §5 is part of
the rules that govern Congress' recognition of slates of
electors. Nowhere in Bush I did we establish that this
Court had the authority to enforce §5. Nor did we suggest
that the permissive "counsel against" could be transformed into the mandatory "must ensure." And nowhere
did we intimate, as the concurrence does here, that a state
court decision that threatens the safe harbor provision of
§5 does so in violation of Article II. The concurrence's
logic turns the presumption that legislatures would wish
to take advantage of § 5's "safe harbor" provision into a
mandate that trumps other statutory provisions and
overrides the intent that the legislature did express.
</p><p>
But, in any event, the concurrence, having conducted its
review, now reaches the wrong conclusion. It says that
"the Florida Supreme Court's interpretation of the Florida
election laws impermissibly distorted them beyond what a
fair reading required, in violation of Article II." Ante, at
4-5 (REHNQUIST, C. J, concurring). But what precisely is
the distortion? Apparently, it has three elements. First,
the Florida court, in its earlier opinion, changed the election certification date from November 14 to November 26.
Second, the Florida court ordered a manual recount of
"undercounted" ballots that could not have been fully
completed by the December 12 "safe harbor" deadline.
Third, the Florida court, in the opinion now under review,
failed to give adequate deference to the determinations of
canvassing boards and the Secretary.
</p><p>
To characterize the first element as a "distortion," however, requires the concurrence to second-guess the way in
which the state court resolved a plain conflict in the language of different statutes. Compare Fla. Stat. §102.166
(2001) (foreseeing manual recounts during the protest
period) with §102.111 (setting what is arguably too short a
deadline for manual recounts to be conducted); compare
§102.112(1) (stating that the Secretary "may" ignore late
returns) with §102.111(1) (stating that the Secretary
"shall" ignore late returns). In any event, that issue no
longer has any practical importance and cannot justify the
reversal of the different Florida court decision before us
now.
</p><p>
To characterize the second element as a "distortion"
requires the concurrence to overlook the fact that the
inability of the Florida courts to conduct the recount on
time is, in significant part, a problem of the Court's own
making. The Florida Supreme Court thought that the
recount could be completed on time, and, within hours, the 
Florida Circuit Court was moving in an orderly fashion to
meet the deadline. This Court improvidently entered a
stay. As a result, we will never know whether the recount
could have been completed.
</p><p>
Nor can one characterize the third element as "impermissibl[e] distort[ing]" once one understands that there
are two sides to the opinion's argument that the Florida
Supreme Court "virtually eliminated the Secretary's discretion." Ante, at 9 (REHNQUIST, C. J, concurring). The
Florida statute in question was amended in 1999 to provide that the "grounds for contesting an election" include
the "rejection of a number of legal votes sufficient to . . .
place in doubt the result of the election." Fla. Stat.
§§102.168(3), (3)(c) (2000). And the parties have argued
about the proper meaning of the statute's term "legal
vote." The Secretary has claimed that a "legal vote" is a
vote "properly executed in accordance with the instructions provided to all registered voters." Brief for Respondent Harris et al. 10. On that interpretation, punchcard
ballots for which the machines cannot register a vote are
not "legal" votes. Id., at 14. The Florida Supreme Court
did not accept her definition. But it had a reason. Its
reason was that a different provision of Florida election
laws (a provision that addresses damaged or defective
ballots) says that no vote shall be disregarded "if there is a
clear indication of the intent of the voter as determined by
the canvassing board" (adding that ballots should not be
counted "if it is impossible to determine the elector's
choice"). Fla. Stat. §101.5614(5) (2000). Given this statutory language, certain roughly analogous judicial precedent, e.g., Darby v. State ex rel. McCollough, 75 So. 411
(Fla. 1917) (per curiam), and somewhat similar determinations by courts throughout the Nation, see cases cited
infra, at 9, the Florida Supreme Court concluded that the
term "legal vote" means a vote recorded on a ballot that
clearly reflects what the voter intended. Gore v. Harris,
___ So. 2d ___, ___ (2000) (slip op., at 19). That conclusion
differs from the conclusion of the Secretary. But nothing
in Florida law requires the Florida Supreme Court to
accept as determinative the Secretary's view on such a
matter. Nor can one say that the Court's ultimate determination is so unreasonable as to amount to a constitutionally "impermissible distort[ion]"of Florida law.
</p><p>
The Florida Supreme Court, applying this definition,
decided, on the basis of the record, that respondents had
shown that the ballots undercounted by the voting machines contained enough "legal votes"to place "the results"
of the election "in doubt." Since only a few hundred votes
separated the candidates, and since the "undercounted"
ballots numbered tens of thousands, it is difficult to see
how anyone could find this conclusion unreasonable-however strict the standard used to measure the voter's
"clear intent." Nor did this conclusion "strip" canvassing
boards of their discretion. The boards retain their traditional discretionary authority during the protest period.
And during the contest period, as the court stated, "the
Canvassing Board's actions [during the protest period]
may constitute evidence that a ballot does or does not
qualify as a legal vote." Id., at *13. Whether a local
county canvassing board's discretionary judgment during
the protest period not to conduct a manual recount will be
set aside during a contest period depends upon whether a
candidate provides additional evidence that the rejected
votes contain enough "legal votes" to place the outcome of
the race in doubt. To limit the local canvassing board's
discretion in this way is not to eliminate that discretion.
At the least, one could reasonably so believe.
</p><p>
The statute goes on to provide the Florida circuit judge
with authority to "fashion such orders as he or she deems
necessary to ensure that each allegation . . . is investigated, examined, or checked, . . . and to provide any relief
appropriate." Fla. Stat. §102.168(8) (2000) (emphasis
added). The Florida Supreme Court did just that. One
might reasonably disagree with the Florida Supreme
Court's interpretation of these, or other, words in the
statute. But I do not see how one could call its plain language interpretation of a 1999 statutory change so misguided as no longer to qualify as judicial interpretation or
as a usurpation of the authority of the State legislature.
Indeed, other state courts have interpreted roughly similar state statutes in similar ways. See, e.g., In re Election
of U. S. Representative for Second Congressional Dist., 231
Conn. 602, 621, 653 A. 2d 79, 90-91 (1994) ("Whatever the
process used to vote and to count votes, differences in
technology should not furnish a basis for disregarding the
bedrock principle that the purpose of the voting process is
to ascertain the intent of the voters"); Brown v. Carr, 130
W. Va. 401, 460, 43 S. E.2d 401, 404-405 (1947)
("[W]hether a ballot shall be counted . . . depends on the
intent of the voter . . . . Courts decry any resort to technical rules in reaching a conclusion as to the intent of the
voter").
</p><p>
I repeat, where is the "impermissible"distortion?

</p><h2>II</h2>
Despite the reminder that this case involves "an election
for the President of the United States," ante, at 1
(REHNQUIST, C. J., concurring), no preeminent legal concern, or practical concern related to legal questions, required this Court to hear this case, let alone to issue a stay
that stopped Florida's recount process in its tracks. With
one exception, petitioners'claims do not ask us to vindicate a constitutional provision designed to protect a basic
human right. See, e.g., Brown v. Board of Education, 347
U. S. 483 (1954). Petitioners invoke fundamental fairness,
namely, the need for procedural fairness, including finality.
But with the one "equal protection" exception, they rely
upon law that focuses, not upon that basic need, but upon
the constitutional allocation of power. Respondents invoke
a competing fundamental consideration -- the need to
determine the voter's true intent. But they look to state
law, not to federal constitutional law, to protect that interest. Neither side claims electoral fraud, dishonesty, or the
like. And the more fundamental equal protection claim
might have been left to the state court to resolve if and
when it was discovered to have mattered. It could still be
resolved through a remand conditioned upon issuance of a
uniform standard; it does not require reversing the Florida
Supreme Court.
<p>
Of course, the selection of the President is of fundamental national importance. But that importance is political,
not legal. And this Court should resist the temptation
unnecessarily to resolve tangential legal disputes, where
doing so threatens to determine the outcome of the election.
</p><p>
The Constitution and federal statutes themselves make
clear that restraint is appropriate. They set forth a road
map of how to resolve disputes about electors, even after
an election as close as this one. That road map foresees
resolution of electoral disputes by state courts. See 3
U. S. C. §5 (providing that, where a "State shall have
provided, by laws enacted prior to [election day], for its
final determination of any controversy or contest concerning the appointment of . . . electors . . . by judicial or
other methods," the subsequently chosen electors enter a
safe harbor free from congressional challenge). But it
nowhere provides for involvement by the United States
Supreme Court.
</p><p>
To the contrary, the Twelfth Amendment commits to
Congress the authority and responsibility to count electoral votes. A federal statute, the Electoral Count Act,
enacted after the close 1876 Hayes-Tilden Presidential
election, specifies that, after States have tried to resolve
disputes (through "judicial" or other means), Congress is 
the body primarily authorized to resolve remaining disputes. See Electoral Count Act of 1887, 24 Stat. 373, 3
U. S. C. §§5, 6, and 15.
</p><p>
The legislative history of the Act makes clear its intent
to commit the power to resolve such disputes to Congress,
rather than the courts:
</p><p></p><blockquote>
"The two Houses are, by the Constitution, authorized
to make the count of electoral votes. They can only
count legal votes, and in doing so must determine,
from the best evidence to be had, what are legal votes
.... The power to determine rests with the two
Houses, and there is no other constitutional tribunal."
H. Rep. No. 1638, 49th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1886) (report submitted by Rep. Caldwell, Select Committee on
the Election of President and Vice-President).
</blockquote><p>
The Member of Congress who introduced the Act added:
</p><p></p><blockquote>
"The power to judge of the legality of the votes is a
necessary consequent of the power to count. The existence of this power is of absolute necessity to the preservation of the Government. The interests of all the
States in their relations to each other in the Federal
Union demand that the ultimate tribunal to decide
upon the election of President should be a constituent
body, in which the States in their federal relationships and the people in their sovereign capacity
should be represented." 18 Cong. Rec. 30 (1886).
"Under the Constitution who else could decide?
Who is nearer to the State in determining a question
of vital importance to the whole union of States than
the constituent body upon whom the Constitution has
devolved the duty to count the vote?" Id., at 31. 
</blockquote><p>

The Act goes on to set out rules for the congressional
determination of disputes about those votes. If, for example, a state submits a single slate of electors, Congress
must count those votes unless both Houses agree that the
votes "have not been . . . regularly given." 3 U. S. C. § 15.
If, as occurred in 1876, one or more states submits two
sets of electors, then Congress must determine whether a
slate has entered the safe harbor of §5, in which case its
votes will have "conclusive" effect. Ibid. If, as also occurred in 1876, there is controversy about "which of two or
more of such State authorities . . . is the lawful tribunal"
authorized to appoint electors, then each House shall
determine separately which votes are "supported by the
decision of such State so authorized by its law." Ibid. If
the two Houses of Congress agree, the votes they have
approved will be counted. If they disagree, then "the votes
of the electors whose appointment shall have been certified by the executive of the State, under the seal thereof,
shall be counted." Ibid.
</p><p>
Given this detailed, comprehensive scheme for counting
electoral votes, there is no reason to believe that federal
law either foresees or requires resolution of such a political issue by this Court. Nor, for that matter, is there any
reason to that think the Constitution's Framers would
have reached a different conclusion. Madison, at least,
believed that allowing the judiciary to choose the presidential electors "was out of the question." Madison, July
25, 1787 (reprinted in 5 Elliot's Debates on the Federal
Constitution 363 (2d ed. 1876)).
</p><p>
The decision by both the Constitution's Framers and the
1886 Congress to minimize this Court's role in resolving
close federal presidential elections is as wise as it is clear.
However awkward or difficult it may be for Congress to
resolve difficult electoral disputes, Congress, being a
political body, expresses the people's will far more accurately than does an unelected Court. And the people's will
is what elections are about.
</p><p>
Moreover, Congress was fully aware of the danger that
would arise should it ask judges, unarmed with appropriate legal standards, to resolve a hotly contested Presidential election contest. Just after the 1876 Presidential
election, Florida, South Carolina, and Louisiana each sent
two slates of electors to Washington. Without these
States, Tilden, the Democrat, had 184 electoral votes, one
short of the number required to win the Presidency. With
those States, Hayes, his Republican opponent, would have
had 185. In order to choose between the two slates of
electors, Congress decided to appoint an electoral commission composed of five Senators, five Representatives, and
five Supreme Court Justices. Initially the Commission
was to be evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats, with Justice David Davis, an Independent, to possess the decisive vote. However, when at the last minute
the Illinois Legislature elected Justice Davis to the United
States Senate, the final position on the Commission was
filled by Supreme Court Justice Joseph P. Bradley.
</p><p>
The Commission divided along partisan lines, and the
responsibility to cast the deciding vote fell to Justice
Bradley. He decided to accept the votes by the Republican
electors, and thereby awarded the Presidency to Hayes.
</p><p>
Justice Bradley immediately became the subject of
vociferous attacks. Bradley was accused of accepting
bribes, of being captured by railroad interests, and of an
eleventh-hour change in position after a night in which his
house "was surrounded by the carriages" of Republican
partisans and railroad officials. C. Woodward, Reunion
and Reaction 159-160 (1966). Many years later, Professor
Bickel concluded that Bradley was honest and impartial.
He thought that "'the great question'for Bradley was, in
fact, whether Congress was entitled to go behind election
returns or had to accept them as certified by state authorities,"an "issue of principle." The Least Dangerous Branch
185 (1962). Nonetheless, Bickel points out, the legal
question upon which Justice Bradley's decision turned was
not very important in the contemporaneous political context. He says that "in the circumstances the issue of
principle was trivial, it was overwhelmed by all that hung
in the balance, and it should not have been decisive."Ibid.
</p><p>
For present purposes, the relevance of this history lies
in the fact that the participation in the work of the electoral commission by five Justices, including Justice Bradley, did not lend that process legitimacy. Nor did it assure
the public that the process had worked fairly, guided by
the law. Rather, it simply embroiled Members of the
Court in partisan conflict, thereby undermining respect for
the judicial process. And the Congress that later enacted
the Electoral Count Act knew it.
</p><p>
This history may help to explain why I think it not only
legally wrong, but also most unfortunate, for the Court
simply to have terminated the Florida recount. Those who
caution judicial restraint in resolving political disputes
have described the quintessential case for that restraint as
a case marked, among other things, by the "strangeness of
the issue," its "intractability to principled resolution," its
"sheer momentousness, . . . which tends to unbalance
judicial judgment," and "the inner vulnerability, the self-doubt of an institution which is electorally irresponsible
and has no earth to draw strength from." Bickel, supra, at
184. Those characteristics mark this case.
</p><p>
At the same time, as I have said, the Court is not acting
to vindicate a fundamental constitutional principle, such
as the need to protect a basic human liberty. No other
strong reason to act is present. Congressional statutes
tend to obviate the need. And, above all, in this highly
politicized matter, the appearance of a split decision runs
the risk of undermining the public's confidence in the
Court itself. That confidence is a public treasure. It has
been built slowly over many years, some of which were 
marked by a Civil War and the tragedy of segregation. It
is a vitally necessary ingredient of any successful effort to
protect basic liberty and, indeed, the rule of law itself. We
run no risk of returning to the days when a President
(responding to this Court's efforts to protect the Cherokee
Indians) might have said, "John Marshall has made his
decision; now let him enforce it!" Loth, Chief Justice John
Marshall and The Growth of the American Republic 365
(1948). But we do risk a self-inflicted wound  -- a wound
that may harm not just the Court, but the Nation.
</p><p>
I fear that in order to bring this agonizingly long election process to a definitive conclusion, we have not adequately attended to that necessary "check upon our own
exercise of power," "our own sense of self-restraint."
United States v. Butler, 297 U. S. 1, 79 (1936) (Stone, J.,
dissenting). Justice Brandeis once said of the Court, "The
most important thing we do is not doing." Bickel, supra,
at 71. What it does today, the Court should have left
undone. I would repair the damage done as best we now
can, by permitting the Florida recount to continue under
uniform standards.
</p><p>
I respectfully dissent.
