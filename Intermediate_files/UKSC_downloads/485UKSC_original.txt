</span>This appeal raises two issues relating to the deportation of “foreign
criminals” as defined in the UK Borders Act 2007. The first concerns the
significance of sections 32 and 33 of that Act in appeals relating to
deportation which are based on article 8 of the European Convention on Human
Rights. The second concerns the significance, in the same context, of changes
to the Immigration Rules which came into effect in July 2012.</a></p><a name="para1">

legislative framework, as it stood at the time of the events with which this
appeal is concerned. It is unnecessary to consider more recent amendments to
the legislation, including those effected by the Immigration Act 2014.</a></p><a name="para2">

</span>Section 3(5) of the Immigration Act 1971 provides that a person who is
not a British citizen is liable to deportation from the United Kingdom if (a)
the Secretary of State deems his deportation to be conducive to the public
good, or (b) another person to whose family he belongs is or has been ordered
to be deported. Section 3(6) provides that, without prejudice to the operation
of section 3(5), a person who is not a British citizen shall also be liable to
deportation if, after he has attained the age of 17, he is convicted of an
offence for which he is punishable by imprisonment and on his conviction is
recommended for deportation by a court empowered by the Act to do so.</a></p><a name="para3">

</span>Section 5(1) provides that, where a person is liable to deportation
under section 3(5) or (6), the Secretary of State may make a deportation order
against him. A deportation order is defined as an order requiring the person to
leave and prohibiting him from entering the UK. Section 5(5) gives effect to
the provisions of Schedule 3 with respect to the removal from the United
Kingdom of persons against whom deportation orders are in force. In particular,
paragraph 1 of Schedule 3 provides that, where a deportation order is in force
against any person, the Secretary of State may give directions for his removal to
a country or territory specified in the directions.</a></p><a name="para4">

section 3(5)(a) of the 1971 Act, does not therefore depend on any assessment by
the Secretary of State: it is automatic. The expression “foreign criminal” is
defined by section 32(1) of the 2007 Act as meaning a person who is not a
British citizen, who is convicted in the United Kingdom of an offence, and to
whom one of the conditions in section 32(2) and (3) applies. The first of those
conditions is that the person is sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at
least 12 months. The second is that the offence is specified by an order made by
the Secretary of State, and the person is sentenced to a period of
imprisonment. No such order has yet been made.</a></p><a name="para10">

</span>It follows from the concluding words of section 33(7) that the fact that
the removal of a foreign criminal would breach his Convention rights does not
affect the application of section 32(4), in terms of which his deportation is
conducive to the public good. Nor does it prevent the making of a deportation
order. On the other hand, it results in the disapplication of section 32(5) of
the 2007 Act. Parliament made that clear in section 33(2)(a), read with section
33(1)(a). The Secretary of State is therefore under no duty to make a
deportation order. It may seem puzzling that a person may be liable to
deportation even when he cannot be deported, but a possible explanation is that
the circumstances which may render deportation incompatible with the Convention
can be temporary. For example, the risk of a breach of article 3 in the country
to which the person would be deported may disappear following a change of
regime, or be removed as a result of negotiated guarantees. Section 32(4) keeps
open the possibility of automatic deportation under section 32(5) in the event
of a material change of circumstances.</a></p><a name="para12">

</span>If the Secretary of State accepts that removal would breach a foreign
criminal’s Convention rights, then she will not make a deportation order: the
Immigration Rules have stated since October 2000 that a deportation order will
not be made if the person’s removal pursuant to the order would be contrary to
the UK’s obligations under the Convention. If, on the other hand, the Secretary
of State rejects a claim that removal would breach the foreign criminal’s Convention
rights, she must decide to make a deportation order as required by section
32(5). As explained earlier, an appeal lies under section 82(1) and (3A) of the
2002 Act against the decision that section 32(5) applies, on the ground that
the decision, or removal, is unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act
1998, or on the ground that the decision is not in accordance with immigration
rules, or is otherwise not in accordance with the law.</a></p><a name="para13">

</span>Sections 32 and 33 were enacted in response to Parliamentary and
public concern about failures to deport large numbers of foreign citizens who
had committed serious offences in the UK, due partly to the practices followed
by the Home Office at that time (under which there was not, until July 2006,
any presumption in favour of deportation), and partly to delays and uncertainty
affecting the procedures for deportation. The level of that concern, and the
justification for it, are apparent from the documents forming the background to
the 2007 Act: see, in particular, <i>Immigration Control, </i>House of Commons
Home Affairs Committee, Fifth Report for 2005-06, HC 775-I, paras 516-535, and <i>Fair,
effective, transparent and trusted: Rebuilding confidence in our immigration system,
</i>Home Office, July 2006. (One might observe, in parenthesis, that the
present appeal illustrates the extent to which delays and uncertainty continue
to affect the system: a deportation order was made in 2010, and the appeal
proceedings have not yet been completed). Sections 32 and 33 make clear Parliament’s
view that there is a strong public interest in the deportation of foreign
nationals who have committed serious offences, and that the procedures for
their deportation should be expeditious and effective. The strength of that
public interest is reflected in Laws LJ’s observation that for a claim under
article 8 of the ECHR to prevail, it must be “a very strong claim indeed”: <i>SS

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Decision-making in relation to immigration and deportation is not
exhaustively regulated by legislation. It also involves the exercise of
discretion, and the making of evaluative judgments, by the Secretary of State
and her officials. A perennial challenge, in such a situation, is to achieve
consistency in decision-making while reaching decisions which are appropriate
to the case in hand. The solution generally lies in the adoption of
administrative policies to guide decision-making: something which the courts
have accepted is legitimate, provided two general requirements are met. First,
discretionary powers must be exercised in accordance with any policy or
guidance indicated by Parliament in the relevant legislation: <i>Padfield v
Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1968/1.html">[1968] AC 997</a>. In relation to
the deportation of foreign offenders, the relevant legislation includes
sections 32 and 33 of the 2007 Act. Secondly, decision-makers should not shut
their ears to claims falling outside the policies they have adopted: <i>British
Oxygen Co Ltd v Minister of Technology </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1970/4.html">[1971] AC 610</a>). As Lord Reid
observed in that case at p 625, there may not be any great difference between a
policy and a rule: some policies may constitute more or less flexible guidance,
but others may be more formal and prescriptive.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para16">16.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Immigration Rules are an example of policies of the latter kind.
They are unusual in having a statutory basis, in requiring the approbation of
Parliament, and in being published as House of Commons papers. Section 1(4) of
the 1971 Act refers to “the rules laid down by the Secretary of State as to the
practice to be followed in the administration of this Act for regulating the
entry into and stay in the United Kingdom of persons not having the right of
abode”. Section 3(2) requires the Secretary of State to lay before Parliament
“statements of the rules, or any changes in the rules, laid down by him as to
the practice to be followed in the administration of this Act for regulating
the entry into and stay in the United Kingdom of persons required by this Act
to have leave to enter”. As was said in <i>R (Munir) v Secretary of State for
the Home Department </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2012/32.html">[2012] UKSC 32</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2012/32.html">[2012] 1 WLR 2192</a>, para 29, the point
of this provision is to give Parliament a degree of control over the practice
to be followed by the Secretary of State in the administration of the 1971 Act
for regulating immigration control.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para17">17.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Rules are not law (although they are treated as if they were law for
the purposes of section 86(3)(a) of the 2002 Act: see para 8 above), but a
statement of the Secretary of State’s administrative practice: see <i>Odelola v
Secretary of State for the Home Department </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2009/25.html">[2009] UKHL 25</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2009/25.html">[2009] 1 WLR 1230</a>, paras 6 and 7; <i>Munir, </i>para 37; <i>Mahad v Entry Clearance Officer </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2009/16.html">[2009] UKSC 16</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2009/16.html">[2010] 1 WLR 48</a>, para 10; <i>R (Aguilar Quila) v Secretary of State

They do not therefore possess the
same degree of democratic legitimacy as legislation made by Parliament: <i>Huang

Nevertheless, they give effect to the policy of the Secretary of
State, who has been entrusted by Parliament with responsibility for immigration
control and is accountable to Parliament for her discharge of her
responsibilities in this vital area. Furthermore, they are laid before
Parliament, may be the subject of debate, and can be disapproved under the
negative resolution procedure. They are therefore made in the exercise of
powers which have been democratically conferred, and are subject, albeit to a
limited extent, to democratic procedures of accountability.</p>

</span>The Secretary of State has a wide residual power under the 1971 Act to
grant leave to enter or remain in the UK even where leave would not be given
under the Rules: <i>Munir, </i>para 44. The manner in which that power should
be exercised is not, by its very nature, governed by the Rules. There is a duty
to exercise the power where a failure to do so is incompatible with Convention
rights, by virtue of section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.</a></p><a name="para18">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Prior to July 2012, the Rules did not specifically address the
requirements of article 8. From October 2000 onwards, rule 2 instructed the
relevant officials to carry out their duties in compliance with the provisions
of the Human Rights Act 1998. There were also specific rules dealing with
deportation, which set out in rule 364 a non-exhaustive list of factors to be
taken into account, and provided in rule 380 that a deportation order would not
be made if removal would be contrary to the UK’s obligations under the Refugee
Convention or the ECHR. With effect from July 2006, rule 364 was amended so as
to provide that, subject to rule 380, where a person was liable to deportation
the presumption should be that the public interest required deportation. All
relevant factors were to be taken into account in considering whether the
presumption was outweighed in any particular case, but it was said that it
would only be in exceptional circumstances that the public interest in
deportation would be outweighed in a case where it would not be contrary to the
ECHR or the Refugee Convention to deport. Rule 364A, introduced after the
enactment of the 2007 Act, disapplied rule 364 where section 32(5) of that Act
applied.</a></p><a name="para19">

</span>On 13 June 2012 the Secretary of State laid before Parliament a
Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules (HC 194), which (so far as material)
deleted a number of the previous rules, including rules 364, 364A and 380, and
inserted a number of new rules (which will be referred to as the “new rules”).
The new rules were formally made under the negative resolution procedure, and
came into force on 9 July 2012. There was also a debate in the House of Commons
on 19 June 2012, in which the changes to the Rules were discussed, on a motion
“that this House supports the Government in recognising that the right to
respect for family or private life in article 8 of the European Convention on
Human Rights is a qualified right and agrees that the conditions for migrants
to enter or remain in the UK on the basis of their family or private life
should be those contained in the Immigration Rules.” The motion was agreed
without a vote (Hansard (HC Debates) 19 June 2012, cols 760-823).</a></p><a name="para20">

</span>It is apparent from the documents which accompanied the Statement of
Changes that the changes to the Rules were intended to promote consistency,
predictability and transparency in decision-making where issues under article 8
arose, and to clarify the policy framework. The changes were said to reflect
the Government’s and Parliament’s view of how, as a matter of public policy, the
balance should be struck between the right to respect for private and family
life and the public interest in public safety by protecting the public from
foreign criminals: Statement of Intent: Family Migration,<i> </i>Home Office,
June 2012, para 33. The changes were also intended to align the Rules with the
body of case law concerning article 8, and in particular to reflect a
consideration of the proportionality of deportation in accordance with article
8: paras 36-38<i>.</i></a></p><a name="para21">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In relation to the deportation of foreign offenders, in particular, it
was explained in the Statement of Intent<i> </i>that the Secretary of State
considered that there were some offenders who should almost always be removed
because of the seriousness of their crime and the overwhelming public interest
in their deportation, despite their family or private life in the UK, and some
other offenders who should normally be deported but who might be able to argue
in individual cases that their family or private life outweighed the public
interest in deportation. There were also cases where the level of criminality
was below the automatic deportation threshold, but the offending was so harmful
or persistent that deportation would normally be proportionate. The Government
believed that a custodial sentence of four years or more represented such a
serious level of offending that it would almost always be proportionate that it
should outweigh private or family life, even taking into account that the best
interests of a child were a primary consideration. Deportation would normally
be proportionate where the foreign offender had received a sentence of between
12 months and four years, or where the sentence was of less than 12 months but,
in the view of the Secretary of State, the offending had caused serious harm or
the person was a persistent offender who showed a particular disregard for the
law. Deportation would not, however, be proportionate if the offender had a
parental relationship in the UK with a child who was a British citizen or had
lived in the UK for the last seven years, the child could not reasonably be
expected to leave the UK, and there was no other family member able to care for
the child in the UK. Nor would it be proportionate if the offender had a
relationship with a partner in the UK who was a British citizen or was in the
UK with refugee leave or humanitarian protection, the offender had lived in the
UK with valid leave for the last 15 years, and there were insurmountable

</span>The Human Rights Act 1998 requires public authorities to act compatibly
with Convention rights, and requires courts or tribunals to take into account
the case law of the European Court of Human Rights. The Convention rights
include the right set out in article 8, which provides:</a></p><a name="para24">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone has the right
to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There shall be no
interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such
as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in
the interests of national security, public safety or the economic wellbeing of
the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of
health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The question whether the deportation of a foreign offender would be
incompatible with article 8 has been considered by the European court in
numerous judgments. In cases concerning “settled migrants”, that is to say
persons who have been granted a right of residence in the host country, the
court has accepted that the withdrawal of that right may constitute an
interference with the right to respect for private and/or family life within
the meaning of article 8. If there is an interference, it must be justified
under article 8(2) as being “in accordance with the law”, as pursuing one or
more of the legitimate aims set out in that paragraph, and as being “necessary
in a democratic society”, that is to say justified by a pressing social need
and proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. The court has treated the
legitimate aim pursued by deportation, on the basis of a person’s conviction of
a criminal offence, as the “prevention of disorder or crime” (although there
are also a small number of cases in which public safety has been accepted to be
an additional aim): see, for example,<i> AA v United Kingdom </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2011/1345.html">[2012] Imm AR 107</a>, paras 53-54. In practice, the critical issue is generally whether the
“necessity” test is met. In that regard, the court has often said that the task
of the court or tribunal applying article 8(2) consists in ascertaining whether
the decision struck a fair balance between the relevant interests, namely the
applicant's right to respect for his private and family life, on the one hand,
and the prevention of disorder or crime, on the other.</p>

concerned can play a role when applying some of these criteria. For instance,
when assessing the nature and seriousness of the offences, it has to be taken
into account whether the person committed them as a juvenile or as an adult.
Equally, when assessing the length of the person's stay in the country from
which he or she is to be expelled and the solidity of the social, cultural and
family ties with the host country, it makes a difference whether the person
came to the country during his or her childhood or youth, or was even born
there, or whether he or she only came as an adult. Some of the factors listed
in these cases relate to the strength of the public interest in deportation:
that is to say, the extent to which the deportation of the person concerned
will promote the legitimate aim pursued. Others relate to the strength of the
countervailing interests in private and family life. They are not exhaustive.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para27">27.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As the Grand Chamber noted in <i>Jeunesse v Netherlands </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2014/1036.html">(2015) 60 EHRR 17</a>, para 105, these criteria cannot be transposed automatically to the
situation of a person who is not a settled migrant but an alien seeking
admission to a host country: a category which includes, as the facts of that
case demonstrate, a person who has been unlawfully resident in the host country
for many years. The court analysed the situation of such a person, facing
expulsion for reasons of immigration control rather than deportation on account
of criminal behaviour, as raising the question whether the authorities of the
host country were under a duty, pursuant to article 8, to grant the person the
necessary permission to enable her to exercise her right to family life on
their territory. The situation was thus analysed not as one in which the host
country was interfering with the person’s right to respect for her private and
family life, raising the question whether the interference was justified under
article 8(2). Instead, the situation was analysed as one in which the person
was effectively asserting that her right to respect for her private and family
life, under article 8(1), imposed on the host country an obligation to permit
her to continue to reside there, and the question was whether such an
obligation was indeed imposed.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para28">28.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In addition to identifying the issue in <i>Jeunesse </i>as concerning a
positive obligation under article 8(1) rather than a negative obligation under
article 8(2), the court also identified a number of factors as being relevant:
factors which overlapped with those mentioned in the <i>Boultif </i>line of
cases, but were also different in some respects. Factors to be taken into
account were said in <i>Jeunesse</i> to include the extent to which family life
would effectively be ruptured, the extent of the ties in the contracting state,
whether there were insurmountable obstacles (or, as it has been put in some
other cases, major impediments: see, for example, <i>Tuquabo-Tekle v
Netherlands </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2005/803.html">[2006] 1 FLR 798</a>, para 48, and <i>IAA v United Kingdom </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2016/986.html">(2016) 62 EHRR SE19</a>, paras 40 and 44) in the way of the family living in the country
of origin of the alien concerned, and whether there were factors of immigration
control (for example, a history of breaches of immigration law) or
considerations of public order weighing in favour of exclusion (para 107).
Another important consideration was said to be whether family life was created
at a time when the persons involved were aware that the immigration status of
one of them was such that the persistence of that family life within the host
state would from the outset be precarious. Where this is the case, the court
has said that it is likely only to be in exceptional circumstances that the
removal of the non-national family member will constitute a violation of
article 8 (<i>Jeunesse, </i>para 108). The court has found there to be
exceptional circumstances in situations where, notwithstanding the importance
of that consideration, removal failed to strike a fair balance between the
competing interests involved. In the <i>Jeunesse </i>case, for example, a
prolonged delay in removing the applicant from the host country, during which
time she had developed strong family and social ties there, constituted
exceptional circumstances leading to the conclusion that a fair balance had not
been struck (paras 121-122).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para29">29.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Where children are involved, their best interests are said by the court
to be of paramount importance (by which it does not mean to say that they are
determinative: see <i>Jeunesse, </i>para 109). Whilst alone they cannot be
decisive, they must be afforded significant weight. Accordingly, national
decision-making bodies should in principle advert to and assess evidence in
respect of the practicality, feasibility and proportionality of any removal of a
non-national parent in order to give effective protection and sufficient weight
to the best interests of the children directly affected by it (<i>Jeunesse, </i>paras
108-109).</a></p><a name="para29">

</span>Counsel for the Secretary of State submitted in the appeal against the
decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Agyarko v Secretary of State for the Home
Department </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2015/440.html">[2015] EWCA Civ 440</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2015/440.html">[2016] 1 WLR 390</a><i>, </i>heard after the
present appeal,<i> </i>that in the light of this approach, the deportation of a
foreign criminal unlawfully resident in the UK should similarly be analysed as
raising the question whether the state is under a positive obligation to permit
him to remain in the UK, applying the <i>Jeunesse </i>criteria, rather than
whether his deportation can be justified under article 8(2), applying the <i>Boultif
</i>criteria. The court was asked to treat those submissions as applying to the
present case, and agreed to do so, counsel for the appellant being given an opportunity
to respond in writing.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para31">31.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Considering first the question whether a positive or a negative obligation
is in issue, liability to automatic deportation under section 32(5) of the 2007
Act is distinct from the regime governing admission to the UK. The aim pursued
is more specific than the wider social and economic aims pursued by controls on
admission. Nevertheless, it is a measure of immigration control, in that it
involves the use of the instruments of immigration control to enforce the
expectation that foreign citizens living in the UK should respect the criminal
law, and risk having their right to stay withdrawn or denied if they fail to do
so. Those foreign criminals who are residing in the UK unlawfully, and who
resist their deportation on the basis of article 8, are in substance asserting
that their right under article 8 to respect for their private and family life
imposes on the UK an obligation to permit them to continue to reside here. They
are, in that respect, in a similar position to the applicants in cases such as <i>Jeunesse.</i></a></p><a name="para31">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para31"></a><a name="para32">32.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Whether the situation is analysed in terms of positive or negative obligations
is, however, unlikely to be of substantial importance. Whether the person
concerned enjoys private or family life in the UK depends on the facts relating
to his relationships with others: whether, for example, he is married or has
children. Where he does enjoy private or family life in the UK, he has a right
under article 8 to respect for that life, whatever his immigration status may
be (although that status may greatly affect the weight to be given to his
article 8 right, as <i>Jeunesse </i>makes clear). Whether one poses the
question whether, striking a fair balance between the interests of the
individual in his private or family life and the competing interests of the
community as a whole, his right to respect for his private and family life
entails an obligation on the part of the state to permit him to remain in the
UK; or whether, striking a fair balance between the same competing interests,
his deportation would be a disproportionate interference, one is asking
essentially the same question. It is true, as counsel pointed out, that the
onus is on the state to justify an interference, whereas there is no such onus
on the state to demonstrate the absence of a positive obligation, but questions
of onus are unlikely to be important where the relevant facts have been
established. Ultimately, whether the case is considered to concern a positive
or a negative obligation, the question is whether a fair balance has been
struck.</a></p><a name="para32">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para32"></a><a name="para33">33.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Considering next the factors which should be taken into account, those
mentioned in the <i>Boultif </i>line of cases have a bearing on the
proportionality of the deportation of foreign offenders, whether they are
settled migrants or not. Where they are not settled migrants, it will also be
necessary to have regard to the factors mentioned in <i>Jeunesse, </i>so far as
relevant and not already taken into account: notably, whether there are
insurmountable obstacles or major impediments in the way of the family living
in the country of origin of the alien concerned; whether there are factors of
immigration control, such as a history of breaches of immigration law; and
whether the family life was created at a time when the persons involved were
aware that the immigration status of one of them was such that the persistence
of that family life within the host state would from the outset be precarious.
Those factors were mentioned in <i>Jeunesse </i>in a context where family life
was relied on to defeat immigration control at the point of admission to the
host country. But it is also relevant to consider, in the context of liability
to deportation because of criminal behaviour, whether the offender has a bad
immigration history, or whether there are major impediments to continuing
family life in his country of origin, or whether family life was established in
the knowledge that, because of the immigration status of one of the persons
involved, its continuation in the UK was uncertain. If that were not so, the
perverse consequence would follow that these matters would be liable to carry
greater weight if a non-offender were sought to be removed on account of his
irregular immigration status than if an offender with the same immigration
status were sought to be removed on account of serious criminal conduct.</a></p><a name="para33">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para33"></a><a name="para34">34.

</span>It is, however, necessary to bear in mind that whether the continuation
of family life in the UK is uncertain may be a more complex question than it
might appear at first sight. For example, where a person was residing in the UK
unlawfully at the time when the relationship was formed, but would have been
permitted to reside here lawfully if an application were made from outside the
UK, the latter point should be taken into account. That example illustrates how
the distinction between settled migrants and aliens residing in the host
country unlawfully may be, in some situations, of limited practical importance
when translated into the context of UK immigration law (see, for example, <i>Chikwamba
v Secretary of State for the Home Department </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/40.html">[2008] UKHL 40</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/40.html">[2008] 1 WLR 1420</a>).</p>

</span>While the European court has provided guidance as to factors which
should be taken into account, it has acknowledged that the weight to be
attached to the competing considerations, in striking a fair balance, falls
within the margin of appreciation of the national authorities, subject to
supervision at the European level. The ECHR can thus accommodate, within
limits, the judgments made by national legislatures and governments in this
area.</a></p><a name="para35">

</span>Considering the new rules in the light of the guidance given by
the European court, rule 397 makes it clear that a deportation order is not to
be made if the person’s removal would be incompatible with the ECHR. Where
article 8 claims are made by foreign offenders facing deportation, rule 398
explains that the Secretary of State will first consider whether rule 399 or
399A applies. Those rules, applicable where offenders have received sentences
of between 12 months and four years, provide guidance to officials as to
categories of case where it is accepted by the Secretary of State that deportation
would be disproportionate. The fact that a claim under article 8 falls outside
rules 399 and 399A does not, however, mean that it is necessarily to be
rejected. That is recognised by the concluding words of rule 398, which make it
clear that a claim that deportation would be contrary to article 8 will not be
rejected merely because rules 399 and 399A do not apply, but that “it will only
be in exceptional circumstances that the public interest in deportation will be
outweighed by other factors”.</a></p><a name="para36">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>How is the reference in rule 398 to “exceptional circumstances” to be
understood, compatibly with Convention rights? That question was considered in
the case of <i>MF (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2013/1192.html">[2013] EWCA Civ 1192</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2013/1192.html">[2014] 1 WLR 544</a>. The Court of Appeal accepted the submission
made on behalf of the Secretary of State that the reference to exceptional
circumstances (an expression which had been derived from the <i>Jeunesse </i>line
of case law) served the purpose of emphasising that, in the balancing exercise,
great weight should be given to the public interest in deporting foreign
criminals who did not satisfy rules 398 and 399 or 399A, and that it was only
exceptionally that such foreign criminals would succeed in showing that their
rights under article 8 trumped the public interest in their deportation (paras
40 and 41). The court went on to explain that this did not mean that a test of
exceptionality was being applied. Rather, the word “exceptional” denoted a departure
from a general rule:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The general rule in the present
context is that, in the case of a foreign prisoner (sic) to whom paragraphs 399
and 399A do not apply, very compelling reasons will be required to outweigh the
public interest in deportation. These compelling reasons are the ‘exceptional
circumstances’.” (para 43)</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The court added that “the exceptional circumstances to be
considered in the balancing exercise involve the application of a
proportionality test as required by the Strasbourg jurisprudence” (para 44). As
explained in the next paragraph, those dicta summarise the effect of the new
rules, construed compatibly with Convention rights.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para38">38.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The implication of the new rules is that rules 399 and 399A identify
particular categories of case in which the Secretary of State accepts that the
public interest in the deportation of the offender is outweighed under article
8 by countervailing factors. Cases not covered by those rules (that is to say,
foreign offenders who have received sentences of at least four years, or who
have received sentences of between 12 months and four years but whose private
or family life does not meet the requirements of rules 399 and 399A) will be
dealt with on the basis that great weight should generally be given to the
public interest in the deportation of such offenders, but that it can be
outweighed, applying a proportionality test, by very compelling circumstances:
in other words, by a very strong claim indeed, as Laws LJ put it in <i>SS
(Nigeria)</i>. The countervailing considerations must be very compelling in order
to outweigh the general public interest in the deportation of such offenders,
as assessed by Parliament and the Secretary of State. The Strasbourg
jurisprudence indicates relevant factors to consider, and rules 399 and 399A
provide an indication of the sorts of matters which the Secretary of State
regards as very compelling. As explained at para 26 above, they can include
factors bearing on the weight of the public interest in the deportation of the
particular offender, such as his conduct since the offence was committed, as
well as factors relating to his private or family life. Cases falling within
the scope of section 32 of the 2007 Act in which the public interest in
deportation is outweighed, other than those specified in the new rules
themselves, are likely to be a very small minority (particularly in non-settled
cases). They need not necessarily involve any circumstance which is exceptional
in the sense of being extraordinary (as counsel for the Secretary of State
accepted, consistently with <i>Huang </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2007/11.html">[2007] 2 AC 167</a><i>, </i>para 20), but
they can be said to involve “exceptional circumstances” in the sense that they
involve a departure from the general rule.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">Appellate decision-making</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para39">39.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The nature of appellate decision-making in the context of immigration
cases involving article 8 was authoritatively considered in the case of <i>Huang.</i>
The appellants in that case had entered the UK and were seeking leave to remain
on the basis that their removal would violate their rights under article 8.
They did not qualify for leave to remain under the Rules as they then stood.</a></p><a name="para39">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para39"></a><a name="para40">40.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The opinion of the Appellate Committee, delivered by Lord Bingham of
Cornhill, made five important points. First, Lord Bingham recognised the
importance of the Rules for administrative purposes, noting “the general
administrative desirability of applying known rules if a system of immigration
control is to be workable, predictable, consistent and fair as between one
applicant and another” (para 16). He acknowledged that the Rules, and the
supplementary administrative directions, must draw a line somewhere in order to
be administratively workable. The rule under which Mrs Huang failed to qualify
was unobjectionable.</a></p><a name="para40">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para40"></a><a name="para41">41.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Secondly, appellate decision-making was not governed by the Rules, but
the Rules were nevertheless relevant to the determination of appeals:</a></p><a name="para41">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“[A]n applicant’s failure to
qualify under the rules is for present purposes the point at which to begin,
not end, consideration of the claim under article 8. The terms of the rules are
relevant to that consideration, but they are not determinative.” (para 6)</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para41"></a><a name="para42">42.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Thirdly, an appeal under the 2002 Act was not equivalent to an
application for judicial review:</a></p><a name="para42">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“[T]he task of the appellate
immigration authority … is to decide whether the challenged decision is
unlawful as incompatible with a Convention right or compatible and so lawful.
It is not a secondary, reviewing, function dependent on establishing that the
primary decision-maker misdirected himself or acted irrationally or was guilty
of procedural impropriety. The appellate immigration authority must decide for
itself whether the impugned decision is lawful and, if not, but only if not,
reverse it ...</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">[T]he appellate immigration
authority ... is not reviewing the decision of another decision-maker. It is
deciding whether or not it is unlawful to refuse leave to enter or remain, and
it is doing so on the basis of up-to-date facts.” (paras 11 and 13)</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para42"></a><a name="para43">43.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Fourthly, the first task of the appellate immigration authority was to
establish the relevant facts, which might well have changed since the original
decision was made, and which the authority was in any event much better placed
to assess than the original decision-maker (para 15).</a></p><a name="para43">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para43"></a><a name="para44">44.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Fifthly, in considering the issue arising under article 8 in the light
of its findings of fact, the appellate authority should give appropriate weight
to the reasons relied on by the Secretary of State to justify the decision
under appeal. In that connection, Lord Bingham gave as examples a case where
attention was paid to the Secretary of State’s judgment that the probability of
deportation if a serious offence was committed had a general deterrent effect,
and another case where weight was given to the Secretary of State’s judgment
that the appellant posed a threat to public order. He continued:</a></p><a name="para44">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The giving of weight to factors
such as these is not, in our opinion, aptly described as deference: it is
performance of the ordinary judicial task of weighing up the competing
considerations on each side and according appropriate weight to the judgment of
a person with responsibility for a given subject matter and access to special
sources of knowledge and advice. That is how any rational judicial
decision-maker is likely to proceed.” (para 16)</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para44"></a><a name="para45">45.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It may be helpful to say more about this point. Where an appellate court
or tribunal has to reach its own decision, after hearing evidence, it does not,
in general, simply start afresh and disregard the decision under appeal. That
was made clear in <i>Sagnata Investments Ltd v Norwich Corpn </i>[1971] 2 QB
614, concerned with an appeal to quarter sessions against a licensing decision
taken by a local authority. In a more recent licensing case, <i>R (Hope &amp;
Glory Public House Ltd) v City of Westminster Magistrates’ Court </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2011/31.html">[2011] PTSR 868</a>, para 45, Toulson LJ put the matter in this way:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It is right in all cases that the
magistrates’ court should pay careful attention to the reasons given by the
licensing authority for arriving at the decision under appeal, bearing in mind
that Parliament has chosen to place responsibility for making such decisions on
local authorities. The weight which magistrates should ultimately attach to
those reasons must be a matter for their judgment in all the circumstances,
taking into account the fullness and clarity of the reasons, the nature of the issues
and the evidence given on the appeal.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para46">46.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>These observations apply a fortiori to tribunals hearing appeals against
deportation decisions. The special feature in that context is that the decision
under review has involved the application of rules which have been made by the
Secretary of State in the exercise of a responsibility entrusted to her by
Parliament, and which Parliament has approved. It is the duty of appellate
tribunals, as independent judicial bodies, to make their own assessment of the
proportionality of deportation in any particular case on the basis of their own
findings as to the facts and their understanding of the relevant law. But,
where the Secretary of State has adopted a policy based on a general assessment
of proportionality, as in the present case, they should attach considerable
weight to that assessment: in particular, that a custodial sentence of four
years or more represents such a serious level of offending that the public
interest in the offender’s deportation almost always outweighs countervailing
considerations of private or family life; that great weight should generally be
given to the public interest in the deportation of a foreign offender who has
received a custodial sentence of more than 12 months; and that, where the circumstances
do not fall within rules 399 or 399A, the public interest in the deportation of
such offenders can generally be outweighed only by countervailing factors which
are very compelling, as explained in paras 37-38 above.</a></p><a name="para46">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The approach adopted in <i>Huang </i>has been followed in later
decisions of the House of Lords and of this court, including <i>EB (Kosovo) v
Secretary of State for the Home Department </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/41.html">[2008] UKHL 41</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/41.html">[2009] AC 1159</a>, <i>Zoumbas

The latter case is particularly relevant for its
consideration of the case of <i>Jeunesse. </i>In her judgment, Lady Hale noted
the distinction drawn by the European Court between cases where lawfully
settled migrants are facing deportation or expulsion, and cases where an alien
is seeking admission to a host country. She also noted that, although the
criteria developed in the first context cannot be transposed automatically into
the second, the applicable principles are nonetheless similar. She went on at
para 29 to state that, although Strasbourg analysed cases in the second
category in terms of a “fair balance”, domestic courts had, at least since <i>Huang,
</i>applied the proportionality approach described in <i>Aguilar</i> <i>Quila</i>.
That approach was criticised by counsel for the Secretary of State in the
present case as being premised on the assumption that there was an interference
with the right to respect for private and family life, whereas in cases where
the individual was not lawfully resident in the UK the issue was whether the
right gave rise to a positive obligation.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para48">48.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The structured approach to proportionality which has been adopted in the
domestic law of the UK makes provision for consideration of the elements
involved in an assessment of fair balance in the context of immigration and
deportation, whether the assessment arises in relation to a potential positive
obligation or in relation to an interference. It can be said that the first of
the four stages of the analysis, as described in <i>Bank Mellat v HM Treasury
(No 2) </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2013/39.html">[2013] UKSC 39</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2013/39.html">[2014] AC 700</a>, para 74<i> </i>(“whether the
objective of the measure is sufficiently important to justify the limitation of
a protected right”), and in similar language in <i>Aguilar</i> <i>Quila </i>and
other cases, is not entirely apt where the question is whether a positive
obligation is imposed, since the language used presumes that the right in
question is being limited. But the point is of no practical importance where,
as in the context of immigration and deportation, there is no doubt as to the
importance of the objective.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para49">49.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>What has now become the established method of analysis can therefore
continue to be followed in this context. The adoption of that method does not,
of course, determine the outcome of the assessment. It is necessary to feed
into the analysis the facts of the particular case and the criteria which are
appropriate to the context, and, where a court is reviewing the decision of
another authority, to give such weight to the judgment of that authority as may
be appropriate. In that way, relevant differences between, for example, cases
where lawfully settled migrants are facing deportation or expulsion, and cases
where an alien is seeking admission to a host country, can be taken into
account.</a></p><a name="para49">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para49"></a><a name="para50">50.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In summary, therefore, the tribunal carries out its task on the basis of
the facts as it finds them to be on the evidence before it, and the law as
established by statute and case law. Ultimately, it has to decide whether
deportation is proportionate in the particular case before it, balancing the
strength of the public interest in the deportation of the offender against the
impact on private and family life. In doing so, it should give appropriate
weight to Parliament’s and the Secretary of State’s assessments of the strength
of the general public interest in the deportation of foreign offenders, as
explained in paras 14, 37-38 and 46 above, and also consider all factors
relevant to the specific case in question. The critical issue for the tribunal
will generally be whether, giving due weight to the strength of the public
interest in the deportation of the offender in the case before it, the article
8 claim is sufficiently strong to outweigh it. In general, only a claim which
is very strong indeed - very compelling, as it was put in <i>MF (Nigeria) </i>-<i>
</i>will succeed.</a></p><a name="para50">

<p class="ParaHeading">A complete code?</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para50"></a><a name="para51">51.

</span>In <i>MF (Nigeria) </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2013/1192.html">[2014] 1 WLR 544</a> the Court of Appeal described
the new rules set out in para 23 above as “a complete code” for article 8
claims (para 44). That expression reflected the view that the concluding words
of rule 398 required the application of a proportionality test in accordance
with the Strasbourg jurisprudence, taking into account all the article 8
criteria and all other factors which were relevant to proportionality (para
39). On that basis, the court commented that the result should be the same
whether the proportionality assessment was carried out within or outside the
new rules: it was a sterile question whether it was required by the rules or by
the general law (para 45).</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The idea that the new rules comprise a complete code appears to have
been mistakenly interpreted in some later cases as meaning that the Rules, and
the Rules alone, govern appellate decision-making. Dicta seemingly to that
effect can be found, for example, in <i>LC (China) v Secretary of State for the
Home Department </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2014/1310.html">[2014] EWCA Civ 1310</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2014/1310.html">[2015] Imm AR 227</a>, para 17, and <i>AJ

</span>As explained at para 17 above, the Rules are not law (although they are
treated as law for the purposes of section 86(3)(a) of the 2002 Act), and
therefore do not govern the determination of appeals, other than appeals
brought on the ground that the decision is not in accordance with the Rules:
see para 7 above. The policies adopted by the Secretary of State, and given
effect by the Rules, are nevertheless a relevant and important consideration
for tribunals determining appeals brought on Convention grounds, because they
reflect the assessment of the general public interest made by the responsible
minister and endorsed by Parliament. In particular, tribunals should accord
respect to the Secretary of State’s assessment of the strength of the general
public interest in the deportation of foreign offenders, and also consider all
factors relevant to the specific case before them, as explained at paras 37-38,
46 and 50 above. It remains for them to judge whether, on the facts as they have
found them, and giving due weight to the strength of the public interest in
deportation in the case before them, the factors brought into account on the
other side lead to the conclusion that deportation would be disproportionate.</a></p><a name="para53">

</span>The facts of the present appeal, as found by the Upper Tribunal, are as
follows. The appellant is an Iraqi national. He left Iraq in 1988, at the age
of 12. With the exception of a few visits prior to 2000, he has not lived there
since then. He lived unlawfully in Jordan until 2000, when he was 24 years of
age. He then entered the UK unlawfully, and has lived in the UK unlawfully ever
since. No attempt appears to have been made to remove him as an illegal
immigrant. In 2002 he applied for asylum, but his application was refused, and
his appeal against that decision was unsuccessful. In November 2005 he was
convicted of possession of class A and C drugs and was fined. He had a serious
drugs problem at that time. In March 2006 he was arrested and later charged with
two counts of possession of class A drugs (11.1 grams of cocaine and 59 tablets
of ecstasy) with intent to supply. In December 2006 he pleaded guilty and was
sentenced to four years’ imprisonment. In the meantime he had begun to address
his drug taking.</a></p><a name="para54">

</span>He was released from custody in January 2009. He had by then stopped
taking drugs, and has remained drug free since then. When he completed his
sentence, in January 2011, his probation officer reported that he had complied
with his licence conditions and that he was considered to present a low risk of
re-conviction and a low risk of harm. In April 2014 he pleaded guilty to a
count of driving while uninsured and with excessive alcohol in his system. He
was fined and disqualified from driving for 12 months. He is not, and never has
been, permitted to take employment in the UK. He has nevertheless worked in a

appeal came before the Upper Tribunal. It is agreed that they nevertheless saw
each other almost every day and spent most nights together. It is agreed that
they wished to marry and have children. It is agreed that they have not done so
as a result of the appellant’s immigration status, his inability to take lawful
employment, and a lack of finances. The appellant is also the father of two
children who probably reside in the UK, and who were born before he began his
relationship with Ms Harwood. He has no contact with either child. He has no
remaining family in Iraq.</a></p><a name="para56">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In September 2007 the Secretary of State notified the appellant that she
was considering his immigration status and that he was liable to removal. In
response, his solicitors made a fresh claim to the effect that he was at risk
of ill-treatment in Iraq, and that his deportation would also be contrary to
article 8. In January 2008 the Secretary of State made a decision to make a
deportation order, but in March 2008 withdrew that decision on the basis that
the appellant’s nationality was unclear. In April 2008 a “nationality
interview” was conducted. In January 2010 an asylum interview was conducted. On
5 October 2010 the Secretary of State decided to make a deportation order in
respect of the appellant on the basis that section 32(5) of the 2007 Act
applied to him. She found that he did not fall within any of the exceptions in
section 33. She rejected his claim to be at risk in Iraq, and also rejected his
claim under article 8. She found that he had failed to demonstrate that he was
in a subsisting relationship with Ms Harwood, and that in any case the
relationship, if it existed, had been entered into at a time when they should
both have been aware that it might not be possible to continue it in the UK.
She accepted that deportation might interfere with the appellant’s private
life, but considered that this was proportionate to the aim of preventing
disorder or crime and the maintenance of effective immigration control. Under
the heading “Proportionality”, the decision letter stated that the reason why
the interference with the appellant’s private life was not considered to be
disproportionate was that:</a></p><a name="para57">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Although you have been resident
in the United Kingdom for a number of years you spent your youth and formative
years in Iraq. In view of this it is not considered unreasonable to expect you
to be able to readjust to life in Iraq.”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal. On 10 February 2011
the appeal was dismissed. The appellant then appealed to the Upper Tribunal. On
16 March 2012, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal was set aside. On 18
January 2013 the Upper Tribunal re-heard the appeal. By that stage, the only
remaining ground of appeal was that the appellant’s removal would breach the
Refugee Convention and articles 3 and 8 of the ECHR. The new rules had by then
come into force.</a></p><a name="para58">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para58"></a><a name="para59">59.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On 11 February 2013 the Upper Tribunal allowed the appeal on the ground
that the appellant’s removal would be incompatible with article 8. The judge
found that the appellant was not a danger to the community: his last offence
(at that time) had been almost seven years earlier, in March 2006. He had put
drug-taking behind him. His relationship with Ms Harwood was genuine, and she
could not reasonably be expected to live in Iraq. The judge identified the
central issue as being whether the interference with private and family life
which would result from the appellant’s removal to Iraq was proportionate to
the proper purpose of deporting foreign criminals for the purpose of the
prevention of disorder or crime. He acknowledged that the appellant had
committed very serious offences, but concluded that the period of time which had
elapsed since the appellant’s last offence, the unlikelihood of his committing
further offences, the strength of his relationship with Ms Harwood, and the
weakness of the appellant’s current links with Iraq, were in combination
compelling, so that deportation would be disproportionate. In reaching that
conclusion, he explained that he accepted that there was an interest in the
appellant’s being removed: Parliament had said so in section 32(4) of the 2007
Act.</a></p><a name="para59">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para59"></a><a name="para60">60.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The judge explained that he had not had regard to the new rules, stating
that the Rules did not assist him with the proper application of the
appellant’s human rights. For the reasons explained earlier, they were a
relevant and important consideration. He also does not appear to have taken
account of the fact that the appellant’s relationship with Ms Harwood had been
formed at a time when his immigration status was such that the persistence of
family life within the UK was uncertain. As was explained earlier, that also
was an important consideration. The judge noted in his summary of the evidence
that the appellant and Ms Harwood had acknowledged these circumstances, but
they were not mentioned in the reasons which he gave for his decision.</a></p><a name="para60">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Secretary of State then appealed to the Court of Appeal on the
grounds that the Upper Tribunal had erred (i) in failing to consider the new
rules, (ii) in failing to recognise the importance of the public interest in
deporting foreign criminals, (iii) in failing properly to apply the guidance
established in <i>Ȕner</i>, and (iv) in allowing the appeal in
circumstances in which no reasonable tribunal could have done so. On 22 July
2014 the Court of Appeal (Sullivan, Black and Richards LJJ) [2015] Imm AR 207 allowed
the appeal on grounds (i) and (ii). The court found it unnecessary to consider
grounds (iii) and (iv), and remitted the appeal for re-consideration by a
differently constituted Upper Tribunal.</a></p><a name="para61">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para61"></a><a name="para62">62.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In relation to grounds (i) and (ii), the Court of Appeal proceeded on
the basis, at para 27, that the new rules “tell the decision taker what weight
they should give to the public interest in deporting foreign criminals”. As
counsel for the appellant submitted, that might be understood as meaning that
the Rules determined the weight which tribunals must give to the public interest
in deportation in all cases.</a></p><a name="para62">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para62"></a><a name="para63">63.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For the reasons already explained, that would be an overstatement of the
significance of the new rules to appellate decision-making by tribunals. That
does not, however, undermine the court’s conclusion. As explained above, the
reasoning of the Upper Tribunal failed to take any account of the new rules,
and also failed to take account of the important fact that the appellant’s
family life had been established when his immigration status was known to be
precarious. In addition, no assessment of the compatibility of removal with
article 8 has been carried out by reference to the facts currently known, as
distinct from those which were known at the time of the hearing before the
Upper Tribunal (<i>AA v United Kingdom </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2011/1345.html">[2012] Imm AR 107</a>, para 67). In the
circumstances, it is appropriate that the appeal should be remitted for
reconsideration, as the Court of Appeal ordered. This court should therefore
forbear from further comment on the merits of the appeal.</p>

</span>This is an important day in the life of our court. For it is the first
occasion upon which either we or our predecessors in the House of Lords have
had occasion to address the interface between the power of the Secretary of
State to deport a foreign criminal and the latter’s ability to resist
deportation by reference to his right to respect for his family or private life
under article 8 of the ECHR. It is a subject which generates strong views in
our society.</a></p><a name="para65">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para65"></a><a name="para66">66.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the <i>MF (Nigeria) </i>case, cited by Lord Reed at para 37 above,
Lord Dyson MR, giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal, said at para 43:</a></p><a name="para66">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The general rule in the present
context is that, in the case of a foreign [criminal] to whom paragraphs 399 and
399A [of the Immigration Rules in force on 9 July 2012] do not apply, very
compelling reasons will be required to outweigh the public interest in
deportation.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">Of the numerous issues raised in this appeal, the central
issue is whether the Court of Appeal’s exposition of what it called “the
general rule” was correct. I subscribe to the majority view that it was indeed
correct. I agree with the judgment of Lord Reed and I concur in the dismissal
of the appeal.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para66"></a><a name="para67">67.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A person is a “foreign criminal” under section 32(1) and (2) of the 2007
Act only if, not being a British citizen, he was convicted in the UK of an
offence for which he was sentenced to imprisonment for at least 12 months. So
the misleadingly entitled “automatic” deportation, for which the section
provides, applies in effect only to a serious offence. Subsection (4) provides
that the deportation of a foreign criminal is conducive to the public good for
the purpose of section 3(5)(a) of the 1971 Act, in other words with the result
that he should be liable to deportation. So it is only the liability to
deportation, not the deportation itself, which the section makes automatic.</a></p><a name="para67">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para67"></a><a name="para68">68.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Section 33 (7) of the 2007 Act, set out at para 11 above, provides, at
first sight surprisingly, that the deportation of a foreign criminal remains
conducive to the public good even when his rights under article 8 bar his
removal. At para 12 above Lord Reed convincingly explains the provision: for
the barrier to his removal arising from his rights under article 8 may prove to
be temporary so there is no harm in maintaining his liability in principle to
deportation by continuing to regard it as conducive to the public good. But
there is a further feature of the subsection which is less easy to explain: for
the effect of limb (a) of it is that the barrier to a foreign criminal’s
deportation arising from his rights under article 8 “does not prevent the
making of a deportation order”. Like Lord Kerr in his dissenting judgment at
para 128 below, I have failed to make any sense of this further feature.</a></p><a name="para68">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para68"></a><a name="para69">69.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In para 14 above Lord Reed suggests that sections 32 and 33 of the 2007
Act were enacted in response to public concern about, in particular, the
procedures for the deportation of foreign offenders. But it is clear to me that
there was equal, if not greater, dissatisfaction with the decisions themselves,
in particular when they rejected deportation. Why, in particular, did the
people of the UK, by their elected representatives, take the unusual step of
pre-empting the minister’s decision whether a deportation was conducive to the
public good by making a formal resolution in section 32(4) that the deportation
of a foreign criminal was conducive to it? No doubt they did so primarily
because of the strength of their wish to protect themselves from disorder and
crime, which, of course, is an aim specifically recognised in paragraph 2 of article
8 of the ECHR and which the Strasbourg court “has consistently considered [to
be] the legitimate aim pursued by deportation”: para 53 of the <i>AA </i>case,
cited at para 25 above. “This means”, says Lord Kerr at para 96 below, “that,
customarily, the risk of re-offending will be of predominant importance”.
Indeed Lord Kerr proceeds to ask: “If an individual is unlikely to commit crime
or be involved in disorder, how can his expulsion on that ground be said to be
rationally connected to the stated aim?” But, with respect, might Lord Kerr’s
analysis be too narrow? Might not the deterrent effect upon all foreign
citizens (irrespective of whether they have a right to reside in the UK) of
understanding that a serious offence will normally precipitate their deportation
be a more powerful aid to the prevention of crime than the removal from the UK
of one foreign criminal judged as likely to re-offend? See <i>DS (India) v
Secretary of State for the Home Department </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2009/544.html">[2009] EWCA Civ 544</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2009/544.html">[2010] Imm AR 81</a>, para 37, Rix LJ.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para70">70.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the Court of Appeal in <i>OH (Serbia) v Secretary of State for the
Home Department</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2008/694.html">[2008] EWCA Civ 694</a>, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2008/694.html">[2009] INLR 109</a>, I stated, at para
15(c):</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“A further important facet [of the
public interest in deportation] is the role of a deportation order as an expression
of society’s revulsion at serious crimes and in building public confidence in
the treatment of foreign citizens who have committed serious crimes.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">By his counsel, the appellant mounts a sustained objection
to my statement and I am constrained to agree with part of it. I regret my
reference there to society’s revulsion at serious crimes and I accept Lord
Kerr’s criticism of it at para 168 below. Society’s undoubted revulsion at
certain crimes is, on reflection, too emotive a concept to figure in this
analysis. But I maintain that I was entitled to refer to the importance of
public confidence in our determination of these issues. I believe that we
should be sensitive to the public concern in the UK about the facility for a
foreign criminal’s rights under article 8 to preclude his deportation. Even
though, for the purposes of the present appeal, we must ignore section 19 of
the Immigration Act 2014, the depth of public concern had earlier been made
manifest not only in section 32(4) of the 2007 Act but also in the amendments
to the immigration rules introduced on 9 July 2012 to which I will turn in the
next paragraph. Laws serve society more effectively if they carry public
support. Unless it lacks rational foundation (in which case the courts should
not pander to it), the very fact of public concern about an area of the law,
subjective though that is, can in my view add to a court’s objective analysis
of where the public interest lies: in this context it can strengthen the case
for concluding that interference with a person’s rights under article 8 by
reason of his deportation is justified by a pressing social need.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para71">71.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the document entitled “<i>Statement of Intent: Family Migration</i>”,
dated 12 June 2012, the Home Office sought to explain the forthcoming changes
to the immigration rules. It said:</a></p><a name="para71">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“37.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; … previous Secretaries of
State have asserted that if the courts think that the rules produce
disproportionate results in a particular case, the courts should themselves
decide the proportionate outcome on the facts before them rather than hold that
the rule itself is incompatible with article 8. The courts have accepted this
invitation to determine proportionality on a case-by-case basis and do not -
indeed cannot - give due weight systematically to the Government’s and
Parliament’s view of where the balance should be struck, because they do not
know what that view is.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:36.0pt;margin-bottom:36.0pt;
margin-left:72.0pt">38.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new Immigration Rules are intended to fill
this public policy vacuum by setting out the Secretary of State’s position on
proportionality and to meet the democratic deficit by seeking Parliament’s
agreement to her policy. The rules will state how the balance should be struck
between the public interest and individual rights, taking into account relevant
case law, and thereby provide for a consistent and fair decision-making
process.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para71"></a><a name="para72">72.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly rule 398, as was then introduced, provided that, other than
in the narrow situations in which paras 399 or 399A applied, “it will only be
in exceptional circumstances that the public interest in deportation will be
outweighed by other factors” in the determination of an article 8 claim by a
person liable to deportation.</a></p><a name="para72">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para72"></a><a name="para73">73.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Provided that the phrase is not misunderstood, there is nothing wrong
with an analysis in certain contexts that “exceptional circumstances” will be
necessary for a claim under article 8 to prevail. In certain situations, the
public interest in a person’s removal from the UK will be inherently so strong,
and in other situations his claim to respect for his private and family life
will be inherently so weak, that it is appropriate to identify a need for
“exceptional circumstances” before his claim can prevail.</a></p><a name="para73">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para73"></a><a name="para74">74.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>An example of the first type of situation is extradition. The public
interest in a person’s extradition in accordance with domestic law is
inherently strong. In <i>Norris v Government of the United States of America
(No 2) </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2010/9.html">[2010] UKSC 9</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2010/9.html">[2010] 2 AC 487</a>, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers,
with whom all eight of the other members of the court agreed, said:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“56.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reality is that only
if some quite exceptionally compelling feature, or combination of features, is
present that interference with family life consequent upon extradition will be
other than proportionate to the objective that extradition serves. That, no
doubt, is what the commission had in mind in <i>Launder v United Kingdom</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1997/179.html">(1997) 25 EHRR CD 67</a>, 73 when it stated that it was only in exceptional circumstances
that extradition would be an unjustified or disproportionate interference with
the right to respect for family life.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para75">75.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>An example of the second type of situation is where the appellant’s
family life with another person developed at a time when, to his knowledge, his
immigration status rendered his ability to remain living in the UK precarious.
In this situation his claim to respect for his family life is inherently weak.
It is therefore legitimate to describe it as likely to prevail only in
exceptional circumstances. The court in Strasbourg has said so. Thus in <i>Rodrigues
Da Silva, Hoogkamer v Netherlands </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2006/86.html">(2007) 44 EHRR 34</a>, the Strasbourg court
said:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“39.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; … where this is the case
it is likely only to be in the most exceptional circumstances that the removal
of the non-national family member will constitute a violation of article 8.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">Two years ago, in <i>Jeunesse v Netherlands</i>, cited at
para 27 above, the Grand Chamber at para 108 indorsed, almost word for word,
the reference to the need in that situation for “exceptional circumstances”.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para76">76.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the <i>MF (Nigeria) </i>case the Secretary of State informed the
court that, in referring to the need for exceptional circumstances in the new
rule 198, she was “borrowing” the phrase from the Strasbourg court, which had
used it in certain article 8 cases: see para 34 of the judgment. Although its
application by the Strasbourg court had been to situations other than
deportation, the Secretary of State was in my view entitled to borrow the
phrase and, by the rule, to commend it to her case-workers. For deportation is
another example of the first type of situation to which I have referred at para
73 above: the public interest in the deportation of a foreign criminal is
inherently so strong, arguably even stronger than in the case of extradition,
that it is appropriate to identify a need for “exceptional circumstances”
before his claim under article 8 can prevail.</a></p><a name="para76">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There is, however, a well-recognised danger that a decision-maker will
misunderstand the significance of the phrase. It may lead him to slide away
from the requisite inquiry into the <i>degree</i> of strength of the public
interest in the deportation of this particular foreign criminal, strong though
that will always be; and from inquiry into the gravity of the proposed
interference with the exercise of his family life, judged in the light of all
the factors upon which he relies insofar as they are relevant to it; and
therefore from inquiry into the justification or otherwise for the proposed
interference. It may lead him instead simply to ask himself “are these
circumstances exceptional?” Even worse, it may even lead him simply to ask
himself “are these circumstances unusual?”</a></p><a name="para77">

the word “exceptional” is capable of being misunderstood. In <i>R (Razgar) v

cases, identifiable only on a case by case basis.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">But in the <i>Huang</i> case, cited at para 17 above, Lord
Bingham, on this occasion giving the opinion of the committee, said:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“20.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; … It is not necessary
that the appellate immigration authority, directing itself along the lines
indicated in this opinion, need ask in addition whether the case meets a test
of exceptionality. The suggestion that it should is based on an observation of
Lord Bingham in <i>Razgar</i>, para 20. He was there expressing an expectation
… that the number of claimants not covered by the rules and supplementary
directions but entitled to succeed under article 8 would be a very small
minority. That is still his expectation. But he was not purporting to lay down
a legal test.”</p>

</span>When it analysed the reference to “exceptional circumstances” in the new
rule 398, the Court of Appeal in the <i>MF (Nigeria) </i>case had well in mind
the risk that the phrase might be misunderstood. It concluded at paras 41 and
42, in my view correctly, that the rule was no more laying down a <i>test </i>of
exceptionality than had been Lord Bingham in the <i>Razgar </i>case or indeed
than had been the Strasbourg court in its analysis of the situation where
family life was precarious. It continued:</a></p><a name="para79">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Rather [the rule means] that, in
approaching the question of whether removal is a proportionate interference
with an individual’s article 8 rights, the scales are heavily weighted in
favour of deportation and something very compelling (which will be
‘exceptional’) is required to outweigh the public interest in removal.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">Then, at para 43, the Court of Appeal articulated the
general rule which I have set out at para 66 above and by which in effect it
substituted the phrase “very compelling reasons” for that of “exceptional
circumstances”. In my view its substitution was wise and, as I have said, its
general rule was correct. In July 2014, when introducing changes to the rules
to accompany the coming into force of the 2014 Act, the Secretary of State made
a corresponding amendment to rule 398 so as, among other things, to substitute
the words “very compelling” for the word “exceptional”.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the <i>MF (Nigeria)</i> case, however, the Court of Appeal proceeded
to make an insignificant but unfortunate error. It held at para 44 that the new
rules were “a complete code” which fell to be applied not only by the Secretary
of State’s case-workers but on appeal by the First-tier Tribunal. It is one
thing to suggest that the Secretary of State’s rule 398 is relevant to the
weight which the tribunal should give to the public interest. By doing so, the
tribunal would do no more than, in the words of Lord Bingham in the <i>Huang</i>
case, para 16, to accord “appropriate weight to the judgment of a person with
responsibility for a given subject matter and access to special sources of
knowledge and advice”. But it is another thing altogether to suggest that the
rules provide the legal framework within which the tribunal should determine
the appeal. Both Lord Reed at para 53 and Lord Kerr at para 163 powerfully
demonstrate that it is a constitutional solecism for an appellate body to
evaluate a person’s human rights by the application of a rubric (however sound)
which the Secretary of State has chosen to incorporate into her rules.
Crucially, however, the Court of Appeal hastened to add:</a></p><a name="para80">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“45.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if we were wrong
about that, it would be necessary to apply a proportionality test outside the
new rules as was done by the [Upper Tribunal]. Either way, the result should be
the same. In these circumstances, it is a sterile question whether this is
required by the new rules or it is a requirement of the general law. What
matters is that it is required to be carried out if paragraphs 399 or 399A do
not apply.”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This error in the <i>MF (Nigeria) </i>case was therefore insignificant.
We should not allow it to distract us from the validity of the general rule
which it articulated. I have come belatedly to realise that the use of a cliché
can be a quick way of effectively communicating a point. So I make no apology
for concluding that we should resist the appellant’s invitation to us, by
reference to this error on the part of the Court of Appeal, to throw the baby
out with the bath-water. On the contrary we should lift the general rule
carefully out of the bath … and embrace it.</a></p><a name="para81">

</span>I agree with the judgment of Lord Reed and in particular the matters he
sets out at paras 37-38, 46 and 50. I add three paragraphs of my own simply to
emphasise the importance of the structure of judgments of the First-tier
Tribunal in decisions where article 8 is engaged. Judges should, after making
their factual determinations, set out in clear and succinct terms their
reasoning for the conclusion arrived at through balancing the necessary
considerations in the light of the matters set out by Lord Reed at paras 37-38,
46 and 50. It should generally not be necessary to refer to any further
authority in cases involving the deportation of foreign offenders.</a></p><a name="para82">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>One way of structuring such a judgment would be to follow what has
become known as the “balance sheet” approach. After the judge has found the
facts, the judge would set out each of the “pros” and “cons” in what has been
described as a “balance sheet” and then set out reasoned conclusions as to
whether the countervailing factors outweigh the importance attached to the
public interest in the deportation of foreign offenders.</a></p><a name="para83">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The use of a “balance sheet” approach has its origins in Family Division
cases (see paras 36 and 74 of the decision of the Court of Appeal <i>In re B-S

undertaken when article 8 is engaged - see paras 15-17. Experience in
extradition cases has since shown that the use of the balance sheet approach
has greatly assisted in the clarity of the decisions at first instance and the
work of appellate courts.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In a series of cases, Strasbourg has given close attention to, and
generally applicable guidance on, the requirements of article 8 of the European
Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) in the context of
the expulsion of “foreign criminals”. The court has recognised that the removal
of a person from a country where close members of his family are residing may
infringe his right to respect for family life (<i>Boultif v Switzerland </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2001/497.html">(2001) 33 EHRR 50</a>, para 39), and that even where there is no family life, the
expulsion of a settled migrant constitutes an interference with his private
life (<i>Ȕner v Netherlands </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2006/873.html">(2007) 45 EHRR 14</a>, para 59).<i> </i>The
facts of these and subsequent cases, and the legal analysis applied to them, is
illuminating of the approach required to be undertaken by domestic
decision-makers when considering making a deportation order after conviction.
As Lord Bingham noted in <i>Huang</i> <i>v Secretary of State for the Home
Department </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2007/11.html">[2007] 2 AC 167</a>, para 18, these cases are valuable in
demonstrating where the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), as the ultimate
guardian of Convention rights, has drawn the line in a number of different
factual scenarios, thus guiding national authorities in making their own
decisions.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr Boultif arrived in Switzerland from Algeria in 1992. He married a
Swiss woman in 1993. In 1997 his conviction of offences of robbery and damage
to property was confirmed by the Swiss Court of Appeal. Those offences had been
committed in 1994. In May 1998 he began a period of imprisonment which the
appeal court had imposed. In the same month it was decided that his residence
permit would not be renewed. His appeal against that decision was dismissed
despite his wife having complained that if he was returned to Algeria she could
not be expected to follow him.</a></p><a name="para87">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Ultimately, Mr Boultif complained
to the ECtHR that his expulsion from Switzerland was in violation of his rights
under article 8 ECHR. The court agreed that it was. That decision was reached
notwithstanding the court’s conclusion that expelling Mr Boultif from
Switzerland was in accordance with law and was rationally connected to the
legitimate aim of preventing disorder and crime. The court then addressed the
question whether the undoubted interference with Mr Boultif’s article 8 rights
was “necessary in a democratic society”. It immediately acknowledged, in para
48, that previously it had only considered this question to a limited extent.
Mr Boultif’s case required it to “establish guiding principles” on this
question.</span></a></p><a name="para88">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The court then proceeded to set
out with some precision what those principles should be. It said this:</span></a></p><a name="para89">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In assessing the relevant
criteria in such a case, the court will consider the nature and seriousness of
the offence committed by the applicant; the length of the applicant’s stay in
the country from which he is going to be expelled; the time elapsed since the
offence was committed as well as the applicant’s conduct in that period; the
nationalities of the various persons concerned; the applicant’s family
situation, such as the length of the marriage; and other factors expressing the
effectiveness of a couple’s family life; whether the spouse knew about the
offence at the time when he or she entered into a family relationship; and
whether there are children in the marriage, and if so, their age. Not least,
the court will also consider the seriousness of the difficulties which the
spouse is likely to encounter in the country of origin, though the mere fact
that a person might face certain difficulties in accompanying her or his spouse
cannot in itself exclude an expulsion.”</p>

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Lord Reed has listed those
criteria at para 26 of his judgment, but the preface given by the Grand Chamber
to this outline of the relevant criteria is particularly important. These were
to be guiding principles. Although the weight to be given to them was
determined by an examination of their application to Mr Boultif’s case, they
were precisely what they were stated to be: guiding principles. In other words,
principles which should be taken into account in <i>all </i>cases where the
propriety of expelling or deporting someone from a member state of the Council

referred to two criteria in particular. It said this:</span></a></p><a name="para92">

26.0pt;margin-left:2.0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">“The
court would wish to make explicit two criteria which may already be implicit in
those identified in the <i>Boultif</i> judgment:</span></p>

margin-left:77.4pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">- the
best interests and well-being of the children, in particular the seriousness of
the difficulties which any children of the applicant are likely to encounter in
the country to which the applicant is to be expelled; and</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:2.0cm;margin-bottom:26.0pt;
margin-left:77.4pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">- the
solidity of social, cultural and family ties with the host country and with the
country of destination.</span></p>

26.0pt;margin-left:2.0cm;text-align:justify"><a name="para92"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">As
to the first point, the court notes that this is already reflected in its
existing case law (see, for example, <i>Sen v Netherlands</i> </span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2001/888.html">(2003) 36 EHRR 7</a>,

in line with the Committee of Ministers’ Recommendation Rec (2002) 4 on the
legal status of persons admitted for family reunification (see para 38 above).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:36.0pt;margin-bottom:
26.0pt;margin-left:2.0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">As
to the second point, it is to be noted that, although the applicant in the case
of <i>Boultif</i> was already an adult when he entered Switzerland, the court
has held the “<i>Boultif</i> criteria” to apply all the more so (<i>a plus
forte raison</i>) to cases concerning applicants who were born in the host
country or who moved there at an early age (see <i>Mokrani v France </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2003/362.html">(2005) 40 EHRR 5</a>, para 31). Indeed, the rationale behind making the duration of a
person’s stay in the host country one of the elements to be taken into account
lies in the assumption that the longer a person has been residing in a
particular country the stronger his or her ties with that country and the
weaker the ties with the country of his or her nationality will be. Seen
against that background, it is self-evident that the court will have regard to
the special situation of aliens who have spent most, if not all, their
childhood in the host country, were brought up there and received their
education there.”</span></p>

</span></a></span><a name="para93"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Although the court identified
these two particular criteria as being of especial importance, the matter of
significance (so far as the present appeal is concerned) is the court’s
proclamation that the <i>Boultif </i>criteria are fundamental in the
examination of whether article 8 has been breached. Different emphasis might be
placed on some of those criteria in different cases. Particular importance (as
in Mr Ȕner’s case) may be accorded to some of them, reflecting the
specific circumstances of an individual. But, the relevance of the factors in
article 8 cases involving expulsion is not left in doubt. Their status as guiding
principles, to be considered and, where appropriate, applied in all such cases,
is clearly affirmed.</span></a></p><a name="para93">

Reed’s analysis at para 26 of his judgment as to the effect of that decision.
In particular, I would stress that some of the Strasbourg criteria (such as the
nature and seriousness of the offence) will be relevant to the weight to be
afforded to the public interest in deportation, and that other criteria will go
to the strength of the individual’s private and family life. A consequence of
the detailed guidance given by the ECtHR in these cases is that the domestic
margin of appreciation is narrower than in many other contexts where article 8
is engaged.</p>

amount to a final conclusion by the ECtHR that the only legitimate aim possible

it must be taken as an indication that that aim will normally be the basis on
which deportation is to be justified. Indeed it is doubtful, in cases involving
persons who hold indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom, whether
“immigration control” (insofar as it is relevant to the “economic well-being of
the country” under article 8(2)) is a legitimate aim under which deportation
can be justified. This means that, customarily, the risk of re-offending will
be of predominant importance. If the risk of re-offending is low, it will be
more difficult to justify an interference with a person’s article 8 rights on
the basis that this is necessary in order to prevent disorder and crime. If an
individual is unlikely to commit crime or be involved in disorder, how can his
expulsion on that ground be said to be rationally connected to the stated aim?</span></a></p><a name="para96">

the principles and guidelines in <i>Boultif </i>and <i>Ȕner.</i> It is
important to note that these are expressed as a generally applicable set of
“fundamental principles” which constitute a prescriptive set of rules to be
applied in <i>all cases</i> involving expulsion of what are described as
foreign criminals. “Foreign criminals” are defined in section 32(1)-(3) of the
UK Borders Act 2007 as persons who are not British citizens, who are either
convicted in the United Kingdom of an offence and sentenced to at least 12
months’ imprisonment, or are sentenced to a period of an imprisonment for an
offence which is specified as serious by the Secretary of State under section
72(4)(a) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.</span></a></p><a name="para98">

above demonstrate, to describe all who might be subject to deportation as
“foreign criminals” can be misleading. Some have lived most of their lives in
the countries from which it is proposed that they be expelled. Indeed, in the
case of the United Kingdom, some so-called “foreign criminals” may even have
been born here or hold permanent residency in this country but, because they do
not have British citizenship, they are liable to expulsion. Given the wide
category of persons who can be expelled after having been found guilty of
criminal offences, it is unsurprising that Strasbourg has given prominence, in
the article 8 assessment, to the length of time that an individual who claims
breach of that provision has spent in the “host” country and whether that
person is a “settled migrant”, in other words someone who has been granted a
right of residence (even if temporary) in the host country.</span></a></p><a name="para99">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Some consideration of the
circumstances of <i>Jeunesse </i>is needed. The applicant and her partner were
born and lived in Suriname. They had cohabited there. In October 1991 the
applicant’s partner went to stay in the Netherlands with his father and was
granted Netherlands nationality. In March 1997 the applicant was granted a visa
for the Netherlands for a short period to visit a relative. She entered the
country on 12 March 1997 and did not return to Suriname when her visa expired.
She had lived in the Netherlands since then. She made various applications for
a residence permit, all of which were refused. In June 1999 the applicant
married her partner and their first child was born in September 2000 and was a
Netherlands national. She renewed her applications for a residence permit and,
apart from a short-lived success in obtaining an injunction against removal,
her applications were refused. In December 2005 she had a second child, again a
Netherlands national. Further applications for residence followed again with no
success. Finally, in April 2010, while pregnant with her third child, the
applicant filed a fifth request for a residence permit in order to stay with
her children. This was also rejected, it being decided that the refusal did not
contravene article 8. The relevant minister attributed “decisive weight” to the
fact that the applicant had never resided lawfully in the Netherlands and that
there was no indication that it would be impossible to exercise family life in
Suriname.</span></a></p><a name="para102">

raised in the present appeal, in the subsequent case of <i>R (Agyarko) v
Secretary of State for the Home Department </i>it was submitted for the
Secretary of State that the effect of <i>Jeunesse </i>was that it was necessary
for an applicant who was not a settled migrant to show that his or her
circumstances were “sufficiently weighty” to oblige the state to allow him or
her to remain before article 8 was engaged in their case. In other words, the
applicant had to show that the state was under a positive obligation to admit
the applicant. Implicit in this argument was that, in the case of someone who
was not a settled migrant, the question of a state’s negative obligation not to
act in violation of that person’s article 8 rights did not arise because access
to those rights could only be obtained by such a person by showing that the
state had a positive obligation to grant leave to remain.</span></a></p><a name="para103">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Where a contracting state
tolerates the presence of an alien in its territory thereby allowing him or her
to await a decision on an application for a residence permit, an appeal against
such a decision or a fresh application for a residence permit, such a
contracting state enables the alien to take part in the host country’s society,
to form relationships and to create a family there. However, this does not
automatically entail that the authorities of the contracting state concerned
are, as a result, under an obligation pursuant to article 8 of the Convention
to allow him or her to settle in their country. In a similar vein, confronting
the authorities of the host country with family life as a fait accompli does
not entail that those authorities are, as a result, under an obligation
pursuant to article 8 of the Convention to allow the applicant to settle in the
country. The court has previously held that, in general, persons in that
situation have no entitlement to expect that a right of residence will be
conferred upon them.”</p>

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">It is important to note that the
Grand Chamber did <i>not</i> say that an applicant for permission to remain who
prays article 8 in aid of his or her application must show, as a prerequisite
to reliance on the rights enshrined in that provision, that the state is <i>obliged</i>
to allow him or her to remain. The burden of the Grand Chamber’s reasoning is
that a person who has been allowed to remain while applications for a right of
residence are being dealt with cannot expect that the period accumulated by
those processes will <i>automatically</i> bring entitlement to a right to
reside. Likewise, the creation of a family and the presentation of that
circumstance to state authorities as a <i>fait accompli</i> carries no
automatic right to the grant of leave to remain. And there is no <i>general</i>
obligation to respect a married couple’s choice of country for their matrimonial
residence (para 107).</span></a></p><a name="para105">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">It is also relevant that, at the
time that family life was created, the persons involved were aware that the
immigration status of one of them was such that family life being permitted to
continue in the host state was precarious. In para 108 of <i>Jeunesse </i>the
Grand Chamber said that where this was the case, it was “likely only to be in
exceptional circumstances that the removal of the non-national family member”
would constitute a violation of article 8.</span></a></p><a name="para106">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">It is important to understand,
however, that none of these considerations has been expressed by the Strasbourg
court as determinative. Each, provided it is relevant to the particular
circumstances of the individual case, must be taken into account. But the
weight to be attached to them will depend upon the significance that they have
according to those circumstances.</span></a></p><a name="para107">

is not a settled migrant</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt"> - a settled
migrant being someone who has been granted some form of residence, whether
temporary or indefinite - </span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">is likewise a
relevant factor. On that account, the Grand Chamber, in para 104, drew a
distinction between Ms Jeunesse’s case and those of settled migrants. As was
pointed out, withdrawal of a right to residence inevitably involves an
interference with family or private life. The same is not true in the case of
someone who is not a settled migrant. The factual and legal situation of a
settled migrant and that of an alien seeking admission to a host country are,
self-evidently, not the same - see para 105. As the Grand Chamber there pointed
out:</span></a></p><a name="para108">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… the question to be examined …
is whether, having regard to the circumstances as a whole, the Netherlands
authorities were under a duty pursuant to article 8 to grant her a residence
permit, <i>thus enabling her to exercise family life on their territory.</i>” (emphasis
supplied)</p>

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The conjunction of the obligation
to grant a residence permit and the facilitation of the exercise of family life
in the host state is critical. The flaw in the argument made by the Secretary
of State is the suggestion that these two issues should be considered
disjunctively and, moreover, that the duty to grant a residence permit should be
considered by way of anterior inquiry to the question of whether the article 8
rights of the individual are engaged and should prevail over the community
interests at stake. It is true that the Grand Chamber in <i>Jeunesse</i> said
that the case was to be seen “as one involving an allegation of failure on the
part of the respondent state to comply with a positive obligation under article
8 of the Convention” (para 105), but that does not mean that it is to be
considered <i>in isolation from</i> the conventional approach to the question
of whether a right to respect for family and private life is engaged. Showing
that the state is under a positive obligation to grant permission to reside
must not be regarded as a gateway to reliance on article 8 rights. On the
contrary, examination of the particular circumstances of the individual who
seeks to rely on article 8 and which are claimed to constitute family life is
central to the question of whether the article is engaged. This cannot be
determined by some extraneous, abstract assessment of whether the state is
under a positive obligation to grant a right to reside.</span></a></p><a name="para109">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The Secretary of State, while
acknowledging that the distinction between positive and negative obligations
had recently tended to be downplayed by Strasbourg in many contexts, argued in
the subsequent case of <i>Agyarko v Secretary of State for the Home Department</i>
that, in cases such as that of Mr Ali, it was of especial significance. Unless
it could be shown that there was a positive obligation to grant a right to
remain, the question of whether there was an interference with article 8 did
not arise, she argued. This does not chime well with observations of the Grand
Chamber in para 106 of <i>Jeunesse</i>, where it said that:</span></a></p><a name="para110">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… the boundaries between the
state’s positive and negative obligations under [article 8] do not lend
themselves to precise definition. The applicable principles are, nonetheless,
similar. In both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be
struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community
as a whole …”</p>

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">This passage, which confirms the
approach taken in <i>Nunez v Norway</i> (2011) 58 EHRR 17, para 69, exposes the
essential nature of the debate. It is not a question of an applicant for leave
to reside showing that they are owed a positive obligation to be allowed to
remain before they can rely on article 8. Rather, what is required is an
open-ended examination of the interests of the individual pitted against those
of the community as a whole. In the <i>Jeunesse </i>case the interests of the
community as a whole were, principally, control of immigration. In the present
appeal the community interests are the prevention of disorder and crime. But
the following passage from para 107 of <i>Jeunesse </i>is pertinent for either
context:</span></a></p><a name="para111">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… in a case which concerns family
life as well as immigration, the extent of a state’s obligations to admit to
its territory relatives of persons residing there will vary according to the
particular circumstances of the persons involved and the general interest.
Factors to be taken into account in this context are the extent to which family
life would effectively be ruptured, the extent of the ties in the contracting state,
whether there are insurmountable obstacles in the way of the family living in
the country of origin of the alien concerned and whether there are factors of
immigration control (for example, a history of breaches of immigration law) or
considerations of public order weighing in favour of exclusion.”</p>

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The striking of a fair balance
between general community interests and the particular circumstances of the
persons involved is the cornerstone on which the dispute is to be resolved, so
far as Strasbourg jurisprudence is concerned. Expressed in that way, one can
recognise the distinction between, on the one hand, the generally constant, if
not unalterable, nature of the community interests and, on the other, the
potentially infinitely variable importance of individual family and private
life interests. The distinction between positive and negative obligations has
not been thought to be significant by our domestic courts. As Lord Bingham held
in <i>Huang,</i> whether an article 8 claim involves a complaint of
interference or a lack of respect, the ultimate question is proportionality:</span></a></p><a name="para112">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In most cases where the
applicants complain of a violation of their article 8 rights, in a case where
the impugned decision is authorised by law for a legitimate object and the
interference (or lack of respect) is of sufficient seriousness to engage the
operation of article 8, the crucial question is likely to be whether the
interference (or lack of respect) complained of is proportionate to the
legitimate end sought to be achieved.” (para 18)</p>

assess a number of specifically identified factors in order to conduct a proper
article 8 inquiry. Another theme is that this examination must be open-textured
so that sufficient emphasis is given to each of the factors as they arise in
particular cases. Of their nature factors or criteria such as these cannot be
given a pre-ordained weight. Any attempt to do that would run counter to the
essential purpose of the exercise. This can be readily exemplified: a significant
prison sentence may be offset by the strength of family ties or progress on the
part of the offender post-conviction, for instance. Or expulsion might be
justified where the offending is relatively minor but the length of time spent
in the host country is short and there are no strong family ties there. The <i>application
</i>of the various factors as opposed to the <i>recognition of their relevance </i>involves
a holistic, open-minded approach. For this reason, giving pre-emptive,
indicative weight to particular factors on a generic basis is impermissible if
it distorts the proper assessment of these in their peculiar and individual
setting.</p>

opposed to following a purely domestic policy, it is not open to the state to
say that some of the <i>Boultif </i>factors should not be taken into account or
should be subservient to others. If those factors are relevant to a potential

where, as in the present case, the interference with the applicant’s rights

provisions of the Immigration Act 1971 at paras 3 and 4 of his judgment. Under
this Act deportation was a two-stage process requiring: (i) a person to be
liable to deportation under the provisions of the Act; and (ii) the Secretary
of State, in the exercise of her discretion under section 5(1), to have decided
whether a deportation order should be made in respect of him. If the deeming
provision in play was (as here) section 3(5)(a), therefore, the Secretary of
State, before deciding whether to make a deportation order, had to make a
judgment that the deportation of the person concerned was conducive to the
public good. If she made that judgment, she then had to exercise a discretion
as to whether the deportation order should be made. These functions underwent
significant change as a result of the enactment of the UK Borders Act 2007.</span></a></p><a name="para124">

Deportation of <i>certain</i> foreign criminals was to become mandatory.</span></a></p><a name="para125">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">As noted above, (at para 98)
foreign criminals are defined in section 32(1)-(3) of the Act. By section 32(4)
the deportation of those coming within that category is stated to be conducive
to the public good. Effectively, therefore, this provision removes from the
Secretary of State the function of deciding whether the deportation of someone
who meets the criteria for designation as a foreign criminal conduces to the
public good. But it goes further than that. The terms of the provision, that
the deportation of a foreign criminal <i>is </i>conducive to the public good,
purport to foreclose any legal debate as to whether the deportation of <i>anyone
</i>who comes within that category can be other than conducive to the public
good. Thus, the deportation of a person convicted of a criminal offence and
sentenced to more than 12 months’ imprisonment is to be considered as immutably
in the public good, irrespective of, for instance, any philanthropy or other
worthy endeavours in which he may have engaged since his incarceration.</span></a></p><a name="para126">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The second major change brought
about by the 2007 Act was the requirement in section 32(5) that the Secretary
of State must make a deportation order against a foreign criminal <i>unless </i>he
came within one or more of the exceptions stipulated in section 33. This
transformed the open-ended discretion that the Secretary of State had under
section 5(1) of the 1971 Act into a circumscribed judgment as to whether the
person to be deported came within any of the exceptions in section 33 of the
2007 Act. Sub-sections (2) to (6A) of section 33 (as amended by section 146 of
the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008) contain six exceptions. The only
one relevant to this appeal is the first. It is to the effect that section
32(4) and (5) do not apply where deportation would breach a person’s rights
under the ECHR. The disapplication of section 32(4) and (5) of the 2007 Act,
provided for in section 33(1), is made subject to section 33(7), however. It
provides:</span></a></p><a name="para127">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The application of an exception -</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; does not prevent the
making of a deportation order;</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; results in it being
assumed neither that deportation of the person concerned is conducive to the
public good nor that it is not conducive to the public good;</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">but section 32(4) applies despite
the application of Exception 1 or 4.”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>So, even if a deportation order would, under the first exception
provided for in section 33(2), breach a person’s Convention right, section
33(7) states that this would not prevent its being made. This is difficult to
reconcile with section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA) which provides that
it is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible
with a Convention right. If the Secretary of State (a public authority) made a
deportation order in the case of someone whose Convention right would thereby
be breached, she would inevitably act in contravention of her section 6 HRA
duty. In these circumstances, it appears to me that it would be problematic for
the Secretary of State to have recourse to this particular power.</a></p><a name="para128">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Moreover, it would not be easy to
square the preservation of the operation of section 32(4) (that the deportation
of a foreign criminal is conducive to the public good) with the breach of a
potential deportee’s Convention rights. For how could it be said to conduce to
the public good to do something which conflicts with the Secretary of State’s
legal obligation not to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention
right? These difficulties may be theoretical rather than practical, however. It
has not been suggested that the Secretary of State has used or would use her
powers under section 32 in a way that would bring her into conflict with her
duty under section 6 of HRA.</span></a></p><a name="para129">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Indeed, after the hearing of the
appeal in this case, the court received a letter dated 21 January 2016 from the
Government Legal Department. This gave the Secretary of State’s view as to how
section 33(7) would be applied “when it is accepted that a person’s deportation
would breach the UK’s obligations under the ECHR”. The letter referred to the
fact that, since at least 2000, para 380 of the Immigration Rules had provided
that a deportation order would not be made against any person whose removal
would be contrary to the United Kingdom’s obligations under ECHR. That
paragraph was deleted in July 2012, although replaced by the new para 397 which
was to the same effect. The letter asserted that the Secretary of State would
not make a deportation order “in the majority of cases where there is a
protection or human rights barrier to deportation … because it would not be
right to do so, and in any event could not be enforced”.</span></a></p><a name="para130">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The letter went on to say,
however, that a deportation order might be made, “despite the existence of an
ECHR barrier to deportation … when it is known that the barrier will fall
away”. Two examples of when this might arise were given:</span></a></p><a name="para131">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“This could be because the breach
(on the basis of article 8, for example) is known to be time-limited or because
[the Secretary of State] will obtain reliable assurances from the country of
return that the person will not be subjected to treatment that would breach the
ECHR …</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">Another example of when the
[Secretary of State] might consider that a deportation order could be made …
would be where the foreign criminal decides to leave the UK of his own accord …
or the person waives his or her rights … In such circumstances the deportation
order would not be enforced … but the foreign criminal would comply with the
requirement to leave the UK and the order would serve as preventing re-entry to
the UK while it is in force.”</p>

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">There are two principal
difficulties in the examples given by the Secretary of State. In the first
place, the distinction between making a deportation order and enforcing it does
not signify when one is considering a Convention right. The imperative in
section 6 HRA is not to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention
right. If deporting someone would conflict with his article 8 right, I cannot
see how it can be said to be compatible with that right to make an order for
his deportation, irrespective of whether, at the time of the making of the
order, it is not intended to enforce it. Moreover, it is not the <i>enforcement</i>
of an immigration order which is in contravention of a Convention right that
animates a right of appeal but the making of the order or the refusal to revoke
it - see section 82 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.</span></a></p><a name="para132">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The second difficulty with the
Secretary of State’s examples is that, properly analysed, most of these do not
involve any conflict with a Convention right at all and do not come within the
first exception in section 33. Thus, for instance, if the Secretary of State
receives assurances on which she can properly rely that the deported person’s
Convention rights will not be violated in the country to which he is deported, then
no Convention right is in play. Likewise, if the “ECHR barrier to deportation”
has fallen away, self-evidently, the Convention right no longer exists. And if
the Convention right has been waived, there is no question of the Secretary of
State acting in contravention of it.</span></a></p><a name="para133">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">That does not mean that the
Secretary of State may deport in anticipation of a Convention right
disappearing. So long as the right is in existence no public authority may act
in a way that is incompatible with it. Plainly, to deport someone in
contravention of a subsisting Convention right which is expected to vanish (but
has not done so) is just as much a breach of section 6 of HRA as is acting in
violation of a right which, it is believed, will endure.</span></a></p><a name="para134">

Section 3(2) of the 1971 Act. On 12 June 2012 the Secretary of State published
her <i>Statement of Intent: Family Migration. </i>Explaining the reasons for
making the new rules she said, in paragraph 7, that they would “reflect fully”
the factors that weigh for and against an article 8 claim. Paragraph 11 stated:</span></a></p><a name="para136">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:32.55pt;margin-bottom:
26.0pt;margin-left:72.0pt">“The Immigration Rules will reflect all the factors
which, under current statutes and case law, can weigh in favour of an article 8
claim, eg a child’s best interests, or against an article 8 claim, eg
criminality and poor immigration history. The courts will continue to determine
individual cases according to the law but, in doing so, they will be reviewing
decisions taken under Immigration Rules which expressly reflect article 8. If
an applicant fails to meet the requirements of the new Immigration Rules, it
should only be in genuinely exceptional circumstances that refusing them leave
and removing them from the UK would breach article 8.”</p>

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">It is interesting to note two of
the themes from this passage. First, the claim that the rules would reflect <i>all
</i>the factors engendered by applicable statute and case law. Secondly, that,
although courts would “determine individual cases according to the law”, they
would be reviewing decisions under rules that expressly reflected article 8.
The somewhat Delphic nature of the latter of these statements can be viewed in
at least two ways. On the one hand, it might appear to recognise the courts’
autonomous function in applying the law, independent of any guidance that the
rules purported to give. On the other, there is more than a hint that it was
expected of judges that, in their review of immigration decisions, they should
acknowledge and give due weight to the fact that those decisions had been
informed by consideration of what was claimed to be a complete charter of all
relevant Convention factors. Moreover, the statement that removing from the UK
an applicant who fails to meet the requirements of the rules would only breach
article 8 in exceptional circumstances is not expressed to be for the guidance
of immigration officers only.</span></a></p><a name="para137">

July 2012. So far as concerns the present appeal, the relevant provisions are
contained in rules 396-399A. Rule 396 expresses an important presumption and
makes a significant statement about the public interest. It stipulates that
where a person is liable to deportation, it is to be presumed that the public
interest requires deportation. And where the Secretary of State must make a
deportation order in accordance with section 32 of the 2007 Act, it is in the
public interest to deport.</span></a></p><a name="para139">

order will not be made if the person’s removal would be contrary to the UK’s

years (sub-paragraph (a)); or a period of imprisonment of less than four years
but at least 12 months (sub-paragraph (b)); or because, in the view of the
Secretary of State, their offending has caused serious harm or they are a
persistent offender who shows a particular disregard for the law (sub-paragraph
(c)). In any of the specified circumstances, the Secretary of State, in
assessing the claim, is required to consider whether paragraph 399 or 399A

</span>These complicated provisions require to be unravelled. It is probably
easiest to consider them as a series of categories. The first category arises
under rule 398(a). This relates to persons liable to deportation who have been
sentenced to at least four years’ imprisonment. Paragraphs 399 and 399A do not
apply to this category of persons - (see the opening words of each of those
provisions), although it is clear from ECtHR jurisprudence that persons falling
within this category may be able to succeed in resisting deportation under
article 8. A number of recent cases involving the UK exemplify this: <i>Omojudi
v United Kingdom </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2009/1942.html">(2010) 51 EHRR 10</a>, <i>AW Khan v United Kingdom </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2010/27.html">(2010) 50 EHRR 47</a>, <i>AA v United Kingdom </i>(2011) Imm AR 107.</p>

</span></a></span><a name="para144"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The effect of rule 398 is that,
notwithstanding a claim by such persons that their deportation would contravene
their article 8 rights, the public interest in having them deported can only be
outweighed by <i>other</i> factors in “exceptional circumstances”. This means
that the article 8 assessment in relation to this class of persons is
necessarily skewed. Their claim that deportation would disproportionately
interfere with their right to respect for private and family life will only
avail if they are able to demonstrate exceptional circumstances. Otherwise, the
compulsorily assumed public interest in having them deported will prevail.</span></a></p><a name="para144">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The threshold imposes two
requirements. In addition to demonstrating “exceptional circumstances”, the
factors which such persons can call upon to substantiate their article 8 claim
are factors “other” than those in paragraphs 399/399A. A similar two-fold
threshold applies in the 2014 Rules: “the public interest in deportation will
only be outweighed by other factors where there are very compelling
circumstances over and above those described in paragraphs 399 and 399A”.</span></a></p><a name="para145">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The second category relates to
those who are liable to deportation and who have been sentenced to a period of
at least 12 months’ but less than four years’ imprisonment and who have “a
genuine and subsisting parental relationship with a child under the age of 18
years”. Several requirements as to the condition of the child are stipulated.
First he or she must be a British citizen. So a child with leave to remain, but
without British citizenship, will not bring a parent within the provision.
Alternatively, the child must have lived in the UK continuously for at least
seven years before the date of the immigration decision. In either case, in
order to come within para 399, it must be established that it would not be
reasonable to expect the child to leave the UK and that there is no other
family member able to care for the child in the UK.</span></a></p><a name="para146">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">It goes without saying that
vibrant family life can exist in circumstances other than those specified in
this second category. It is not difficult to envisage tight-knit families where
it would be <i>possible</i> under the rules to separate a parent from his or
her child if that child is not a British citizen or is less than seven years
old or where there is another family member who might care for her or him. But
whether to bring about a separation in those circumstances would violate the
right of the parent and the child to respect for his or her family life is an
entirely different matter. Family life is not to be defined by the application
of a series of rules. Disturbance of that precious aspect of existence is not
avoided by a limited set of exemptions. While a limited area of discretionary judgment
must be allowed the government in the matter of justification of an
interference with the rights enshrined in article 8(1) of ECHR, it is
important, as a first step in an examination of whether there has been a breach
of that article, that one should recognise that family life and the requirement
to respect it are not susceptible to verification solely by a system of checks
against a set of prescriptive rules.</span></a></p><a name="para147">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">It is crucial, also to draw
attention here to the obligation under section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship
and Immigration Act 2009, incorporating article 3(1) of the United Nations
Convention on the Rights of the Child, to treat the child’s best interests as a
primary consideration (as discussed in <i>ZH (Tanzania) v Secretary of State
for the Home Department </i></span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2011/4.html">[2011] 2 AC 166</a>). The rules do not permit
consideration of the best interests of the children concerned. Indeed, insofar
as they envisage that where an alternative family member can care for a child
deportation will be proportionate, the rules positively disregard the child’s
interests.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:26.0pt;

</span></a></span><a name="para149"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The third category involves those
who have a “genuine and subsisting relationship” with someone who comes within
one of the groups specified in para 399(b): British citizens, persons with
indefinite leave to remain, and those who have been granted refugee or
humanitarian protection. Again, conditions are applied in order to qualify for
the exemption provided for in this sub-paragraph. The person with whom the
relationship exists must have lived in the UK for at least 15 years and there
must be “insurmountable” obstacles to continuing family life with that partner
outside the UK. Similar observations about these requirements may be made as
those that pertain to the second category.</span></a></p><a name="para149">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Some comment in particular is
required on the use of the phrase “insurmountable obstacles”. In the article 8
contexts, our domestic courts have repeatedly emphasised that the test for
whether a family can be expected to relocate abroad to continue their family
life is whether relocation would be “reasonable”. In <i>Huang </i>at para 20,
Lord Bingham refers to “circumstances where the life of the family cannot
reasonably be expected to be enjoyed elsewhere”; in <i>EB (Kosovo) v Secretary
of State for the Home Department </i></span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/41.html">[2009] 1 AC 1159</a>, para 12, whether the
spouse can “reasonably be expected to follow the removed spouse to the country
of removal”, (see also para 18); and in <i>ZH (Tanzania)</i>, where Lady Hale
at para 15 observes that “of particular importance is whether a spouse or … a
child can reasonably be expected to follow the removed parent to the country of
removal” (see also para 29). The issue was laid to rest in <i>VW (Uganda) v
Secretary of State for the Home Department </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2009/5.html">[2009] EWCA Civ 5</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2009/5.html">[2009] Imm AR 436</a> (paras 19, 24)). The ECtHR, although it uses the phrases “insurmountable
obstacles”, “major impediments”, “serious impediments” or, in the French
version of certain judgments, merely “<i>obstacles</i>”, looks in substance at
the difficulties facing families and whether it is reasonable to expect family
members to relocate. This is so, not only in cases involving “settled” migrants
(see <i>Boultif</i>, paras 48, 52-55) but also in cases involving a
“precarious” immigration status. For example, in <i>Mokrani v France </i><span style="font-size:13.0pt">(2003) 40 EHRR 5</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">,
which involved a relationship commenced after a deportation order had been
issued, the court, noting that the applicant “could not have been unaware of
the relative precariousness of his situation” went on to say, in finding a
violation of article 8, “it is hardly conceivable that the wife, a French
national who has never lived in Algeria and who has no links with that country,
should be expected to follow the applicant to Algeria” (para 34).</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:26.0pt;

</span></a></span><a name="para151"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The fourth and fifth categories
under para 399A (the article 8 “private life” provisions, whilst para 399
purports to deal with “family life”) involve those who have been living in the
UK for a prescribed number of years or who are less than 25 years old and have
spent at least half their life in the UK and have no ties with the country to
which they would be deported. This is an extremely high threshold to meet.
Despite having lived in the UK for many years, a person may continue to speak
the language of their country of origin, or may have family who remain living
there. But this does not mean that their deportation would not be disproportionate.
Furthermore, the rules do not take into account the personal, cultural,
linguistic and economic ties that a person has with the United Kingdom, or
assess their degree of integration in this country, factors which are
indisputably relevant to an article 8 assessment.</span></a></p><a name="para151">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">One can accept that all five
categories describe groups of people who may readily be supposed to have
established a family or private life in the UK. It cannot be said, however,
that these groups are comprehensive of all whose circumstances might properly
come within that rubric. Indeed, the rules also make the mistake of addressing
family and private life separately, rather than recognising that the impact of
expulsion on private and family life must be considered cumulatively (<i>Maslov
</i>para 63; <i>AA v United Kingdom </i></span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2011/1345.html">[2012] Imm AR 107</a>, para 49). Many who
fall outside the categories set out in the rules enjoy a full family or private
life in every sense. The significance of that inescapable truth is that, under
the 2012 Immigration Rules, anyone who does not come within any of the
specified categories and who is liable to deportation as a result of their
status as a foreign criminal must demonstrate “exceptional circumstances” in
order to outweigh the statutorily imposed public interest in their deportation.
That requirement runs directly counter to a proper assessment of whether an
interference with the right to respect for family or private life on the part
of those who do not come within one of the exemptions is justified.</p>

recognise two features of the <i>Huang </i>decision. The first of these is that
consideration of whether an individual’s article 8 rights will be infringed by
a decision to deport her or to refuse her permission to reside in this country,
notwithstanding her article 8 right, does not lend itself naturally to the
application of a series of rules. The essential nature of the inquiry into
whether (i) the article 8 right is engaged; (ii) there has been an interference
with it; and (iii) if so, the interference is justified, inevitably involves a
fact sensitive focus. Of course, Immigration Rules, in order to be
administratively workable, must contain a series of checks or filters. But two
points need to be made about this. First, the primary function of such checks
should be to determine whether the applicant <i>qualifies </i>under the rules.
And the second is that failure to qualify under the rules should not inhibit
the open-minded examination of whether article 8 mandates that a decision to
grant leave to enter or remain or, as in this case, to refuse to make a
deportation order, should be made.</span></a></p><a name="para154">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The second feature of the <i>Huang
</i>decision mirrors the second point made above. At para 20 of <i>Huang</i>
Lord Bingham said:</span></a></p><a name="para155">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In an article 8 case … the
ultimate question for the appellate immigration authority is whether the
refusal of leave to enter or remain, in circumstances where the life of the
family cannot reasonably be expected to be enjoyed elsewhere, taking full
account of all considerations weighing in favour of the refusal, prejudices the
family life of the applicant in a manner sufficiently serious to amount to a
breach of the fundamental right protected by article 8. If the answer to this
question is affirmative, the refusal is unlawful and the authority must so
decide. It is not necessary that the appellate immigration authority, directing
itself along the lines indicated in this opinion, need ask in addition whether
the case meets a test of exceptionality.”</p>

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">So, the ultimate question is
whether the refusal of leave to enter or remain (or, as in this case, the
decision to make a deportation order) prejudices the family or private life of
the individual sufficiently seriously to amount to a breach of the article 8
right. That quest should not be encumbered by pre-emptive considerations of
exceptionality. It is, in essence, a simple exercise. Of course, the fact that
the person liable to deportation has committed a criminal offence looms large
in the “considerations weighing in favour of the refusal”. But that
consideration is no more than a factor to be accorded the weight that the
particular circumstances of the case warrant. It must not be an intrinsic
impediment of unvarying significance which creates a hurdle of identical weight
in all cases and which can only be overcome by the existence of closely defined
exceptional circumstances.</span></a></p><a name="para156">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">A proper understanding of the role
of the appellate immigration authority, on an appeal from a decision to refuse
leave is, as Lord Reed has pointed out (in paras 42-43), vital to an
appreciation of how it is to perform its function. It is not a reviewing body.
It is not inhibited by findings previously made. On the contrary, it is its
duty to find facts for itself and these must include, where relevant,
circumstances which have arisen since the original findings were made. For this
reason, although the Upper Tribunal in the present case was bound to take
account of the Secretary of State’s reasons for making a deportation order,
that was only because these were relevant considerations to which appropriate
weight should be given. The fact that the Secretary of State had decided to
make a deportation order has no significance for the Upper Tribunal beyond
that.</span></a></p><a name="para157">

Borough Council v Joffe </i>[1949] 1 KB 599, 603. I question the relevance of
those decisions in the present context. In a human rights appeal, the function
of the Tribunal is to anxiously scrutinise the decision of the Secretary of
State, and to assess the proportionality of the interference with the
individual’s rights for itself. I find myself unable to agree with the
statement, in the human rights context, that a court “ought not lightly … to
reverse” the Secretary of State’s decision. My view that this is not the
correct approach is reinforced by the existence of a statutory appeal right on
human rights grounds.</span></a></p><a name="para158">

at para 48 of counsel for the Secretary of State’s criticism of the decision in

resisting deportation is not a settled migrant is relevant, it does not mean
that they are debarred from relying on the same type of circumstances as would
a settled migrant in advancing an article 8 claim. And as Lady Hale said in <i>Bibi</i>
the applicable principles are similar in both instances.</span></a></p><a name="para160">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Moreover, as Lord Reed has
explained, the analytical structure by which the proportionality of a decision
or measure should be assessed can, with modest modification, be applied to the
present circumstances. That structure has been developed and refined through
such cases as <i>Huang</i>;<i> R (Aguilar Quila) v Secretary of State for the

is now firmly established as the appropriate means by which the proportionality

Secretary of State had asserted (in a statement produced during the hearing of

reflect the Strasbourg jurisprudence when applied to the deportation of foreign

(Nigeria)</i>, at para 44,<i> </i>that the new rules were “a complete code”
suggests that article 8 factors which are not covered by the rules need not be
considered, I would strongly disagree. As I have said, the primary function of
the checks which the rules contain is to determine whether the applicant
qualifies under them. They cannot be regarded as a comprehensive means by which
a person’s article 8 rights are determined and, indeed, on the hearing of this
appeal, Ms Giovanetti made no such claim. In the words of Lord Bingham, “an
applicant's failure to qualify under the rules is … the point at which to
begin, not end, consideration of the claim under article 8” (<i>Huang</i>,<i> </i>para
6).</span></a></p><a name="para162">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The approach to proportionality
can be structured; indeed, the formulation of the correct approach in such
cases as <i>Aguilar Quila </i>and <i>Bank Mellat </i>is positively helpful in
ensuring that examination of whether a decision or measure is proportionate is
conducted in a controlled way. But the content of Convention rights and whether
interference with them can be said, in any given context, to be proportionate
cannot be prescribed. Indeed, although the ECtHR has set out a number of
factors that will frequently require to be examined, these do not purport to be
exhaustive of the circumstances in which a Convention right is in play or
whether interference with such a right is proportionate. Nor will all of those
factors be relevant in every conceivable situation. Much less will it be
appropriate to attempt to attach a particular weight to individual factors in
any general, pre-emptive way. For these reasons, the suggestion (made in</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt"> <i>AJ (Angola) v Secretary of State for the Home Department

of any Convention rights of an appellant through the lens of the new rules

accepted, as was said in <i>Secretary of State for the Home Department v AQ

to which deportation of a particular individual will further the legitimate aim
of preventing crime and disorder, and thus, as pointed out by Lord Reed at para

trouble with the suggestion that there may generally be a strong public
interest in the deportation of foreign criminals but a claim that this has a

risk of re-offending, deterrence and societal revulsion towards the commission
of criminal offences. I have touched upon the risk of re-offending at para 96
above. Where an individual is assessed to pose a low risk of re-offending,
interference with his article 8 rights on the basis that it is necessary to
prevent crime and disorder is more difficult to justify, and the weight to be
attached to the public interest in deportation in such a case will be reduced.</p>

para 16 of <i>Huang </i>acknowledged “the need to discourage non-nationals admitted
to the country temporarily from believing that they can commit serious crimes
and yet be allowed to remain”. This observation posits an appropriate
distinction between migrants admitted <i>temporarily</i> to the United Kingdom,
and persons who hold permanent residence or who have resided in this country
for a substantial period of time, for example, children who have lived in this
country all or most of their lives. It is at least open to question whether
deterrence is a relevant component of the public interest in deportation so far
as this latter group is concerned. Where the threat of a custodial sentence has
failed to deter such persons from offending, one must query whether the threat
of deportation would have any greater effect. No evidence has been presented to
support such a contention.</span></a></p><a name="para167">

the third of the factors applied in <i>OH (Serbia)</i>, should no longer be
seen as a component of the public interest in deportation. It is not rationally
connected to, nor does it serve, the aim of preventing crime and disorder.
Societal disapproval of any form of criminal offending should be expressed
through the imposition of an appropriate penalty. There is no rational basis
for expressing additional revulsion on account of the nationality of the

interest in the deportation of foreign national criminals. But the public
interest is multi-faceted, and there are other important factors which
contribute to the positive development of our society and are thus matters in
the general public interest. These factors may be a relevant consideration in
the article 8 proportionality assessment, and have a free-standing value,
independent of that which attaches to the individual facing deportation. For
example, there is a public interest in families being kept together, in the
welfare of children being given primacy, in valuing a person who makes a
special contribution to their community, and in encouraging and respecting the
rehabilitation of offenders. These factors all play a role in the construction
of a strong and cohesive society. They are recognised outwith the immigration
context, and certain factors are given statutory recognition. Where relevant
they should be part of the proportionality equation.</span></a></p><a name="para169">

it is not apparent that the judge took account of the fact that the appellant’s
relationship with Ms Harwood had been formed at a time when his immigration
status was such that the persistence of family life within the UK was precarious
and that its continuance after his release from prison took place when he was

he recorded that the appellant had “accepted that his relationship with [Ms

the judge observed that Ms Harwood had learned of “the appellant’s precarious
immigration status” following his involvement in criminal offences. At para 70,
Ms Harwood is recorded as having said that she wanted to marry the appellant
and have a “proper wedding” but that this was difficult because of his
“uncertain immigration status”. Quite apart from these items of evidence and
the judge’s express reference to them, the appellant’s precarious immigration
status and the fact that he was facing deportation proceedings when he was
released from prison are indisputable facts. I find it hard to believe in these
circumstances that the judge did not attach weight to them. The fact that they
were not discussed prominently among the welter of matters that the judge was
required to consider does not mean that they were left out of account. On the
contrary, his mention of the appellant’s and Ms Harwood’s awareness of them
seems to me to suggest that he had them well in mind in reaching his

Upper Tribunal erred in failing to take any account of the new rules on the
basis that they did not assist with the proper assessment of the applicant’s
human rights (paras 60 and 63). I do not consider that the Upper Tribunal’s
failure to take account of the rules impaired its approach to the article 8
proportionality assessment. In my opinion, the Upper Tribunal succinctly, but
correctly, expressed the proper approach to article 8, apart from its reference
to society’s disapproval as a basis on which deportation could be justified.
(Since the Upper Tribunal found that the decision to deport was
disproportionate, however, this error does not signify.) At para 95 of his
Determination and Reasons the judge said:</span></a></p><a name="para172">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“I have to decide if the
interference in (<i>sic</i>) the private and family life consequent on removal

purposes of the prevention of disorder and crime. I have to do that knowing
that it is unlikely that this appellant will commit further offences. The point
is the deterrent effect or general expression of society’s disapproval of
foreign criminals, rather than preventing further trouble from this particular
man, that is important in this case.”</p>

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The judge also recognised that the
2007 Act had expressed a legitimate public interest in the deportation of
foreign criminals and acknowledged that he was bound to respect the policy as
set out in section 32(5) of the 2007 Act (para 96), and subsequently referred
to the “imperative of removal” in his discussion (paras 98 and 102). He then
set out a number of reasons which, taken in combination, led him to the
conclusion that his deportation would be disproportionate. These included that
the appellant had no family in Iraq and had not lived there since the age of 12
(this was “not determinative”, but “a factor against removal” - para 100); the
appellant’s “length of stay” in the UK “and positive attitude to future behaviour”
were “significant factors to weigh in the balance against the imperative of
removal” (para 102); and his “genuine”, “strong” and “important” relationship
with his fiancée (paras 94, 99), whose being required to relocate to Iraq would
not be “reasonable” (para 88). This is precisely the type of fact-sensitive
proportionality assessment that both ECtHR jurisprudence and binding domestic
authority requires and I cannot fault it.</span></a></p><a name="para173">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The Court of Appeal’s basic error
was its misunderstanding of the significance of sections 32 and 33 of the 2007
Act, and its conclusion that <i>MF (Nigeria) </i></span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2013/1192.html">[2014] 1 WLR 544</a> and <i>SS

to the public interest in the deportation of foreign criminals at the expense
of a proper examination of the circumstances of individual cases. All article 8
claims had to be refused if they fell outside rules 399 and 399A unless they
could identify exceptional or compelling circumstances. The inevitable circumscription
of a proper article 8 inquiry that such an approach entails cannot be upheld
for the reasons earlier given.</p>

</span></a></span><a name="para175"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The second ground of appeal (that
the Upper Tribunal had failed to recognise the importance of the public
interest in deporting foreign criminals) is plainly unsustainable once the
correct approach to sections 32 and 33 is understood. As I pointed out in para
172 above, the judge actually overstated the scope of the public interest but,
for the reasons given, this had no impact on the otherwise correct decision
that he reached.</span></a></p><a name="para175">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Grounds (iii) and (iv) (which the
Court of Appeal found it unnecessary to consider in light of its conclusion on
grounds (i) and (ii)) are unarguable, in my opinion. Ground (iii) averred that

need not repeat my discussion of the guidance to be derived from that case.
There is nothing in that guidance which is in conflict with the approach of the
Upper Tribunal. Since, for the reasons that I have given as to the general
propriety of the Upper Tribunal’s approach, I consider that ground (iv) is
unsustainable.</span></a></p><a name="para176">
