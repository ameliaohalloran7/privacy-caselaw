<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>B has a long and complex immigration history which it is necessary to
refer to in some detail. He has been in the United Kingdom since 1993. Between
5 February 2002 and 11 March 2005, he was detained under section 21 of the
Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001. He appealed to the Special Immigration
Appeals Commission (“SIAC”) against that decision using a false identity. The
relevant provisions of the 2001 Act were repealed by the Prevention of
Terrorism Act 2005 (“the 2005 Act”) following the decision of the House of
Lords in <i>A and others v Secretary of State for the Home Department </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2004/56.html">[2004] UKHL 56</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2004/56.html">[2005] 2 AC 68</a>. B was then released from detention on 11 March 2005,
and made subject to a control order under the 2005 Act. He was admitted to the
Royal Free Hospital on the 12 March 2005 as a voluntary psychiatric patient
where he remained, save for one night, until 11 August 2005.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para3">3.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On 11 August 2005 B was notified, in accordance with regulations under
section 105 of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, of the
Secretary of State’s decision to make a deportation order against him on
national security grounds, under sections 3(5) and 5(1) of the 1971 Act. B was
arrested and detained under immigration powers contained in paragraph 2(2) of
Schedule 3 to the 1971 Act “pending the making of the deportation order”. He
was detained at HMP Woodhill and, the following day, transferred to HMP Long
Lartin. On 17 August 2005, B appealed to SIAC against that decision, once again
using the same false identity. B’s grounds of appeal contended, <i>inter alia</i>,
that his removal to Algeria would be in breach of the United Kingdom’s
obligations under the UN Refugee Convention and unlawful as incompatible with
his rights under article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights and
Fundamental Freedoms (“ECHR”).</a></p><a name="para3">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Secretary of State has never disputed that, if deported to Algeria,
B would be at real risk of treatment incompatible with article 3 ECHR and that
only with specific individual assurances from the Algerian government could he
be lawfully and safely removed to Algeria. On 11 May 2006, Her Majesty’s
Government informed the Algerian Government that it proposed to deport B and
requested certain information about him. On 16 May 2006, specific assurances as
to the treatment of B were sought from Algeria. On 10 July 2006,<i> </i>the
Algerian authorities confirmed that the details of his identity given by B were
those of an individual present in Algeria.</a></p><a name="para4">

</span>On 12 January 2007, pursuant to rule 39(1) of the Special Immigration
Appeals Commission (Procedure) Rules 2003, SIAC directed B to provide specified
particulars of his true identity and to consent to provide a non-invasive
sample for the purposes of DNA testing. B consented to provide a DNA sample but
refused to provide the particulars of his true identity. On 19 July 2007, SIAC
ordered B to provide details of his true identity. A penal notice was attached
to the order.</a></p><a name="para6">

</span>On 30 July 2008, SIAC gave judgment in the national security case
against B, holding that the Secretary of State’s case on the risk to national
security had been made out. SIAC concluded that, notwithstanding his mental
health difficulties, B had played a leading role in facilitating communications
for Algerian terrorists, as well as being responsible for the procurement of
false documentation and high technology equipment. The hearing of the case on
safety on return did not take place at that time because of the unresolved
question of B’s true identity.</a></p><a name="para7">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On 18 August 2009, the Secretary of State applied to SIAC for an order
that B be committed to prison for contempt for disobeying the order of 19 July
2007. Following an adjournment in the hope of resolving the issue of B’s
identity, the committal application was eventually heard on 11 October 2010. In
its judgment delivered on 26 November 2010 SIAC held that B had deliberately
and contumeliously disobeyed its order and, taking into account all the
circumstances including that B’s mental illness may have reinforced his
decision not to comply with SIAC’s order, imposed a prison sentence of four
months. The operation of the order was suspended until the final determination
of any appeal. On 21 July 2011, the Court of Appeal by a majority dismissed his
appeal (<i>B (Algeria) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2011/828.html">[2011] EWCA Civ 828</a>). B appealed to the Supreme Court which on 30 January 2013
dismissed the appeal (<i>B (Algeria) v</i> <i>Secretary of State for the Home
Department </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2013/4.html">[2013] UKSC 4</a>;<i> </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2013/4.html">[2013] 1 WLR 435</a>). B then served his
sentence of 4 months’ imprisonment in HMP Belmarsh and was released on 5 April
2013.</p>

</span>On 11 April 2006, SIAC had decided in principle that B could be granted
bail. However, save for one night, throughout the period from 11 March 2005 B
remained in either prison or hospital until his discharge from hospital to bail
accommodation on 18 January 2011. B was voluntarily readmitted to hospital in February
2011 and on further occasions thereafter. Following his release from prison
after serving his sentence for contempt, two sets of bail conditions were set
by SIAC to run in parallel depending on whether B was an in-patient at a
psychiatric hospital or residing at his bail accommodation.</a></p><a name="para9">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On 23 January 2014, B applied to vary his bail conditions which, he
maintained, constituted an unlawful deprivation of liberty. At a hearing on 28
and 29 January 2014 SIAC considered the application of the <i>Hardial Singh </i>principles
(<i>R v Governor of Durham Prison, Ex p Hardial Singh </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/1983/1.html">[1984] 1 WLR 704</a>) to
the circumstances of B’s case, including the prospect of B’s removal to
Algeria. In its judgment of 13 February 2014, SIAC found that in the absence of
a change of mind by B “there is no reasonable prospect of removing [B] to
Algeria and thus the ordinary legal basis for justified detention of B under
the Immigration Acts has fallen away”.<i> </i>Following this ruling, the
Secretary of State did not authorise the further detention of B, although B’s
advisers only became aware of this on or about 6 June 2014. In its judgment of
13 February 2014 SIAC also held that the conditions of bail did not constitute
a deprivation of liberty. However, it subsequently directed a review of B’s bail
conditions, which were relaxed by an order dated 16 May 2014.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On 14 May 2014 the Secretary of State applied under rules 11B and 40 of
the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (Procedure) Rules 2003 to strike out
B’s appeal against the notice of decision to deport him, on the grounds of his
continuing refusal to comply with the order of 19 July 2007. On 1 July 2014, in
the light of B’s continuing contempt of court, SIAC struck out B’s appeal.</a></p><a name="para11">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>B maintained that, following SIAC’s findings on 13 February 2014, his
detention could no longer lawfully be authorised as it would be incompatible
with <i>Hardial</i> <i>Singh </i>principles. He contended that if that were so,
and he could not lawfully be detained, SIAC no longer had jurisdiction to grant
bail to B or to impose bail conditions. In its judgment of 1 July 2014, SIAC
rejected these submissions, concluding that it continued to have jurisdiction
to impose bail conditions on B.</a></p><a name="para12">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>B then applied for permission to apply for judicial review of SIAC’s
decision of 1 July 2014 on its bail jurisdiction, there being no right of
appeal against that decision. Irwin J, sitting as a High Court Judge, heard
that application by agreement between B and the Secretary of State, and on 14 August
2014 he granted B permission to apply for judicial review of that decision,
dismissed the application for judicial review, and granted permission to appeal
to the Court of Appeal.</a></p><a name="para13">

</span>B appealed to the Court of Appeal which on 6 May 2015 gave judgment
allowing both appeals (<i>B (Algeria) v Secretary of State for the Home
Department (No 2) </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2015/445.html">[2015] EWCA Civ 445</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2015/445.html">[2016] QB 789</a>).</p>

</span>The Court of Appeal allowed B’s appeal in relation to SIAC’s bail
jurisdiction on the ground that SIAC had no jurisdiction to impose bail
conditions on B if his detention would be unlawful.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(2)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeal also allowed B’s appeal against the strike out of B’s
SIAC appeal and remitted the matter to SIAC.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On 15 September 2016 SIAC refused the application to strike out B’s
appeal against the decision to make a deportation order against him. The
Secretary of State then indicated that she no longer opposed B’s appeal.
Accordingly, in a judgment dated 12 December 2016 SIAC confirmed its decision
to allow B’s appeal against the notice of intention to deport him. The
Secretary of State did not seek permission to appeal. As a result of this
ruling allowing the substantive deportation appeal, B’s bail fell away and it
is common ground that the immigration bail power is now unavailable.</a></p><a name="para15">

</span>The <i>Hardial Singh</i> principles form an important part of the

down the following propositions (at p 706D-G):</a></p><a name="para24">

</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para24">“Since 20 July 1983, the applicant

individuals is not subject to any express limitation of time, I am quite
satisfied that it is subject to limitations. First of all, it can only
authorise detention if the individual is being detained in one case pending the
making of a deportation order and, in the other case, pending his removal. It
cannot be used for any other purpose. Secondly, as the power is given in order
to enable the machinery of deportation to be carried out, I regard the power of
detention as being impliedly limited to a period which is reasonably necessary
for that purpose. The period which is reasonable will depend upon the
circumstances of the particular case. What is more, if there is a situation
where it is apparent to the Secretary of State that he is not going to be able
to operate the machinery provided in the Act for removing persons who are
intended to be deported within a reasonable period, it seems to me that it
would be wrong for the Secretary of State to seek to exercise his power of
detention.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">In addition, I would regard it as
implicit that the Secretary of State should exercise all reasonable expedition
to ensure that the steps are taken which will be necessary to ensure the

</span>Over time these principles have been elaborated and refined. In <i>R (WL

<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2011/12.html">[2012] 1 AC 245</a>, Lord Dyson JSC summarised them as follows (at para 22):</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It is common ground that my
statement in <a href="https://login.westlaw.co.uk/maf/wluk/app/document?src=doc&amp;linktype=ref&amp;context=64&amp;crumb-action=replace&amp;docguid=I79BD3A00E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9"><i><span style="color:windowtext;text-decoration:none">R (I) v Secretary of State for

as follows: (i) the Secretary of State must intend to deport the person and can
only use the power to detain for that purpose; (ii) the deportee may only be
detained for a period that is reasonable in all the circumstances; (iii) if,
before the expiry of the reasonable period, it becomes apparent that the
Secretary of State will not be able to effect deportation within a reasonable
period, he should not seek to exercise the power of detention; (iv) the
Secretary of State should act with reasonable diligence and expedition to
effect removal.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">With regard to determining what is a reasonable period
Lord Dyson (at para 104) repeated his earlier conclusion in <i>I</i>’s case (at
para 48):</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It is not possible or desirable
to produce an exhaustive list of all the circumstances that are or may be
relevant to the question of how long it is reasonable for the Secretary of
State to detain a person pending deportation pursuant to <a href="https://login.westlaw.co.uk/maf/wluk/app/document?src=doc&amp;linktype=ref&amp;context=64&amp;crumb-action=replace&amp;docguid=I0E0CB3F0E44911DA8D70A0E70A78ED65"><span style="color:windowtext;text-decoration:none">paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 3 to
the Immigration Act 1971</span></a>. But in my view they include at least: the
length of the period of detention; the nature of the obstacles which stand in
the path of the Secretary of State preventing a deportation; the diligence,
speed and effectiveness of the steps taken by the Secretary of State to
surmount such obstacles; the conditions in which the detained person is being
kept; the effect of detention on him and his family; the risk that if he is
released from detention he will abscond; and the danger that, if released, he
will commit criminal offences.”</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">Discussion</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para26">26.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I take as my starting point that adopted by the Court of Appeal at paragraph
23 of the judgment of Lord Dyson MR. It is uncontroversial. On 13 February 2014
SIAC ruled that there was “no reasonable prospect of removing [B] to Algeria
and thus the ordinary legal basis for justified detention of B under the
Immigration Acts has fallen away”. The Secretary of State accepts that there
was thereafter no further authority for the detention of B under paragraph 2(2)
of Schedule 3 to the 1971 Act. It is, therefore, common ground that B could not
lawfully be detained following the ruling of 13 February 2014 because to do so
would exceed the implied limits on the exercise of administrative power to
detain for immigration purposes as determined in <i>Hardial Singh</i>.</a></p><a name="para26">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para26"></a><a name="para27">27.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At the heart of this case lies a dispute between the parties as to the
correct approach in principle to the availability of immigration bail when the <i>Hardial
Singh</i> limit on actual detention is reached. The Secretary of State submits
that at that point the individual can be moved onto or kept on bail as an
alternative to detention, as a means of getting or keeping him out of detention
that is, or is about to become, or would be unlawful. Moreover, at that point
the ability to exercise control over him in the form of bail conditions is
retained. B’s position, by contrast, is that bail is predicated on lawful
detention with the result that when the <i>Hardial Singh</i> limit on actual
detention is reached the ability to grant or maintain bail also simultaneously
falls away.</a></p><a name="para27">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On behalf of the Secretary of State, Mr Tam urges the court to adopt a
purposive interpretation of the relevant legislation. He submits that it is
consistent with the purpose of the bail power for it to be construed so that
bail is available regardless of whether the individual is lawfully detained or
would hypothetically be lawfully detained. The bail power has been provided in
order to remove an individual from detention. That purpose would be served
whether the detention is lawful or unlawful at the time that bail is granted
and the detention is terminated. The bail power, he submits, constitutes a
practical solution which permits the termination of unwanted or unwarranted
detention, regardless of the separate question of whether that detention is
lawful or unlawful. He then draws attention to the fact that at one end of the
spectrum of cases dealt with by the immigration system are those of dangerous
criminals and those who pose a risk to national security. It is, he submits,
particularly important that bail should be available in such cases. Here he
refers to the fact that bail conditions can be of greater stringency than
conditions which can be attached to temporary admission or temporary release.
The availability of bail, he argues, therefore helps to protect the public from
such risks if detention is no longer appropriate.</a></p><a name="para28">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>While accepting that practical difficulties may arise in the categories
of case referred to by Mr Tam in circumstances where continuing detention
becomes unlawful on <i>Hardial Singh</i> grounds, I can see no basis for
adopting the purposive approach for which the Secretary of State contends,
resting as it does on a disregard of the issue of the lawfulness of any
continuing detention. It is a fundamental principle of the common law that in
enacting legislation Parliament is presumed not to intend to interfere with the
liberty of the subject without making such an intention clear (<i>Tan Te Lam v
Superintendent of Tai A Chau Detention Centre</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKPC/1996/5.html">[1997] AC 97</a>, 111E; <i>R v

122E-F per Lord Bridge). Thus, in <i>In re Wasfi Suleman Mahmod</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/1994/3.html">[1995] Imm AR 311</a>, 314 Laws J, observed:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“While, of course, Parliament is
entitled to confer powers of administrative detention without trial, the courts
will see to it that where such a power is conferred the statute that confers it
will be strictly and narrowly construed and its operation and effect will be
supervised by the court according to high standards.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">In the present case our particular focus is not on a
power of executive detention, but on a power to grant bail. Nevertheless, and
despite the fact that the purpose may be to effect a release from detention, I
consider that this similarly attracts the presumption of statutory
interpretation because the conditions which may be attached to a grant of bail
are capable of severely curtailing the liberty of the person concerned. It was
common ground before us that bail under the 1971 Act may be subject to
conditions which constitute a deprivation of liberty within article 5(1)(f)
ECHR. As Mr Tam frankly accepts, the ability to exercise control through the
use of what may be stringent conditions of bail in part underlies the purposive
interpretation for which he contends. Moreover, this is, to my mind, a situation
where the principle of legality is in play. As Lord Hoffmann observed in <i>R v
Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p Simms</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1999/33.html">[2000] 2 AC 115</a>,
131D-G:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Fundamental rights cannot be
overridden by general or ambiguous words. This is because there is too great a
risk that the full implications of their unqualified meaning may have passed
unnoticed in the democratic process. In the absence of express language or
necessary implication to the contrary, the courts therefore presume that even
the most general words were intended to be subject to the basic rights of the
individual.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">In these circumstances, we are required to interpret the
statutory provisions strictly and restrictively.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para30">30.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is common ground that being “detained” is a condition precedent to
the exercise of the power to grant bail conferred by paragraphs 22 and 29 of
Schedule 2 to the 1971 Act. The power of SIAC to grant bail under section 3,
Special Immigration Appeals Commission Act 1997 is similarly based on the
person being detained. The Court of Appeal (at para 30) described the bail
power as “predicated on the individual being detained”.</a></p><a name="para30">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para30"></a><a name="para31">31.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Paragraph 22 of Schedule 2 confers a power to release on bail in the
case of three categories of person, namely a person detained under paragraph
16(1) pending examination, a person detained under paragraph 16(1A) pending
completion of his examination or a decision on whether to cancel his leave to
enter, and a person detained under paragraph 16(2) pending the giving of
directions. Each category is defined by reference to the person being detained
under paragraph 16 of Schedule 2. Similarly, paragraph 29 applies to a person
who “is for the time being detained under Part I of this Schedule”. Applying
the strict approach to interpretation which I consider is required here, these
provisions must be taken to refer to detention which is lawful. This conclusion
is reinforced by the fact that in respect of each category to which it applies
paragraph 16 refers to detention “under the authority of an immigration officer”.
This makes clear that the provision is not addressing the mere fact of detention;
this must refer to a lawful authorisation for detention. As the Court of Appeal
concluded in the present case, it would be extraordinary if Parliament had
intended to confer the power to grant bail where a person had been unlawfully
detained or could not lawfully be detained. The words employed are certainly
not appropriate to refer to a state of purported detention or to embrace both
lawful and unlawful detention. I consider that “detained” in paragraphs 22 and
29 refers to lawfully authorised detention.</a></p><a name="para31">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para31"></a><a name="para32">32.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On behalf of the Secretary of State, Mr Tam submits that “detained” is
used only to define the state of affairs which must exist at the time when the
power is first exercised. Clearly the power to grant bail can continue to be
exercised after the person has ceased to be detained. However, this fails to
address whether there needs to be a continuing power to detain as a
pre-condition to the grant of bail. Here it seems to me that unless there is a
continuing power to detain, the system of bail within Part 1 of Schedule 2
would encounter substantial difficulties in its operation. In this regard, Ms
Harrison on behalf of B, draws attention to certain features attending the
grant of bail. First, paragraph 22(1A) and paragraph 29(2) require the detained
person to enter into a recognizance to appear before an immigration officer at
a named time and place. When he does so it is then for the immigration officer
to re-fix bail if he or she considers it appropriate to do so and to determine
any appropriate conditions. (<i>R (AR (Pakistan)) v Secretary of State for the
Home Department</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2016/807.html">[2016] EWCA Civ 807</a>, para 26). It is difficult to see how
this would operate if there were no continuing power of detention. As Ms
Harrison points out, bail could be re-fixed but until it is the individual
cannot simply be at liberty, neither detained nor granted temporary admission.
Secondly, and more fundamentally, Ms Harrison points to a situation in which it
becomes necessary to re-detain the person on bail, for example because he or
she is in breach of the conditions of bail. This would not be possible in the
absence of a subsisting lawful power to detain. In the absence of such a power,
conditions of bail and recognizances entered into would be unenforceable.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para33">33.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In response Mr Tam first places reliance on the breach of bail
conditions. However, in such circumstances the legal authority for detention
cannot be found in the grant of bail or in the breach of conditions of bail but
must be found in an ongoing lawful power to detain, as appears from <i>Stellato
v Ministry of Justice</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2010/1435.html">[2010] EWCA Civ 1435</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2010/1435.html">[2011] QB 856</a> and <i>R (Konan)
v Secretary of State for the Home Department</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2004/22.html">[2004] EWHC 22 (Admin)</a>,
authorities to which I shall return later in this judgment. Secondly, he makes
the point that under the <i>Hardial Singh</i> principles a power of detention
may sometimes revive, for example because of a change of circumstances in the
foreign state concerned or because of a change in the risk which the individual
presents. While that may well occur from time to time in individual cases, it
is no answer to Ms Harrison’s objection which is directed at the operation of
the system of immigration bail. I note, moreover, that there is no possibility
of that occurring in the present case where not only did SIAC conclude on 1
July 2014 that B’s detention could no longer be authorised as it would be
incompatible with <i>Hardial Singh</i> principles, but the Secretary of State
has not authorised B’s continuing detention since that finding of SIAC. The
present case, it appears, falls within the category contemplated by Lord Dyson
JSC in <i>WL (Congo)</i> at para 144 where, however grave the risk of
absconding or the risk of serious offending, it ceases to be lawful to detain a
person pending deportation. Once that position is reached there is, in my view,
no longer a power of detention under paragraph 16 and there is therefore no longer
a power to grant bail under paragraphs 22 or 29.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr Tam submits that the respective structures of the powers to grant
temporary admission or release under paragraph 21 and the power to grant bail
under paragraph 22 are similar; paragraph 21 refers to “a person liable to
detention or detained” whereas paragraph 22 refers to “a person detained”. He
submits that this difference of wording serves only to identify that bail is
available only if the individual is actually detained, while temporary
admission is also available if the individual has not been actually detained.

The power to admit temporarily and the power to grant bail should be held to
continue so long as the power to detain exists, even if it cannot be lawfully
exercised.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“31.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For my part I have no
doubt that Mance LJ was right to recognise a distinction between the
circumstances in which a person is potentially liable to detention (and can
properly be temporarily admitted) and the circumstances in which the power to
detain can in any particular case properly be exercised. It surely goes without
saying that the longer the delay in effecting someone’s removal the more
difficult will it be to justify his continued detention meanwhile. But that is
by no means to say that he does not remain ‘liable to detention’. What I cannot
see is how the fact that someone has been temporarily admitted rather than
detained can be said to lengthen the period properly to be regarded as ‘pending
... his removal’.</p>

</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para36">32.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The true position in my
judgment is this. ‘Pending’ in </a><a href="https://login.westlaw.co.uk/maf/wluk/app/document?src=doc&amp;linktype=ref&amp;context=18&amp;crumb-action=replace&amp;docguid=I0DDA8060E44911DA8D70A0E70A78ED65"><span style="color:windowtext;text-decoration:none">paragraph 16</span></a> means no
more than ‘until’. The word is being used as a preposition, not as an
adjective. <a href="https://login.westlaw.co.uk/maf/wluk/app/document?src=doc&amp;linktype=ref&amp;context=18&amp;crumb-action=replace&amp;docguid=I0DDA8060E44911DA8D70A0E70A78ED65"><span style="color:windowtext;text-decoration:none">Paragraph 16</span></a> does not
say that the removal must be ‘pending’, still less that it must be ‘<i>im</i>pending’.
So long as the Secretary of State remains intent upon removing the person and
there is some prospect of achieving this, paragraph 16 authorises detention
meanwhile. Plainly it may become unreasonable actually to detain the person pending
a long delayed removal (ie throughout the whole period until removal is finally
achieved). But that does not mean that the power has lapsed. He remains ‘liable
to detention’ and the ameliorating possibility of his temporary admission in
lieu of detention arises under <a href="https://login.westlaw.co.uk/maf/wluk/app/document?src=doc&amp;linktype=ref&amp;context=18&amp;crumb-action=replace&amp;docguid=I0DE6DC70E44911DA8D70A0E70A78ED65"><span style="color:windowtext;text-decoration:none">paragraph 21</span></a>.</p>

</span>In its judgment in the present proceedings SIAC drew attention to the
distinction drawn by Lord Brown between the existence of a power to detain,
which can subsist even where actual detention would be unlawful, and the
unlawful exercise of that power. The power to detain continues to exist even if
actual detention would be unlawful provided that there is some prospect of
removal being effected. It noted that <i>Khadir</i> had not been disapproved by
the Supreme Court in <i>WL (Congo)</i>. In the present case SIAC considered
that there remained “some prospect” of removal so that the power to detain
persisted under paragraph 2 of Schedule 3. The fact that detention today would
be unlawful did not necessarily prevent lawful detention in the future. As a
result it concluded that the power to grant bail also subsisted and could be
exercised. That reasoning was decisively rejected by the Court of Appeal.</a></p><a name="para37">

</span>On this further appeal Mr Tam submits that the value of the decision in <i>Khadir</i>
is that its acceptance of the continuing existence of the power to detain and
thus the continuing availability of temporary admission or temporary release
allows a purposive construction of the three-layered mechanism provided by
Schedule 2 ie detention, bail, temporary admission or temporary release. In
particular, he submits that as both bail and temporary admission or temporary
release are “ameliorating possibilities” of alternatives to detention, it is
sensible for both powers to persist for some duration beyond the point at which
actual detention can no longer continue.</a></p><a name="para38">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In my view, <i>Khadir</i> provides no assistance to the Secretary of
State in the present case, for the reasons given by Lord Dyson MR (at paras
29-31). They may be summarised as follows:</a></p><a name="para39">

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(1)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><i>Khadir</i> is a decision not on detention or on the power to grant
bail under paragraphs 22 or 29, but on the power to grant temporary admission
under paragraph 21.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(2)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There is a material difference between the wording of paragraph 21, on
the one hand, and paragraphs 22 and 29 on the other. The distinction between a
person “detained” and a person “liable to be detained” is clear and must have
been deliberate.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(3)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The House of Lords in <i>Khadir</i> held that the distinction between
the existence and the exercise of the power to detain was material to the power
to grant temporary admission to a person “liable to detention”. There is no
warrant for applying that distinction to the different question of whether
there is a power to grant bail to a person who may not lawfully be detained at
the time when it is proposed to grant bail.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para39"></a><a name="para40">40.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On behalf of the Secretary of State it is then submitted that the
interpretation of paragraphs 22 and 29 favoured by the Court of Appeal would
lead to impracticability in their application and that this casts doubt on its
reading.</a></p><a name="para40">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para40"></a><a name="para41">41.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>First, it is submitted that, if there is no power to grant bail unless
there is a power to detain, on an application for bail the FTT or an
immigration officer would have to determine <i>Hardial Singh</i> issues as a
jurisdictional matter. It is submitted that Parliament could not have intended
the FTT or immigration officers to engage in such an exercise which is
difficult enough in a case of actual detention but which would be much more
difficult or even logically impossible in the hypothetical context required by
this reading of paragraphs 22 and 29. As a result bail applications could
require “two or three days of <i>Hardial Singh</i> enquiry simply to decide
whether there is jurisdiction to grant bail”. Here Mr Tam further submits that
the FTT does not have jurisdiction to decide whether detention is lawful. (See <i>Konan</i>
at para 30 and <i>WL (Congo)</i> at para 118.) I consider that there is little
or no substance in these contentions for the following reasons:</a></p><a name="para41">

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(1)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is unlikely that an applicant for bail will seek to challenge the
jurisdiction of the FTT to grant bail. Similarly, the Secretary of State is
unlikely to maintain that an applicant’s detention is unlawful. I accept,
however, that, as it is a matter of jurisdiction, there may be cases in which
the FTT should properly take the point of its own motion.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(2)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The power to grant bail is expressly conferred on the FTT or a Chief
Immigration Officer by paragraphs 22 and 29 of Schedule 2. If an issue as to
the legality of detention were to arise on a bail application, it would fall to
be addressed in that context. If the judge concluded that detention was
unlawful, the Secretary of State could be expected to direct release of the
applicant on temporary admission. If she maintained the view that detention was
lawful, the matter could be raised urgently in the Administrative Court. I note
that, in the context of SIAC, where an applicant puts the legality of his
detention in issue, concurrent judicial review proceedings can be lodged and
the Chair of SIAC is able to exercise the jurisdiction of the Administrative
Court. That is, in fact, what occurred in the present case.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm"><a name="para41">(3)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The FTT is clearly entitled to address the <i>Hardial Singh</i>
principles. Consideration on a bail application of whether detention was lawful
would not, in any event, require the FTT to depart significantly from what is
currently required of it. The current guidance (Bail Guidance for Immigration
Judges Presiding over Immigration and Asylum Hearing, Presidential Note 1 of
2012, Judge Michael Clements, 11 June 2012 at paras 5,17 and 18) recognises
that the lawfulness of detention may be a relevant factor in bail proceedings,
as has the High Court in the SIAC jurisdiction (<i>R (Othman) v SIAC</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2012/2349.html">[2012] EWHC 2349 (Admin)</a>).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para42">42.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Secondly, the Secretary of State submits that it appears from the
statutory scheme that the grant of bail was intended to be an exercise
conducted by relatively junior immigration officers or even by police officers
with less specialist immigration experience and that, accordingly, it is very
unlikely that Parliament intended that the lawfulness of detention should be
investigated before the grant of bail. This is equally unconvincing. So far as
the capabilities of immigration officers are concerned, I agree with the
observations of Lord Dyson MR (at para 35). Immigration officers are charged by
Parliament with taking many difficult decisions, which require care, individual
consideration and the exercise of judgement and which may involve fact finding.
These decisions are of enormous consequence to the lives of the persons
concerned. In particular, in considering whether to grant temporary admission
an immigration officer may have to consider whether a person is “liable to
detention” under paragraph 21. Contrary to the submission of Mr Tam, I cannot
see that application of the <i>Khadir</i> test of “some prospect” of the
individual’s removal is a significantly less complex exercise than the
application of the <i>Hardial</i> <i>Singh</i> principles.</a></p><a name="para42">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para42"></a><a name="para43">43.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Thirdly, the Secretary of State submits that an arrest by a police officer
for an actual or apprehended breach of bail would require the officer to
consider the <i>Hardial Singh</i> principles and assess whether the prescribed
limit of a power to detain had been reached. However, the power of arrest
conferred by paragraph 24(1)(a) is exercisable by a police officer “if he has
reasonable grounds for believing that that person is likely to break the
condition of his recognizance or bail bond”. Unlike the power to order
re-detention in paragraph 24(3), it does not depend on a continuing power to
exercise immigration detention.</a></p><a name="para43">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para43"></a><a name="para44">44.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Fourthly, the Secretary of State points to the consequences which might
follow if detention were unlawful on other grounds. Here, particular reliance
is placed on <i>WL (Congo)</i>, where detention was unlawful because it was
based on an unpublished policy which conflicted with a published policy, and on
<i>R (SK (Zimbabwe)) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2011/23.html">[2011] UKSC 23</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2011/23.html">[2011] 1 WLR 1299</a>, where detention was unlawful because of missed
detention reviews required by a published policy. It is said that it would be
absurd if there were no power to grant bail in such circumstances. In my view,
there is no absurdity here. Once detention had been authorised on a lawful
basis there would be power to grant bail.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para45">45.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, I consider that the spectre of impracticability conjured up
by Mr Tam is illusory and does not cast any doubt on my reading of paragraphs
22 and 29. There is no reason to conclude that Parliament must have intended to
confer a power to grant bail where a person is detained unlawfully. On the
contrary, I have no doubt that the statutory provisions with which we are
concerned require a lawful power to detain as a pre-condition to a grant of
bail. In any event, if administrative inconvenience is a consequence the remedy
lies with Parliament.</a></p><a name="para45">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para45"></a><a name="para46">46.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For these reasons I agree with the conclusion of Lord Dyson MR that bail
may not be granted under paragraphs 22 and 29 of Schedule 2 where a person is
unlawfully detained purportedly under paragraph 2(2) of Schedule 3 to the 1971
Act or where a person not currently in detention could not lawfully be detained
under that provision.</a></p><a name="para46">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para46"></a><a name="para47">47.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In his judgment in the Court of Appeal in the present case, Lord Dyson
MR, having arrived at the conclusion that the word “detained” in paragraphs 22
and 29 of Schedule 2 should be construed as meaning “lawfully detained”,
advanced a further, independent basis for his conclusion, namely that the power
to grant bail presupposes the existence of and the ability to exercise the
power to detain lawfully. In support of this conclusion he drew attention to <i>Mitchell
v Mitchinham</i> (1823) 2 D &amp; R 722 and <i>In re Amand</i> [1941] 2 KB 239
which, he observed, demonstrate that the writ of habeas corpus can still issue
where a person is on bail.</a></p><a name="para47">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para47"></a><a name="para48">48.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As a matter of legal instinct, the proposition that the ability to
exercise a lawful power to detain is a precondition to a power to grant bail
seems entirely sound. Not only does it seem correct as a matter of principle,
but also the lack of a lawful power to detain is likely, without more, to give
rise to practical difficulties. As I have explained earlier in this judgment,
that would, in my view, be the position in relation to immigration bail if the
Secretary of State’s submissions were accepted in the present case. Although we
have been referred on this appeal to a number of authorities relating to the
scope and availability of habeas corpus, including those referred to by Lord
Dyson MR, I have not found these decisions of any great assistance.
Nevertheless, there is a considerable body of modern authority which supports
Lord Dyson’s statement of principle.</a></p><a name="para48">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Stellato v Ministry of Justice</i>
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2010/1435.html">[2011] QB 856</a> is strongly supportive of this approach. The claimant having been
released on licence from a prison sentence refused to comply with the
conditions of his licence on the ground that he was entitled to be released
unconditionally. He was returned to prison. A Divisional Court of the Queen’s
Bench Division dismissed his claim for judicial review. His appeal was allowed
by the Court of Appeal which granted a declaration that he was entitled to
immediate release but stayed the declaration to permit a petition to the House
of Lords and granted him conditional bail. He refused to comply with the bail
conditions and, as a result, was arrested and returned to prison pursuant to an
order of a Lord Justice who, the next day, ordered that his bail be revoked and
that he remain in custody until the end of the stay granted by the Court of
Appeal. Following the dismissal by the House of Lords of the Home Office’s
appeal, he was released unconditionally and he then brought an action for false
imprisonment and breach of his rights under article 5 ECHR against the Ministry
of Justice as successor to the Home Office. In those proceedings the question
arose whether the stay or the breach of bail conditions provided legal
authority for his detention. The Court of Appeal (Maurice Kay, Stanley Burnton
and Patten LJJ) held that they did not. Stanley Burnton LJ explained (at para
21) that the only authority for the continued detention was the original
sentence of imprisonment and the legislation which was the subject of the
court’s judgment. He continued:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“23.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning to the effect of
the orders of Hughes LJ, I consider that the answer is to be found in the
nature of a grant of bail. In principle, a grant of bail is not an order for
the detention of the person to whom it is granted. To the contrary, it is a
grant of liberty to someone who would otherwise be detained. The legal
justification for his detention is to be found elsewhere: in the case of a
person suspected of crime, in the powers of arrest of a constable under a warrant
issued by a magistrates’ court (see <a href="https://login.westlaw.co.uk/maf/wluk/app/document?src=doc&amp;linktype=ref&amp;context=18&amp;crumb-action=replace&amp;docguid=IDF57CDF0E44911DA8D70A0E70A78ED65"><span style="color:windowtext;text-decoration:none">section 1 of the Magistrates’

Criminal Evidence Act 1984</span></a>), and powers to remand pending trial or
further hearing. Similarly, there is statutory authority for detention in
immigration cases: see, for example, <a href="https://login.westlaw.co.uk/maf/wluk/app/document?src=doc&amp;linktype=ref&amp;context=18&amp;crumb-action=replace&amp;docguid=I0E0CB3F0E44911DA8D70A0E70A78ED65"><span style="color:windowtext;text-decoration:none">paragraph 16 of Schedule 2 to,
and paragraph 2 of Schedule 3 to, the Immigration Act 1971</span></a>.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">24.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A grant of bail may be
conditional or unconditional. A condition of bail does not impose an obligation
on the person granted bail. It is a true condition. It qualifies the grant of
liberty made by the grant of bail. If the person granted bail does not comply
with the conditions of his bail, he is liable to be returned to custody. If so,
the legal authority for his detention is not the grant of bail, or his breach
of the conditions of his bail, but the authority for his detention apart from
the order for bail. All that his breach of the conditions of his bail does is
to disentitle him to bail.”</p>

Department</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2010/1678.html">[2010] EWHC 1678 (Admin)</a>. On this basis, he submits that the
Secretary of State’s contention in the present proceedings is the
conventionally accepted approach to the question of bail and that this includes
the imposition of bail conditions as an alternative to detention after actual
detention has become unlawful for <i>Hardial Singh</i> reasons. The difficulty
with this submission, however, is that in these first instance decisions, which
include one of my own, the power to grant bail appears to have been assumed
without the present issue having been directly addressed.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Nevertheless, the notion that the power to grant bail presupposes the
existence and the ability to exercise a power to detain lawfully is not necessarily
a principle of universal application. While the clearest possible words would
be required to achieve a contrary result, Parliament could do so. It would be a
question of construction in each case whether that result had been achieved.
Thus in <i>Stellato</i> Stanley Burnton LJ observed (at para 25) that the
general principles which he had set out in paragraphs 23 and 24 (quoted above)
are subject to any statutory provision. Moreover, following a suggestion by
Lord Hughes during the course of argument on this appeal, it became apparent
that the provisions governing police bail in sections 34, 37 and 41, Police and
Criminal Evidence Act 1984 may be exceptions to the general principle stated by
the Court of Appeal. In this regard, I also draw attention to section 61,
Immigration Act 2016.</a></p><a name="para53">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In view of such possible statutory inroads into the principle stated by
the Court of Appeal, I prefer to found my conclusions in the present case on
the interpretation of the provisions of Schedule 2.</a></p><a name="para54">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para54"></a><a name="para55">55.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the present case it is common ground that B could not lawfully be
detained following the ruling of SIAC on 13 February 2014 that there was “no
reasonable prospect of removing [B] to Algeria and thus the ordinary legal
basis for justified detention of B under the Immigration Acts has fallen away”.
Furthermore, it has not been suggested that this is a case in which, on the
application of <i>Hardial Singh</i> principles, a lawful power of detention
subsequently revived as a result of a change of circumstances. In these
circumstances I conclude, for the reasons set out above, that in the absence of
a power of lawful detention there was no power to grant bail to B pursuant to paragraph
22 of Schedule 2 to the 1971 Act.</a></p><a name="para55">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In these circumstances I do not consider it necessary to address the arguments
which we have heard on article 5 ECHR which, in my view, adds nothing to the
resolution of the issues before the court on this appeal.</a></p><a name="para56">
