<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The respondent (“VWFS”) is a member of the Volkswagen Group, and is used
(through its “retail” sector) to provide hire purchase (“HP”) finance for the
sale of vehicles manufactured by the group. When a customer of a VW dealership
wishes to purchase a vehicle using finance from VWFS, the vehicle is acquired
by VWFS as part of the finance arrangements from the dealer and then supplied
by it to the customer on deferred payment terms under an HP contract. The
vehicles are sold on to the customer at the same price as they are purchased
from the dealer.</a></p><a name="para1">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1"></a><a name="para2">2.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This appeal is concerned with the treatment of general business
overheads, not directly attributable to particular supplies. The legal and
factual background is set out in detail in the judgment of Patten LJ and need
not be repeated. As he explained the issue arises in the context of a so-called
“partial exemption special method” (“PESM”) agreed with HMRC for the valuation
of the proportion of residual input tax attributable to HP transactions. The
issue is whether any of the residual input tax paid by VWFS in respect of such
general overheads (so far as apportioned to the retail sector) is deductible
against the output tax paid on the taxable supply of vehicles to customers.
HMRC’s primary contention is that the overheads are all attributable to the
exempt supplies of finance and the input tax is therefore irrecoverable. VWFS
contends that the residual input tax should be split in proportion to the ratio
of taxable transactions to the whole, which has the effect of splitting the residual
input tax 50/50 for HP transactions. That issue was decided in favour of VWFS
by the First-tier Tribunal (“FTT”), and by the Court of Appeal, although the Upper
Tribunal had supported HMRC’s approach.</a></p><a name="para2">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2"></a><a name="para3">3.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>That remains the main issue in the appeal, but is one on which the court
has decided that a reference to the CJEU is necessary to reach a conclusion.
The present judgment is concerned with a secondary issue. Mr Thomas argues that
HMRC had a fall-back position on the amount of the apportionment, which the FTT
had failed to consider. As Patten LJ explained:</a></p><a name="para3">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… The First-tier Tribunal proceeded
on the basis that the only dispute about methodology was whether any part of
the residual input tax was attributable to and could be set-off against the
taxable supplies of vehicles made in the retail sector of VWFS’s business. But
HMRC contend that they did challenge the apportionment formula contained in the
proposed PESM on wider grounds and that a lower figure than 50% should be
attributed to the taxable supplies of vehicles as part of the hire purchase
contracts in terms of the use made of the allocated inputs.” (para 13)</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para3"></a><a name="para4">4.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Patten LJ expressed some surprise (which I share) that, in an appeal
where both sides were represented by experienced counsel, such an issue had not
been capable of resolution by agreement between them, or by reference to their
written submissions or notes of the hearing. However, the court had been asked
to resolve the issue on the available material. That included:</a></p><a name="para4">

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">i)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>HMRC’s skeleton argument before the tribunal which had described the
issue as being whether VWFS’ method “produces a fair and reasonable
attribution” of residual input tax in the retail sector, but without putting
forward a positive alternative to HMRC’s preferred methodology, or suggesting a
different apportionment.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">ii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>HMRC had relied upon two witness statements made by Mr Jonathan Cannon,
the second of which commented on the differences between the two approaches. He
observed that VWFS’s approach was “realistic, perhaps more so than the HMRC’s
approach”, but was open to two particular concerns, which he identified. Again
he did not put forward an alternative apportionment.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">iii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Judge Berner’s notes of the hearing recorded the following submission
made by Mr Thomas:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“[The] value of the car does not
bear on the use of overheads. What [VWFS] says is [that] if [that is done] it
would be 80%, but 50% is fair. But why? The appellant does not say. 50% is an
arbitrary selection of a figure. No analysis has been put forward. [This] comes
from the weighting exercise. HP contracts [are] treated as two transactions.
[It is] wholly unexplained as [to] why it is fair to treat HP [transactions]
1:1. Why not another fraction?”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para4"></a><a name="para5">5.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Upper Tribunal (para 103) saw this extract as supporting Mr Thomas’s
submission that he had asked the FTT to consider in the alternative whether a
lesser figure than 50% should have been attributed to the taxable supplies.
Patten LJ thought otherwise:</a></p><a name="para5">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“But my own reading of the judge’s
notes on these issues is that Mr Thomas was challenging the basis of the 50%
attribution as arbitrary in the context, as Ms Shaw has submitted, of an
argument that any attribution was impermissible. HMRC did not rely upon some
alternative methodology which attributed to the use of the residual inputs by the
taxable supply of vehicles a figure somewhere between 1% and 50%. I do not see
how this court is in the position to gainsay Judge Berner’s understanding of
the parties’ position on the appeals which the FTT heard and none of the
materials we have been asked to look at demonstrate that the FTT misunderstood
HMRC’s case.” (para 71)</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para5"></a><a name="para6">6.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In this court Mr Thomas submits that the Court of Appeal failed to take
account of the nature of the appeal to the tribunal, which allows the FTT to
consider both issues of principle and the amount of the assessment. He relies
on words of mine in <i>Pegasus Birds Ltd v Revenue and Customs and Excise Comrs</i>
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2004/1015.html">[2004] EWCA Civ 1015</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2004/1015.html">[2004] STC 1509</a>:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The Tribunal should remember that
its primary task is to find the correct amount of tax, so far as possible on
the material properly available to it, the burden resting on the taxpayer. In
all but very exceptional cases, that should be the focus of the hearing …”
(para 38(i))</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">He relies also on <i>Banbury Visionplus Ltd v Her Majesty’s
Revenue and Customs</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2006/1024.html">[2006] EWHC 1024</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2006/1024.html">[2006] STC 1568</a> para 48, where in a
similar context to the present Etherton J held that there was nothing to
exclude the jurisdiction of the tribunal to decide whether a particular method
would achieve the statutory objective. Miss Shaw submits that those cases do
not detract from the general principle that proceedings before the tribunal are
not inquisitorial in nature; it is no part of the tribunal’s role to undertake
a roving review of the dispute of its own motion. She relies on comments of
Forbes J as to the adversarial nature of proceedings before the former VAT
Tribunal (<i>Tynewydd Labour Working Men’s Club and Institute Ltd v Customs and
Excise Comrs</i> [1979] STC 570, 580).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para7">7.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In my view, this issue does not require examination of general questions
about the tribunal’s role. One of the strengths of the new tribunal system is
the flexibility of its procedures, which need to be and can be adapted to a
wide range of types of case and of litigant. In some areas, particularly those
involving litigants in person, a more inquisitorial role may be appropriate.
However, when the tribunal as here is dealing with substantial litigants,
represented by experienced counsel, it is entitled to assume that the parties
will have identified with some care what they regard as relevant issues for
decision. My comments in <i>Pegasus Birds </i>should not be taken as indicating
anything different. They were not of general application, but intended (as the
following words made clear) to discourage undue attention to the Commissioner’s
original exercise of “best judgment”, as opposed to the correctness of the
result.</a></p><a name="para7">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Like Patten LJ, I would attach particular importance to the tribunal’s
understanding of the issue before it. This is apparent from the tribunal’s own
introduction to the detailed discussion. Having described the main issue, the
tribunal continued:</a></p><a name="para8">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“That is the full extent of the
dispute. Other aspects of what amounts to a fair and reasonable attribution,
such as ease of audit and operation, are not at issue. Nor, <i>although the
Tribunal itself asked for clarification</i>, is the 50/50 weighting that VWFS
proposes as between the taxable supplies of the vehicle and the exempt supplies
of finance under the HP agreements. The evidence of Mr Cannan for HMRC shows that
the weighting is accepted as realistic; indeed he concedes that it may be more
realistic than that adopted by HMRC’s method. The dispute is not on the
weighting, but on whether any part of the residual input tax should be
attributed at all to the taxable supply of the vehicle.” (para 41, emphasis
added)</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para8"></a><a name="para9">9.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I agree with Patten LJ that we have no material which could justify
going behind that clear statement of the position as the tribunal understood
it, having itself apparently sought clarification. Mr Thomas says that he has
no recollection of such a request. However, if there was any doubt about that,
the time to have dealt with it was when the decision was received. If the
tribunal was thought to have misunderstood HMRC’s position, and failed to deal
with a significant issue, the matter could have been raised with them and
sorted out then and there, at a time when it was fresh in the minds of all
involved. As it is the tribunal’s understanding seems to me entirely consistent
with the lack of any specific reference to this issue in their written
submissions or the evidence of their witness. I agree with Patten LJ that the
passing reference in the note of cross-examination adds nothing.</a></p><a name="para9">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For these reasons, in agreement with the Court of Appeal, I would
dismiss this ground of appeal.</a></p><a name="para10">
