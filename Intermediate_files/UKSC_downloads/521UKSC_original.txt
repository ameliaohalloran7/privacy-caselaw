<p class="NewSpeech">LORD REED: (<span style="text-transform:none">with whom Lord
Neuberger, Lord Mance, Lord Carnwath and Lord Hodge agree)</span></p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1">1.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This appeal arises out of the payment of value added tax which was not
due, because the supplies in question were exempt from VAT under the relevant
EU directive. At the time of the payment, however, the supplies were treated as
taxable by the UK’s VAT legislation, which had incorrectly transposed the
directive, and were mistakenly believed to be taxable by the customer who paid
an amount charged in respect of the tax, the supplier who received that amount,
and the Commissioners to whom the supplier accounted for the tax. As the corollary
of the supplies being believed to be taxable, the supplier and the
Commissioners also believed that the supplier was entitled to deduct from the
tax chargeable on its supplies to customers the tax which it had itself paid on
taxable supplies received for the purposes of its business. It therefore
accounted to the Commissioners for the tax chargeable on its supplies during
each accounting period on the basis that it could deduct and retain the amount
of the tax which it had paid to its own suppliers, and it paid the
Commissioners only the remaining surplus, if any.</a></p><a name="para1">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1"></a><a name="para2">2.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In that situation, does the customer have a common law claim against the
Commissioners for restitution, or is he confined to a claim against the
supplier? If he has a claim against the Commissioners, is it for the entire
amount which he paid to the supplier, or only for the amount, if any, which the
Commissioners received from the supplier? Does it make a difference if any
claim for restitution by the supplier against the Commissioners is time-barred?
Does it make a difference if there is a statutory scheme under which the
customer can obtain reimbursement of the amount which the supplier paid to the
Commissioners, but not of any amount which was retained by the supplier?
Furthermore, if the statutory scheme has the effect of excluding a common law
claim by the customer against the Commissioners, is that compatible with EU
law? These are the principal issues which the court has to decide.</a></p><a name="para2">

<p class="ParaHeading">The factual background</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2"></a><a name="para3">3.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The claimants are investment trust companies (“ITCs”). They are
“closed-ended” investment funds constituted as limited companies: that is to
say, the companies were established with a fixed number of issued shares and a
term date when the company would be wound up and the assets distributed to the
shareholders. They have now reached their term dates and are in winding up. The
claims of three of the ITCs (“the Lead Claimants”) have been taken forward as
lead claims while the others are stayed to await the outcome of these
proceedings. The Lead Claimants are Kleinwort Overseas Investment Trust plc,
F&amp;C Income Growth Investment Trust plc, and M&amp;G Recovery Investment
Trust plc. They will be referred to respectively as the Kleinwort Trust, the
F&amp;C Trust and the M&amp;G Trust.</a></p><a name="para3">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para3"></a><a name="para4">4.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Between 1992 and 2002 the Lead Claimants received supplies of investment
management services from their investment managers (“the Managers”). Those were
respectively Kleinwort Benson Investment Management Ltd, F&amp;C Asset
Management Ltd and M&amp;G Investment Management Ltd. Their services were
rendered under contracts which provided for the Managers to be paid fees plus
VAT “if applicable” (or words to similar effect). Under the provisions of the
UK VAT legislation then in force, those services, unlike the other investment
management services provided by the Managers, did not qualify for exemption.
The Managers therefore charged VAT on the supplies of their services. The VAT
charges were separately identified on the VAT invoices issued to the Lead
Claimants, and the Lead Claimants paid the amounts charged.</a></p><a name="para4">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para4"></a><a name="para5">5.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Managers were obliged to account to the Commissioners for the VAT
due in respect of their chargeable supplies during each accounting period. It
is relevant to note that the obligation to account for tax arises whether or
not tax is charged on the supply or paid by the customer: it is the supplier,
rather than the customer, who is under a liability to the Commissioners, and it
is the supply, rather than payment by the customer, which triggers the
supplier’s liability. The customer’s liability to pay an amount in respect of
the tax rests upon contract. The Managers’ obligation to account for the tax
due did not, however, mean that they were obliged to pay the Commissioners the
whole of, or indeed any part of, the sums they received from the Lead
Claimants. Under general principles of VAT law, they were entitled to deduct
from the tax chargeable in respect of any taxable supplies they had made, known
as output tax, the tax chargeable in respect of any taxable supplies which they
had received for the purpose of their business of making taxable supplies,
known as input tax.</a></p><a name="para5">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para5"></a><a name="para6">6.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It therefore followed from the legislative treatment of the services
supplied to the Lead Claimants as taxable, that the Managers were understood to
be entitled to pay to the Commissioners only the surplus of their output tax
over their input tax, and to retain the balance of the output tax in their own
hands. If the input tax exceeded the output tax, they were entitled to a
credit, which could be paid by the Commissioners or carried forward to later
accounting periods. Thus, for example, if a Manager made taxable supplies to an
ITC, and the VAT chargeable on those supplies was £100, then the Manager was
bound to account to the Commissioners for £100. If the Manager had purchased
taxable supplies during the relevant period on which the VAT was £25, the
Manager was entitled to credit for that £25, and was required to pay the
Commissioners only the balance of £75.</a></p><a name="para6">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para6"></a><a name="para7">7.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It was also possible for an ITC to be registered for VAT (if it invested
in securities outside the EU), and in that event to recover, as input tax, some
of the VAT which it had paid to its Manager. The F&amp;C Trust and the M&amp;G
Trust made no such supplies, but the Kleinwort Trust did, and recovered 58.4%
of the VAT charged by its Manager (that being the percentage of its portfolio
which was invested outside the EU). Its claim against the Commissioners has
therefore been adjusted to take account of the sums which it has already
recovered as input tax: rather than claiming every £100 which it paid to its
Manager in respect of VAT, it claims £41.60, being the difference between the
£100 and the £58.40 which it recovered as input tax.</a></p><a name="para7">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para7"></a><a name="para8">8.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The essential pattern was therefore as follows:</a></p><a name="para8">

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">1.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Managers supplied investment management services to the Lead
Claimants under contracts providing for the payment of fees plus VAT if
applicable.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">2.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Managers charged the Lead Claimants VAT on the supply of those
services, and included the VAT charges on the invoices which they issued to the
Lead Claimants.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">3.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Lead Claimants paid the invoices. They might or might not be able to
recover some of the VAT as input tax.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">4.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Managers made periodic VAT returns in which they:</p>

<p class="ParaLevel3" style="margin-left:70.9pt;text-indent:0cm">(i)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>accounted for the VAT chargeable on their supplies of investment
management services as output tax;</p>

<p class="ParaLevel3" style="margin-left:70.9pt;text-indent:0cm">(ii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>deducted as input tax the VAT which they had paid to third parties for
supplies received in the course of their business; and</p>

<p class="ParaLevel3" style="margin-left:70.9pt;text-indent:0cm">(iii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>paid the difference between their output tax and input tax to the
Commissioners.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para8"></a><a name="para9">9.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It transpired that the supplies of the investment management services
were exempt from VAT under article 13B(d)(6) of the Sixth VAT Directive
(77/388/EEC). That was established by the European Court of Justice in <i>JP
Morgan Fleming Claverhouse</i> <i>Investment Trust plc </i><i>v</i> <i>Revenue
and Customs Comrs </i>(Case C-363/05) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2007/C36305.html">[2007] ECR I-5517</a><i>. </i>Although the UK
failed to transpose article 13B(d)(6) correctly into national legislation until
1 October 2008<i>, </i>it had direct effect at all material times. It is
therefore common ground between the parties that the Lead Claimants paid the
Managers the amounts they did in respect of VAT, and that the Managers
accounted for VAT to the Commissioners, under a mistake of law.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">The Managers’ claims against the Commissioners</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para10">10.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In early 2004, when the <i>Claverhouse </i>litigation began and was
publicised, the Managers of the F&amp;C Trust and the M&amp;G Trust made claims
to the Commissioners under section 80 of the Value Added Tax Act 1994 for
refunds in respect of VAT accounting periods from 2001 to 2004. It will be
necessary to return to section 80, the material provisions of which are set out
in para 75 below. Claims were not made in relation to earlier accounting
periods because of the three year limitation period imposed by section 80(4).
For the same reason, no claim was made by the Managers of the Kleinwort Trust,
which had gone into winding up in 1998. Following the <i>Claverhouse </i>judgment,
the Commissioners allowed the claims and repaid the relevant amounts (as will
be explained shortly) to the Managers, with interest. In accordance with section
80, and regulations made pursuant to section 80A, the Commissioners required
the Managers to enter into approved “reimbursement arrangements” with the Lead
Claimants, so that the refunded VAT and interest were passed on by the Managers
to them.</a></p><a name="para10">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para10"></a><a name="para11">11.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, the decision of the House of Lords in <i>Fleming (trading
as Bodycraft) </i><i>v</i> <i>Revenue and Customs Comrs </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/2.html">[2008] UKHL 2</a>;
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/2.html">[2008] 1 WLR 195</a><i> </i>established that the retrospective manner in which the
three year limitation period had been introduced (by an amendment to the 1994
Act, effected by the Finance Act 1997, which reduced the previous period) was
incompatible with EU law, and that the time bar had to be disapplied in respect
of rights which had accrued before it came into effect on 4 December 1996. The
Managers then made further claims in respect of accounting periods ending
before that date. These claims were again allowed, with interest, and the
appropriate repayments were made to the Managers, who in turn passed them on to
the Lead Claimants.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para12">12.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As a result of these arrangements, the Lead Claimants were refunded the
VAT which they had paid to the Managers, subject to two exceptions. First, the
Managers were unable to make claims in respect of accounting periods ending on
or after 4 December 1996 which were time barred under section 80(4). In
practice, that meant that claims could not be made by the Managers of the
Kleinwort Trust in relation to accounting periods ending between 4 December
1996 and 20 March 1998, when the Kleinwort Trust went into liquidation. The
corresponding periods in relation to the F&amp;C Trust and the M&amp;G Trust
ended on 6 and 1 April 2001 respectively. Those periods have been referred to
in these proceedings as the “dead periods”. It is common ground that the
limitation period in section 80(4) is compatible with EU law.</a></p><a name="para12">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para12"></a><a name="para13">13.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Secondly, the amounts repaid to the Managers were calculated on the
basis that, under section 80(2A), it was necessary to set against the output
tax for which they had accounted, the amount of the input tax which they had
deducted. It is a matter of agreement that that was the correct approach to the
application of section 80. In the illustrative example given in para 6 above,
that means that the Managers were entitled to repayment of the £75 which they
had paid to the Commissioners, but not of the £25 which they had retained in
their own hands.</a></p><a name="para13">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para13"></a><a name="para14">14.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is a matter of agreement that, although the Managers were only
entitled under section 80 to reimbursement of the notional £75, the
Commissioners could have made the refunds conditional on the Managers’
undertaking to repay to the Lead Claimants the full amount which they had been
mistakenly charged (ie, the notional £100). It is agreed that the Commissioners
did not do so because they accepted the Managers’ assertion that, if they had
known that the input tax was non-deductible, they would have passed on that
cost to the Lead Claimants by charging a higher price for their services. In
the present proceedings, however, it is accepted that that assertion was
erroneous: had the true position been known, the Managers would not<i> </i>have
sought to increase the price of their services to the Lead Claimants. Instead,
as Henderson J found after trial, they would have absorbed the input tax as a
business expense. In the event, the notional £25 was later refunded to the
Kleinwort Trust and the F&amp;C Trust by their respective Managers, but it was
not refunded to the M&amp;G Trust.</a></p><a name="para14">

<p class="ParaHeading">The proceedings below</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para14"></a><a name="para15">15.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The ITCs brought proceedings against the Commissioners in which they
sought payment of the amounts which had been paid by them to their managers, to
the extent that they had not been recovered under the statutory scheme
established by section 80 or otherwise: in other words, the amounts which the
managers could not claim because any claim would be time-barred, and the
amounts which the managers had not paid to the Commissioners but had retained
and set against input tax (unless those amounts had been refunded to the ITC in
question by its manager). The ITCs’ claims were based on unjust enrichment, or
alternatively on EU law.</a></p><a name="para15">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para15"></a><a name="para16">16.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The claims of the Lead Claimants proceeded to a trial on liability.
After trial, the judge held </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2012/458.html">[2012] EWHC 458 (Ch)</a>:</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">1.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>That, using the notional figures referred to above, the Commissioners
had been enriched in the full amount of £100, even if only £75 was paid to them
by a Manager after deducting £25 in respect of input tax paid to its own
suppliers. In the judge’s view, although the £25 was not paid to the
Commissioners, it was nevertheless used by the Commissioners to give the Managers
a credit for that input tax.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">2.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>That the Commissioners were enriched at the expense of the Lead
Claimants because, in economic terms, the person at whose expense the VAT was
paid was the customer. The enrichment was also unjust.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">3.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>That a cause of action in unjust enrichment was, however, excluded under
domestic law by section 80(7) of the 1994 Act, which protects the Commissioners
from liability other than as provided in that section.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">4.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>That the Lead Claimants had a directly effective right to repayment
against the Commissioners under EU law, which required a remedy to be made
available in respect of the full notional £100, not merely the £75.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">5.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>That EU law did not, on the other hand, require national law to give the
Lead Claimants any remedy in respect of amounts falling within the scope of the
time-bar imposed by section 80(4). Any EU-based claims would be subject (in
effect) to the same limitation period.</p>

held that the Lead Claimants had no <i>Woolwich </i>claim under English law for
unlawfully levied tax (ie a claim based on the principle established in <i>Woolwich
Equitable Building Society v Inland Revenue Comrs </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1992/TC_65_265.html">[1993] AC 70</a>), and that
EU law required section 80(7) to be disapplied, so as to permit a mistake-based
restitutionary claim. It is unnecessary to consider the <i>Woolwich </i>issue
further, as the point has not been pursued in the present appeal.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the light of these conclusions, the judge gave judgment for the
M&amp;G Trust in respect of the notional £25 (defined as the difference between
the amounts paid by the M&amp;G Trust to its Manager as VAT and the amount of
the refunds it received from its Manager, and also as equalling the input tax
brought into account by its Manager) for periods outside the dead period, and
dismissed the claims in relation to the dead periods (the dead period in
relation to each claimant being the period for which its Manager was unable,
for reasons of limitation, to make a claim under section 80).</a></p><a name="para18">

that the judge was wrong to conclude (i) that a cause of action in unjust
enrichment against the Commissioners was excluded by section 80(7) of the 1994
Act, and (ii) that the Lead Claimants had no claim under EU law to VAT paid in
respect of the dead periods. The Commissioners also appealed against the first
judgment on the ground that the judge was wrong to conclude that the M&amp;G
Trust had a directly effective EU law right to recover from the Commissioners
the £25 element of its claim for accounting periods outside the dead period,
and they appealed against the second judgment<i> </i>on the ground that the
judge had erred in holding that section 80(7) was to be disapplied.</a></p><a name="para19">

against the Managers alone.</p>

</span>In this appeal by the Commissioners against the decision of the Court of
Appeal (in respect of the notional £75 paid in respect of dead periods), and
cross-appeal by the Lead Claimants (in respect of the notional £25), there are
three key questions. First, did the Lead Claimants have a common law claim
against the Commissioners in principle, subject to any statutory exclusion of
such a claim? Secondly, if so, did section 80 of the 1994 Act bar such a claim?
Thirdly, if the Lead Claimants have no claim against the Commissioners, either
because no such claim is recognised at common law or because a common law claim
is barred by section 80, is that compatible with EU law?</a></p><a name="para22">

<p class="ParaHeading">The common law claim</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Lead Claimants argue that customers who pay undue VAT charged by
their supplier have a claim against the Commissioners based on unjust
enrichment, unless such a claim is excluded by statute. The first question is
whether that is correct. If not, that in itself provides an answer to the

</span>In answering the question, both parties followed the approach adopted by
Lord Steyn in <i>Banque Financière de la Cité v Parc (Battersea) Ltd </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1998/7.html">[1999] 1 AC 221</a>, 227, and asked:</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There is no dispute that the Commissioners were enriched to the extent
of the notional £75. What is in dispute is whether they were also enriched to
the extent of the notional £25 which they did not receive. The judge held that
they were. Although the £25 was not paid to the Commissioners by the Managers,
it enriched the Commissioners, in his view, by being set against the input tax
which the Commissioners would otherwise have been obliged to pay or credit to
the Managers: that is to say, the tax which the Managers had paid on the goods
and services supplied to them for the purposes of their business of supplying
investment services.</a></p><a name="para25">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeal considered this reasoning to be fallacious on the
basis that if the supply of services by the Managers was not taxable, then the
Managers had no right to deduct as input tax the VAT which they had paid to
their own suppliers. The Managers retained the notional £25 in satisfaction of
what the court regarded as a purported obligation, on the part of the
Commissioners, which never existed. The Commissioners did not, therefore,
benefit from the Lead Claimants’ payment of the notional £25. An order
compelling them to pay that amount to the Lead Claimants would not reverse an
enrichment but leave them worse off, having received £75 and made “restitution”
of £100. Any claim to restitution of the £25 should therefore have been
directed against the Managers.</a></p><a name="para26">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In this appeal, counsel for the Lead Claimants argued that when the £25
was paid to the Managers, the position under the applicable UK legislation was
that the Managers were entitled to deduct their input tax in satisfaction of an
obligation owed to them by the Commissioners. They continued to be entitled to
account to the Commissioners for VAT, notwithstanding that it was not lawfully
due under EU law, and therefore remained entitled to claim reimbursement in
respect of input tax, until the position under UK law was changed: <i>Becker v
Finanzamt Münster-Innenstadt </i>(Case C-8/81) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1982/R881.html">[1982] ECR 53</a>; <i>VDP Dental

argument that a domestic levy which was incompatible with EU law was to be
treated as having never existed: <i>Ministero delle Finanze v IN CO GE’90 Srl </i>(Joined

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I am unable to accept this argument. The case of <i>Ministero delle
Finanze v IN CO GE’90 Srl</i> merely establishes that national legislation
which is incompatible with EU law, although inapplicable in so far as it is
incompatible, is not a nullity for all purposes. The case concerned claims for
the repayment of a charge which had been levied under Italian legislation which
was inconsistent with EU law. A preliminary issue before the national court was
whether the claims fell within its jurisdiction: an issue which turned on
whether they were of a fiscal or a civil nature. The question which troubled
the national court was whether, in deciding that issue, it should treat the
national legislation as set aside in its entirety, or whether it could have
regard to the legislation for the purpose of characterising the nature of the
relationship between the parties at the time when the contested amounts were
paid. The Court of Justice held that, subject to compliance with the principles
of non-discrimination and effectiveness, the detailed rules which applied for
the repayment of a charge, and the classification for that purpose of the legal
relationship established when the charge was levied, were matters to be
determined under national law (para 26).</a></p><a name="para28">

</span>The cases of <i>Becker </i>and <i>VDP Dental Laboratory </i>are more
directly in point. In the former case, VAT had been levied under domestic law
in respect of services which were exempt under the relevant directive, and an
issue was raised as to the consequences of granting the exemption
retrospectively after the mistake was discovered. In the course of its
judgment, the Court of Justice stated that, by availing themselves of an
exemption from VAT, persons entitled to the exemption necessarily waived the
right to claim a deduction in respect of input tax (para 44). An analogous
conclusion was reached in the <i>VDP Dental Laboratory </i>case, where an exemption
provided for under national law was incompatible with the relevant VAT
directive. The court held that the taxable person was not entitled both to
benefit from the exemption and to exercise the right to deduct input tax (para
40). It follows from these authorities that the Managers could not both claim
reimbursement of the output tax which they had paid to the Commissioners, under
section 80 of the 1994 Act, on the basis that their supplies were exempt from
VAT, and simultaneously assert an entitlement to retain the amounts which they
had deducted as input tax, on the basis that their supplies were taxable.</a></p><a name="para29">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para29"></a><a name="para30">30.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Commissioners were not, therefore, enriched by the Managers’
retention of the notional £25, and the Managers have, in principle, no defence to
a claim by the Lead Claimants for the restitution of that amount. That
conclusion is as one would expect. The Lead Claimants’ claim to restitution
against the Commissioners proceeds on the basis that the supplies which they
received from the Managers were exempt from VAT. That being so, it would be
surprising if they could present that claim, in relation to the measure of
restitution, on a basis which was predicated on the supplies being taxable.</a></p><a name="para30">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para30"></a><a name="para31">31.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It follows that the Commissioners’ enrichment was only to the extent of
the notional £75.</a></p><a name="para31">

<p class="ParaHeading">Was the enrichment at the Lead Claimants’ expense?</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para31"></a><a name="para32">32.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There is no doubt that, in economic terms, the Commissioners were
enriched at the expense of the Lead Claimants. On the mistaken premise that the
supplies were taxable, the Lead Claimants were charged tax by the Managers, and
paid it to them in accordance with their contract. On the same premise, the
Managers were obliged to account to the Commissioners for the tax chargeable on
their supplies, and to pay them the output tax in respect of each accounting
period, after deducting their input tax. The net result of the mistake was that
the Lead Claimants were worse off by the amount of the Managers’ output tax,
and the Commissioners were better off to the extent that that amount exceeded
the Managers’ input tax.</a></p><a name="para32">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para32"></a><a name="para33">33.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As the judge noted, however, no payment was made by the Lead Claimants
to the Commissioners. Nor were the Managers simply a conduit or, in legal
terms, an agent for payment by the Lead Claimants to the Commissioners. The Lead
Claimants owed no money to the Commissioners. Furthermore, the payment of the
tax element of the invoices submitted by the Managers to the Lead Claimants was
not the cause of the payment of tax by the Managers to the Commissioners: as
explained earlier, the Managers were liable to account for tax to the
Commissioners once they had supplied the relevant services. As the judge found,
it could not be said that the tax would not have been paid but for the payments
by the Lead Claimants to the Managers. In these circumstances, it was argued,
the Lead Claimants’ remedy lay against the Managers, as the recipients of the
mistaken payments which they had made, leaving it to the Managers to recover
from the Commissioners any amount which they had mistakenly paid to them in
accordance with the legislation.</a></p><a name="para33">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para33"></a><a name="para34">34.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>After considering the limited guidance provided by the modern English
authorities, and English academic opinion, the judge concluded that, as a
general rule, a defendant was legally enriched at the expense of the person
from whom the benefit in question was directly received. There were, however,
exceptions to that general rule. Without attempting to be exhaustive, he listed
a number of relevant criteria for identifying such exceptions, which he derived
from the authorities: put shortly, the need for a close causal connection
between the payment (or other provision of a benefit) by the claimant and the
enrichment of the defendant, the need to avoid the risk of double recovery, the
need to avoid conflict with contracts between the parties, and the need to
distinguish between unjust enrichment and compensation or damages.</a></p><a name="para34">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para34"></a><a name="para35">35.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Applying that approach, he regarded the present case as exceptional.
First, to allow the Lead Claimants to recover from the Commissioners would not,
in his view, involve any risk of double recovery, as any claim against the
Managers would face a cast iron defence of change of position, since they had
accounted to the Commissioners for the entirety of the tax and retained no
benefit for themselves (this reasoning mistakenly presumed that the Managers
were entitled to retain the notional £25, as deductible input tax, and that the
notional £75 was irrecoverable by the Managers from the Commissioners).
Secondly, it would not undermine or conflict with the contract between the Lead
Claimants and the Managers, which had provided for the payment of VAT “if
applicable”. Thirdly, notwithstanding the absence of a strict causal connection
between the payments by the Lead Claimants and the enrichment of the Commissioners,
the nexus created by the VAT system between the consumer and the Commissioners
could, in his view, hardly be closer or stronger as a matter of commercial
reality. In that regard, the judge referred at para 49 to the statements of the
Court of Justice in <i>Elida Gibbs Ltd v Customs and Excise Comrs </i>(Case
C-317/94) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1996/C31794.html">[1996] ECR I-5339</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1996/C31794.html">[1997] QB 499</a>, that “the basic principle of the
VAT system is that it is intended to tax only the final consumer” (para 19),
and that the taxable persons “collect the tax on behalf of the tax authorities
and account for it to them” (para 22). In his view, cases concerned with
subrogation showed that the “at the expense of” requirement could be satisfied
by reference to “the underlying commercial reality of a transaction” (para 72).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para36">36.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>By the time this case came before the Court of Appeal, the approach
adopted by the judge had already been approved by that court in three
decisions: <i>Menelaou v Bank of Cyprus UK Ltd </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2013/1960.html">[2013] EWCA Civ 1960</a>, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2013/1960.html">[2014] 1 WLR 854</a>; <i>TFL Management Services Ltd v Lloyds TSB Bank plc </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2013/1415.html">[2013] EWCA Civ 1415</a>, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2013/1415.html">[2014] 1 WLR 2006</a>; and <i>Relfo Ltd v Varsani (No 2) </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2014/360.html">[2014] EWCA Civ 360</a>; [2015] BCLC 14. It was also endorsed by the Court of Appeal in the
present case. The court noted that the judge had been mistaken in thinking that
the Managers would have a defence to a direct claim by the Lead Claimants, so
far as the notional £25 was concerned. It nevertheless agreed with his
conclusion that, in the context of VAT, the final consumer who paid the tax had
a sufficient economic connection with the Commissioners to be able to say that
they had been enriched at his expense when the tax ought never to have been
imposed on the services which were supplied.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">General discussion</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para37">37.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Decisions concerning the question whether an enrichment was “at the
expense of” the claimant demonstrate uncertainty as to the approach which
should be adopted. Such tests as have been suggested have been too vague to
provide clarity. For example, in <i>Menelaou v Bank of Cyprus UK Ltd </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/66.html">[2015] UKSC 66</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/66.html">[2016] AC 176</a>, Lord Clarke of Stone-cum-Ebony said at para 27, with
the agreement of Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury, Lord Kerr of Tonaghmore and Lord
Wilson, that “the question in each case is whether there is a sufficient causal
connection, in the sense of a sufficient nexus or link, between the loss to the
bank and the benefit received by the defendant”. This leaves unanswered the
critical question, namely, what connection, nexus or link is sufficient? The
same can be said of Arden LJ’s statement in <i>Relfo </i>that there must be a
“sufficient link” (para 95), Floyd LJ’s reference in the same case to
“proximity” (para 110), and the Court of Appeal’s finding in the present case
that there was “a sufficient economic connection” (para 67).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para38">38.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It would be unwise to attempt in this appeal to arrive at a definitive
statement of the circumstances in which the enrichment of a defendant can be
said to be at the expense of the claimant. Nevertheless, in view of the
uncertainty which has resulted from the use of vague and generalised language,
this court has a responsibility to establish more precise criteria. Some
observations of a general nature should therefore be made, before turning to
the specific context in which the issue arises in the present case. It should
be said at the outset that these observations are concerned only with personal
claims, and not with proprietary claims.</a></p><a name="para38">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para38"></a><a name="para39">39.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>First, it is important, when dealing with personal claims based on
unjust enrichment, to bear in mind what was said by Lord Goff of Chieveley in <i>Lipkin
Gorman v Karpnale Ltd </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1988/12.html">[1991] 2 AC 548</a>, 578, when rejecting a submission
that, when dealing with a claim to restitution based on unjust enrichment, it
was for the court to consider the question of injustice or unfairness on broad
grounds, and that it should deny recovery if it thought that it would be unjust
or unfair to hold the defendant liable:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The recovery of money in
restitution is not, as a general rule, a matter of discretion for the court. A
claim to recover money at common law is made as a matter of right; and even
though the underlying principle of recovery is the principle of unjust
enrichment, nevertheless, where recovery is denied, it is denied on the basis
of legal principle.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">As Lord Steyn remarked in <i>Banque Financière, </i>unjust
enrichment ranks next to contract and tort as part of the law of obligations (p
227). A claim based on unjust enrichment does not create a judicial licence to
meet the perceived requirements of fairness on a case-by-case basis: legal
rights arising from unjust enrichment should be determined by rules of law
which are ascertainable and consistently applied. Without going as far as
Scrutton LJ, who described the legacy of <i>Moses v Macferlan </i><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1760/713.pdf">(1760) 2 Burr 1005</a> as “a history of well-meaning sloppiness of thought” (<i>Holt v Markham </i>[1923] 1 KB 504, 513), McLachlin J rightly cautioned against the “tendency … to view
the action for unjust enrichment as a device for doing whatever may seem fair
between the parties”: <i>Peter v Beblow </i>(1993) 1 SCR 980, 988.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para40">40.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Secondly, the adoption of the concept of unjust enrichment in the modern
law, as a unifying principle underlying a number of different types of claim,
does not provide the courts with a tabula rasa, entitling them to disregard or
distinguish all authorities pre-dating <i>Lipkin Gorman</i>. The point is
illustrated by the judgment of Floyd LJ in <i>TFL</i>, where the decision in <i>Ruabon
Steamship Co Ltd v London Assurance </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpAC/1899/53.html">[1900] AC 6</a> was put to one side on the
basis that “the House of Lords … was not looking at the case through the eyes
of the modern law of unjust enrichment” (para 39). Although judicial reasoning
based on modern theories of unjust enrichment is in some respects relatively
novel, there are centuries’ worth of relevant authorities, whose value should
not be underestimated. The wisdom of our predecessors is a valuable resource,
and the doctrine of precedent continues to apply. The courts should not be
reinventing the wheel.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para41">41.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Thirdly, as the judge observed in the present case, in remarks with
which Lord Clarke expressed agreement in <i>Menelaou </i>(para 19), Lord
Steyn’s four questions are no more than broad headings for ease of exposition.
They are intended to ensure a structured approach to the analysis of unjust
enrichment, by identifying the essential elements in broad terms. If they are
not separately considered and answered, there is a risk that courts will resort
to an unstructured approach driven by perceptions of fairness, with consequent
uncertainty and unpredictability. At the same time, the questions are not
themselves legal tests, but are signposts towards areas of inquiry involving a
number of distinct legal requirements. In particular, the words “at the expense
of” do not express a legal test; and a test cannot be derived by exegesis of
those words, as if they were the words of a statute.</a></p><a name="para41">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para41"></a><a name="para42">42.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The structured approach provided by the four questions does not,
therefore, dispense with the necessity for a careful legal analysis of
individual cases. In carrying out that analysis, it is important to have at the
forefront of one’s mind the purpose of the law of unjust enrichment. As was
recognised in <i>Menelaou </i>(para 23), it is designed to correct normatively
defective transfers of value, usually by restoring the parties to their
pre-transfer positions. It reflects an Aristotelian conception of justice as
the restoration of a balance or equilibrium which has been disrupted. That is
why restitution is usually the appropriate remedy.</a></p><a name="para42">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para42"></a><a name="para43">43.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The nature of the various legal requirements indicated by the “at the
expense of” question follows from that principle of corrective justice. They
are designed to ensure that there has been a transfer of value, of a kind which
may have been normatively defective: that is to say, defective in a way which
is recognised by the law of unjust enrichment (for example, because of a
failure of the basis on which the benefit was conferred). The expression
“transfer of value” is, however, also too general to serve as a legal test.
More precisely, it means in the first place that the defendant has received a
benefit from the claimant. But that is not in itself enough. The reversal of
unjust enrichment, usually by a restitutionary remedy, is premised on the
claimant’s also having suffered a loss through his provision of the benefit.</a></p><a name="para43">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para43"></a><a name="para44">44.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This was recognised in <i>Menelaou, </i>as was noted in para 37 above.
It was explained more fully by Lord Clyde in <i>Banque Financière, </i>citing a
maxim of Pomponius:</a></p><a name="para44">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“My Lords, the basis for the
appellants’ claim is to be found in the principle of unjust enrichment, a
principle more fully expressed in the Latin formulation, nemo debet locupletari
aliena jactura [no-one should be enriched by another’s loss] ... Without
attempting any comprehensive analysis, it seems to me that the principle
requires at least that the plaintiff should have sustained a loss through the
provision of something for the benefit of some other person with no intention
of making a gift, that the defendant should have received some form of
enrichment, and that the enrichment has come about because of the loss.” (p
237)</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para44"></a><a name="para45">45.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It should be emphasised that there need not be a loss in the same sense
as in the law of damages: restitution is not a compensatory remedy. For that
reason, some commentators have preferred to use different terms, referring for
example to a subtraction from, or diminution in, the claimant’s wealth, or
simply to a transfer of value. But the word “loss” is used in the authorities,
and it is perfectly apposite, provided it is understood that it does not bear
the same meaning as in the law of damages. The loss to the claimant may, for
example, be incurred through the gratuitous provision of services which could
otherwise have been provided for reward, where there was no intention of
donation. In such a situation, the claimant has given up something of economic
value through the provision of the benefit, and has in that sense incurred a
loss.</a></p><a name="para45">

<p class="ParaHeading">Direct and indirect provision of a benefit</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para45"></a><a name="para46">46.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Situations in which the defendant has received a benefit from the
claimant, and the claimant has incurred a loss through the provision of that
benefit, usually arise where the parties have dealt directly with one another,
or with one another’s property. Common examples are the gratuitous payment of
money, or provision of goods or services, by the claimant to the defendant,
where there was no intention of donation. In such a situation, if the
enrichment of the defendant is unjust - if, in other words, the transfer of
value is defective in a sense recognised by the law of unjust enrichment - then
the claimant is prima facie entitled to have the enrichment reversed.</a></p><a name="para46">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There are, however, situations in which the parties have not dealt
directly with one another, or with one another’s property, but in which the
defendant has nevertheless received a benefit from the claimant, and the
claimant has incurred a loss through the provision of that benefit. These are
generally situations in which the difference from the direct provision of a
benefit by the claimant to the defendant is more apparent than real.</a></p><a name="para47">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para47"></a><a name="para48">48.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>One such situation is where the agent of one of the parties is
interposed between them. In that situation, the agent is the proxy of his
principal, by virtue of the law of agency. The series of transactions between
the claimant and the agent, and between the agent and the defendant, is
therefore legally equivalent to a transaction directly between the claimant and
the defendant. Similarly, where the right to restitution is assigned, as in <i>Equuscorp
Pty Ltd v Haxton </i></a><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinodisp/au/cases/cth/HCA/2012/7.html">[2012] HCA 7</a>; 246 CLR 498; 86 AJLR 296, the claimant
stands in the shoes of the assignor, and is therefore treated as if he had been
a party to the relevant transaction, and the defendant’s enrichment had been
directly at his expense. Another situation is where, as in <i>Relfo, </i>an intervening
transaction is found to be a sham (para 121). Since the sham is created
precisely in order to conceal the connection between the claimant and the
defendant, it is disregarded when deciding whether the latter was enriched at
the former’s expense. So, in <i>Relfo, </i>Gloster and Floyd LJJ described the
arrangements in question as being “equivalent to a direct payment” (paras 103
and 115). There have also been cases, discussed below, in which a set of co-ordinated
transactions has been treated as forming a single scheme or transaction for the
purpose of the “at the expense of” inquiry, on the basis that to consider each
individual transaction separately would be unrealistic. There are also
situations where the defendant receives property from a third party into which
the claimant can trace an interest. Since the property is, in law, the
equivalent of the claimant’s property, the defendant is therefore treated as if
he had received the claimant’s property.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para49">49.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A different type of situation is typified by the case where the claimant
discharges a debt owed by the defendant to a third party. Although it is the
third party creditor who receives the payment from the claimant, the defendant
is directly enriched, since the payment discharges his debt: the enrichment is not
the payment which the third party receives, but the discharge which the
defendant receives. Where the transfer of value is defective, and the
enrichment is consequently unjust, the law reverses it, as far as possible, by
subrogating the claimant to the rights formerly held by the third party (as was
explained, for example, by Walton J in <i>Burston Finance Ltd v Speirway Ltd</i>
[1974] 1 WLR 1648, 1652). There are many variations on the type of situation
where equitable subrogation is an appropriate remedy to reverse or prevent
unjust enrichment. The remedy differs from restitution, in that it does not
have the effect of restoring the parties to their pre-transfer positions, but
it is the most practicable means of reversing or preventing unjust enrichment
in the types of situation where it is appropriate.</a></p><a name="para49">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It has often been suggested that there is a general rule, possibly
subject to exceptions, that the claimant must have directly provided a benefit
to the defendant. The situations discussed in the two preceding paragraphs can
be reconciled with such a rule, if it is understood as encompassing a number of
situations which, for the purposes of the rule, the law treats as equivalent to
a direct transfer, in the sense that there is no substantive or real
difference. So understood, the suggested rule is helpful. It may nevertheless
require refinement to accommodate other apparent exceptions, and it would be
unwise at this stage of the law’s development to exclude the possibility of
genuine exceptions, or to rule out other possible approaches.</a></p><a name="para50">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Where, on the other hand, the defendant has not received a benefit
directly from the claimant, no question of agency arises, and the benefit does
not consist of property in which the claimant has or can trace an interest, it
is generally difficult to maintain that the defendant has been enriched at the
claimant’s expense. The point is illustrated by the case of <i>MacDonald
Dickens &amp; Macklin v Costello </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2011/930.html">[2011] EWCA Civ 930</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2011/930.html">[2012] QB 244</a>, where
the provision of services to a company was held not to enrich its directors and
shareholders. It is also illustrated by the example, discussed in <i>Relfo, </i>of
a claimant who makes a mistaken payment to a third party, who in consequence
makes a gift to the defendant out of property in which the claimant has no
interest, and into which he is unable to trace. As Arden and Floyd LJJ
recognised (paras 78 and 114), the claimant does not have a claim in unjust
enrichment against the defendant. The claimant suffers a loss through making
the payment to the third party, who is unjustly enriched at his expense. A
claim in unjust enrichment therefore lies against the third party (subject to
any defences available). But no claim of a personal nature lies at the instance
of the claimant against the defendant: the claimant has not incurred any loss
through the making of the gift.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">Incidental benefits</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para52">52.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As explained earlier, the “at the expense of” requirement is not
satisfied merely by the direct receipt of a benefit. The claimant must also
incur a loss through the provision of the benefit. As Lord Clyde put it in <i>Banque
Financière, </i>in the passage cited at para 44 above, “the plaintiff should
have sustained a loss through the provision of something for the benefit of
some other person”. That requirement will not normally be satisfied where the
provision of the benefit was merely an incidental or collateral result of his
expenditure. (In practice, situations where the defendant has received a
benefit merely as an incidental consequence of the claimant’s pursuit of some
other objective are also often situations in which the enrichment of the
defendant is not in any event unjust.) In such a situation, the claimant may
have received the consideration for which he bargained as the counterpart of
his own expenditure, and in that event will not usually have suffered any loss.
Even if he has incurred a loss, it will not normally have arisen through his
provision of something for the benefit of the defendant, since the benefit
received by the defendant will have been merely incidental or collateral to the
reason why the expenditure was incurred. A “but for” causal connection between
the claimant’s being worse off and the defendant’s being better off is not,
therefore, sufficient in itself to constitute a transfer of value.</a></p><a name="para52">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para52"></a><a name="para53">53.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The need for the claimant to suffer a loss through the provision of
something for the benefit of the defendant is illustrated by the <i>Ruabon </i>case,
which concerned a ship which had been damaged during a voyage covered by a
policy of marine insurance. She was put into dry dock for repairs at the
expense of the insurers. The owners took advantage of her being in dry dock to
have her surveyed for the purpose of renewing her Lloyds classification. There
was no consequent increase in dock expenses. Even if the insurers might be
regarded as having provided a benefit to the owners (by enabling them to have
the vessel surveyed without themselves incurring the expense of putting her
into dry dock), the insurers incurred no loss through the provision of that
benefit: their expenses were not increased, and they received the consideration
for which they had paid. The insurers’ claim for a contribution towards their
expenses, on the basis that the owners had benefited from it, was rejected.
Lord Macnaghten put the point in a nutshell: “there is no principle of law
which requires that a person should contribute to an outlay merely because he
has derived a material benefit from it” (p 15).</a></p><a name="para53">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para53"></a><a name="para54">54.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Earl of Halsbury LC, in a speech with which the other members of the
Committee agreed, emphasised the fact that the owners were strangers to the
exercise undertaken by the insurers, and the absence in those circumstances of
any reason why, in justice, they should contribute towards its cost:</a></p><a name="para54">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“[T]his is the first time in which
it has been sought to advance that principle [of contribution] where there is
nothing in common between the two persons, except that one person has taken
advantage of something that another person has done, there being no contract
between them, there being no obligation by which each of them is bound, and the
duty to contribute is alleged to arise only on some general principle of
justice, that a man ought not to get an advantage unless he pays for it. So
that if a man were to cut down a wood which obscured his neighbour's prospect
and gave him a better view, he ought upon this principle to be compelled to
contribute to cutting down the wood.” (p 12)</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The Lord Chancellor’s example did not involve anything
which might have been argued to be an unjust factor, but the position would scarcely
be different if it had: if, for example, the man had cut down the wood in the
mistaken belief that the trees were diseased.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Another illustration of the need for a loss to be incurred through the
provision of the benefit, also cited to the Court of Appeal in the <i>TFL </i>case,
is the case of <i>Edinburgh and District Tramways Co Ltd v Courtenay </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/scot/cases/ScotCS/1908/1909_SC_99.html">1909 SC 99</a>. It concerned a contract between a tramway company and an advertising
firm, under which the firm paid a rental for the right to display advertising
on the tramcars. It was up to the firm to provide the boards around the upper
deck of the tramcars, on which the advertisements were displayed. The tramway
company subsequently constructed new tramcars with “decency boards” already
supplied, saving the advertising firm the expense of fitting its own. The
tramway company’s claim against the advertising firm for the cost of fitting
the decency boards was rejected, on the ground that the tramway company had not
incurred any loss through the provision of the benefit. Lord President Dunedin
observed that “there are certain marks or notes of the situation in which
recompense is due, and I think that one mark or note is that the person who
claims recompense must have lost something” (pp 105-106). The Lord President
also emphasised that the company had been acting for its own purposes.
Referring to earlier authorities, he remarked that in the case at hand “you
have the same element that went to the decision of some of these eases, that
the thing done was as much for the benefit of the man who did it as for that of
the other person” (p 106). The Lord President illustrated his opinion with an
illuminating example:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“One man heats his house, and his
neighbour gets a great deal of benefit. It is absurd to suppose that the person
who has heated his house can go to his neighbour and say - ‘Give me so much for
my coal bill, because you have been warmed by what I have done, and I did not
intend to give you a present of it.’” (p 105)</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The importance of identifying a loss arising through the provision of a
benefit is also illustrated by the case of <i>TFL, </i>where a claim based on
unjust enrichment<i> </i>was brought by a company, A, against a defendant, B,
in order to recover the costs which A had incurred in earlier legal
proceedings. Those proceedings had been brought by A in order to recover a debt
from a third party, C, and had been successfully defended on the ground that
the debt was due, not to A, but to B. After B recovered the debt, A brought
proceedings against B on the basis that A had conferred a benefit on it by
bringing the earlier proceedings and thereby clarifying B’s right to recover
the debt. Since A had done so under an erroneous understanding of its rights,
it argued that B had therefore been unjustly enriched at its expense. The Court
of Appeal, by a majority (Sir Stanley Burnton dissenting), held that the claim
could not be summarily dismissed. The court had understandable difficulty in
identifying the benefit which had supposedly been conferred by A on B (para
50), and accepted that the benefit, “whatever it consists of”, had not been
directly provided by A to B (para 54). It appears to have considered that a
causal link between A’s payment of the costs of the proceedings and an indirect
benefit to B was nevertheless arguably sufficient (para 64). The fact that A
had been acting in its own interests was considered to be no answer (para 67).</a></p><a name="para56">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para56"></a><a name="para57">57.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The court could hardly have reached the same conclusion if, when
considering the “at the expense of” question, it had focused on the need to
identify a transfer of value from the claimant to the defendant. A had not
provided any benefit directly to B. At best, B had received an incidental
benefit as the result of A’s pursuit of its own interests. The facts of the
case, so far as the “at the expense of” question is concerned, were not
materially distinguishable from those of Lord Dunedin’s example of the
householder whose heating warms his neighbour’s house. Furthermore, A’s
erroneous understanding of its legal rights did not in any event bear on the
justice of B’s incidentally benefiting from the clarification of the legal
position: one might cite Pollock CB’s rhetorical question in <i>Taylor v Laird </i>(1856)
25 LJ Ex 329, 332, “One cleans another’s shoes; what can the other do but put
them on?” A had received the legal services it had bargained for when it
incurred the expense (and, if it also had to meet its opponent’s costs, that
was a risk inherent in litigation, which it voluntarily assumed). Even bearing
in mind that the Court of Appeal was dealing with a strike-out application, the
majority of the court were wrong in not summarily dismissing the claim.</a></p><a name="para57">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is interesting to note that similar claims were rejected long ago in
Scotland, on the basis that the litigant had been pursuing his own interests. More,
in his Notes to Stair’s Institutions (1832), states:</a></p><a name="para58">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“a person who, for his own
benefit, carries on an expensive law-suit, which, in the result, establishes
some point as beneficial to other neighbouring proprietors as to himself, can
make no claim against them for any part of the expense incurred by him. And
Lord Stair, in the text, states the case of a person who reduces [sets aside] a
right as void, and thereby lets in the claims of third parties, which are
ultimately preferred to his own, yet he says, that ‘as he was doing his own
business, not theirs, he can claim no share from them of his expenses.’” (p
liv)</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Hume’s <i>Lectures</i> (1786-1822) are to the same
effect, stating in relation to the person who brings an action:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Now, though it should so happen,
(as very often it must,) that he settles some point of law, in the decision of
this lawsuit of his, and thus does a service to a number of other persons,
whose property, or concerns, are in the like situation; yet still the cost of
this lawsuit is his peculiar and exclusive concern. He can recover no part of
it from his neighbours, or any of them, for whose benefit he probably never
would have stirred in the matter.” (Vol III, p 167, citing the unreported case
of <i>Ferguson v Smyth, </i>18 November 1802, SC Old Sess Pap, vol 437, No 30.)</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">Economic reality</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para58"></a><a name="para59">59.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Nor is the “at the expense of” requirement satisfied by a connection
between the parties’ respective benefit and loss merely as a matter of economic
or commercial reality. Economic reality is not only a “somewhat fuzzy concept”,
as Moses LJ described it in <i>Menelaou </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2013/1960.html">[2014] 1 WLR 854</a>, para 62, but one
which is difficult to apply with any rigour or certainty in this context, or
consistently with the purpose of restitution on the ground of unjust
enrichment. An inquiry into where the economic burden of an unjust enrichment
has fallen is liable to be a very complex undertaking, especially where there
is a chain of suppliers and consumers. The supplier who passes on a tax or
other charge by increasing the price of his goods or services might be thought
to have shifted the economic burden, but his increased prices may have an
adverse impact upon his sales, and accordingly upon the profitability of his
operations. Furthermore, in a situation where numerous factors affect the
prices which he charges, it may be far from easy to decide to what extent the
economic burden of the tax has been reflected in the price charged. Deciding
whether the economic burden of an unjust enrichment has been passed on has been
described as virtually unascertainable (<i>Hanover Shoe Inc v United Shoe
Machinery Corpn</i> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1968/185.html">(1968) 392 US 481</a>, 493) and a near impossibility (<i>British
Columbia v Canadian Forest Products Ltd</i> <span class="reflex3-alt"><a href="http://canlii.ca/t/1h87s">[2004] 2 SCR 74</a>, para 205)</span>. These points have been made repeatedly in other
jurisdictions, when considering a defence of passing on: that is to say, a
defence based on the proposition that the economic burden of an unjustified
enrichment was borne not by the claimant but by a third party: see, for
example, <i>Commissioner of State Revenue (Victoria) v Royal Insurance
Australia Ltd </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/61.html">(1994) 182 CLR 51</a>; 126 ALR 1; <i>Kingstreet Investments Ltd v

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A more fundamental difficulty with an approach based on economic reality
arises from the fact that the purpose of restitution is not to compensate for
loss, but to reverse the defective transfer. Looking to see who has suffered an
economic loss is therefore not, in principle, the correct way of identifying
the appropriate claimant. Indeed, even in tort law, which <i>is</i> concerned
with compensation for loss, the court is not concerned with where the economic
burden of the tort may ultimately have fallen as a matter of economic reality.</a></p><a name="para60">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There are, on the other hand, cases in which the court has referred to
“reality” in a different sense. These are cases in which, for the purpose of
answering the “at the expense of” question, the court has treated a set of
related transactions, operating in a co-ordinated way, as forming a single
scheme or transaction, on the basis that to answer the question by considering
each of the individual transactions separately would be unrealistic. The case
of <i>Banque Financière, </i>as explained in some of the judgments,<i> </i>is
an example. The claimant had entered into a refinancing arrangement involving
the loan of a sum of money to the manager of a holding company, which he in
turn lent to a subsidiary of that company so that it could discharge a debt
secured by a first-ranking security. The purpose of interposing the manager
between the claimant and the first subsidiary was to avoid a requirement to
make a public disclosure of the loan, which would have applied if the claimant
had lent the money directly to the first subsidiary. The claimant paid the
money directly to the subsidiary’s creditor, so discharging the debt. It was
conceded that this enriched the defendant, which was another subsidiary of the
holding company, since it promoted the ranking of its own security, with the
consequence that it was the only creditor of the first subsidiary which was
likely to be repaid. This was contrary to the understanding on which the
claimant had advanced the loan, namely that it would be repaid in priority to
all intra-group debts. The House of Lords held that this would unjustly enrich
the defendant, and therefore subrogated the claimant to the discharged
security, as against the defendant, so as to prevent the unjust enrichment.</a></p><a name="para61">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para61"></a><a name="para62">62.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>One of the questions considered by the House of Lords was whether the
enrichment was at the expense of the claimant, when the claimant had made the
loan to the manager of the holding company, who had then made a further loan to
the first subsidiary, rather than the claimant lending directly to the first
subsidiary. Two different analyses were put forward. Lord Steyn proceeded on
the basis that the interposition of the loan to the manager was “no more than a
formal act designed to allow the transaction to proceed ... To allow [it] to
alter the substance of the transaction would be pure formalism” (p 227). Lord
Clyde similarly stated that the arrangement with the manager did not “prevent
recognition of the reality of the granting of the funds by [the claimant] to
[the holder of the first-ranking security]” (p 238). That was also the view of
Lord Hutton (“the reality was that the [defendant] was enriched at the expense
of [the claimant]”: p 239). Lord Hoffmann, with whom Lord Steyn, Lord Griffiths
and Lord Clyde agreed, put forward another analysis, namely that the claimant’s
money could be traced into the discharge of the debt secured by the
first-ranking security (p 235). On both analyses, the House of Lords treated
the situation as one where the defendant had directly received a benefit from
the claimant, since on one analysis it was in reality the claimant which had
discharged the first-ranking security and thereby promoted the defendant’s
security, and on the other analysis it was the claimant’s money which had done
so. </a></p><a name="para62">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The case of <i>Menelaou</i> provides another illustration. The case
concerned the sale of a property owned by the defendant’s parents, and the use
of part of the proceeds to purchase another property in her name, as a gift.
The claimant bank held a charge over the first property to secure the parents’
borrowings, and agreed to the discharge of the security in return for a fresh
charge over the second property. It instructed solicitors to deal with the
discharge of the security over the first property and to obtain a charge over
the second property. The solicitors sent the bank a charge over the second
property, purportedly executed by the defendant, and the bank authorised the
discharge of the security over the first property. In the event, the second
charge was defective, as a result of the solicitors’ negligence. The defendant
had agreed to the purchase of the second property in her name, but was unaware
of her parents’ agreement with the bank that there should be a charge. The
solicitors admitted liability to the bank for its losses, subject to credit being
given for any sums which the bank might recover from the defendant.</a></p><a name="para63">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Carnwath analysed the case in terms of the law of equity rather
than unjust enrichment. He considered that the moneys held by the solicitors
following the sale of the first property, and used to purchase the second
property, were held on a <i>Quistclose-</i>type trust for the bank (<i>Quistclose
Investments Ltd v Rolls Razor Ltd </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1968/4.html">[1970] AC 567</a>). On that footing, it
followed that the bank was subrogated to the lien of the unpaid vendor of the
second property, so as to give it an equitable interest in the property. In
other words, the vendor had a lien over the property, to secure his right to
payment of the purchase price, as long as he remained unpaid. The bank, on
discharging the parents’ obligation to pay the vendor, became entitled in
equity to the benefit of that lien (or, strictly analysed, to a new lien to
secure its own right to repayment) by subrogation.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The other members of the court held that the bank should be subrogated
to the unpaid vendor’s lien on the basis of unjust enrichment, since it had
mistakenly authorised the use of the proceeds of sale of the first property
(which it could otherwise have required to be applied to discharge the debt
owed to itself) to purchase the second property, thereby providing the
defendant with a benefit at its expense. Lord Clarke proceeded on the basis
that “the two arrangements, namely the sale of [the first property] and the
purchase of [the second property], were not separate but part of one scheme,
which involved the bank throughout” (para 25). Lord Neuberger agreed, observing
that “it is appropriate not merely to consider the purchase of, and charge
over, [the second property] as a single composite transaction”, applying the
approach to property purchases involving a charge which was adopted in <i>Abbey
National</i> <i>Building Society v Cann</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1990/3.html">[1991] 1 AC 56</a>, but that it was
“also appropriate in the present case to treat the sale of [the first property]
and the purchase of [the second property] as one scheme, at least for present
purposes” (para 67). Lord Kerr and Lord Wilson agreed with both judgments in
relation to this issue.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On that basis, Lord Clarke considered that the conclusion that there had
been a transfer of value between the bank and the defendant gave effect to “the
reality of the transaction”, notwithstanding the absence of a direct payment by
the former to the latter (para 33). Lord Neuberger agreed, stating:</a></p><a name="para66">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“[T]here was in reality a single
transaction, and it was from that transaction that [the defendant] directly
benefitted, even though the benefit was effected at the direction of the
Menelaou parents. The benefit to [the defendant] was direct because it arose as
the immediate and inevitable result of the very transaction to which she was
party and which gave rise to the unjust enrichment.” (para 73)</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Turning to the issue raised in the present case, the only English
authority cited in argument which contains a discussion of the “at the expense
of” question in relation to taxation is the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Kleinwort
Benson Ltd v Birmingham City Council </i>[1997] QB 380. The case concerned a
claim by a bank for restitution of money which it had paid to a local authority
under a void swap transaction. The bank had also entered into hedging
arrangements with a third party which protected it against loss. In considering
whether English law recognised a defence of passing on, the Court of Appeal
discussed the requirement that the defendant’s enrichment should be at the
expense of the claimant. Evans LJ, delivering the leading judgment with which
Saville LJ agreed, referred to a range of authority and academic writing from
other jurisdictions, including two authorities concerned with taxes paid under
a mistake: the decision of the United States Federal Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit in <i>123 East Fifty-Fourth Street Inc v United States </i>(1946)
157 F 2d 68, and<i> </i>the decision of the High Court of Australia in <i>Commissioner
of State Revenue (Victoria) v Royal Insurance Australia Ltd</i>. He noted that
the cases raised a “question, akin to agency, which is whether the taxpayer
should be regarded as having collected tax from his customers on behalf of the
taxing authority”, and that it had been said by Learned Hand J in the <i>123
East Fifty-Fourth Street </i>case that any tax recovered by the taxpayer would
be held by him as a fiduciary for his customers. Similarly, in the <i>Royal
Insurance </i>case it had been said that if it was established that the
plaintiff had charged its policy-holders the tax as a separate item, it would
be entitled to recover the money from the tax authority but would then hold it
as a constructive trustee. In the event, however, Evans LJ found the taxation
cases of little assistance, since on the facts of the case no question of a
constructive trust or of any obligation to account to customers could arise (p
391). Morritt LJ, with whose judgment Saville LJ also agreed, emphasised that
the plaintiff was legally and beneficially entitled to the money it paid to the
authority, and that the case was not one in which the claimant held the money
claimed as a bare trustee or tax collector such as, arguably, in the <i>123
East Fifty-Fourth Street </i>case<i> </i>(p 400).</a></p><a name="para67">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It has not been argued in the present appeal that the Managers held the
amounts paid to them by the Lead Claimants in respect of VAT as agents or
trustees or in any other fiduciary capacity. In the circumstances, it is
unnecessary to consider the American and Australian authorities in any detail.
The dissenting opinion of Learned Hand J in the <i>123 East Fifty-Fourth Street
</i>case was concerned with a simpler situation than the present case, where
the supplier of services collected sales tax from his customers, as a
separately identifiable amount paid for the purpose of meeting the tax, and
then remitted the whole of that amount to the tax authority. The same was true
in the case of <i>Wayne County Produce Co v Duffy-Mott Co</i> (1927) 244 NY
351, where Cardozo CJ adopted a similar approach. The reasoning in these cases
was approved by Mason CJ in the <i>Royal Insurance </i>case, in an opinion in
which the other members of the court did not join, but he distinguished the
case before him on the basis that the amount collected was not paid separately
from the price of the services supplied.</a></p><a name="para68">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In considering these authorities, it is necessary not only to bear in
mind the differences from the facts of the present case, but also to remember
that American and Australian law adopt a broader approach to constructive
trusts than English law. In particular, one of the essential requisites for a
trust in English law is that there must be identifiable trust property (or its
traceable proceeds) in the hands of the recipient which is not available to him
as part of his general assets: see <i>Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v
Islington London Borough Council</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1996/12.html">[1996] AC 669</a>, 705.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para70">70.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the present case, the contracts between the Managers and the Lead
Claimants provided for the Managers to be paid fees plus VAT “if applicable”
(or words to similar effect). The contractual obligation of the Lead Claimants
was therefore to pay the fees plus whatever sum, if any, was necessary in order
to meet the VAT chargeable on the supply in question. This was reflected in the
invoices issued by the Managers, which drew a distinction between their fees,
on the one hand, and the VAT due on their fees, on the other hand. There is,
however, no evidence that the Managers were expected to keep the amounts paid
to them by the Lead Claimants in respect of VAT separate from their other
funds: on the face of things, they were entitled to treat them as part of their
general assets. It follows that in paying those amounts to the Managers, the
Lead Claimants must be taken to have intended to part with any interest in the
money, rather than to have impressed it with a special purpose trust.
Furthermore, since the Managers were not aware of any mistake prior to making
payment to the Commissioners, their conscience cannot have been affected so as
to render them trustees: see <i>Westdeutsche </i>at p 709. In these
circumstances, the right to the restitution of money paid under the contract as
the result of a mistake gives rise, like the contract itself, to purely
personal obligations.</a></p><a name="para70">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para70"></a><a name="para71">71.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Returning, then, to the question whether the unjust enrichment of the
Commissioners was at the expense of the Lead Claimants, and focusing on whether
there was a transfer of value from the Lead Claimants to the Commissioners, the
answer is in the negative. There was a transfer of value, comprising the
notional £100, from the Lead Claimants to the Managers, under the contract
between them. It was defective, because it was made in performance of a
contractual obligation which was mistakenly believed to be owed. There was a
subsequent transfer of value, comprising the notional £75, from the Managers to
the Commissioners. It was also defective, because it was made in compliance
with a statutory obligation which was inapplicable because it was incompatible
with EU law. These two transfers cannot be collapsed into a single transfer of
value from the Lead Claimants to the Commissioners.</a></p><a name="para71">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para71"></a><a name="para72">72.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>That follows from a number of considerations. First, the Lead Claimants
do not challenge the judge’s rejection of a connection between the payments
made by the Lead Claimants and the payments received by the Commissioners based
on agency. The intervention of the Managers cannot therefore be disregarded on
the basis that they were in law the proxy of one of the other parties.
Secondly, since the payments made by the Lead Claimants formed part of the
Managers’ general assets, to do with as they pleased, it is impossible to trace
those payments into the payments subsequently made by the Managers to the
Commissioners, and so to regard the Commissioners as having benefited from the
receipt of property in which the Lead Claimants had an interest. Thirdly, the
fact that there were two separate transactions - first, between the Claimants
and the Managers, and secondly between the Managers and the Commissioners - is
not in this context something which can be disregarded. In particular, there is
no question of the transactions being a sham or involving an artificial step,
or of their comprising a single scheme. The first transfer did not even bring
about the second transfer as a matter of causation: the judge’s rejection of a
“but for” causal connection between the two transfers is not challenged. The
Lead Claimants rely on a connection established by commercial or economic
reality. But, for the reasons already explained, the fact that, as a matter of
economic or commercial reality, the Lead Claimants bore the cost of the undue
tax paid by the Managers to the Commissioners does not in itself entitle them
to restitution from the Commissioners.</a></p><a name="para72">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para72"></a><a name="para73">73.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It follows that the Lead Claimants did not in principle have any right
to restitution against the Commissioners. They did, on the other hand, have a
right to restitution against the Managers. That right was to restitution of the
entire amount paid in respect of VAT, ie the notional £100. The Managers did
not in principle have a change of position defence in respect of the notional
£75 which they paid to the Commissioners, since that change of position was
reversible under section 80 of the 1994 Act, as I shall shortly explain. Nor
did they have a change of position defence in respect of the notional £25 which
they retained.</a></p><a name="para73">

necessary next to consider the effect of section 80 of the 1994 Act. The

</span>Section 80 is supplemented by section 80A, introduced by section 46(2)
of the Finance Act 1997 and subsequently amended, which enables the
Commissioners to make regulations providing for reimbursement arrangements to
be disregarded for the purposes of section 80(3) except where they contain such
provision, and are supported by such undertakings, as may be required by the
regulations. The relevant regulations are contained in Part VA of the Value
Added Tax Regulations 1995 (SI 1995/2518), as amended. They provide for
“reimbursement arrangements”, defined by regulation 43A as arrangements for the
purposes of a claim under section 80 which “(a) are made by a claimant for the
purpose of securing that he is not unjustly enriched by the crediting of any
amount in pursuance of the claim, and (b) provide for the reimbursement of
persons (consumers) who have, for practical purposes, borne the whole or any
part of the original amount brought into account as output tax that was not
output tax due”. The regulations go on to require the claimant under section 80
to give undertakings to the Commissioners that he will apply the whole of the
amount credited, and any interest on that amount, to the reimbursement of
identified consumers whom he has reimbursed or intends to reimburse.</a></p><a name="para76">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is common ground that, for persons who have accounted to the
Commissioners for VAT that was not due, section 80 and the associated
regulations provide a code for the recovery of VAT which is exhaustive and
excludes other remedies such as a common law claim based on unjust enrichment.
It is also common ground that the ITCs could never have made a claim under
section 80, since they did not pay or account for any of the VAT in question to
the Commissioners. The first issue in dispute is whether the effect of section
80 is to exclude a common law claim by the ITCs, assuming, contrary to my
earlier conclusion, that such a claim might otherwise be brought.</a></p><a name="para77">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para77"></a><a name="para78">78.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The argument for the Lead Claimants is based primarily on the structure
and wording of section 80. They point out that subsections (1) to (6) are
concerned with the crediting or repayment of undue VAT to the supplier, not the
consumer. In subsection (7), the words “credit or repay” echo the language of
earlier subsections, where they can plainly refer only to the repayment or
crediting of the supplier. They submit that subsection (7) is similarly
concerned with the supplier. Only a supplier of goods or services can “account”
for an amount to the Commissioners, and only a supplier can be “credited” with
an amount by them. Similarly, only a supplier can be “repaid” by the
Commissioners, since only he has paid them in the first place. Section 80(7) is
thus designed only to exclude claims, otherwise than under the section, by
persons who have a claim under the section. That argument was accepted by the
Court of Appeal.</a></p><a name="para78">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para78"></a><a name="para79">79.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On behalf of the Commissioners, it is argued that the word “repay” is
capable of applying to any payment back by the Commissioners of VAT which they
have received. From their perspective, there is a repayment if the VAT is
refunded, whether to the supplier or to someone else. Furthermore, it is
argued, it would be strange if section 80(7) barred a restitutionary claim by
the supplier, but left the supplier’s customer in a better position. Moreover,
it is argued, section 80 establishes a statutory scheme for the restitution of
VAT which was not due, which by necessary implication excludes non-statutory
restitutionary claims. The argument seeks to draw support from the decision of
the Court of Appeal in <i>Monro v Revenue and Customs Comrs </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2008/306.html">[2008] EWCA Civ 306</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2008/306.html">[2009] Ch 69</a>, where a common law claim was held to be excluded by a
statutory scheme for the recovery of tax, since it would be inconsistent with
the purpose of the scheme.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para80">80.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In agreement with the judge, I find the textual arguments inconclusive,
when considered by themselves. The word “repay” is capable of bearing a wider
meaning than the one for which the claimants contend, but could also be
construed more narrowly. A purposive construction of the provision points more
clearly to the correct conclusion. In that regard, section 80(3) and (4) are
particularly important.</a></p><a name="para80">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para80"></a><a name="para81">81.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Under section 80(3), the Commissioners have a statutory defence to a
claim under section 80 - a claim which, it is agreed, can only be made by a
supplier - where crediting the supplier would unjustly enrich him. The
possibility of unjust enrichment (in a non-technical sense) arises because the
supplier normally recovers from his customers the output tax for which he
accounts to the Commissioners. The subsection therefore creates a statutory
defence of passing on. Section 80A, and the 1995 Regulations, then create a
scheme under which the defence is disapplied where “reimbursement arrangements”
are made with the purpose of ensuring that the payment to the supplier is used
to reimburse the consumers who have borne the economic burden of the tax.
Sections 80 and 80A, together with the 1995 Regulations, thus create a scheme
which enables consumers who have been wrongly charged VAT to obtain
reimbursement. The consumers are able to recover the VAT which they were
wrongly charged, to the extent that it was remitted by the supplier to the
Commissioners, through the medium of the supplier’s claim under section 80.</a></p><a name="para81">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para81"></a><a name="para82">82.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Although the consumers’ remedy is indirect, it can generally be expected
to be effective: if the supplier is otherwise reluctant to make a claim, the
consumers have a direct claim against him, as explained below. Subject to the
question of time bar, these arrangements therefore remove any need there might
otherwise be, in most circumstances, for the consumer to have a direct remedy
against the Commissioners. It will be necessary at a later point to return to
the question whether there may nevertheless be some circumstances in which a
direct remedy is required by EU law.</a></p><a name="para82">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para82"></a><a name="para83">83.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Section 80(4) lays down a limitation period for claims under the section
which is shorter than the period of six years, with extensions in the event of
mistake, which would apply to a common law claim in unjust enrichment under
section 32(1)(c) of the Limitation Act 1980 (and which also applied under
section 80(4) until its amendment by the Finance Act 1997). A statutory claim
by the supplier must therefore be brought within a shorter and more certain
period of time. The evident aim is to protect public finances against the risk
of a liability to repay tax emerging more than three years after the tax was
received. It would be inconsistent with that intention for there to be a
potentially far longer period within which non-statutory claims might be
brought against the Commissioners by the supplier’s customers.</a></p><a name="para83">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para83"></a><a name="para84">84.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the light, therefore, of section 80(3) and (4) in particular,
Parliament cannot sensibly be taken to have intended, when it created this
scheme for the reimbursement of suppliers (with provision for them in turn to
reimburse their customers), subject to strict time limits, that it should exist
concurrently with non-statutory liabilities towards suppliers and their
customers which were potentially wider in scope and were subject to a longer
and less certain limitation period. Such an intention would be inconsistent
with the rationale of the statutory scheme. In these circumstances, on the
hypothesis that non-statutory claims by consumers might otherwise lie against
the Commissioners in circumstances falling within the scope of section 80,
subsection (7) must be construed as excluding such claims.</a></p><a name="para84">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeal considered that that approach, which the judge
accepted, presupposed that Parliament had in mind that restitutionary claims
might be brought by consumers, and legislated with the intention of excluding
such claims. As they pointed out, however, <i>Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Lincoln
City Council </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1998/38.html">[1999] 2 AC 349</a>, which established that money paid under a
mistake of law might be recoverable, had not been decided when the 1994 Act was
enacted. In their view, that background pointed away from a legislative intent
to restrict claims for the recovery of overpaid VAT to the machinery provided
by section 80.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para86">86.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I find this reasoning unpersuasive. The fact that Parliament will not
have had in mind a particular common law right to payment when enacting a
legislative scheme for recovery does not preclude the common law right being
excluded by that scheme: <i>R (Child Poverty Action Group) v Secretary of State
for Work and Pensions </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2010/54.html">[2010] UKSC 54</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2010/54.html">[2011] 2 AC 15</a>. The absence of a
recognised right to recover money paid under a mistake of law, at the time when
section 80 was enacted, did not exclude the possibility of restitutionary
claims by consumers, since there were other established grounds on which
restitution might be sought, including payment under a mistake of fact.
Moreover, the Lead Claimants’ argument proves too much: if section 80(7) was
not intended to exclude common law claims based on mistake of law, because no
such cause of action was recognised when the legislation was enacted, then a
common law claim by the Managers would not be excluded either; but it is common
ground that section 80(7) is effective to exclude any common law claim by the
Managers.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para87">87.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>More fundamentally, the determining factor in the present case is that
the scheme created by section 80 is inconsistent with the existence of a
concurrent non-statutory liability on the part of the Commissioners to make
restitution to consumers. In the absence of section 80(7), one would therefore
conclude that section 80 impliedly excluded such liability (assuming that it
might otherwise exist). Given the existence of an express exclusion in section
80(7) which is capable of covering such liability, it is unnecessary to rely on
implication: one can construe section 80(7) as having the same exclusionary
effect.</a></p><a name="para87">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para87"></a><a name="para88">88.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It follows that section 80 bars claims by the consumers who ultimately
bear the burden of VAT. It nevertheless enables them to be reimbursed, subject
to a limitation period designed to avoid the disruption of public finances.</a></p><a name="para88">

<p class="ParaHeading">Compatibility with EU law</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para88"></a><a name="para89">89.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Section 80 must have been intended to be compliant with EU law, since it
is concerned with the recovery of VAT, which is a tax imposed by EU law.
Indeed, a report by the Law Commission indicates that section 80 was framed to
accord closely with European Community law: Restitution: Mistakes of Law and
Ultra Vires Public Authority Receipts and Payments, Law Com No 227 (1994), </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/other/EWLC/1994/227.html">[1994] EWLC 227</a> para
14.19. The present case raises the question whether the system of reimbursement
established by section 80 has achieved that objective.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para90">90.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There is a well-established principle of EU law that a member state is
in principle required to repay taxes levied in breach of EU law, and an equally
well-established exception whereby repayment can be refused where it would
entail unjust enrichment of the taxable person because the burden of the tax
has been passed on: see <i>San Giorgio</i>, paras 12-13. In the latter
situation, however, the Court of Justice has held that the person to whom the
tax was passed on should have a right to recover the sums unduly paid, so as to
offset the consequences of the tax’s incompatibility with EU law by
neutralising the economic burden which the tax has imposed on the operator who
has actually borne it: <i>Danfoss A/S v Skatteministeriet </i>(Case C-94/10)
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2011/C9410.html">[2011] ECR I-9963</a>, paras 23 and 25. It is for the domestic legal system of each
member state to lay down the conditions under which claims may be made, subject
to observance of the principles of equivalence and effectiveness: <i>Danfoss, </i>para
24. These general principles apply to the reimbursement of improperly invoiced
VAT: <i>Reemtsa Cigarettenfabriken GmbH v Ministero delle Finanze </i>(Case
C-35/05) [2007] ECR I-2425. Reasonable limitation periods are compatible with
the principle of effectiveness, and the limitation period applicable to claims
under section 80 of the 1994 Act has specifically been held to be reasonable: <i>Marks
&amp; Spencer plc v Customs and Excise Comrs </i>(Case C-62/00) <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2002/C6200.html">[2003] QB 866</a>,
para 35.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para91">91.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The court has accepted that, in principle, a system under which only the
supplier is entitled to seek reimbursement of VAT from the tax authorities, and
the consumer can seek restitution from the supplier, meets the requirements of
EU law: <i>Reemtsma, </i>para 39. The court added one caveat:</a></p><a name="para91">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“[I]f reimbursement of the VAT
becomes impossible or excessively difficult, in particular in the case of the
insolvency of the supplier, those principles may require that the recipient of
the services to be able to address his application for reimbursement to the tax
authorities directly.” (<i>Reemtsma, </i>para 41).</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para91"></a><a name="para92">92.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This approach has been applied and restated in later cases. In the <i>Danfoss
</i>case, the Court of Justice put the matter in this way:</a></p><a name="para92">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“27.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It follows that a member
state may, in principle, oppose a claim for the reimbursement of a duty unduly
paid made by the final consumer to whom that duty has been passed on, on the
ground that it is not that consumer who has paid the duty to the tax
authorities, provided that the consumer - who, in the final analysis, bears the
burden of that duty - is able, on the basis of national law, to bring a civil
action against the taxable person for recovery of the sums unduly paid.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">28.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, if
reimbursement by the taxable person were to prove impossible or excessively
difficult - in particular, in the case of the insolvency of that person - the
principle of effectiveness requires that the purchaser be able to bring his
claim for reimbursement against the tax authorities directly and that, to that
end, the member state must provide the necessary instruments and detailed procedural
rules.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">In these passages, the insolvency of the taxable person
is given as an example of circumstances where reimbursement by that person
might prove impossible or excessively difficult, and where the principle of
effectiveness would therefore be infringed. It is the most likely example to
arise in practice, but it cannot be treated as necessarily exhaustive. The
governing principle of effectiveness means that the purchaser must, in principle
(and subject to procedural rules which are compatible with the principle of
effectiveness, such as reasonable limitation periods), be able to recover from
the member state where reimbursement by the taxable person would be impossible
or excessively difficult.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para92"></a><a name="para93">93.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the present case, the Lead Claimants had a common law right to
restitution of the amounts mistakenly paid to the Managers, whose enforcement
was neither impossible nor excessively difficult. The Managers had a statutory
right to recover the notional £75 from the Commissioners, under arrangements
which ensured that it was passed on to the Lead Claimants. The Managers
retained the remaining £25 and were not insolvent. They were therefore in a
position to refund it to the Lead Claimants. The only amounts which the Lead
Claimants could not recover were the amounts which they had paid during the
“dead periods”, to the extent that those amounts had been paid by the Managers
to the Commissioners: that is to say, the notional £75 whose recovery from the
Commissioners was time-barred under section 80(4) of the 1994 Act. Although a
claim by the Lead Claimants against the Managers in respect of the dead periods
would not have been time-barred, because of the more generous limitation period
allowed by section 32(1)(c) of the Limitation Act 1980, the Managers would have
a defence of change of position, since the amounts which they paid to the
Commissioners during those periods were irrecoverable. The inability of the
Lead Claimants to recover those sums is not, however, incompatible with EU law:
as explained earlier, it is conceded that the three year limitation period
imposed by section 80(4) of the 1994 Act is compatible with EU law.</a></p><a name="para93">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para93"></a><a name="para94">94.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In these circumstances, the inability of the Lead Claimants to pursue a
direct claim for restitution against the Commissioners is not incompatible with
EU law. That follows from the application of well-established principles of EU
law. There is therefore no need for any reference to the Court of Justice. Nor
is it necessary or appropriate to consider what the position would be in a
hypothetical case where the supplier was insolvent: the court has heard no
submissions, and has no information before it, as to how reimbursement
arrangements under section 80 might operate in that situation.</a></p><a name="para94">

<p class="ParaHeading">Conclusion</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para94"></a><a name="para95">95.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For these reasons I would allow the Commissioners’ appeal and dismiss
the Lead Claimants’ cross-appeal.</a></p><a name="para95">
