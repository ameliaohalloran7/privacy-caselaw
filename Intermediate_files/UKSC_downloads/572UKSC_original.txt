</span>In these proceedings the appellant, Ms O’Connor, a practising barrister,
claims damages under the Human Rights Act 1998 against the respondent, the Bar
Standards Board (“the BSB”), alleging discrimination in her enjoyment of the
right to a fair trial, in breach of article 14 of the European Convention on
Human Rights (“ECHR”) considered in conjunction with article 6 ECHR. The
appellant, who is black, alleges that the BSB discriminated against her on grounds
of her race in bringing disciplinary proceedings which ended in her acquittal
on appeal in August 2012.</a></p><a name="para1">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1"></a><a name="para2">2.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On 9 June 2010 the BSB Complaints Committee brought 6 disciplinary charges
against the appellant. Charges 1-3 each alleged professional misconduct in that
she had conducted litigation by signing a statement of truth on behalf of a
party to litigation. Charge 4 alleged professional misconduct in that, in
conducting litigation by signing a statement of truth on behalf of a party to
litigation, she failed to have regard to Public Access Work Guidance for
Barristers, issued by the General Council of the Bar. Charge 5 alleged
professional misconduct in that she engaged in conduct discreditable to a
barrister by committing an offence under section 70(8) of the Courts and Legal
Services Act 1990 as a member of an unregulated limited liability partnership
which “filed” a defence and counterclaim with the claimant’s solicitor, thereby
unlawfully conducting litigation. Charge 6 alleged professional misconduct in
that she engaged in conduct likely to diminish public confidence in the legal
profession or the administration of justice or otherwise bring the legal
profession into disrepute by committing the offence contrary to section 70(8)
of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 referred to in Charge 5.</a></p><a name="para2">

6 was dismissed.</a></p><a name="para3">

</span>The appellant appealed to the Visitors to the Inns of Court (“the Visitors”).
(It should be noted that the procedure for an appeal to the Visitors with which
we are concerned in this case is no longer in force, having been replaced by an
appeal to the High Court. See section 24(1) of the Crime and Courts Act 2013
which came into force on 7 January 2014; <i>Tariq Rehman v The Bar Standards
Board</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2016/1199.html">[2016] EWHC 1199 (Admin)</a>, at para 22, Hickinbottom J.) On 17 August
2012 her appeal was allowed. The Visitors found that none of the conduct
alleged against the appellant involved any breach of the Code of Conduct of the
Bar of England and Wales. Sir Andrew Collins, delivering the judgment of the
Visitors, observed that they had no doubt that none of these charges should
stand. In the light of this conclusion it was not necessary for the Visitors to
rule on two further submissions, namely that there had been procedural
unfairness in the course of the hearing and that there was a lack of reasons in
the decision of the tribunal. The Visitors observed, however, that there was in
their view considerable force in those submissions.</p>

</span>The appellant issued the present proceedings against the BSB on 21
February 2013. The appellant relied on various causes of action including
allegations of violation of articles 6 and 14 ECHR, contrary to section 6 of
the Human Rights Act 1998. By its defence the BSB denied the appellant’s
allegations and also maintained that the claims under the 1998 Act were
time-barred. On 9 October 2013 the appellant issued an application for
directions. These included an application for permission to amend her particulars
of claim and directions for the service of a reply. The draft amended pleading
did not answer the BSB’s plea that the claim was time-barred. The appellant did
not serve a reply.</a></p><a name="para5">

</span>On 3 January 2014 the BSB issued an application seeking an order that
the statement of case be struck out pursuant to CPR rule 3.4(2) on the grounds
that it disclosed no reasonable grounds for bringing the claim or that summary
judgment be given in its favour pursuant to CPR Part 24. On 28 March 2014
Deputy Master Eyre heard the application. The BSB maintained that none of the
claims had a real prospect of success and that, in any event, the limitation
defence was bound to succeed. Deputy Master Eyre granted the application with

18 December 2014 held that there was sufficiently pleaded a case that the BSB
indirectly discriminated against the appellant on racial or ethnic grounds by
bringing the disciplinary proceedings against her. He did not consider that it
was possible for the court to determine that the appellant had no real prospect
of establishing that the statistics on which she relied were significant (at paras
63, 65). However, he held (at para 79) that the claim was time-barred by
section 7(5) of the 1998 Act.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Here, the ‘act complained of’ in
the one human rights claim that I have held to be both adequately pleaded and
sustainable for the purposes of a summary judgment application is the BSB’s ‘prosecution’
of the appellant. The decision to bring proceedings was taken on 9 June 2010 or
at the latest in late July 2010 when the charges were served on the appellant. If
time runs from either of those dates then the one-year time limit expired some
17 or 18 months before the issue of these proceedings in February 2013. If the
BSB’s ‘prosecution’ of the appellant is considered to be a continuing state of
affairs up to the tribunal decision, time under section 7 expired in May 2012.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Warby J also rejected (at para 81) the submission on behalf

had started to run when the Disciplinary Tribunal had found the charges against
the claimant proved and so had expired before she had issued her claim. The
Court of Appeal refused a renewed application for permission to appeal on the

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Furthermore, by a respondent’s notice, the BSB contends
that the decision of the Court of Appeal should be affirmed on grounds other
than those relied on by that court, namely that Warby J erred in holding that
the article 14 claim had a real prospect of success. In this regard, the BSB
also seeks permission to adduce new evidence of fact, thereby replicating a
respondent’s notice and related application to adduce new evidence which were
before the Court of Appeal.</p>

</span>Before addressing the application of section 7(5)(a) to the present
proceedings, it is necessary to consider the precise nature of the
discrimination claim which the appellant wishes to make. In particular it is
necessary to establish whether the complaint is directed at the conduct of the
BSB in bringing and pursuing the prosecution against this appellant or, more
generally, at alleged systemic discrimination against BME barristers.</a></p><a name="para15">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para15"></a><a name="para16">16.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The discrimination claim is pleaded in the Particulars of Claim in very
general terms which are vague and unclear. The relevant paragraphs provide:</a></p><a name="para16">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“22.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The defendant infringed
the claimant’s right to a fair trial on grounds of her race, in breach of
article 14 of the Convention.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">23.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The refusal to allow
sufficient time to prepare is in line with the defendant’s general complaints
process which impacts disproportionately on black and ethnic Barristers. Black and
ethnic Barristers are more likely to have a complaint referred for disciplinary
action, are more likely to be convicted, and are more likely to have those
convictions upheld. The claimant avers that the fact that every element of the
defendant’s disciplinary system impacts on black and ethnic Barristers more
adversely indicates that there is a systemic bias against black and ethnic
Barristers.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">24.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no objective or
reasonable reason why, given that black and ethnic Barrister make up such a
small proportion of the Bar, they are more likely to be investigated following
a complaint, more likely to have a complaint referred for prosecution, more
likely to be prosecuted, more likely to be convicted and more likely to have
those convictions upheld. There is no objective reason why the defendant ignored
its own rules and prosecuted the claimant.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">…</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">29.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The defendant
discriminated against the claimant indirectly in breach of section 53(2), 53(3)
of the Equality Act 2010, section 1 of the Race Relations Act 1976 and article
14 of the Convention. The defendant’s rules are applied in such a way that
although the Code of Conduct of the Bar applies to all Barristers in England
and Wales it particularly disadvantages ethnic Barristers who make up only a
small proportion of the membership of the Bar. The claimant again repeats para
20 of these Particulars.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">The reference in para 23 to refusal to allow sufficient
time to prepare is no longer relevant as that basis of claim did not survive
the hearing before Warby J. Para 20 of the pleading had alleged, inter alia,
that the BSB had acted knowing that it had no power to act because its actions
were in breach of its own rules and knowing that its action would injure the
claimant.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“63.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The relevant parts of the
appellant’s particulars of claim could be more clearly formulated and do
contain some surplus wording. In my judgment however she has, within paras
22-24 and 29, sufficiently pleaded a case that the BSB indirectly discriminated
against her on racial or ethnic grounds by bringing the disciplinary
‘prosecution’ against her. At 23 and 24 she alleges that in practice the
complaints process impacts disproportionately on BME barristers in particular
ways. These include the allegation that BME barristers are more likely to have
a complaint referred for prosecution. She also alleges, though it may not be
necessary for her to do so, that there is no objective reason to justify this
different treatment. At 29 she expressly alleges indirect discrimination in
that the relevant rules ‘are applied in such a way’ by the BSB that ‘it
particularly disadvantages black barristers’.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para17"></a><a name="para18">18.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At para 79 he concluded that the “act complained of” in the one human
rights claim that he held to be both adequately pleaded and sustainable for the
purposes of a summary judgment application was “the BSB’s ‘prosecution’ of the
appellant”. However, he also considered (at para 62) that the decision of the
Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights in <i>DH v Czech Republic</i>
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2007/922.html">(2008) 47 EHRR 3</a> showed that in an appropriate case statistics may be relied on
to establish that an applicant is a member of a group which has been treated
differently in practice from others in a comparable situation in a way which is
disproportionately prejudicial to members of that group, and thereby shift the
onus to the public body concerned to provide evidence of an objective and
reasonable justification for the difference.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para19">19.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the Court of Appeal Lord Dyson MR (at para 21) approached the issue
of limitation on the basis that the complaint was that the proceedings against
the appellant were in breach of article 14. Elias LJ (at paras 38 and 39)
suggested that some confusion had arisen over the article 14 claim. He
distinguished between an allegation of discriminatory treatment of the
appellant herself and a distinct, wider allegation that there is systemic
discrimination against BME barristers. In the former case the focus had to be
on the act or acts directed against the appellant and the limitation period
fell to be determined by reference to that act or those acts. In that regard
the disproportionate treatment of BME barristers was potentially evidence of
discrimination against the appellant herself. In the latter case each BME
barrister subjected to the disciplinary process would, on the analysis of <i>DH</i>,
be a victim with the right to take action to challenge the wider systemic
discrimination. The remedy for such a claim would, however, be different and it
was highly arguable that the limitation period would run from a different time.
In his view the operation of the limitation period had at all points in the
present proceedings been argued on the assumption that it ran by reference to
acts directed against the appellant. Accordingly, that gave rise to the
question whether the decision to bring disciplinary proceedings against her, as
an alleged act of discrimination, was a continuous act or not and if so,
whether it ran until the appeal was determined.</a></p><a name="para19">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para19"></a><a name="para20">20.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On this appeal counsel for the appellant, Mr Mark Anderson QC and Mr S
Chelvan, neither of whom appeared below, have made clear in their written case
and in the oral submissions of Mr Anderson that the appellant’s complaint is that
the disciplinary proceedings were brought against her for reasons which
infringe her Convention rights. The BSB’s written case states that the only act
complained of which survived the hearing before Warby J is the alleged
violation of article 14 by indirect discrimination pursuant to the <i>DH v
Czech Republic</i> line of Strasbourg case law. However, it later states that
the only surviving allegation of discrimination is that by bringing
disciplinary proceedings against the appellant, the respondent indirectly
discriminated against her contrary to article 14 pursuant to the <i>DH v Czech
Republic</i> line of Strasbourg case law.</a></p><a name="para20">

</span>I agree with Elias LJ as to the basis on which the claim has been
presented and I gratefully adopt his analysis. The appellant’s challenge is to
the conduct of the BSB in bringing and pursuing disciplinary proceedings
against her, not to an alleged state of affairs in which BME lawyers were more
likely to be the subject of such proceedings. The appellant’s reliance on <i>DH</i>
is intended to demonstrate that the disciplinary proceedings against her were
discriminatory. This has an important impact on the issue of limitation. The
bringing and pursuit of disciplinary proceedings must be the focus of the
investigation into “the date on which the act complained of took place”.</a></p><a name="para21">

<p class="ParaHeading">Section 7(5)(a): A series of acts or a single act?</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para21"></a><a name="para22">22.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The question which then arises in relation to the application of section
7(5)(a) to the present proceedings is whether the bringing of disciplinary
proceedings by the BSB is to be considered a series of discrete acts or a
single continuous act.</a></p><a name="para22">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para22"></a><a name="para23">23.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The expression “the date on which the act complained of took place” is
apt to address a single event. However, the provision should not be read
narrowly. There will be many situations in which the conduct which gives rise
to the infringement of a Convention right will not be an instantaneous act but
a course of conduct. The words of section 7(5)(a) should be given a meaning
which enables them to apply to a continuing act of alleged incompatibility.
While it is correct that section 7(5)(b) may often empower a court to grant an
extension of time to bring proceedings in respect of a course of conduct which
has extended over a period of longer than a year, leaving a claimant to have
recourse to such a discretionary remedy is inappropriate. It cannot justify
limiting the scope of section 7(5)(a). The primary provision in 7(5)(a) must be
capable of providing an effective and workable rule for situations where the
infringement arises from a course of conduct.</a></p><a name="para23">

</span>On behalf of the appellant, Mr Anderson submits that where a barrister
complains that she was prosecuted for reasons which infringe her Convention
rights, she is not complaining about each of the individual steps which
comprise the prosecution but about the fact that the BSB prosecuted her, a
state of affairs which lasted until the prosecution came to an end. He also
draws attention to section 6(6) of the 1998 Act which provides that an act
includes a failure to act. He submits that the BSB had the power to decide at
any moment after preferring the charges and before the verdict of the Visitors
that it would offer no evidence and, in certain circumstances, a duty to offer
no evidence. However, he accepts that the Court of Appeal was correct to
conclude that a failure to act does not arise in this case, provided that it is
accepted that the prosecution is a single continuous act.</a></p><a name="para25">

</span>On behalf of the BSB, Ms Padfield submits that the decision to refer the
appellant to a disciplinary tribunal, even if indirectly discriminatory, was a
one-off act with potentially continuing consequences rather than a continuing
violation. She submits that this is a case of alleged indirect discrimination
and that any unlawfulness does not automatically continue for as long as the
prosecution continues. She accepts that there is evidence of disproportionate
impact in relation to the decision to refer BME barristers to disciplinary
tribunals but submits that there is no evidence of disproportionate impact in
relation to the continuation of disciplinary prosecutions or the failure to
bring them to an end.</a></p><a name="para26">

</span>The only authority to which we were referred on this issue is <i>Somerville
v Scottish Ministers</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2007/44.html">[2007] UKHL 44</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2007/44.html">[2007] 1 WLR 2734</a>. This decision is,
however, not particularly illuminating on this point because of the variety of
views expressed. The petitioners were serving sentences of imprisonment and
were at various times segregated from other prisoners by monthly orders and
authorisations that were made over a period of time. They sought judicial
review of the decisions to segregate them on the ground that their Convention
rights had been infringed. Several of the periods of segregation had concluded
more than one year before the proceedings were brought. The House held that the
time limit in section 7(5) did not apply to the proceedings and the
observations on its operation were therefore obiter. Lord Hope of Craighead
stated (at paras 51-52) that he would hold that the phrase “the date on which
the act complained of took place” in section 7(5)(a) means, in the case of what
may properly be regarded as a continuing act of alleged incompatibility, that
time runs from the date when the continuing act ceased, not when it began.
Otherwise it would not be open to a person who was subjected to a continuing
act or failure to act which was made unlawful by section 6(1) to take proceedings
to bring it to an end without relying on section 7(5)(b) while it was still
continuing after the expiry of one year after its commencement. He also
considered that, so long as the proceedings were brought within the time
permitted by section 7(5)(a) and any longer period allowed under section
7(5)(b), damages may be awarded as just satisfaction for the whole of the
period over which the continuing act extends, including any part of it that
commenced before the period of one year prior to the date when the proceedings
were brought. The question whether the acts complained of in that case were
continuing acts or one-off acts with continuing consequences was not easy to
determine on the pleadings and he preferred to reserve his opinion on that point.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para28">28.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Mance, by contrast, (at para 197), considered that each monthly
order and authorisation constituted for the purpose of section 7(5) a separate
act in respect of which separate one year limitation periods would run. If a
period of segregation has lasted for more than a year the claimant would be
left to seek an extension of time under section 7(5)(b). Lord Rodger of
Earlsferry (at paras 145-146) preferred to express no view on the point but
considered Lord Mance’s approach at least arguable. Lord Walker of
Gestingthorpe (at para 167) did not expressly address the point but said he
agreed on all other issues with Lord Hope and Lord Rodger. Lord Scott of
Foscote (at para 81) observed that “act” includes “a failure to act”. In his
view it therefore followed that the one year beginning with the date on which
the act complained of took place should simply be calculated back from the date
on which the section 7(1)(a) proceedings were commenced.</a></p><a name="para28">

</span>I consider that the alleged infringement of Convention rights in the

disciplinary proceedings brought by the BSB necessarily involve a series of
steps, the essence of the complaint made here is the initiation and pursuit of
the proceedings to their conclusion, ie the entirety of the course of conduct
as opposed to any component steps. As Lord Dyson MR observed in the Court of
Appeal (at para 21) without expressing a concluded view on this issue,
prosecution is a single process in which the prosecutor takes many steps. It
cannot have been the intention of Parliament that each step should be an “act”
to which the one year limitation period should apply. I also note in this
regard that, were it otherwise, a prosecution which lasted longer than one year
could not be relied on in its entirety as a basis of complaint unless
proceedings were commenced before the conclusion of the disciplinary
proceedings or relief were granted under section 7(5)(b). A claimant would be
placed in the difficult position of having to bring a human rights claim within
one year of the commencement of what might be lengthy proceedings, without
knowing the outcome which might be very material to the claim.</a></p><a name="para29">

</span>On the basis that we are concerned here with a single continuing act of
alleged incompatibility, I agree with Lord Hope in <i>Somerville</i> (at para
51) that time runs from the date when the continuing act ceased, not when it
began.</a></p><a name="para30">

</span>In view of my conclusion on this issue, it is not necessary to consider
the appellant’s alternative argument based on a failure to act. I would,
however, suggest that it may, in certain other circumstances, be necessary to
guard against reliance on a failure to reverse an out-of-time decision which
would have the potential to subvert the limitation scheme of the Act.</a></p><a name="para31">

<p class="ParaHeading">When did the continuing act cease?</p>

</span>On the basis that the conduct challenged in these proceedings is the
single continuing act of bringing and pursuing disciplinary proceedings against
the appellant, it is necessary to consider when that continuing act ceased.</a></p><a name="para32">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para32"></a><a name="para33">33.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the Court of Appeal Lord Dyson MR, with whom the other members of
that court agreed, considered, at para 22, that the question for consideration
here was whether “opposing an appeal by a convicted defendant should be
regarded as a continuation of the prosecution”. His view was that it should not
be so regarded. He considered that a prosecution comes to an end with the
verdict when the prosecution has run its course. In opposing an appeal by a
convicted defendant a prosecutor is not continuing the prosecution but is
seeking to uphold the decision of the court or tribunal that has convicted the
defendant. In his view, seeking to uphold a conviction is a categorically
different act from that of prosecuting.</a></p><a name="para33">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para33"></a><a name="para34">34.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It appears that throughout the current proceedings the disciplinary
proceedings brought by the BSB against the appellant have been described as a
“prosecution”. This is, perhaps, an understandable analogy but it is imprecise
and may tend to obscure the fact that the complaint is of discrimination in
bringing disciplinary proceedings not a criminal prosecution. There is a danger
that this characterisation may influence the outcome on the current issue.
Whatever may be the position in relation to an appeal against a criminal
conviction, in considering whether in the present case the BSB’s conduct in
proceedings before the Visitors should be considered as forming part of the
same continuing act as its conduct in proceedings before the Disciplinary
Tribunal for the purpose of the rules on limitation, it is necessary to have
regard to the nature of the regulatory scheme and the precise features of such
conduct.</a></p><a name="para34">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para34"></a><a name="para35">35.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Several features of the regulatory scheme and the Visitors’
jurisdiction, as applicable to the disciplinary proceedings against this
appellant lead me to the conclusion that the BSB’s part in proceedings before
the Disciplinary Tribunal and those before the Visitors should be regarded for
this purpose as part of a single continuing act.</a></p><a name="para35">

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">(1)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In <i>In re S (A Barrister)</i> [1970] 1 QB 160 five judges sitting as
Visitors of the Inns of Court stated (at p 166G-H), that “[t]he judges as
visitors have always had supervisory powers and their decision, upon an appeal
by a barrister or student to them, has always been the final determination of
such matter”. The precise origins of the long-established visitorial
jurisdiction of the judges to hear disciplinary appeals from the Inns of Court
are obscure. (See J H Baker, Judicial Review of the judges as Visitors to the
Inns of Court, (1992) Public Law 411.) For present purposes it is sufficient to
record that in 1886 the Council of Judges resolved that “the jurisdiction as to
appeals from decisions of the benchers of the several Inns of Court is now
vested in the judges of the High Court”. (See <i>R v Visitors to the Inns of
Court, Ex p Calder</i> [1994] QB 1<i> </i>per Sir Donald Nicholls V-C at pp
35D-E). This arrangement continued notwithstanding the transfer by the Inns of
Court of their disciplinary function (other than the power to pronounce and
carry into effect any sentence) to the Senate of the Inns of Court in 1966 and
to the Council of the Inns of Court in 1986. The first Hearings before the Visitors
Rules were issued in 1980.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">(2)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>One aspect of the continuing supervisory jurisdiction of the Visitors was
apparent in their role in hearing applications and giving directions for the
conduct of the disciplinary proceedings. Regulation 9(1) of The Disciplinary
Tribunals Regulations 2009 (Annexe K to the Code of Conduct of the Bar of
England and Wales) required the President of a Disciplinary Tribunal to
designate a judge or judges to perform this function. The directions to be
given by a designated judge might concern (inter alia) the severance or strike
out of charges, the attendance of witnesses, the admission of documents, the
admission of facts and such other matters as the judge deemed expedient for the
efficient conduct of the hearing. In the proceedings against this appellant
Field J heard the appellant’s application to strike out the proceedings and
gave directions for their conduct.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">(3)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The function of the Visitors in hearing appeals from Disciplinary
Tribunals was a further aspect of this supervisory jurisdiction. The appeal
brought by this appellant was governed by the Hearings before the Visitors
Rules 2010 (Annexe M to the Code of Conduct).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">(4)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In cases where one or more charges of professional misconduct had been
proved, an appeal against conviction or sentence could be lodged by the
barrister as of right (Regulation 25(1) of The Disciplinary Tribunals
Regulations 2009).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">(5)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In certain circumstances (which did not arise in this case) the BSB could
appeal against the dismissal of a charge of professional misconduct with the
consent of the Chairman of the BSB or the Chairman of the Complaints Committee
or the permission of the visitors (Regulation 25(1)(c), 25(5) of The Disciplinary
Tribunals Regulations 2009).</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para35">(6)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On an appeal the Visitors were required to look afresh at the matters in
dispute and to form their own views. They were required to consider whether the
charge had been made out to their satisfaction, to the requisite standard of
proof. The proper approach was that of an appellate court rehearing the case on
its merits. (</a><a name="_Hlk497476776"><i>R v Visitors to the Inns of Court, Ex p
Calder</i> [1994] QB 1<i> </i>per Sir Donald Nicholls V-C at pp</a> 42D-F, 42H;
per Stuart-Smith LJ at pp 61H - 62D. See also <i>Lincoln v Daniels </i>[1962] 1
QB 237, per Devlin LJ at p 256.)</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">(7)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It was open to the Visitors to correct procedural defects and to remedy
procedural unfairness before the Disciplinary Tribunal. As Sir Andrew Collins
observed in delivering the judgment of the Visitors in the present case, the
Visitors were able to hear the matter entirely on its merits. They would give
the necessary protection to an appellant and it was not necessary for the
matter to be remitted for further consideration by the Tribunal.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">(8)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Following a finding or sentence of the Tribunal on a charge of
professional misconduct, the Treasurer of a defendant’s Inn was required to
pronounce and implement the sentence. However, the Treasurer was required first
to wait for 21 days to allow a notice of appeal to be lodged. Where a defendant
had given notice of appeal to the Visitors against a finding or sentence of the
Tribunal on a charge of professional misconduct, the pronouncement and
implementation of the sentence by the Treasurer of the defendant’s Inn were
automatically deferred (Regulation 27, The Disciplinary Tribunals Regulations
2009). The verdict of the Tribunal could not be put into effect until after the
decision of the Visitors on the appeal.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para36">36.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>These features, considered cumulatively, persuade me that the role of
the BSB in initiating and pursuing these proceedings before the Tribunal and
before the Visitors is essentially one continuing act. In these circumstances
it is not necessary to express any view as to whether the same conclusion
should be drawn in relation to an appeal against a criminal conviction.</a></p><a name="para36">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para36"></a><a name="para37">37.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Before leaving this issue, I should refer to a further submission of Mr
Anderson based on <i>Delcourt</i> <i>v Belgium </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1970/1.html">(1970) 1 EHRR 355</a> where the
Strasbourg court, in rejecting a submission that article 6 had no application
to the Belgian Court of Cassation because it was concerned not with the merits
of the case but with the validity of the judgment, observed:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Thus, a criminal charge is not
really ‘determined’ as long as the verdict of acquittal or conviction has not
become final. Criminal proceedings form an entity and must, in the ordinary
way, terminate in an enforceable decision. Proceedings in cassation are one
special stage of the criminal proceedings and their consequences may prove
decisive for the accused. It would therefore be hard to imagine that proceedings
in cassation fall outside the scope of article 6(1).” (at para 25)</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para38">38.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I do not find this passage of any assistance, even by way of analogy.
The Strasbourg court was there concerned with the distinct question as to the
scope of application of article 6. As Lord Dyson MR observed in the Court of
Appeal (at para 23) in relation to a similar submission based on <i>Eckle v
Federal Republic of Germany</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1982/4.html">(1982) 5 EHRR 1</a>, this does not touch on the
question whether the role of a prosecutor in appeal proceedings is to be considered
as a continuation of the act of prosecuting the defendant in the first place.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para39">39.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I would therefore allow the appeal. I consider that the conduct of the
BSB in bringing and pursuing the disciplinary proceedings was, for the purposes
of section 7(5)(a), a single continuing act which continued until the Visitors
to the Inns of Court allowed the appeal on 17 August 2012. The present
proceedings against the BSB, which were commenced on 21 February 2013, were
therefore commenced within a period of one year beginning with the date on
which the act complained of took place.</a></p><a name="para39">

<p class="ParaHeading">The respondent’s notice</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para39"></a><a name="para40">40.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>By its Notice of Objection dated 12 January 2017 the BSB asks this court
to uphold the Court of Appeal’s decision on the alternative ground that Warby J
was wrong to hold that the article 14 claim had real prospects of success. In
addition, it seeks permission to adduce new evidence of fact to counter the
conclusion of Warby J on this point.</a></p><a name="para40">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para40"></a><a name="para41">41.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Notice of Objection and the application to adduce new evidence
replicate a respondent’s notice and related application that were before the
Court of Appeal. Warby J had concluded that the particulars of claim both in
their unamended and draft amended forms adequately stated a case, which was not
fanciful, that by bringing disciplinary proceedings against the appellant, the
BSB indirectly discriminated against her contrary to article 14. In the light
of its conclusion as to the limitation period under section 7(5)(a) the Court
of Appeal did not address these matters in any detail or express any concluded
view. However, Lord Dyson did refer to the main submission made by Ms Padfield
for the BSB in this regard which, as before us, was, essentially that the
discrimination claim founded on Strasbourg decisions such as <i>DH v Czech Republic</i>
could have no real prospect of success without statistics sufficient to raise a
prima facie case of discrimination, general statements of disproportionate
impact being unlikely to be sufficient. In this regard Ms Padfield relied on <i>Oršuš
v Croatia</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2010/337.html">(2011) 52 EHRR 7</a>. Lord Dyson MR observed (at para 35) that, in
his view, there was considerable force in these points and that, at best, the
appellant’s case, on the basis of the evidence she had adduced so far, was very
thin.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para42">42.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Had this point been raised in isolation by BSB on an application for
permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal, it seems most unlikely that
permission would have been granted. It would have been a second appeal and it
would not have satisfied the second appeal criteria in that it does not raise
an important point of principle or practice and there is no other compelling
reason why an appeal should be heard (CPR 52.7 and 52.13). The point is now
before this court only because BSB took a limitation point which in my view
should fail. It is adventitious that it is before the court at all. Moreover,
it cannot be said that the respondent’s notice raises a point of law of general
public importance. In these circumstances, it would certainly be open to this
court to decline to entertain the ground in the respondent’s notice.</a></p><a name="para42">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para42"></a><a name="para43">43.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Nevertheless, in the light of the history of these proceedings, I
consider it appropriate to address the merits of the respondent’s notice. I can
do so briefly. I consider that Warby J was correct to conclude on the basis of
the evidence before him that there were reasonable grounds for bringing the
claim and that it had a real prospect of success. The appellant’s case is
based, in part, on a 2013 report by Inclusive Employers into the BSB’s
complaints system. That report analysed data from the period 2007-11 and
concluded that (i) BME barristers were disproportionately over-represented in
the complaints process in relation to the outcomes of external complaints; (ii)
BME barristers were more likely to have a complaint referred to disciplinary
action; and (iii) BME barristers were more likely to have complaints upheld.
The report went on to find that although there were steps the BSB could take to
improve the complaints process from an equality and diversity perspective - in
particular the provision of more prompt training for tribunal members which
included training in unconscious bias - the procedure itself was not
discriminatory and that other factors, as yet unidentified, were causing the
disproportions shown in the data. Ms Padfield for the BSB objects that the mere
fact of a statistical difference in treatment between two groups is not
sufficient to establish that there is prima facie evidence that the effect of a
measure or practice is discriminatory. I accept that in <i>DH</i> and in <i>Sampanis
v Greece </i>(Application No 32526/05), 5 June 2008 (Case Summary </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/ECHR/2011/1637.html">[2011] ECHR 1637</a>), the difference in
treatment between different groups was so striking as to amount, of itself, to <i>prima
facie</i> evidence that the effect was discriminatory and to require
explanation. That may not be the position in the present case. Nevertheless, I
consider that the appellant is entitled to rely on this evidence, so far as it
goes, in conjunction with the unhappy history of the proceedings against her,
as supporting her case that she has been the victim of discrimination. The
BSB’s submission in the present case rests on the fallacious assumption that an
inference from statistical difference in treatment is the only way in which a
claimant can establish an infringement of article 14. As the Strasbourg court
has made clear, indirect discrimination can be proved without statistical
evidence (<i>DH</i> at para 188; <i>Oršuš</i> at para 153).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para44">44.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Finally, Ms Padfield seeks, by her application to adduce new evidence,
to produce a further report by the BSB’s research department dated January 2016
and entitled “Complaints at the Bar: An Analysis of ethnicity and gender
2012-2014”, in order to counter the 2013 report. I would refuse the application.
It is not appropriate for this court to address, for the first time in the
course of these proceedings, competing submissions of fact on a strike out
application.</a></p><a name="para44">
