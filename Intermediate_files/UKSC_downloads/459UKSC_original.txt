</span>The appellant is a national of Sri Lanka. He arrived in the UK in
January 2005, then aged 28, and was given leave to enter as a student. His
leave to remain was extended to 30 September 2008. Shortly before its expiry he
applied for a further extension. This was refused on 11 December 2008. He
claimed asylum on 5 January 2009 on the grounds, in summary, that he had been a
member of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (“LTTE”), he had been detained
and tortured by the Sri Lankan security forces, and, if returned to Sri Lanka,
he was at risk of further ill-treatment for the same reason.</a></p><a name="para5">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellant’s application was refused by the respondent on 23 February
2009. The respondent did not dispute the core of the appellant’s account, that
he had been a member of the LTTE and had been detained and tortured for that
reason, but she did not accept that he would be of continuing interest to the
Sri Lankan authorities or at risk of further ill-treatment if he were returned.</a></p><a name="para6">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellant appealed against the respondent’s decision. It is not
necessary to set out full details of the procedural history, but ultimately his
appeal formed part of a decision by the Upper Tribunal, dated 5 July 2013,
giving “Country Guidance” on the risk to Tamils following the end of the Sri
Lankan civil war: <i>GJ and Others (post-civil war: returnees) Sri Lanka CG</i>
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKUT/IAC/2013/00319_ukut_iac_gj_ors_srilanka_cg.html">[2013] UKUT 319 (IAC)</a>.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Upper Tribunal had medical evidence that the appellant bore scars on
his chest and upper and lower limbs which were “highly consistent” with his
account of being beaten with blunt instruments, burned with cigarettes and an
iron bar, and his hand cut with a knife. It also had evidence of a
psychiatrist, who had examined the appellant and had access to his medical
records in the UK, that he was suffering severe post-traumatic stress disorder
and severe depression, he showed a high degree of suicidality and he appeared
to have a serious determination to kill himself if he were returned to Sri
Lanka. The appellant did not himself give evidence. The psychiatrist did not
consider him fit to do so.</a></p><a name="para8">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para8"></a><a name="para9">9.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Upper Tribunal accepted that the appellant had a genuine fear of
return to Sri Lanka, and that he had difficulty in trusting or interacting with
official figures, even in the UK, because of his past torture, but it rejected
his appeal under the Refugee Convention and the Qualification Directive because
it did not accept that he was of any continuing interest to the authorities in
Sri Lanka. However, it allowed his appeal under article 3 of the European
Convention on Human Rights. It explained its reasoning in the following
paragraphs:</a></p><a name="para9">

</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para9">“453.&nbsp; Although the appeal fails
under the Refugee Convention and Qualification Directive, we must consider
whether the suicide risk which this appellant presents is such as to engage article
3 ECHR. Applying the <i>J </i>and <i>Y </i>principles [<i>J v Secretary of State
for the Home Department </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2005/629.html">[2005] EWCA Civ 629</a> and<i> Y (Sri Lanka) v Secretary
of State for the Home Department </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2009/362.html">[2009] EWCA Civ 362</a>] and reminding
ourselves of the gravity of the appellant’s past experience of ill-treatment
and his current grave mental health problems, with severe forms of both
post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, we have considered whether
returning the appellant to Sri Lanka will breach the United Kingdom’s international
obligations under article 3.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">454.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The evidence is that there
are only 25 working psychiatrists in the whole of Sri Lanka. Although there are
some mental health facilities in Sri Lanka, at para 4 of the April 2012 UKBA
Operational Guidance Note on Sri Lanka, it records an observation by Basic
Needs that ‘money that is spent on mental health only really goes to the large
mental health institutions in capital cities, which are inaccessible and do not
provide appropriate care for mentally ill people’.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">…</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">456.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We note that the … appellant
is considered by his experienced Consultant Psychiatrist to have clear plans to
commit suicide if he is returned and that he is mentally very ill, too ill to give
reliable evidence. We approach assessment of his circumstances on the basis
that it would be possible for the respondent to return to return the … appellant
to Sri Lanka without his coming to harm, but once there, he would be in the
hands of the Sri Lankan mental health services. The resources in Sri Lanka are
sparse and limited to the cities. In the light of the respondent’s own evidence
in her OGN that there are facilities only in the cities and that they ‘do not
provide appropriate care for mentally ill people’ and of the severity of this
appellant’s mental illness, we are not satisfied on the particular facts of
this appeal, that returning him to Sri Lanka today complies with the United
Kingdom’s international obligations under article 3 ECHR.”</p>

</span>The Upper Tribunal’s decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal: </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2014/829.html">[2014] EWCA Civ 829</a>. Maurice Kay LJ, with whom the other members of the court agreed,
said that in his judgment “the Qualification Directive was not intended to
catch article 3 cases where the risk is to health or of suicide rather than of
persecution” (para 48). He referred to the decision of the European Court of
Human Rights in <i>N v United Kingdom </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2008/453.html">(2008) 47 EHRR 39</a> (a case of an AIDS
sufferer who claimed that her removal to Uganda would contravene article 3) as
showing that cases where the risk to an applicant arose from his health were a
special category to which article 3 applied only in very exceptional
circumstances, because “in such cases the alleged future harm would emanate not
from the intentional acts or omissions of public authorities or non-state
bodies, but instead from a naturally occurring illness and the lack of
sufficient resources to deal with it in the receiving country” (para 43). Counsel
for the appellant submitted that it made a critical difference to the
applicability of the Qualification Directive that the Sri Lankan state was
responsible for his mental illness by its past ill treatment, but Maurice Kay
LJ considered that this argument stretched the concept of subsidiary protection
too far.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is argued on the appellant’s behalf that the Upper Tribunal and the
Court of Appeal took too narrow a view of the scope of the Qualification
Directive. It is his case that his mental illness should not be regarded as a
“naturally occurring illness”, because it was caused by torture at the hands of
the Sri Lankan authorities. Instead, it is submitted that, just as the Upper
Tribunal accepted that on the facts of this case the appellant’s return would
cause him severe mental harm which, taking into account his history of ill
treatment by the state and the inadequacy of facilities to treat its
consequences, would amount to a violation of ECHR article 3, so for similar
reasons it should have accepted that he was entitled to subsidiary protection
status under the Qualification Directive. According to this argument, it makes
no difference to his entitlement to such protection that there is no longer a
risk of repetition of the ill treatment which is the cause of his current state
of health.</a></p><a name="para11">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The respondent submits that the Upper Tribunal and Court of Appeal were
right. It is her case that it is a necessary component of subsidiary protection
that there exists a risk of serious harm, as defined in article 15 of the
Qualification Directive, in the country of origin for which the home state will
be responsible, in that it will either inflict that harm or it will be
inflicted by a non-state actor against which the state is unable or unwilling
to provide protection. Put shortly, according to her argument, the Directive is
aimed at providing international protection against the risk of serious harm
from <i>future</i> ill treatment, either by the state or by a third party
against which the state cannot or will not provide protection, and not at
potential future consequences of <i>past</i> ill treatment of which there is no
risk of repetition.</a></p><a name="para12">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This court was referred to a number of authorities of the Court of
Justice of the European Union, including <i>M’Bodj</i> <i>v Kingdom of Belgium </i>(Case
C-542/13) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2014/C54213.html">[2015] 1 WLR 3059</a>, and of the European Court of Human Rights, but
none is precisely in point. The question of principle which the appeal raises
is debatable and should therefore be referred to the Court of Justice. The
question to be referred is: Does article 2(e), read with article 15(b), of the
Qualification Directive cover a real risk of serious harm to the physical or
psychological health of the applicant if returned to the country of origin,
resulting from previous torture or inhuman or degrading treatment for which the
country of origin was responsible?</p>
