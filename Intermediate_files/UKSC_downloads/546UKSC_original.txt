<p class="NewSpeech">LADY HALE: (<span style="text-transform:none">with whom Lord
Clarke, Lord Wilson, Lord Carnwath and Lord Hodge agree)</span></p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1">1.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The interface between health and social care is a difficult and
controversial policy area. In general, health care is provided or arranged by
the National Health Service, and is free for all patients irrespective of
means, while social care is provided or arranged by local authorities with
means-tested contributions from those clients who are deemed able to pay for
some or all of it themselves. This case is not about the rights or wrongs of
that general policy. This case is about who is legally responsible for paying
for the work done by registered nurses in social rather than health care
settings. Is the National Health Service responsible for all the work they do
or are the social care funders responsible for at least some of it? The issue
happens to arise in relation to Wales, where the legislation has since changed,
as has the legislation in England, but very similar issues arise under the
legislation now in force.</a></p><a name="para1">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1"></a><a name="para2">2.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The issue is the correct interpretation and application of section 49 of
the Health and Social Care Act 2001, which is headed <b>Exclusion of nursing
care from community care services</b>:</a></p><a name="para2">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing in the enactments

a local authority, in or in connection with the provision of any such services,

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The social care funders contend that this means that the NHS, in the
shape of the Local Health Boards, is required to fund the full cost of a
registered nurse’s presence in a care home. This is in the context of
regulation 18(3) of the Care Homes (Wales) Regulations 2002 (SI 2002/324),
which requires that:</a></p><a name="para3">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Where the care home -</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; provides nursing to

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; provides, whether or
not in connection with nursing, medicines or medical treatment to service
users,</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">the registered person <i>shall
ensure that at all times a suitably qualified registered nurse is working at
the care home</i>.” (emphasis supplied)</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para3"></a><a name="para4">4.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Local Health Boards, on the other hand, contend that the nurse’s
time can be divided into a series of discrete tasks or functions, some of which
do not need to be provided by a registered nurse, so that they are responsible
for only a proportion of her time working in the home.</a></p><a name="para4">

<p class="ParaHeading">How the dispute arose</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para4"></a><a name="para5">5.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In practice, Local Health Boards pay for nurses’ time in social care
homes by a weekly flat rate payment for each care home resident who qualifies
for some nursing care. Between September and November 2013, every Local Health
Board in Wales decided to set the rate at £128.61 per resident per week. This
was an increase on what they had previously been paying. Their decisions took
account of a report by healthcare consultants Laing &amp; Buisson.</a></p><a name="para5">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para5"></a><a name="para6">6.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Laing &amp; Buisson conducted a survey which asked nurses to record and
categorise the time they spent during a particular shift into: (a) direct
nursing care time, (b) indirect nursing care time (eg management of medicines,
overall care planning, and hygiene standards), (c) non-nursing care time (eg
social care including dressing and washing), and (d) other time (including
stand-by time, paid breaks and time spent receiving supervision). They
commented that splitting nurses time and costs in such detail was “always
likely to prove challenging”. If social care were excluded, homes might be
“inclined to minimise nurses’ participation in providing holistic and integrated
nursing and social care support for residents”. “Would it not be a lot
simpler”, they asked, “just for the NHS to pay for the full direct salary cost
of registered nurses, rather than argue about the split between nursing and
non-nursing care?” (NHS Wales Funded Nursing Care Review 2013, Laing &amp;

</span>The Health Boards decided that time in categories (c) and (d) did not
fall within the definition of “nursing care by a registered nurse” in section
49(2) and therefore they would not fund it. This resulted in a weekly payment
which was £27.33 lower than it would have been had that time been included. It
has been estimated that the overall cost to the Health Boards in Wales if it
were included would be between £7 and £13m a year.</a></p><a name="para7">

</span>The decisions of the seven Local Health Boards, covering the whole of
Wales, to set the flat rate at £128.61 (subsequently increased in accordance
with an inflationary uplift mechanism which is not now disputed) were
originally challenged by 11 owners and operators of care homes in Wales. All
the local authorities in Wales were joined as interested parties. They (with
the exception of the County Council of the City and County of Cardiff, which
has taken no part in these proceedings) have effectively taken over the conduct
of the case from the care home owners. The Welsh Ministers were also joined as
interested parties but have taken no part in this appeal. The Secretary of
State for Health, who is responsible for the NHS in England, has intervened in
the appeal in support of the Local Health Boards.</a></p><a name="para8">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The care homes’ challenge, on the ground that too restrictive an
interpretation of “nursing care by a registered nurse” had been adopted,
succeeded before Hickinbottom J: </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2015/601.html">[2015] EWHC 601 (Admin)</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2015/601.html">[2015] PTSR 945</a>. He
rejected the Health Boards’ argument that it covered care which could only be
provided by a registered nurse and accepted the challengers’ argument that it
covered all the services in fact provided by a registered nurse. Hence he
quashed the Health Boards’ decision.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On appeal, the Health Boards conceded, as they had done below, that they
had been wrong to exclude the nurses’ stand-by time (part of (d) in para 6
above) from their calculations. Subject to that, the Court of Appeal, by a
majority, allowed their appeal: </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2016/26.html">[2016] EWCA Civ 26</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2016/26.html">[2016] PTSR 908</a>. Laws LJ
gave the leading judgment. He held that the Judge’s construction gave
insufficient weight to the excepting words at the end of section 49(2). These
clearly distinguished between different services provided by a nurse at a care
home. It did not follow from the fact that a nurse needed to be on call at all
times that everything she did while on duty was a service which needed to be
provided by a registered nurse. Whether what she did fell within the definition
was a factual rather than a legal question.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Elias LJ agreed that section 49(2) envisaged that there would be some
services provided by a registered nurse which would not fall within the concept
of “nursing care by a registered nurse”. But it followed from the requirement
to have a nurse or nurses in attendance at all times that the Health Boards had
to pay for all the arrangements necessary to secure this, so not only stand-by
time, but also meal breaks, supervision and administrative tasks associated
with it. But if the costs were increased because she also provided social care
that was not a service for which the Health Boards should pay.</a></p><a name="para11">

</span>Lloyd Jones LJ agreed with Laws LJ. Distinguishing between the services
provided by the nurse inevitably involved what had been referred to as a “task-based
approach” apportioning her time according to how she spent it. He also agreed
that it did not follow from the fact that a nurse had to be there at all times
that everything she did while there was the responsibility of the Health
Boards. The approach adopted by Elias LJ was inconsistent with the agreed
requirement to distinguish between different categories of services.</a></p><a name="para12">

</span>The powers and duties of local authorities in relation to what is now
called social care were contained in a series of enactments which have now been
replaced, in Wales, by the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014 and,
in England, by the Care Act 2014. At the relevant time, section 47 of the
National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 required a local authority,
where it appeared that a person for whom they were responsible might be in need
of community care services, to carry out an assessment of his need for those
services and decide whether his needs called for them to provide such services.
“Community care services” were defined in section 46 of the 1990 Act as
services which a local authority might provide or arrange under a number of
enactments, including Part III of the National Assistance Act 1948. Part III of
the 1948 Act included section 21(1)(a), under which local authorities could
provide or arrange “residential accommodation” for adults who “by reason of
age, illness, disability or any other circumstances are in need of care and
attention which is not otherwise available to them”, in other words care homes.
This was a duty owed to people ordinarily resident in their area and other
persons in urgent need (Local Authority Circular LAC (93)10).</a></p><a name="para14">

</span>Under section 12, the Welsh Ministers may direct the Local Health Boards
established under section 11 to exercise these functions. The effect of the
directions current at the relevant time (the National Health Service (Nursing Care
in Residential Accommodation) (Wales) Directions 2004) was that Local Health
Boards were obliged to provide nursing care for those who required it,
including those accommodated in care homes by local authorities. In practice,
there are three categories of resident in care homes:</a></p><a name="para17">

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A resident who has a
“primary need” for health care. Local Health Boards fund the whole of her care,
both nursing and non-nursing, and her accommodation. This is known as
“Continuing Health Care”.</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A resident who
requires some health care but for whom this is not a primary need. Local Health
Boards fund the nursing care which she needs, known as “Funded Nursing Care”,
while the resident herself, or the local authority, or both, fund the rest of
her care and accommodation.</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A resident who
requires no nursing care. The whole of her care and accommodation will be
funded by the resident, or by the local authority, or by both.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This case is concerned with the funding of nursing care for residents in
category (2). The extent to which a local authority is neither allowed nor
required to fund such care is governed by section 49 of the 2001 Act
(subsequently replaced by section 47 of the 2014 Act, section 47(10) of which
defines nursing care by a registered nurse in almost identical terms to section
49(2)). The case has been argued throughout on the basis that, if a local
authority is not permitted to fund such care, then the Local Health Boards are
required, under section 3(1) of the 2006 Act, to do so: there will be no
“funding gap”.</a></p><a name="para18">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Part of the background to the enactment of section 49 is the decision of
the Court of Appeal in <i>R v North and East Devon Health Authority, Ex p
Coughlan</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1999/1871.html">[2001] QB 213</a> (upholding the decision of the first instance
Judge). The claimant was severely disabled as a result of a road traffic
accident. She and others were placed in an NHS home for long term disabled
people and assured that this would be their home for life. Then the health authority
decided that they were in need of only “general” rather than “specialist”
nursing services and that these should be purchased by the local authority
rather than provided by the NHS. So the health authority decided to close the
home and transfer their long-term care to the local authority. The case is
generally known for holding that to close the home would be an unjustified
breach of the legitimate expectations engendered by the health authority’s
promise and thus an abuse of power. But it is also important for its discussion
of when nursing care could, and could not, be provided by local authorities in
residential accommodation which they provided or arranged under section 21 of
the 1948 Act. On the one hand, section 21(5) included in the provision of
accommodation “board and other services, amenities and requisites provided in
connection with the accommodation”. This could obviously include nursing care
for those residents who needed it. On the other hand, section 21(8) excluded
anything “authorised or required to be provided under the National Health
Service Act 1977”. The court held that this was “limited to those health
services which, in fact, have been authorised or required to be provided under
the 1977 Act”. It did not include “services which the Secretary of State [had]
legitimately decided under section 3(1) of the 1977 Act it was not necessary
for the NHS to provide” (per Lord Woolf MR, at para 29). There was no precise
dividing line between those nursing services which are and those which are not
capable of being treated as included in the “package of care” provided by the
local authority (para 30(d)). But it could not be based solely on whether the
nursing care was “general” or “specialist”. The distinction was one of degree
which would depend upon the facts of the individual case:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“However, as a very general
indication as to where the line is to be drawn, it can be said that if the
nursing services are (i) merely incidental or ancillary to the provision of the
accommodation which a local authority is under a duty to provide … and (ii) of
a nature which it can be expected that an authority whose primary
responsibility is to provide social services can be expected to provide, then
they can be provided under section 21.” (para 30(e))</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para20">20.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The court acknowledged Mr Gordon’s submission, on behalf of the
claimant, that this was unfair: if a person received comparable nursing
services in a hospital or at home, they would be free of charge. But that
unfairness was part of the statutory scheme (para 30(c)). However, the NHS
eligibility criteria could not place responsibility on a local authority which
went beyond what section 21 permitted. These patients’ health care needs went
far beyond that. Hence the closure decision was unlawful.</a></p><a name="para20">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para20"></a><a name="para21">21.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>But the matter did not rest there. The other part of the background to
section 49 of the 2001 Act is the Report of the Royal Commission on Long Term
Care (chaired by Sir Stewart Sutherland), <i>With Respect to Old Age: Long Term
Care - Rights and Responsibilities </i>(Cm 4192-I), published in March 1999
between the first instance and Court of Appeal judgments in the <i>Coughlan </i>case.
This made two main recommendations. The first was that all nursing care,
wherever it was delivered, should be free and funded by the NHS (recommendation
6.3 (para 6.26)). The current situation was “not justified or defensible”. By
nursing care was meant “care which involves the knowledge or skills of a qualified
nurse” (para 6.22). The second was that all personal care should also be free
of charge and funded from general taxation (recommendation 6.4 (para 6.37)). By
personal care was meant care which “involves touching a person’s body. … It
falls within the internationally recognised definition of nursing but may be
delivered by many people who are not nurses …” (para 6.43). A long list of such
tasks was provided (para 6.44).</a></p><a name="para21">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There was a Note of Dissent by Joel Joffe and David Lipsey. They agreed
that the position on nursing care was a “glaring anomaly” and that it should be
free and funded by the NHS wherever it was provided. But they defined it
strictly as “that care which requires the specific knowledge and skills which
only a registered nurse can provide” and then gave examples (para 65). Further,
the dissenters could “not go along with” the central recommendation of the
majority that personal care should be provided free of charge (para 1). This
would cost a great deal of money while doing nothing to increase the funds
actually devoted to personal care or to improve the quality of services
provided.</a></p><a name="para22">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Government published its response in July 2000, <i>The NHS Plan: The
Government’s response to the Royal Commission on Long Term Care </i>(Cm
4818-II). This rejected the recommendation on personal care, believing it not
to be the best use of resources. But it accepted the recommendation on nursing
care (para 2.5). This would require primary legislation, which would be
introduced as soon as possible, with a view to introducing free NHS nursing
care in all nursing homes by October 2001 (para 2.8). Crucially:</a></p><a name="para23">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“2.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the future, the NHS
will meet <i>the costs of registered nurse time spent on providing, delegating

care than proposed in the Note of Dissent to the Royal Commission report, which
suggested it should include those tasks that only a registered nurse could
undertake.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">2.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore people
identified as needing nursing home care will no longer have to meet <i>any of

</span>Section 49 was enacted as a result. The Explanatory Notes to the 2001

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>We have been referred to various ministerial statements made during the
Parliamentary debates on the 2001 Bill, but I do not regard those statements as
sufficiently clear and unequivocal to meet the stringent tests of admissibility
laid down in <i>Pepper v Hart </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1992/3.html">[1993] AC 593</a> and <i>R v Secretary of State

by the tasks that he or she performs” (Hansard, Standing Committee E, 6
February 2001, col 442); it is quite another thing to say that there is no
limit to the work done by a registered nurse in a care home for which the NHS
must pay. We are, however, entitled to take into account the preceding reports
and explanatory notes to identify the mischief at which the legislation was
aimed and the proposed solution to it.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">The issue and the arguments</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para26">26.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There is no doubt that the mischief at which section 49 was aimed was
the “glaring anomaly” that nursing care was either provided free by the NHS or
bought in by the local authority or residents depending on where it was
provided. It was clearly intended to shift the boundary established by the <i>Coughlan
</i>decision further in the direction of NHS funding. But the question remains
whether “nursing care by a registered nurse” covers everything that is done by
a registered nurse in a care home, as it would in a hospital or other health
service setting or (probably) in the patient’s own home, as the appellant local
authorities contend, or whether it covers only some of what she does, as the
Health Boards contend. This turns on the meaning and purpose of the concluding
words in section 49(2):</a></p><a name="para26">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… other than any services which,
having regard to their nature and the circumstances in which they are provided,
do not need to be provided by a registered nurse.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Had those words not been there, there is no doubt that
the local authorities’ interpretation would be correct and the NHS would have
to pay for all the time spent by a registered nurse in a care home providing,
planning, supervising or delegating care of any sort, at least for those
residents whose needs were the reason for her presence. So the question is: why
are those words there and what do they mean?</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para26"></a><a name="para27">27.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There are no other decided cases which have discussed this question,
perhaps surprisingly, given how important it is, not only to the Health Boards
and local authorities in Wales, but also to thousands of care home residents
who fund or contribute to the funding of their own care, as well as to those in
England where the legislation is in similar terms. Section 49 is referred to in
two cases, <i>R (Grogan) v Bexley NHS Care Trust </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2006/44.html">[2006] EWHC 44 (Admin)</a>;
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2006/44.html">[2006] LGR 491</a>) and <i>R (St Helens Borough Council v Manchester Primary Care
Trust </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2008/931.html">[2008] EWCA Civ 931</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2008/931.html">[2009] PTSR 105</a>, but in both cases the issue was
the criteria for deciding whether an individual qualified for continuing NHS
care (category (1) residents in para 17 earlier), with the consequence that the
NHS was responsible for all their care costs, or whether they fell within the
scheme under discussion here, in which case those costs might be shared. There
was no detailed discussion of how those costs are to be shared, which is the
issue in this case.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para28">28.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Much of the oral argument in this court focussed upon the consequences
of the requirement in regulation 18(3) of the Care Homes (Wales) Regulations
2002, that if a home “(a) provides nursing to service users; and (b) provides
whether or not in connection with nursing, medicines or medical treatment to
service users” a suitably qualified registered nurse must be working there at
all times. This means that in such homes there must always be a registered
nurse on duty, even if she is doing nothing. This would in practice be the case
even without regulation 18(3), because, as was the evidence at first instance,
if a home has residents who need nursing care “they [will] need to be cared for
in an environment where a registered nurse is available on a 24 hour basis.
This will usually be because of the complexity, intensity or unpredictability
of their needs” (First Witness Statement of Victoria Warner, para 8). The Local
Health Boards therefore accepted before the judge that time spent on “stand-by”
should have been included in the time for which they should pay. Mr Gordon, for
the local authorities, argues that this means that they should pay for all the
time that the nurse is there. She has to be there all the time and therefore
all the services which she is providing while she is there need to be provided
by her. Thus, the argument goes, even if the Health Boards are in principle
correct to divide up the nurse’s time according to what she is doing, in
practice whatever she is doing needs to be done by her because she has to be
there.</a></p><a name="para28">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para28"></a><a name="para29">29.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This approach, it is argued, does not ignore the closing words of
section 49(2) for two reasons. First, the NHS does not have to pay for roles
which happen to be done by a registered nurse but could just as well be done by
someone else. In many homes, for example, the manager is a registered nurse,
but the manager’s role does not need to be performed by a registered nurse.
This argument does accept that “nursing care by a registered nurse” is defined
by the sort of work the nurse is doing rather than by her formal
qualifications. But defining her role is different from parcelling up her time
in the manner put forward by the Health Boards. Against this, the Health Boards
argue that the NHS is already protected by section 49 from having to pay for
registered nurses doing something other than providing, arranging or
supervising care. But it cannot have been intended that it should have to pay
the full costs of employing a manager if she is also fulfilling the “on call”
requirement.</a></p><a name="para29">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para29"></a><a name="para30">30.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The second reason for suggesting that the local authorities’ approach
does not ignore the closing words is that the NHS does not have to pay for
over-staffing. If the home only needs there to be one nurse on duty at all times,
then the services provided by other nurses do not need to be provided by a
registered nurse. Against this, the Health Boards argue that even if there are
more nurses than required, the NHS still has to pay for that part of their work
which does need to be done by a registered nurse.</a></p><a name="para30">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para30"></a><a name="para31">31.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Overall, the Health Boards and the Secretary of State argue that the
Government’s policy decision was that personal care should be provided or
arranged by local authorities and subject to means-tested charges. It would be contrary
to that policy to oblige the NHS to pay the costs of personal care which
happened to be provided by a registered nurse and absurd to make it pay the
cost of a registered nurse on stand-by fulfilling some completely different
role. Their interpretation encourages efficiency: homes should arrange their
business so that nurses spend as much time as possible on nursing care, but
when they are not, their time should be used productively on personal care
rather than standing idle. Dividing up the nurses’ time between nursing and
non-nursing tasks is the only way to make sense of section 49 as a whole,
including the closing words.</a></p><a name="para31">

<p class="ParaHeading">Discussion</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para31"></a><a name="para32">32.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The parties in this appeal have adopted diametrically opposed positions.
The Health Boards and Secretary of State argue that the consistent view of the
case law has been to respect the decisions of the NHS as to what services are
necessary to meet all reasonable requirements, under section 3(1) of the 2006
Act, subject only to challenge on the usual judicial review grounds. Thus, it
is said, there is nothing unusual in the NHS defining the limits of its
responsibilities for itself. The proper construction of section 49(2) depends
upon what the NHS decides is reasonably required. Against this, it is true that
the courts have normally respected those decisions, subject only to challenges
on conventional judicial review grounds; but in this case the NHS is arguing
that it should be free to define the extent of the responsibilities of <i>others</i>,
the local authorities or residents, by deciding for itself what is and what is
not a nursing task, because all are agreed that there should be no funding gap
between what is funded by the NHS and what is funded by local authorities with
means-tested contributions from the clients. The limits of the local
authorities’ responsibilities are defined by Parliament in section 49. If
Parliament had wanted to leave the division of responsibility in the hands of
the NHS, it could and would have left the <i>Coughlan </i>decision undisturbed.</a></p><a name="para32">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para32"></a><a name="para33">33.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On the other hand, the local authorities’ primary argument before this
Court was that the court should focus on the <i>application</i> rather than the
interpretation of section 49. If it is accepted that the NHS must fund the
presence of a nurse who is there to fulfil the legal or practical requirement
that a nurse must be on duty at all times, then it follows that the NHS must
fund everything that that nurse does while on call in this way. This cannot be
correct. The task of this court is to interpret the meaning of the words used
by Parliament to impose a restriction on what local authorities may provide or
arrange and thus indirectly to impose an obligation on the NHS to fund what the
local authorities cannot provide or arrange. Interpretation must come before
application. Once interpreted, it is for those on the ground to put that
interpretation into practice.</a></p><a name="para33">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para33"></a><a name="para34">34.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Before turning to that task, it is worth bearing in mind that the
current practice does not in fact reflect the logic of the Health Boards’
interpretation. Their task-based approach would logically require an
individualised assessment of what is in fact done by each registered nurse
working in a care home and dividing it into nursing and non-nursing tasks.
Instead, the Health Boards have relied on a survey to produce an average result
and thus a flat rate contribution across the board. Furthermore, it appears
that this is only done in relation to nurses’ time in care homes. Section 49
applies to all kinds of community care services, including services in the
clients’ own homes, but we have no evidence of a similar apportionment being
made in relation to home nursing services. Nor, of course, does it take place
in hospital, where nurses may well spend time doing other tasks than those which
the NHS argues are covered by section 49. The courts below accepted that this
was the only practical solution to the problem but it is not necessarily
logical.</a></p><a name="para34">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para34"></a><a name="para35">35.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I start from the proposition that, in passing the 2001 Act, Parliament
did not intend to leave the division of responsibility in the hands of the NHS.
It clearly intended to provide a test, but a different test from that in
section 21(8) of the 1948 Act (para 15 above). It must also have intended to
depart from the position established in <i>Coughlan</i>, which depended upon
the test in section 21(8).</a></p><a name="para35">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para35"></a><a name="para36">36.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In construing the test in section 49(2), I bear in mind that, if
Parliament had wanted to restrict the definition of “nursing care by a
registered nurse” to tasks which can <i>only</i> be performed by a registered nurse,
it both could and would have said so. It did not. The Government’s response to
the Royal Commission report clearly envisaged a wider test than that put
forward by the dissenters to that report.</a></p><a name="para36">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para36"></a><a name="para37">37.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On the other hand, if Parliament had wanted to prohibit local
authorities from paying for anything done by a registered nurse in a care home,
it both could and would have said so. It did not. It began with the broad
concept of “any services provided by a registered nurse” but then limited those
services in two ways. First, they must be services “involving” the provision,
planning, supervision or delegation of “care”. So they are limited to services
which have to do with the care of residents, that is, with looking after them.
However, they are not limited to nursing services or nursing care. They could
involve any form of care, nursing, personal or social.</a></p><a name="para37">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para37"></a><a name="para38">38.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Secondly, however, “services which <i>having regard to their nature and
the circumstances in which they are provided</i>, do not need to be provided by
a registered nurse” are excluded. This clearly envisages that there will be
circumstances in which <i>some</i> personal or non-nursing care <i>will</i>
need to be provided by a registered nurse. Care which is associated with or
ancillary to the nursing care which she is providing obviously needs to be
provided by her. When a registered nurse is engaged in providing nursing care,
it makes no sense to say that she does not need to do the other things that the
resident needs to have done while she is providing the nursing care.</a></p><a name="para38">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para38"></a><a name="para39">39.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For example, there may be a reason why a nurse needs to take a patient
to the lavatory. The tasks associated with taking a resident to the lavatory
cannot be parcelled up between two carers in this way. Whoever is doing them
needs to do them all. That applies to all sorts of caring tasks which a nurse
needs to do for some reason and which cannot sensibly be parcelled up between nursing
and non-nursing tasks.</a></p><a name="para39">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para39"></a><a name="para40">40.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>One service which a nurse undoubtedly has to do is to provide, as the
Laing and Buisson report puts it, “an overall, holistic, person-centred plan”
for each resident who needs some nursing care (p 6). In the course of doing
this, she may very well have to engage in social and personal care tasks in
order to understand the overall needs of the resident and provide an appropriate
care plan to meet them.</a></p><a name="para40">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para40"></a><a name="para41">41.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>We are, by definition, looking at the funding of the care of residents
who, although health care is not a “primary need” do have a need for some
nursing care. That has to be provided by a registered nurse. Other kinds of
care which are ancillary to or associated with the nursing care which these
residents need does also have to be provided by a registered nurse. Any other
approach is contrary to the holistic view which is now taken of looking after
the whole person. It is a matter of fact what part of the care provided by
registered nurses to residents who have a need for some nursing will fall
within this definition; it may or may not be a substantial part of their care;
but that is a matter for the decision-makers and not for us.</a></p><a name="para41">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para41"></a><a name="para42">42.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I would also accept the view that time spent on paid breaks falls within
the definition of “nursing care by a registered nurse”. Part of providing their
caring services is taking the breaks necessary to be able to provide those
services properly. The same applies to time spent receiving supervision, which
is also a necessary part of providing the caring services they are there to
provide.</a></p><a name="para42">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para42"></a><a name="para43">43.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This construction is close, but not identical, to the third argument put
forward in the local authorities’ case. Their first and second arguments, as we
have seen, were that the NHS should pay for everything done by a registered
nurse whose presence was required in a care home and her time should not be
“atomised” into different tasks. Their third argument was that time spent
providing personal or social care, on paid breaks, or receiving supervision,
should be included. The respondents argue that they should not be allowed to
advance it. However, having rejected both parties’ primary arguments, it is our
task to try to discern the true meaning of the legislation. As the legislation
quite clearly envisages that there will be some circumstances in which care
does need to be provided by a registered nurse, even though it is not care
which only a registered nurse can provide, in my view it is our duty to say so.</a></p><a name="para43">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para43"></a><a name="para44">44.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In my view, therefore, “nursing care by a registered nurse” covers (a)
time spent on nursing care, in the sense of care which can only be provided by
a registered nurse, including both direct and indirect nursing time as defined
by the Laing and Buisson study; (b) paid breaks; (c) time receiving
supervision; (d) stand-by time; and (e) time spent on providing, planning,
supervising or delegating the provision of other types of care which in all the
circumstances ought to be provided by a registered nurse because they are
ancillary to or closely connected with or part and parcel of the nursing care
which she has to provide.</a></p><a name="para44">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para44"></a><a name="para45">45.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In other words, the concentration in this case on the division between
nursing and personal care has been a distraction. There is some personal care
which, in all the circumstances, does need to be performed by a registered
nurse, but there is some which does not. I agree with Laws LJ that this is a
question of fact, although the only practical solution is to make a rough and
ready calculation based on the generality of what takes place. Hence I also
agree with Laws LJ and Lloyd Jones LJ that some differentiation between the
care services provided is required. But I would draw the dividing line in a
different place from them. It seems to me plain that Parliament envisaged that
some care services would be included beyond those which could only be provided
by a registered nurse: hence the addition of category (e) above to the list.</a></p><a name="para45">

<p class="ParaHeading">Decision</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para45"></a><a name="para46">46.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It follows from this, and from the earlier concession that “stand-by”
time should have been included, that the Health Boards’ decisions were based on
a misinterpretation of section 49(2) and must be quashed and re-taken in the
light of the guidance given in para 44 of this judgment. Ideally, this should
be a matter for negotiation between all the parties who are governed by the
legislation and have an interest in the outcome.</a></p><a name="para46">
