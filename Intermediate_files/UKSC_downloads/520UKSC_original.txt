<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This is an appeal on preliminary points of European Union and domestic
law regarding the circumstances in which damages may be recoverable for failure
to comply with the requirements of the Public Procurement Directive (Parliament
and Council Directive 2004/18/EC on the coordination of procedures for the
award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service
contracts (OJ 2004 L134, p114) (“the PP Directive”)), as given effect in the
United Kingdom by the Public Contracts Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/5) (“the 2006
Regulations”).</a></p><a name="para1">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1"></a><a name="para2">2.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As recited in the Statement of Facts and Issues, the appellant, the
Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (“the NDA”) is a non-departmental public body
established under the Energy Act 2004 (“the EA 2004”), and is responsible for
17 nuclear sites and the associated civil nuclear assets and liabilities
formerly owned by the UK Atomic Energy Authority and British Nuclear Fuels Ltd.
Pursuant to its duties under the EA 2004, the appellant is responsible for
ensuring that, once decommissioned, sites previously used for nuclear
generation are made suitable to be used for other purposes. The respondent, ATK
Energy EU Ltd (“ATK”), provides integrated waste management and decommissioning
services for the nuclear industry.</a></p><a name="para2">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2"></a><a name="para3">3.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>ATK has pursued against the NDA a claim for damages for breaches of the
NDA’s obligations under the PP Directive and the 2006 Regulations in respect of
the award of a contract for the decommissioning of 12 Magnox power stations, at
Berkeley, Bradwell, Chapelcross, Dungeness A, Hinkley Point A, Hunterston A,
Oldbury, Sizewell A, Trawsfynydd, Wylfa and two others. An agreement of
compromise has been reached in respect of the claim, but the parties wish this
judgment to be issued nonetheless. In short, Fraser J held, and it is for the
purposes of the present appeal to be assumed, that the NDA failed to award the
contract to the tenderer which submitted the most economically advantageous
offer determined in accordance with the criteria which the NDA had itself
specified, in breach of obligations under regulations 18(27) and 30(1) to (4)
of the 2006 Regulations read against the background of the articles 29.1, 29.7
and 53 of the PP Directive. The NDA erroneously concluded that a consortium, known
as CFP, had provided the most economically advantageous offer, awarding it a
score of 86.48%. It awarded a consortium known as Reactor Site Solutions
(“RSS”), of which ATK and another company, Bechtel, were members, a score of
85.42%. Fraser J </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/TCC/2016/1988.html">[2016] EWHC 1988 (TCC)</a> found (i) that CFP should have been
disqualified from the competition for failing two threshold requirements, and
(ii) that, in any event, RSS would have won the competition had the NDA not
made “many manifest errors” (para 944) in its assessment of the tenders, but
for which the NDA would have awarded RSS a score of 91.48% and CFP a score of
only 85.56%.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para4">4.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The public procurement directives in effect prior to 2004, concerning
works (Council Directive 71/305/EEC (OJ 1971 L185, p5)) and supplies (Council
Directive 77/62/EEC (OJ 1977 L13, p1)), contained no enforcement provisions.
Following the decision of the Court of Justice in <i>Gebroeders Beentjes BV v
State of the Netherlands</i> (Case C-31/87) [1988] ECR I-4635, paras 38-44,
that the provisions of these Directives were unconditional and sufficiently
precise to be relied upon by persons before national courts, a further
Directive was introduced, Council Directive 89/665/EEC (OJ 1989 L395, p33)
later amended by Council Directive 2007/66/EC (OJ 2007 L335, p31) (“the 2007
Directive”), to provide effective remedies for economic operators, including
the setting aside of awards and compensation. I will refer to Council Directive
No 89/665/EEC, as so amended, as the Remedies Directive. Domestic effect was
given to the Remedies Directive by amendment of the 2006 Regulations by the
Public Contracts (Amendment) Regulations 2009 (SI 2009/2992) (“the 2009
Amendment Regulations”). The 2006 Regulations have since been superseded by the
Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (SI 2015/102). Under regulation 118 thereof,
the 2006 Regulations remain, however, applicable for the purposes of this case.</a></p><a name="para4">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para4"></a><a name="para5">5.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The scheme of the Remedies Directive, as implemented and as applicable
on the facts of this case, was, in outline, as follows:</a></p><a name="para5">

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(a)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Under article 2a(2) of the Remedies Directive, a standstill period of at
least ten days was required, from the date of receipt of a telephone or letter
communication to an economic operator (such as ATK) that it had not been
awarded the contract; during the standstill period the relevant contracting
authority (here the NDA) could not enter into the contract; as implemented
domestically by regulations 32(1) and 32A(5) of the 2006 Regulations, the
standstill period was fixed as exactly ten days from the date of such receipt.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(b)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Under article 2c of the Remedies Directive, the United Kingdom was
required to allow a period of at least ten days from any such communication for
the economic operator to issue proceedings seeking a review of the authority’s
decision; it implemented this requirement under regulation 47D(2) by allowing
30 days beginning with the date on which the economic operator first knew or
ought to have known that grounds for starting proceedings had arisen; this was
coupled with a proviso under regulation 47D(3) that it did not require
proceedings to be started before the end of a defined period, corresponding
with that stated in article 2c. (Article 2f in fact required that domestic law
allow a period of at least 30 days, from publication of a contract award notice
or information given by the contracting authority about the conclusion of the
contract, for challenges based on limited grounds of “ineffectiveness”
identified in article 2d; this may, perhaps, have been an inspiration for the more
general 30 day period in regulation 47D(2).)</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(c)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Under article 2(3) of the Remedies Directive, as implemented by
regulation 47G, the authority, on becoming aware of the issue of a claim form
relating to its decision to award the contract to CFP, was required to refrain
from entering into the contract, if not already entered into, until court order
or disposal of the proceedings.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para5"></a><a name="para6">6.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the present case, the NDA informed RSS by telephone and letter
delivered on 31 March 2014 that RSS had been unsuccessful. It also informed all
bidders that it would voluntarily observe an extended standstill period until
14 April 2014. RSS wrote letters on 6, 8 and 10 April 2014, by which it
requested various information and ultimately asked for a further extended
standstill period until 23 April 2014, saying that it might otherwise be forced
to issue a claim by 14 April to protect its position. On 11 April 2014, the NDA
refused to extend the standstill period, and on the same day RSS replied that
this was “regrettable” and that it was actively considering commencing a claim,
and urged the NDA not to enter into the contract. On 15 April the NDA repeated
that it was unable to agree to refrain from taking steps to enter into the
contract, explaining that delay would cause it to suffer significant additional
cost. Later that day, the NDA entered into the contract with CFP and informed
RSS accordingly. On 28 April 2014, and so within the 30 days referred to in
para 5(b) above, ATK, though not Bechtel, issued the claim form beginning the present
proceedings.</a></p><a name="para6">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Preliminary issues ordered by Akenhead J on 10 October 2014 were decided
by Edwards-Stuart J on 23 January 2015 (</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/TCC/2015/73.html">[2015] PTSR 1106</a>), leading to an appeal
determined by the Court of Appeal (Lord Dyson MR, Tomlinson and Vos LJJ) by
judgment dated 15 December 2015: <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2015/1262.html">[2016] PTSR 689</a>. The shape of the arguments
has changed, leading to a position where three main issues are now presented in
the Statement of Facts and Issues as arising on this appeal. Slightly
reformulated to reflect the submissions before the Supreme Court, they are:</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2">(i)(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; whether the Remedies Directive only requires an
award of damages to be made when any breach of the PP Directive is
“sufficiently serious” and (b) whether the answer to this question is acte
clair, so that it need not be referred to the Court of Justice?</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whether regulation 47J(2)(c) of the 2006
Regulations confers a power to award damages in respect of any loss or damage
suffered by an economic operator (a) in the case of any breach, or (b) only in
the case of a “sufficiently serious” breach, of the Regulations?</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whether (and, if so, when) an award of damages
under regulation 47J(2)(c) of the 2006 Regulations may be refused on the ground
that an economic operator, who issued a claim form in respect of a contract
award decision within the 30 day time limit prescribed by regulation 47D of the
2006 Regulations, did not do so and inform the contracting authority that it
had done so before the contracting authority entered into the contract?</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="ES"><a name="para8">8.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></a></span><a name="para8">Before Edwards-Stuart J issue (i) only appears to have arisen
tangentially to an argument, which no longer directly arises, that damages were
discretionary. So far as he addressed it, his answer appears to have been
negative (para 86). Issue (ii), he answered: (a) Yes; (b) No (para 71). Issue
(iii), he held, involved a question of fact, not suitable for resolution as a
preliminary issue in this case, though his views were generally discouraging of
the idea that damages would be refused on any such basis (paras 42-54). In the
Court of Appeal, Vos LJ, in a judgment with which the other members concurred,
determined these issues to the following effect: (i)(a) Yes. <span lang="ES">(b)
Yes (para 55). (ii)(a) Yes. (b) No (paras 66-70). (iii) No (paras 71-77).</span></a></p><a name="para8">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para8"></a><a name="para9">9.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In relation to the first issue, Vos LJ, after analysing Court of Justice
case law, concluded (paras 62-65) that breaches of the PP Directive must, in
the light of the Remedies Directive, be actionable under the following three
minimum conditions (the “<i>Francovich</i>” conditions): (1) the rule of law
infringed must be intended to confer rights on individuals, (2) the breach must
be sufficiently serious, and (3) there must be a direct causal link between the
breach of the obligation and the damage sustained by the injured party.
National law must also respect the principle of equivalence of EU with domestic
rights (para 62). For present purposes, it is <i>Francovich </i>condition (2)
which matters. As to the second issue, Vos LJ held, and this is not
contentious, that it is open to national law to lay down “criteria that provide
a less restrictive remedy in damages than would be provided by the <i>Francovich</i>
conditions” (para 66). He went on to hold (and this is contentious) that the
2006 Regulations had this effect; whether ATK’s claim was viewed as being for
breach of directly enforceable EU law or for breach of domestic law enacted to
give effect to the EU obligation contained in the Remedies Directive, it
constituted a private law claim for breach of statutory duty, which, under
English law, was not subject to any restrictive condition limiting its
availability to cases of “sufficiently serious” breach (paras 66-67). As to the
third issue, Vos LJ held that this involved an issue of “determination or
estimation” of damages, which was for domestic law to determine (paras 55 and
71). He went on to hold that there was nothing in the 2006 Regulations or in
general domestic law to oblige an economic operator to issue its claim form
before the contracting authority entered into the contract, or to deprive it of
a claim to damages on the ground that it had failed to invoke any other remedy
(paras 72-76). The NDA now appeals by permission of the Supreme Court.</a></p><a name="para9">

Pêcheur</i>”). These were decisions on state liability, in <i>Francovich</i>
itself for failure to transpose a directive and in <i>Brasserie du Pêcheur</i>
for domestic laws which violated European law. In the latter case, the Court of
Justice set out the three <i>Francovich</i> conditions at para 51, remarking in
this respect that “Community law confers a right to reparation where three
conditions are met”, and went on:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“55.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to the second
condition, as regards both Community liability under article 215 and member
state liability for breaches of Community law, the decisive test for finding
that a breach of Community law is sufficiently serious is whether the member
state or the Community institution concerned manifestly and gravely disregarded
the limits on its discretion.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">56.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The factors which the
competent court may take into consideration include the clarity and precision
of the rule breached; the measure of discretion left by that rule to the
national or Community authorities; whether the infringement and the damage
caused was intentional or involuntary; whether any error of law was excusable
or inexcusable; the fact that the position taken by a Community institution may
have contributed towards the omission, and the adoption or retention of
national measures or practices contrary to Community law.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">57.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On any view, a breach of
Community law will clearly be sufficiently serious if it has persisted despite
a judgment finding the infringement in question to be established, or a
preliminary ruling or settled case law of the court on the matter from which it
is clear that the conduct in question constituted an infringement. …</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">66.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The aforementioned three
conditions are necessary and sufficient to found a right in individuals to
obtain redress, although this does not mean that the state cannot incur
liability under less strict conditions on the basis of national law.”</p>

</span>In <i>Brasserie du Pêcheur</i> one issue before the Court of Justice was
whether a national court was entitled to make reparation conditional on the
existence of fault, whether intentional or negligent. Referring to the second <i>Francovich
</i>condition, the Court said:</a></p><a name="para12">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“78.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, certain objective and
subjective factors connected with the concept of fault under a national legal
system may well be relevant for the purpose of determining whether or not a
given breach of Community law is serious: see the factors mentioned in paras 56
and 57 above.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">79.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The obligation to make reparation
for loss or damage caused to individuals cannot, however, depend on a condition
based on any concept of fault going beyond that of a sufficiently serious
breach of Community law. …</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">80.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, …
reparation of loss or damage cannot be made conditional on fault (intentional
or negligent) on the part of the organ of the state responsible for the breach,
going beyond that of a sufficiently serious breach of Community law.”</p>

of state liability for failure by a final state court to apply European Union

</span>The question on this appeal is whether, as the Court of Appeal
considered, the three <i>Francovich </i>conditions apply to a claim against a
contracting authority under the PP and Remedies Directives (and whether the
answer to this question is acte clair). In submitting that the Court of Appeal
was wrong, ATK makes a number of points. It points to the purposes of the
Remedies Directive generally, and to the terms of articles 1(1) and 2(1) in
particular, as showing an intention to address and provide a remedy in damages
for harm caused by infringements generally. It points to the wording of article
3 as indicating that, where there is an intention to limit provisions of the
Directive to cases of serious infringement, the intention is made express. It
points to the fact that, if the <i>Francovich </i>conditions apply, then no
remedy at all would potentially be available in cases falling within the last words
of article 2(7).</a></p><a name="para14">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>ATK also submits that the Court of Appeal’s approach is inconsistent
with the European Union’s international obligations under the Government
Procurement Agreement (“GPA 1994”), a plurilateral agreement contained in Annex
4 to the Agreement in 1994 establishing the World Trade Organisation and
approved on behalf of the Union by article 2 of Council Decision 94/800/EC (OJ
1994 L336, p144). Article XX(2) of the GPA 1994 provided for each party to
provide “effective procedures enabling suppliers to challenge alleged breaches
of the Agreement arising in the context of procurements in which they have, or
have had, an interest”, while article XX(7) provided that:</a></p><a name="para15">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Challenge procedures shall
provide for:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rapid interim measures

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an assessment and a
possibility for a decision on the justification of the challenge;</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; correction of the
breach of the Agreement or compensation for the loss or damages suffered, which
may be limited to costs for tender preparation or protest.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">A similar provision appears in the more recent revised
GPA to which the EU became party on 6 April 2014: Council Decision 2014/115/EU
(OJ 2014 L68, p1). ATK submits that article XX(7) contemplates that damages
must always be recoverable for a breach (and cannot be restricted to cases of
serious breach), even if they may be limited to costs for tender preparation or
protest. It points to the principle, endorsed in <i>Řízení Letového
Provozu ČR, sp v Bundesamt für Finanzen </i>(Case C-335/05) [2007] STC
1509, para 16, and <i>Association Justice &amp; Environment zs v Commission of
the European Communities </i>(Case T-727/15) 23 January 2017, para 77, that
secondary EU legislation should, so far as possible, be interpreted
consistently with international agreements concluded by the European Union.</p>

</span>Finally, but most importantly, ATK submits that Court of Justice case
law supports its position. The debate in this area turns on two principal
authorities: <i>Stadt Graz v Strabag AG </i>(Case C-314/09) [2010] ECR I-8769
(decided 30 September 2010 by the Third Chamber, without an Advocate General’s
opinion) and <i>Combinatie Spijker Infrabouw-De Jonge Konstruktie v Provincie
Drenthe</i> (Case C-568/08) [2010] ECR I-12655 (Advocate General’s opinion
delivered 14 September 2010; Judgment of the Second Chamber 9 December 2010).</a></p><a name="para16">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para16"></a><a name="para17">17.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In <i>Stadt Graz</i> the basic question referred was whether the
Remedies Directive precluded national legislation which made the right to
damages for an infringement of public procurement law by a contracting
authority conditional upon the infringement being culpable. The legislation in
question included a presumption that the contracting authority was at fault,
and a provision that the authority could not rely on a “lack of individual
abilities”. The court, in holding that such legislation was impermissible, said
this:</a></p><a name="para17">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“33.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; … Directive 89/665 lays
down only the minimum conditions to be satisfied by the review procedures
established in domestic law to ensure compliance with the requirements of EU
law concerning public procurement … If there is no specific provision governing
the matter, it is therefore for the domestic law of each member state to
determine the measures necessary to ensure that the review procedures
effectively award damages to persons harmed by an infringement of the law on
public contracts …</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">34.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although, therefore, the
implementation of article 2(1)(c) of Directive 89/665 in principle comes under
the procedural autonomy of the member states, limited by the principles of
equivalence and effectiveness, it is necessary to examine whether that
provision, interpreted in the light of the general context and aim of the
judicial remedy of damages, precludes a national provision such as that at
issue in the main proceedings from making the award of damages conditional, in
the circumstances …, on a finding that the contracting authority’s infringement
of the law on public contracts is culpable.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">35.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In that regard, it
should first be noted that the wording of article 1(1), article 2(1), (5) and
(6), and the sixth recital in the preamble to Directive 89/665 in no way
indicates that the infringement of the public procurement legislation liable to
give rise to a right to damages in favour of the person harmed should have
specific features, such as being connected to fault - proved or presumed - on
the part of the contracting authority, or not being covered by any ground for
exemption from liability.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">36.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That assessment is
supported by the general context and aim of the judicial remedy of damages, as
provided for in Directive 89/665</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">37.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to settled
case law, while the member states are required to provide legal remedies
enabling the annulment of a decision of a contracting authority which infringes
the law relating to public contracts, they are entitled in the light of the
objective of rapidity pursued by Directive 89/665 to couple that type of review
with reasonable limitation periods for bringing proceedings, so as to prevent
the candidates and tenderers from being able, at any moment, to invoke
infringements of that legislation, thus obliging the contracting authority to
restart the entire procedure in order to correct such infringements …</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">38.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, the second
subparagraph of article 2(6) of Directive 89/665 reserves to the member states
the right to limit the powers of the body responsible for the review
procedures, after the conclusion of a contract following its award, to the
award of damages.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">39.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Against that background,
the remedy of damages provided for in article 2(1)(c) of Directive 89/665 can
constitute, where appropriate, a procedural alternative which is compatible
with the principle of effectiveness underlying the objective pursued by that
directive of ensuring effective review procedures … only where the possibility
of damages being awarded in the event of infringement of the public procurement
rules is no more dependent than the other legal remedies provided for in article
2(1) of Directive 89/665 on a finding that the contracting authority is at
fault.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">40.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... it makes little
difference in that regard that, by contrast with the national legislation
referred to in <i>Commission of the European Communities v Portugal </i>(Case
C-275/03), the legislation at issue in the main proceedings does not impose on
the person harmed the burden of proving that the contracting authority is at
fault, but requires the latter to rebut the presumption that it is at fault,
while limiting the grounds on which it can rely for that purpose.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">41.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason is that that
legislation, too, creates the risk that the tenderer who has been harmed by an
unlawful decision of a contracting authority is nevertheless deprived of the
right to damages in respect of the damage caused by that decision, where the
contracting authority is able to rebut the presumption that it is at fault. …</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">42.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the very least, that
tenderer runs the risk, under that legislation, of only belatedly being able to
obtain damages, in view of the possible duration of civil proceedings seeking a
finding that the alleged infringement is culpable.”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>ATK submits that, although the immediate focus of <i>Stadt Graz </i>was
on the impermissibility of any limitation of liability by reference to a
requirement of fault, its whole tenor was that the Remedies Directive
contemplates a general right to damages for any infringement of the public
procurement legislation, neither subject, nor capable of being made subject, to
any specific features. A requirement that the breach should be “sufficiently
serious” would, it submits, be an example of a special feature.</a></p><a name="para18">

</span><i>Spijker </i>concerned a situation not dissimilar to the present. The
claimant’s tender had come second in circumstances which the claimant (“<i>Combinatie</i>”)
alleged breached the PP Directive. The defendant Provincie, following an
interim administrative court order that the contract should be awarded to
no-one else but Machinefabriek Emmen BV (“MFE”), awarded it to MFE. The
claimant sued the Provincie for damages in the civil courts. One issue which
the civil court, the Rechtbank Assen, identified was whether any unlawful act
fell to be attributed to the Provincie. The court, taking the view that the
Provincie might have acted unlawfully, asked the Court of Justice by questions
4(c) and (d):</a></p><a name="para19">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If [the] authority is

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the contracting public
authority cannot be deemed liable, is it possible, under Community law, for
some other person to be shown to be liable, and on what basis?”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Advocate General Cruz Villalón said (para 5), in connection with
question 4(c) that:</a></p><a name="para20">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“the present case offers the
opportunity to clarify certain points of Directive 89/665 which are of great
significance for the purpose of upholding the legality which European Union law
requires in the context of public procurement.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">In the course of his opinion, he said (para 77) that:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In my view, it is solely for the
Rechtbank to assess<sup>(40)</sup> points such as whether there was any
liability and whether, where appropriate, it must be attributed to the
Provincie, to the State - on account of the actions of the judge dealing with
interim relief proceedings - or to any other person taking into consideration
the evidence which has been shown to be relevant: the fact that the Provincie
did not wait before making the award or appeal against the interim measures;
the possible alternatives (if any) to making the award to MFE; the
circumstances surrounding the provisional enforcement of the order of the judge
dealing with interim relief proceedings, and the Combinatie’s voluntary
withdrawal of the appeal lodged against that order.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Footnote 40 to this passage read:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“40.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to do so, it
must take into account all the factors which characterise the situation which
has been brought before it, ‘in particular, the degree of clarity and precision
of the rule infringed, whether the infringement was intentional, whether the
error of law was excusable or inexcusable, the position taken, where
applicable, by a Community institution and non-compliance by the court in

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court addressed question 4(c) as follows:</a></p><a name="para21">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“85.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By its fourth question,
part (c), the referring court asks, in essence, whether, if the awarding
authority has to make good the damage arising from an infringement of EU law on
the award of public contracts, EU law provides criteria on the basis of which
the damage may be determined and estimated and, if so, what those criteria are.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">86.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Article 2(1)(c) of [the
Remedies Directive] clearly indicates that member states must make provision
for the possibility of awarding damages in the case of infringement of EU law
on the award of public contracts, but contains no detailed statement either as
to the conditions under which an awarding authority may be held liable or as to
the determination of the amount of the damages which it may be ordered to pay.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">87.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That provision gives
concrete expression to the principle of State liability for loss and damage
caused to individuals as a result of breaches of EU law for which the State can
be held responsible. According to case law developed since the adoption of the
[Remedies Directive], but which is now consistent, that principle is inherent
in the legal order of the Union. The Court has held that individuals harmed
have a right to reparation where three conditions are met: the rule of EU law
infringed must be intended to confer rights on them; the breach of that rule
must be sufficiently serious; and there must be a direct causal link between
the breach and the loss or damage sustained by the individuals ([the <i>Francovich</i>
case] para 35, the <i>Brasserie du Pêcheur </i>case] paras 31 and 51; and [the <i>Danske
Slagterier </i>case] paras 19 and 20).</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">88.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As matters stand at
present, the case law of the Court of Justice has not yet set out, as regards
review of the award of public contracts, more detailed criteria on the basis of
which damage must be determined and estimated.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">89.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As regards EU
legislation, it should be noted that Directive 89/665 has been largely amended
by Directive 2007/66/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11
December 2007 amending Council Directives 89/665/EEC and 92/13/EEC (OJ 2007 L
335, p 31), adopted after the date of the facts which gave rise to the dispute
in the main proceedings. However, on that occasion, the EU legislature
refrained from adopting any provisions on that point.</p>

</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para21">90.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the absence of EU
provisions in that area, it is for the legal order of each member state to
determine the criteria on the basis of which damage arising from an
infringement of EU law on the award of public contracts must be determined and
estimated (see, by analogy, Case C-315/01 <i>GAT</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2003/C31501.html">[2003] ECR I-6351</a>, para
46; and Case C-314/09 [the <i>Stadt Graz</i> case [2010] ECR I-8769], para 33)
provided the principles of equivalence and effectiveness are complied with
(see, to that effect, Joined Cases C-295/04 to C-298/04 <i>Manfredi and others</i>
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2006/C29504.html">[2006] ECR I-6619</a>, para 98).</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">91.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is apparent from well-established
case law that the detailed procedural rules governing actions for safeguarding
an individual’s rights under EU law must be no less favourable than those
governing similar domestic actions (principle of equivalence) and must not
render practically impossible or excessively difficult the exercise of rights
conferred by EU law (principle of effectiveness) ...</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">92.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, the answer to
the fourth question, part (c) is that, as regards state liability for damage
caused to individuals by infringements of EU law for which the state may be
held responsible, the individuals harmed have a right to redress where the rule
of EU law which has been infringed is intended to confer rights on them, the
breach of that rule is sufficiently serious, and there is a direct causal link
between the breach and the loss or damage sustained by the individuals. In the
absence of any provision of EU law in that area, it is for the internal legal
order of each member state, once those conditions have been complied with, to
determine the criteria on the basis of which the damage arising from an
infringement of EU law on the award of public contracts must be determined and
estimated, provided the principles of equivalence and effectiveness are
complied with.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">93.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of that answer,

to contain answers to both questions 4(c) and (d), that paras 89 and 90
indicate that no EU law conditions attach to liability of a contracting
authority of the sort covered by question 4(c), whereas para 92 (and presumably
para 87 on which para 92 is evidently based), which refer to the <i>Francovich</i>
conditions, cover question 4(d) and are confined to the liability of the state
and those for whom the state may be liable who are not contracting authorities.</a></p><a name="para22">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I am unable to accept this interpretation of the Court of Justice’s
judgment. It converts an apparently clear exposition of the position regarding
question 4(c) into an incoherent mixture of two differing schemes between which
the text, on ATK’s interpretation, jumps back and forwards. In my view, the
text is clear. Paras 85 and 86 set the scene, viz that what is about to be
discussed is the liability of an “awarding authority” for damage arising from
an infringement of the PP Directive, and para 87 proceeds by making clear that
the liability of an awarding authority is to be assessed by reference to the <i>Francovich
</i>conditions. Subject to those conditions being met, paras 88 to 90 go on to
make clear that the criteria for damages are to be determined and estimated by
national law, with the further caveat that the general principles of
equivalence and effectiveness must also be met (para 91). Finally, para 92
summarises what has gone before, repeating the need to satisfy the <i>Francovich
</i>conditions. This is also exactly what the Advocate General had indicated in
footnote 40 of his opinion. As to para 93, the inference is that the Court
considered that the same principles must govern any claim against the State
itself or a body for which the State is answerable (such as perhaps the
administrative court which issued the interim order in <i>Spijker</i>). That is
of course logical.</a></p><a name="para23">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Justice in <i>Spijker </i>was aware of the recent decision
in <i>Stadt Graz</i>, cited it in para 90, and clearly did not consider it in
any way inconsistent with what the Court of Justice said about the general
applicability of the <i>Francovich </i>conditions. Nor was it inconsistent.
Whether an error is excusable or inexcusable is a matter that a court may take
into account when considering whether a breach is sufficiently serious to
justify an award of damages under the second condition: see <i>Brasserie du
Pêcheur</i>, para 57, quoted in para 11 above. But the introduction of a fixed
requirement of fault as a condition of State liability, on whichever party the
burden of proving or disproving fault is placed, is well-established as
illegitimate on a line of authority which goes back to <i>Brasserie du Pêcheur</i>
itself (see para 12 above), and to <i>Commission of the European Communities v
Portugal</i> (Case C-275/03) EU:C:2004:632 and which was merely reflected in
the decision in <i>Stadt Graz</i>. The clarity of EU law in this respect was,
no doubt, why the decision was taken that no Advocate General’s opinion was
required in <i>Stadt Graz</i>.</a></p><a name="para24">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In these circumstances, there is in my view very clear authority of the
Court of Justice confirming that the liability of a contracting authority under
the Remedies Directive for breach of the PP Directive is assimilated to that of
the state or of a public body for which the state is responsible. It is in
particular only required to exist where the minimum <i>Francovich </i>conditions
are met, although it is open to States in their domestic law to introduce wider
liability free of those conditions. In the light of <i>Spijker</i>, ATK’s
submissions based on the general wording of articles 1 and 2 of the Remedies
Directive cannot lead to a contrary conclusion. Article 3 is dealing with a
different subject matter, which, even by way of contrast, could not throw much
light on the scope of articles 1 and 2, and certainly cannot in the light of <i>Spijker</i>.
Nor is ATK’s argument by reference to the EU’s international obligations under
the GPA 1994 capable of leading to a contrary decision on any points. Any
impetus which article XX(7) can give to ATK’s argument is very weak at best.
That article requires no more than either correction of the breach or
compensation, and the compensation required may fall far short of covering the
actual loss or damage suffered (since it “may be limited to costs for tender
preparation or protest”). There is, apparently, no WTO authority on the
interpretation of article XX(7) (or as to whether it might not itself be read
subject to a condition such as the second <i>Francovich</i> condition). The
argument based on GPA 1994 cannot in any event withstand the clear impact of
the Court’s judgment in <i>Spijker</i>.</a></p><a name="para25">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Finally, the Supreme Court, during the course of submissions, asked
about academic authority, and was shown a further article additional to any in
the agreed bundles. That was Professor Steen Treumer’s article <i>Basis and
Conditions for a Damages Claim for Breach of the EU Public Procurement Rules </i>in<i>
</i>Fairgrieve and Lichère,<i> Public Procurement Law</i> (2011). Professor
Treumer wrote then of a lack of clarity in cases such as <i>Commission v
Portugal</i>, of confusion arising from, and fundamentally different approaches
taken in, the cases of <i>Stadt Graz </i>and <i>Spijker</i> and of differing
approaches taken in national law, presumably before those cases. For the
reasons I have already given, I do not see any such lack of clarity or
confusion. Further, the Supreme Court was shown in the agreed bundles a more
recent article, by a serving judge of the General Court, Judge Anthony M
Collins, <i>Damages in Public Procurement - An Illusory Remedy?</i> in Chapter
21 (p 339) in <i>Of Courts and Constitutions - Liber Amicorum in honour of Nial
Fennelly </i>(ed Bradley, Travers and Whelan) (2014). Setting out the criteria
for the recovery of damages for breaches of the procurement rules, Judge
Collins explains <i>Spijker </i>precisely in the sense which I consider that it
obviously bears. It harmonises liability for such breaches “irrespective of the
identity of the author of the alleged illegality”, with the minimum <i>Francovich
</i>conditions applying to all such breaches (p 340), and with the result (p
341) that:</a></p><a name="para26">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… the requirements that the rule
breached must be intended to confer rights on individuals and that the breach
of such a rule must be ‘<i>sufficiently </i>serious’, means that not every
legal error in the course of an award procedure can ground an action in damages.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">This article reinforces my view that there is no
uncertainty or confusion in the Court of Justice’s case law, and that the
Supreme Court can be safe in relying on the clear language and ruling in <i>Spijker</i>
as settling the position, whatever may have been previous doubts or differences
of view at national level.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For these reasons, I consider that the Court of Appeal answered the
first question correctly, and in a manner which does not call for any reference
by the Supreme Court, as the final court of appeal, to the Court of Justice.</a></p><a name="para27">

</span>The 2006 Regulations and 2009 Amendment Regulations were made under the
power contained in section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972, to make
provision for the purpose of implementing EU obligations of the United Kingdom
and/or dealing with matters arising out of or related to any such obligation.
The <i>Francovich </i>conditions are no more than minimum conditions, which
domestic law is free to relax or ignore. There is therefore no <i>Marleasing </i>presumption
that the United Kingdom legislator intended to reflect the <i>Francovich </i>conditions
(<i>Marleasing SA v La Comercial Internacional de Alimentación SA </i>(Case
C-106/89) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1990/C10689.html">[1990] ECR I-4135</a>). Further, it is not suggested that it would be
outside the scope of section 2(2) for the United Kingdom legislator to provide
for the recovery of damages in respect of breaches which were not sufficiently
serious to meet the EU law minimum requirement that a damages remedy be
available: see <i>United States v Nolan </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/63.html">[2015] UKSC 63</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/63.html">[2016] AC 463</a>, para

</span>ATK relies on the wording of the 2006 Regulations as introducing
unconditional actionability of breaches, coupled with unconditional domestic
liability for breaches of any domestically-based statutory duty. It points to
the obligation contained in regulation 47A(2) and the duty, breach of which is
by regulation 47C(1) prescribed as actionable by any economic operator who in
consequence suffers loss or damage. ATK submits that there is no warrant for
reading into these Regulations any condition that the breach must be
“sufficiently serious” before it is actionable in damages.</a></p><a name="para31">

</span>Although there was no requirement to do so, or presumption that this
would be done, the NDA invites the Supreme Court to conclude that it was the
intention of the UK legislator simply to give effect to the minimum EU
requirements regarding damages. It points to the uses of the word “may” in regulations
47I(2) and 47J(2)(c). It does not suggest that this gives rise to any general
discretion. But it suggests that it is consistent with a limitation of damages
by reference to the <i>Francovich</i> conditions. It picks up, in domestic law,
the requirement under article 2(1) of the Remedies Directive that domestic law
shall include a “power” to award damages to an economic operator harmed by an
infringement, a requirement which, as I have held, is limited by the <i>Francovich
</i>conditions. ATK in response submits the word “may” can be explained as a
reference to the possibility that the contracting authority might have a
defence, for example due to failure by the economic operator to mitigate its
loss. That to my mind is a somewhat slender explanation for the introduction of
the word “may”, especially as loss arising from a failure to mitigate is
commonly regarded as not having been caused by the breach: see eg <i>Sotiros
Shipping Inc v Sameiet Solholt (The Solholt) </i>[1983] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 605.</a></p><a name="para32">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeal dealt with this issue quite shortly. It noted that
the 2009 Amendment Regulations had been preceded by an Explanatory Memorandum
and a Transposition Note as well as a Consultation Document of April 2009, “all
of which [it said] make it reasonably clear that the Government’s intention was
to do only what was necessary to implement the Remedies Directive without any
‘gold plating’ save where such was expressly identified” (para 17). But it
viewed the claim provided by the 2006 Regulations, as amended in 2009, as an
ordinary private law claim for breach of statutory duty, to which no
restrictive condition applies under English law, and saw it as irrelevant in
this context whether or not the legislator intended to “gold plate” the EU law
on public procurement when introducing the Regulations (para 67).</a></p><a name="para33">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para33"></a><a name="para34">34.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeal was right in para 17 to identify the legislator’s
intention in 2009 as having been not to gold plate. The Explanatory Note to the
2009 Amendment Regulations said that “except where otherwise stated” (none of
the respects so stated being presently relevant) the Regulations implemented
the Directive. The Explanatory Memorandum laid before Parliament referred to
the Regulations as implementing articles in the Directive “that need to be
transposed” and to the amendments to the 2006 Regulations as “needed to
implement” the Directive. The Impact Assessment, prepared by the Office of
Government Commerce (“the OGC”) and attached to the Explanatory Memorandum,
concluded by saying that the OGC had adhered to guidance including “avoidance
of ‘gold-plating’ and taking a minimalist approach to implementation … insofar
as is possible within the context of this implementation” and that the impact
assessment had “examined, article by article, the choices available for the UK
and identified a range of options”, “invariably” selecting those which
“represent the least cost and greatest benefit within the confines of the
mandate laid down in the Directive” (para 72). The Impact Assessment contained
a detailed account of the choices available and made. None relates to or suggests
a choice in 2009 to implement the Directive by introducing domestic liability
for damages in circumstances not required under EU law.</a></p><a name="para34">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Explanatory Note, the Explanatory Memorandum and the Impact
Assessment are all potentially admissible as aids to the understanding of the
legislator’s intentions in 2009, on the principle identified by the House of
Lords in <i>R v Montila </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2004/50.html">[2004] UKHL 50</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2004/50.html">[2004] 1 WLR 3141</a>, para 35.
However, ATK submits that 2009 is not the relevant date. It points out that,
although regulations 47A through to 47P (Part 9) of the 2006 Regulations as
amended by the 2009 Amendment Regulations were introduced as a complete
substitute for the previous section 47 (Part 9) and were the product of
extensive re-writing of previous text with many new elements, the bare outline of
regulations 47A to 47C, 47I and 47J can still be detected in the much more
limited language of regulation 47(1), (6), (8) and (9) of the earlier 2006
Regulations, which can in turn be traced back to the Public Services Contracts Regulations
1993 (SI 1993/3228), regulation 32(1), (2), (4) and (5). ATK submits that there
is no reason to suggest that the legislator in 2009 intended any different
approach to the damages recoverable under the earlier 1993 and 2006 Regulations,
and that there is no material to show that avoidance of “gold-plating” had the
same weight at those earlier dates. As to this, it is true that there is no
material bearing directly on the legislator’s intentions at those earlier dates
(though there is equally nothing to show that it was necessarily any
different). But in my view it is unrealistic, when construing regulations 47A
through to 47P, to ignore the legislator’s intention in 2009 to introduce a
whole new package of substituted provisions which should, save where a
deliberate choice to the contrary appeared, have no greater force than EU law
requires. What happened in 2009 was effectively a new start, based on the
Remedies Directive.</p>

that damages under the Remedies Directive 89/665/EEC were not subject to the <i>Francovich
</i>conditions (described by the Court of Appeal as <i>Norbrook </i>conditions,
after <i>Norbrook Laboratories Ltd v Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food</i> (Case C-127/95) <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1998/C12795.html">[1998] ECR I-1531</a>). The Court of Appeal went on (para
1655D-G) to express the view that the “damages provided by domestic law remain
damages on the basis envisaged by Directive (89/665/EEC); but regulation
32(5)(b)(ii) none the less thereby creates a private law, non-discretionary,
remedy, because within the national legal order any remedy in damages
necessarily has those qualities”. The Court of Appeal in <i>Matra</i> can now
be seen to have been wrong in treating the <i>Francovich </i>conditions as
irrelevant. Its further view that domestic law damages “remain damages on the
basis envisaged by [the] Directive” might however be read as consistent with
the NDA’s case on the present issue.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Where the Court of Appeal in the present case went in my opinion clearly
wrong was in its assumption that any claim for damages under the 2006
Regulations was no more than a private law claim for breach of a
domestically-based statutory duty, and for that reason subject to ordinary
English law rules which include no requirement that a breach must be shown to
be “sufficiently serious” before damages are awarded (para 67). The Court of
Appeal appears to have assumed that the categorisation in domestic law of a
claim based on EU law as being for breach of statutory duty freed it
automatically from any conditions which would otherwise apply under EU law.
That this is not so is clear if one takes the simple case of a domestic claim
against the State for failure correctly to transpose EU law. Such a claim is
subject to the <i>Francovich </i>and <i>Brasserie du Pêcheur</i> principles and
conditions.</a></p><a name="para37">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the outset it is
necessary to consider the nature of PPL’s claim. The decisions of the European
Court of Justice in <i>Francovich v Italian Republic</i> (Joined Cases C-6/90
and C-9/90) <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1991/C690.html">[1995] ICR 722</a> and <i>Brasserie du Pêcheur SA v Federal Republic of

it is not disputed, that a member state may incur liability to a person under
Community law where three conditions are satisfied. They are that (1) the rule
of Community law infringed is intended to confer rights on individuals; (2) the
breach is sufficiently serious, and in particular that there was a manifest and
grave disregard by the member state of its discretion; and (3) there is a
direct causal link between the breach of the obligation resting on the member state
and the damage sustained by the injured party. As I have already pointed out
for the purposes of these preliminary issues I have to assume that all those conditions
will be established.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The nature of such a
claim in English law was considered by Hobhouse LJ in <i>R v Secretary of State

the Divisional Court concluded that liability had been established and went on
to consider whether exemplary damages could and should be awarded. It was in
that context that Hobhouse LJ considered (para 173) that the liability was best
understood as a breach of statutory duty. In so doing he relied on the dictum to
the same effect of Lord Diplock in <i>Garden Cottage Foods v Milk Marketing Board</i>
[1984] AC 130, 141 and the conclusion of Mann J in <i>Bourgoin v Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</i> [1986] QB 716, 733 that the duty was
imposed by the relevant article and section 2(1) European Communities Act 1972.
Transposed to the facts of this case the duty for the breach of which the Crown
is sued is that imposed by article 8.2 of the Rental Directive and section 2(1)

</span>The scheme of the Remedies Directive is a balanced one. The <i>Francovich</i>
conditions represent the Court of Justice’s conclusion as to the appropriate
minimum protection by way of damages which an economic operator can expect.
Although there is no <i>Marleasing </i>imperative to construe the scheme so far
as possible consistently with the <i>Francovich </i>conditions, it is I think a
natural assumption that the UK legislator will not go further than required by
EU law when implementing such a scheme, without considering this and making it
clear. That is fortified by the legislator’s clear intention not to gold plate
when substituting the new Part 9 scheme for the old in 2009. In these
circumstances, I consider that the 2006 Regulations as amended in 2009 should
be read as providing for damages only upon satisfaction of the <i>Francovich </i>conditions.
That is also consistent with the use of the word “may” which otherwise seems to
me to have no real significance.</a></p><a name="para39">

</span>Issue (iii) arises from the difference between the periods set by the
domestic legislator for a standstill and for the commencement of proceedings by
a person aggrieved by the decision to award a public procurement contract. The
UK legislator <i>could</i> have implemented articles 2a(2) and 2c of the
Remedies Directive by assimilating the standstill period and the period for
applying for a review. The former had under article 2a(2) to be at least ten
days from sending by fax or electronically or from receipt of the contract
award decision. The latter could under article 2c have been at least ten days
from the same moment. While regulation 32A(2) reflected the period identified
in article 2a(2), regulation 47D(2) gave a period for proceedings for review
(not involving a claim of ineffectiveness) 20 days longer than the minimum
required by article 2c. Thus, in the present case, the NDA was free after ten days
(extended voluntarily for four further days) to enter into the contract, but
ATK had another 20 (or, after the voluntary extension) 16 days within which to
issue its claim form for damages.</a></p><a name="para41">

(which it would in this case presumably have been seen as having, since it
ultimately succeeded), the court would have considered whether “it would not be
appropriate to make an interim order … in the absence of undertakings or

</span>the NDA would in this way, assuming that it was ordered to continue to
refrain from entering into the contract while ATK’s challenge was resolved,
have had the benefit of a cross-undertaking and/or security, which would, if

the NDA had entered into the contract. ATK’s response is that the NDA’s case
conflicts with the scheme of the 2006 Regulations, as well as with a general
principle that it is open to a party to elect as it chooses between remedies,
particularly between seeking interim relief and relying on a claim for damages.
ATK also submits that the NDA’s case amounts to imposing a time limit which
would be shorter than that required by EU law or stipulated by domestic law

</span>The general legislative schemes, constituting the background to this issue
under EU and domestic law, have been summarised in paras 5 and 42 above. In the
context of an argument about mitigation, it is worth underlining one feature.
Both the Remedies Directive and the 2006 Regulations treat a contracting
authority’s decision to award a contract in circumstances where the substantive
requirements of the PP Directive or the 2006 Regulations have not been observed
as an actionable infringement or breach of duty to any economic operator
thereby disadvantaged. This is so, although no contract will at that point have
been entered into. Proceedings may be begun, within the relevant time limit,
before or after the entry into the contract, but in either case they involve
the same complaint, viz failings in the prescribed procurement process, leading
to the decision to award the contract to the wrong person. In this context, the
actual entry into any contract appears in effect to be treated not as the
relevant breach, but as the consequence of the prior breach consisting in the
prior wrongful decision to award the contract. This is also consistent with the
way in which ATK’s present claim was formulated and litigated before Fraser J
who gave judgment on 29 July 2016, holding that the NDA had failed properly to
conduct the procurement process and ought to have awarded the contract to ATK.
If that proves to be the right analysis, it at least opens the way to a
submission under domestic law that the duty to mitigate arose as from the date
of ATK’s receipt of the decision to award the contract to CFP. I do not
understand ATK to have contested that in their submissions.</a></p><a name="para46">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para46"></a><a name="para47">47.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, since the appeal is concerned with what the Remedies
Directive and the 2006 Regulations treat as an existing infringement, an
argument that ATK failed to mitigate is in principle open to the NDA. But issue
(iii) as formulated before the Supreme Court (para 7(iii)), falls to be
answered with reference to the circumstances of this appeal. We are not
concerned with a familiar form of mitigation, such as a failure to take steps
to seek alternative business to replace the contract wrongly awarded to a
competitor. We are concerned with a very unusual form of mitigation, whereby,
it is suggested, ATK should have taken steps to prevent the NDA giving effect
to the NDA’s infringement, even if ATK thereby had to expose themselves to the
risks associated with the possibility of their challenge to the contract award
decision failing.</a></p><a name="para47">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para47"></a><a name="para48">48.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>That the so-called duty to mitigate may in some circumstances require
the victim of a breach to take steps by way of legal action is, in my opinion,
clear. Lord Pannick QC, representing the NDA, was able to refer to cases in
which English courts have held that the victim of a breach of duty should, by
way of mitigation, pursue available legal remedies, before, for example, suing
his professional advisers for negligence: <i>Western Trust &amp; Savings Ltd v
Travers &amp; Co</i> (1998) 75 P &amp; CR 200; <i>Walker v Geo H Medlicott
&amp; Son</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1998/1806.html">[1999] 1 WLR 727</a>. See also the discussion of these and other
cases in Jackson &amp; Powell on <i>Professional Liability</i> 8th ed (2017),
paras 11.336-11.339. The principle that a breach may call for mitigation, by
third party action of this sort, is therefore uncontroversial. If my builder
leaves my front door open and squatters enter, I cannot say that I have lost my
house. I must take steps, legal steps if necessary, to recover possession.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para49">49.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Pannick also referred to cases on the exercise of a discretion,
where the failure to seek interim relief as against the person or body alleged
to have been in breach of duty was regarded as a relevant factor. In one, Evans
LJ expressed a view that a failure to seek interim relief was relevant to the
exercise of discretion to give leave for judicial review of a local authority
decision to award a waste disposal contract to a competitor of the claimant: <i>Mass
Energy Ltd v Birmingham City Council</i> [1994] Env LR 298. In another, <i>R
(Gavin) v Haringey Borough Council</i> [2004] 1 PLR 61 David Richards J took
into account an objector’s failure to apply for interim relief - reasonable
though it was since such an application would have involved giving an
undertaking in damages - as relevant to an issue whether planning permission
should be quashed; the developer had a reasonable case for considering that the
planning permission was valid, and the objector’s failure had enabled the
developer, reasonably, to continue to incur costs on the development. The
factors relevant to an exercise of discretion can be very wide. But the
awarding of damages for a breach, or their refusal on account of a failure to
mitigate, is not discretionary.</a></p><a name="para49">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para49"></a><a name="para50">50.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>No authority was cited to us on a situation directly comparable to the
present, where it is submitted that the victim of a breach may be regarded as
acting unreasonably, by not taking steps to stop the perpetrator of the breach
from carrying it into effect. The NDA does not suggest that ATK’s conduct, in
delaying the issue of a claim form, would necessarily or always fall to be
regarded as unreasonable. The NDA’s proposition is that, on a full examination
at a trial of all the circumstances in the light of evidence, including in
particular examination of the reasons for ATK’s conduct, ATK may be held to
have acted unreasonably and thereby to have failed to avoid the loss of the
contract, so disabling itself from claiming damages for any loss arising from
the NDA’s entry into the contract with CFP, rather than with RSS.</a></p><a name="para50">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para50"></a><a name="para51">51.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In this connection, the NDA surmises, plausibly, that the reason why ATK
did not issue its claim form at a time when this would have put an automatic
stop on the NDA entering into the contract is that it appreciated that this
would lead to the NDA seeking to lift the stop. In that case, it would very
probably only have been possible to maintain the stop if ATK was ready and able
to put up security for any loss which the NDA would suffer through the
continuation of the stop. This, ATK may well not have been. But another
possible reason why ATK might not have been able to maintain the stop (or not have
thought it sensible to bring about a stop in the first place, by issuing a
claim form before the contract was entered into) was that it could not show
that damages would not constitute an adequate remedy if the NDA proved to have
failed wrongly to award the contract to the RSS consortium to which ATK
belonged.</a></p><a name="para51">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para51"></a><a name="para52">52.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The question therefore arises whether and on what basis it could be said
to be unreasonable for ATK to delay commencing proceedings until after the
entry into the contract. If ATK regarded damages as an adequate remedy, there
would be no point in bringing about a stop in the first place. Even if it did
not regard damages as an adequate remedy - and confident though it may have
been in the prospects of success of its (ultimately successful) challenge to the
NDA’s contract award decision - it may in its own interests have preferred to
rest on a claim for damages if its challenge to the contract award decision
succeeded, rather than give a cross-undertaking and expose itself to an
indeterminate liability thereunder if its challenge failed.</a></p><a name="para52">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para52"></a><a name="para53">53.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is true, as Lord Pannick submits, that the scheme of the Remedies
Directive and the 2006 Regulations aims specifically at giving an economic
operator the opportunity to stop the wrongful award of a procurement contract
to a competitor. But that does not mean that the economic operator is obliged
to take advantage of the opportunity. The scheme gives both parties choices as
to how to proceed and how to protect themselves. It assimilates the position,
after a stop has been placed on the entry into a contract by the issue of a
claim, with that which exists when a party is seeking an interim injunction:
see para 42(d) above. An economic operator is, under the scheme as enacted in
the United Kingdom, thus left free to issue a claim for damages after awaiting
the entry into the contract. If, on the other hand, it issues a claim before
entry into the contract, it is, on the face of it, also entitled to consider in
its own interests whether or not to give an undertaking or put up security, if
that is later required as the price of continuing the stop on entry into the
contract.</a></p><a name="para53">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para53"></a><a name="para54">54.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The provision of an undertaking or security as a condition of the
continuation of a stop order or stay is a matter of free choice for a party.
There is no basis for regarding the victim of an alleged breach seeking interim
relief as obliged to exercise that choice in the interests of the other party,
or indeed of anyone save itself. I am unable to accept the NDA’s proposition
that, because the court could reasonably demand a cross-undertaking or security
as a condition of a continuation of the stop order, it would or could be
regarded as unreasonable for ATK to refuse to put this up. For the court to
impose a condition as the price of continued relief which a party is seeking is
quite different from treating the victim of a breach as acting unreasonably if
it fails to seek a particular form of relief or to back it with an undertaking
or security.</a></p><a name="para54">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para54"></a><a name="para55">55.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The present issue only arises, by definition, in a context where the
contracting authority proves to have infringed procurement rules by its
contract award decision. Under the scheme, the contracting authority also has a
choice as to whether and how to act and to protect itself in a context where
this is alleged or is a possibility. If it wishes to avoid the exposure
resulting from having entered into the contract in circumstances where there is
still time for an aggrieved economic operator to issue a claim form, it can
delay entering into the contract until after the expiry of the 30 day period
allowed to the economic operator for issue of a claim form. The delayed entry
into the contract could involve the contracting authority in some loss, over
and above that due to the minimum ten day standstill anyway required under the
Remedies Directive and the 2006 Regulations. In the event that the contract
award decision proved not to have involved any infringement, the contracting
authority would have to bear that loss, without any recourse. But some loss of
this sort could anyway result under the scheme from the ten day standstill
period (and from the period which might elapse between the imposition of any
stop and its discharge, in a case where the Court did not see fit to continue
the stop by requiring an undertaking or security). The loss would on any view
be unlikely to be anything approaching that which would arise from entering
into the contract with one economic operator and being held liable to another
for having wrongly done so.</a></p><a name="para55">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para55"></a><a name="para56">56.

</span>In summary, an economic operator is entitled, in the face of what it
views as (and later proves to have been) a breach of duty by the contracting
authority, to leave it to the authority to take the risk of implementing its
wrongful award decision. The economic operator cannot be said to be acting
unreasonably if it fails to stop the authority from perpetrating a breach of
duty which the authority could itself stop perpetrating. It cannot be said to
be acting unreasonably if it refuses to give an undertaking or put up security
in order to maintain a stop which it has in the first instance obtained by
issuing a claim form before the authority has entered into the contract to give
effect to its wrongful contract award decision.</a></p><a name="para56">

</span>I add that it has not been - and could not be - suggested that the NDA
entered into the contract only because it thought that it was not exposed to a
subsequent claim by ATK. Indeed, NDA’s submissions before the Court of Appeal
said this (para 51):</a></p><a name="para57">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The [NDA] makes no bones about
the fact that, because of the financial implications of delay, it would have
applied to lift the suspension and (if successful) signed the contract, had
[ATK] sought to trigger and maintain the suspension without offering a
cross-undertaking in damages. The [NDA] does not know what it would have done
if a cross-undertaking had been offered - it would have depended upon advice
that was not in fact sought, and factors such as the likely date of an
expedited trial that did not become known, because of the way that [ATK] in
fact acted.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The second sentence indicates that the NDA might have
sought to remove any stop on its entry into of the contract, even if ATK had
offered a suitable cross-undertaking in order to achieve its continuation. In
other words, the NDA may, even in that context, have preferred to run the same
risk that it did by entering into the contract in this case.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para57"></a><a name="para58">58.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For the reasons I have given, I do not consider that there are any
circumstances in which ATK could be regarded as having failed unreasonably to
mitigate its loss arising from the NDA’s wrongful contract award decision, by
failing to initiate or pursue steps to prevent the NDA from implementing that
decision by entering into the contract with ATK’s competitor, CFP. Under the
scheme of the Remedies Directive and 2006 Regulations, each side had choices
which it was entitled to, and no doubt did, exercise in its own interests. In
these circumstances, the answer to issue (iii) is in the negative as the Court
of Appeal held.</a></p><a name="para58">

<p class="ParaHeading">Conclusion</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para58"></a><a name="para59">59.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Under issue (i), ATK’s case in this Court was that European Union law
requires a remedy in damages for any breach, whether serious or not, or that
this issue should at least be referred to the Court of Justice. This case
would, if accepted, have constituted a reason for reaching the same result as
the Court of Appeal did by reference to domestic law. The Supreme Court does
not however accept ATK’s case on this issue. Under issue (ii), the NDA’s case
has been the Court of Appeal was wrong to hold that, even though European Union
law only requires a remedy in damages for a serious breach, domestic law goes
further by requiring a remedy in damages for any breach, whether serious or
not. The NDA has succeeded, and its appeal should be allowed, on this issue.
Under issue (iii), the NDA also sought to establish that there should be a
trial as to whether an award of damages may in the circumstances of this case
be refused to an economic operator. The NDA has failed, and its appeal should
be dismissed, on this issue.</a></p><a name="para59">
