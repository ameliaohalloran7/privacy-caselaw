<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="_Hlk508183362">1.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This appeal tests the limits, in a modern context, of the long-established
remedy known as the solicitor’s equitable lien. In its traditional form it is
the means whereby equity provides a form of security for the recovery by
solicitors of their agreed charges for the successful conduct of litigation,
out of the fruits of that litigation. It is a judge-made remedy, motivated not
by any fondness for solicitors as fellow lawyers or even as officers of the
court, but rather because it promotes access to justice. Specifically it
enables solicitors to offer litigation services on credit to clients who,
although they have a meritorious case, lack the financial resources to pay up
front for its pursuit. It is called a solicitor’s lien because solicitors used
to have a virtual monopoly on the pursuit of litigation in the higher courts.
Nothing in this judgment should be read as deciding whether the relaxation of
that monopoly means that the lien is still limited only to solicitors.</a></p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2">2.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Solicitors have, since time immemorial, been entitled to a common law
retaining lien for payment of their costs and disbursements. That is an
essentially defensive remedy, which merely enables them to hold on to their
clients’ papers and other property in their actual possession, pending payment.
It affords no assistance where there is nothing of value in the solicitor’s
possession, and is powerless where, in a litigation context, the defendant to
the claim pays the judgment debt or agreed settlement amount direct to the
solicitor’s client, the claimant. But equity deals with that deficiency in the
common law by first recognising, and then enforcing, an equitable interest of
the solicitor in the fruits of the litigation, against anyone who, with notice
of it, deals with the fruits in a manner which would otherwise defeat that
interest.</a></p><a name="para2">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2"></a><a name="para3">3.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Originally the fruits of the litigation were first identified in the
judgment debt. Later this was extended to the debt due under an arbitration
award and, later still, to the debt due to the claimant under an agreement to
settle the claim. Each of those types of debt was identified as a form of
property, a chose in action, in which equity could recognise and enforce an
equitable interest in favour of the solicitor. It was called a lien because the
chose in action represented the fruits of the solicitor’s work. But it is better
analysed as a form of equitable charge. Traditionally, the solicitor’s interest
could not be identified as a beneficial share in the chose, because that would
have offended the laws against maintenance and champerty. Rather it was, from
the earliest times, recognised as a security interest, enforceable against the
fruits of the litigation up to the amount contractually due to the solicitor,
in priority to the interest of the successful client, or anyone claiming
through him. It did not depend upon the fruits of the litigation including a
specific amount for party and party costs, such as a judgment for costs, or an
element in a settlement sum on account of costs.</a></p><a name="para3">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para3"></a><a name="para4">4.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the ordinary course of traditional litigation, with solicitors acting
on both sides, the amount due under a judgment, award or settlement agreement
would be paid by the defendant’s solicitor to the claimant’s solicitor. Or the
claimant’s solicitor might recover the sum due to his client by processes of
execution. In either case the equitable lien would entitle the solicitor not
merely to hold on to the money received, but to deduct his charges from it
before accounting to his client for the balance. But equity would also enforce
the security where the defendant (or his agent or insurer) paid the debt direct
to the claimant, if the payer had either colluded with the claimant to cheat
the solicitor out of his charges, or dealt with the debt inconsistently with
the solicitor’s equitable interest in it, after having notice of that interest.
In an appropriate case the court would require the payer to pay the solicitor’s
charges again, direct to the solicitor, leaving the payer to such remedy as he
might have against the claimant. This form of remedy, or intervention as it is
sometimes called, arose naturally from the application of equitable principles,
in which equitable interests may be enforced <i>in personam</i> against anyone
whose conscience is affected by having notice of them, either to prevent him
dealing inconsistently with them, or by holding him to account if he does.</a></p><a name="para4">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para4"></a><a name="para5">5.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The modern context in which the extent of this remedy comes to be
reviewed is that of the pursuit of modest claims for personal injuries arising
out of road traffic accidents, by solicitors retained under a Conditional Fee
Agreement (“CFA”) using the Pre-Action Protocol for Low Value Personal Injury
Claims in Road Traffic Accidents (“the RTA Protocol”). In bare outline this
highly effective scheme, hammered out by stakeholders under the auspices of the
Civil Justice Council and approved by the Civil Procedure Rule Committee,
enables modest claims for personal injuries to be notified by the claimant’s
solicitors to the defendant’s insurer using a bespoke online platform (“The RTA
Portal”) and, where liability is admitted, for a settlement to be negotiated,
or quantum to be determined by the court, at a fraction of the cost and effort
which would have to be deployed if the matter were to become the subject of
ordinary proceedings in the County Court, and on terms which reward the
claimant’s solicitors with modest fixed costs for their work on the process. It
is an express objective of the RTA Protocol, and its provisions are designed so
to ensure, that the solicitors are paid their fixed costs and charges at each
stage of the process, direct by the defendant’s insurer.</a></p><a name="para5">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para5"></a><a name="para6">6.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The <i>casus belli</i> for this litigation was a decision by the
appellant insurer (“Haven”) to respond to the notification of claims on the RTA
Portal by offering to settle direct with claimants, on terms which included no
amount for their solicitors’ costs or disbursements (fixed or otherwise), with
the twin inducements to claimants of a speedier and more generous payment than
would be likely to be available from a settlement using the RTA Protocol and
Portal. The motivation of the insurer was the opportunity to avoid having to
add, to the settlement amount for the injury, the fixed costs and disbursements
payable under the terms of the RTA Protocol to the claimants’ solicitors.</a></p><a name="para6">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para6"></a><a name="para7">7.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Settlements thereby achieved included claims by clients of the
respondent solicitors (“Edmondson”) arising from three motor accidents, all of
whom retained the respondent firm on a particular type of identically worded
CFA retainer, known in the trade as a “CFA Lite”, designed to ensure that in no
circumstances would the client have to put his hands in his own pocket for
payment of the firm’s charges. Edmondson responded by a claim against Haven for
wrongful inducement to the clients to breach their retainer contract,
intentional causing of loss by unlawful means and, by amendment, seeking equitable
enforcement of its solicitors’ lien. Although the sums involved are
individually modest, we were told that this practice by Haven had been repeated
on a sufficiently large scale for the determination of the dispute to have
financial consequences running to many millions of pounds.</a></p><a name="para7">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para7"></a><a name="para8">8.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The trial judge (HHJ Jarman QC) rejected the claims in tort and refused
to grant permission to appeal in respect of those claims. An application for
permission was made to the Court of Appeal, but not dealt with because of its
disposal of the claim to enforce the solicitors’ lien. That claim was rejected
by the trial judge because, in his view, there had been no collusion between
Haven and the claimants to cheat the solicitors, and because Haven was not on
notice of the terms of the retainers.</a></p><a name="para8">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para8"></a><a name="para9">9.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the Court of Appeal </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2015/1230.html">[2015] EWCA Civ 1230</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2015/1230.html">[2016] 1 WLR 1385</a> the main
submission of Haven was that the particular terms of the CFA Lite retainers
created no contractual liability of the claimants for Edmondson’s charges, so
that there was nothing upon which an equitable security could be founded. The
Court of Appeal agreed that there was no such contractual liability upon the
true construction of the retainers. Nonetheless it decided that the equitable
jurisdiction to intervene could be extended far enough to enable the court to
recognise and then enforce an interest of Edmondson under the RTA Protocol in
receiving its fixed costs and charges as therein provided or, alternatively, an
interest under an express provision in the retainers to sue in its client’s
names for recovery of those charges from Haven, and that Haven knew of those
interests. Accordingly the Court of Appeal ordered Haven to pay the charges
allowable under the RTA Protocol to Edmondson, in addition to the settlement sums
already paid to the claimants.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para10">10.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In this court Haven repeated its main submission that the retainers
created no contractual liability to pay the charges upon which an equitable
lien or charge could be founded, and submitted that the Court of Appeal had
been wrong to extend the equity of intervention as it did, the extension being
contrary to settled principle. Edmondson countered first by asserting that the
retainers did contain a sufficient contractual liability of the clients for
their charges to support their equitable lien on conventional grounds.
Secondly, and in the alternative, Edmondson vigorously supported the extended
power of equitable intervention in the absence of such a contractual liability,
as devised by the Court of Appeal. This court permitted The Law Society of
England and Wales to intervene in writing, broadly in support of the solution
devised by the Court of Appeal, and to submit written evidence about the
widespread use of the CFA Lite, and the use of the RTA Protocol. The court is
grateful for the submissions both of the parties and of the Law Society.</a></p><a name="para10">

</span>This is, according to the researches of counsel, the first occasion for
this court (or its predecessor) to consider the nature and effect of the
solicitors’ equitable lien. It is therefore appropriate to describe its
evolution in a little more detail than might otherwise have been necessary.
Before doing so, I must first summarise the facts, set out the relevant terms
of the CFA Lite retainer, and describe the terms and modus operandi of the RTA

</span>Mr Ainsley Tonkin was involved in a road traffic collision on 10 April
2012. Haven’s insured was also involved in the collision and on the 12 April
2012. Haven, having obtained Mr Tonkin’s contact details from its insured’s
accident report form, contacted Mr Tonkin concerning a hire vehicle. On 16
April 2012 Mr Tonkin entered into a CFA with Edmondson and on 17 April 2012 the
case entered the Portal. On 20 April 2012 Mr Tonkin telephoned Haven asking “where
they go from here”. He was told by Louise Richardson of Haven:</a></p><a name="para13">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“... What we can do is offer you a
scheme to compensate you for your injury. We can work out a sum of money and
you can put it into your account as soon as you agree on that figure.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para13"></a><a name="para14">14.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr Tonkin told Ms Richardson that he had his insurance solicitor and
volunteered the information that there was a 14-day cooling off period. They
then negotiated on the telephone and Ms Richardson offered £2,200. She said:</a></p><a name="para14">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“So the offer stands at the moment
at two thousand two hundred pounds and obviously [indecipherable] think about
it but if you do ask your solicitors they will tell you that they can get you
more ... but at the end of the day that offer will come from myself and we
through solicitors we have to pay solicitor costs as well.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para14"></a><a name="para15">15.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr Tonkin replied that he fully understood that and went on to raise
other matters. They eventually negotiated a settlement at £2,350. Mr Tonkin
asked what he should do about the solicitors he had instructed. Ms Richardson
said he should just call them and tell them that he did not want to deal with
them any more and they could just close the claim. On 23 April 2012 Haven sent
a written offer of settlement to Mr Tonkin who on 24 April 2012 completed and
signed the “mandate of acceptance” which was returned to Haven on 26 April. The
mandate of acceptance confirmed that the offer was accepted: “in full and final
settlement of my claim for Pain, Suffering &amp; Loss of Amenity in respect of
injuries sustained and any financial losses incurred in relation to the road
traffic accident.”</a></p><a name="para15">

</span>On 23 June 2012, Mr Michael Wheater, Mr Dale Makey, Mr Saul Mohsin and
Ms Rose Lunt were all travelling in the same vehicle when it was involved in a
road traffic accident. On 20 July 2012 all four entered into CFAs with
Edmondson and on 23 July 2012 their cases entered the Portal. On 24 July 2012
Haven sent to each of them a letter containing an offer of settlement. On 7
August 2012 Mr Mohsin telephoned Mr O’Connell of Haven who told him that “we
offer services if you want to come to us to avoid going to the solicitors”. Mr
Mohsin explained that he had actually gone to some solicitors but he was
concerned that it was going to take a long time to get everything settled.
Later that day Mr Mohsin telephoned Haven again with the news that he had
spoken to Mr Wheater, Mr Makey and Ms Lunt and that they were all going to
accept the offer. On the same day Mr Mohsin sent an email enclosing mandates of
acceptance completed by all four claimants.</a></p><a name="para16">

</span>Mr Daniel Grannell was involved in a road traffic accident on 30 August
2012. On the following day he entered into a CFA with Edmondson and his case
entered the Portal that day. On 10 September 2012 Haven sent Mr Grannell a
letter offering to settle the claim for £1,900. On 14 September 2012 Haven
received a completed mandate of acceptance signed by Mr Grannell on 13
September 2012.</a></p><a name="para17">

</span>Thereafter an impostor claiming to be Mr Grannell spoke by telephone
with Haven and the compensation was paid to an account on his directions. When
Mr Grannell subsequently contacted Haven, Haven became aware that it had been
defrauded. In a telephone conversation on 6 November 2012 Mr Grannell stated
that the mandate of acceptance dated 13 September 2012 was genuine. Mr Ralph
McClaren of Haven told him that the offer of £1,900 was still on the table and
that he could arrange for that to be paid at once. Mr Grannell replied that he
would love that. Mr McClaren then said that he would contact Edmondson and tell
Edmondson what they had done. He then added:</a></p><a name="para18">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“As I say they’ll probably when
you speak to them they’ll probably will tell you not to ya know or you shouldn’t
do that but for the to be honest with you if when they call you probably a bit
less the reason we offer you a bit more is because of the fact the solicitors
get kept out of it so we don't have to pay their fees that’s basically it.”</p>

</span>The facts relevant to the issue about notice were the same in all three
cases. As will shortly appear, the RTA Protocol prescribes a simple online form
of notification of a claim (a Claim Notification Form or “CNF”) which contains
a tick box opposite a statement that the solicitors had been retained under a
CFA which provided for a success fee. In each case Edmondson ticked the box and
filled in the date of the retainer. Thus Haven knew that information via the
Portal before it began negotiating with the claimants. Haven did not know the
detailed terms of the retainers, which I shall now describe.</a></p><a name="para19">

</span>Each of the claimants retained Edmondson on identical terms. They were
each sent, on the same day, the following documents. First, a document headed
(under the firm’s logo) “CFA”, containing these relevant provisions:</a></p><a name="para20">

</span>This voluntary pre-action protocol came into force in 2010. At the relevant
time for present purposes it applied to claims for RTA personal injuries
between £1,000 (which was the dividing line between the Fast Track and the
Small Claims Track) and £10,000. It has since been extended to higher value
claims, up to £25,000, which corresponds with the boundary between the Fast
Track and the Multi Track. Current Government proposals to raise the Small
Claims Track boundary to £5,000 for RTA cases may greatly affect its scope,
since more that 90% by number of RTA cases are for damages below that level.</a></p><a name="para23">

from the judgment of Lloyd Jones LJ in the Court of Appeal. The Protocol
describes in great detail the behaviour the court will normally expect of
parties, of their legal representatives and of the parties’ insurers, involved
in such claims. Under the Protocol scheme parties, lawyers and insurers, when
required to send information to one another, are expected to do so
electronically through a website (“the Portal”) established by road accident
insurers. While notice of claims falling within the Protocol is expected to be
given in accordance with the procedures set out in the Protocol, they are not
mandatory. However, there are possible costs consequences if qualifying claims
are not processed in accordance with the Protocol.</a></p><a name="para24">

Equitable Lien: the Existing Law</span></b></p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para29"></a><a name="para30">30.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The earliest decision to recognise the equitable lien is <i>Welsh v Hole
</i>(1779) 1 Dougl KB 238. The plaintiff obtained judgment for £20 and costs in
a civil claim for assault, but then compromised the claim for a direct payment
by the defendant of £10. There was no collusion to defeat the solicitor’s right
to payment of his bill. Lord Mansfield said this:</a></p><a name="para30">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“An attorney has a lien on the
money recovered by his client, for his bill of costs; if the money come to his
hands, he may retain to the amount of his bill. He may stop it in transit if he
can lay hold of it. If he apply to the Court, they will prevent its being paid
over till his demand is satisfied. I am inclined to go still farther, and to
hold that, if the attorney give notice to the defendant not to pay till his
bill should be discharged, a payment by the defendant after such notice would
be in his own wrong, and like paying a debt which has been assigned, after
notice. But I think we cannot go beyond those limits.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">There having been no notice in that case, the solicitor’s
claim against the defendant failed. It is implicit in Lord Mansfield’s
reasoning that, if there had been notice to the defendant, he would have had to
pay a second time, up to the amount of the solicitor’s bill. The typically
terse judgment may be said to have dealt with legal and equitable lien without
clearly distinguishing between the two, but the analogy of an assigned debt
shows that Lord Mansfield recognised that the solicitor had an interest in the
judgment debt which the court would protect, provided that notice of that
interest had been given to the debtor before payment to the judgment creditor. An
interest dependent upon notice is typical of an equitable interest.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para30"></a><a name="para31">31.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Confirmation that payment of the judgment debt to the claimant after
notice of the solicitor’s interest exposed the payer to having to pay again was
provided in <i>Read v Dupper</i> </a><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1795/4137.pdf">101 ER 595</a> (1795) 6 Term Rep 361. In that case the
defendant’s solicitor paid the plaintiff direct, after notice of the
plaintiff’s solicitor’s interest, and had to pay again. Lord Kenyon began:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The principle by which this
application is to be decided was settled long ago, namely that the party should
not run away with the fruits of the cause without satisfying the legal demands
of his attorney, by whose industry, and in many instances at whose expense,
those fruits are obtained.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Lord Kenyon explained Lord Mansfield’s reference to
assignment in <i>Welsh v Hole </i>in terms of equitable principle. He said:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… according to the rules of
equity and honest dealing if the assignee give notice to the debtor of such
assignment, he shall not afterwards be suffered to avail himself of a payment
to the principal in fraud of such notice.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para32">32.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

debt arising from an arbitration award. That appears to have been a case of
collusion, because Lord Kenyon described the arrangement to pay the claimant
direct as:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“no other than a mere shuffle
between the plaintiff and defendant to cheat the attorney of his lien.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">He described the extension of the principle to
accommodate arbitration awards as justified by “convenience, good sense and
justice” and recognised a public interest in the extension, to encourage
litigants to use arbitration.</p>

</span>Two early cases demonstrate that access to justice lay behind the
development of the principle. The first is <i>Ex p Bryant </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1815/982.html">(1815) 1 Madd 49</a>.
Vice Chancellor Plumer said:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“I do not wish to relax the
doctrine as to lien, for it is to the advantage of clients, as well as
solicitors; for business is often transacted by solicitors for needy clients,
merely on the prospect of having their costs under the doctrine as to lien.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The Vice Chancellor also said, <i>obiter,</i> that
knowledge of the solicitor’s lien on the part of the payer would be as
effective as notice. To the same effect is <i>Gould v Davis </i>(1831) 1 Cr
&amp; J 415.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para34">34.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The second case is <i>In re Moss</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpEq/1866/133.html">(1866) LR 2 Eq 345</a>, although it was
about a legal rather than equitable lien. Lord Romilly MR said:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“I think it of great importance to
preserve the lien of solicitors. That is the real security for solicitors
engaged in business. It is also beneficial to the suitors. It would frequently
happen, but for the lien which solicitors have upon papers and deeds, that a
client who is not able to advance money to enable them to carry on business would
be deprived of justice, through inability to prosecute his claims in the suit.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para35">35.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><i>Barker v St Quintin</i> (1844) 12 M &amp; W 441, </a><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1844/134.pdf">152 ER 1270</a> shows, better than
any other, that the equitable lien operates by way of security or charge. Baron
Parke said:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The lien which an attorney is
said to have on a judgment (which is, perhaps, an incorrect expression) is
merely a claim to the equitable interference of the Court to have that judgment
held as a security for his debt.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">A similar analysis is provided by Lord Hanworth MR in<i>
Mason v Mason and Cottrell</i> [1933] P 199, at 214. The use of the concepts
security and charge imply that there must be identified some fund over which it
can operate. This was described as a necessary condition of equitable
interference under this principle in <i>In re Fuld dec’d (No 4)</i> [1968] P
727, per Scarman J at 736. The requirement for a fund may be satisfied not just
by a judgment debt or arbitration award, but also by a debt arising from a
settlement agreement. Provided that the debt has arisen in part from the
activities of the solicitor there is no reason in principle (and none has been
suggested) why formal proceedings must first have been issued, all the more so
in modern times when parties and their solicitors are encouraged as a matter of
policy to attempt to resolve disputes by suitable forms of ADR, and when
pre-action protocols of widely differing kinds have been developed precisely
for that purpose.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para36">36.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The authorities on the solicitors’ equitable lien (including many of
those summarised above) were recently reviewed by the Court of Appeal in <i>Khans
Solicitors v Chifuntwe</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2013/481.html">[2014] 1 WLR 1185</a>. The fund in question consisted of
a debt arising from the agreement of the Home Secretary to settle pending
judicial review proceedings by a payment of a specific sum on account of the
claimant’s costs. The payment was made direct by the Treasury Solicitor to the
claimant (by then acting in person) after express notice from the claimant’s
former solicitors that they claimed a lien. The Home Secretary was ordered to pay
the settlement sum a second time to the solicitors, less an amount already paid
by the client on account. Sir Stephen Sedley provided this summary, at para 33:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In our judgment, the law is today
(and, in our view, has been for fully two centuries) that the court will
intervene to protect a solicitor’s claim on funds recovered or due to be
recovered by a client or former client if (a) the paying party is colluding
with the client to cheat the solicitor of his fees, or (b) the paying party is
on notice that the other party’s solicitor has a claim on the funds for
outstanding fees. The form of protection ought to be preventative but may in a
proper case take the form of dual payment.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para37">37.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I consider that to be a correct statement of the law. It recognises that
the equity depends upon the solicitor having a claim for his charges against
the client, that there must be something in the nature of a fund against which
equity can recognise that his claim extends (which is usually a debt owed by
the defendant to the solicitor’s client which owes its existence, at least in
part, to the solicitor’s services to the client) and that for equity to
intervene there must be something sufficiently affecting the conscience of the
payer, either in the form of collusion to cheat the solicitor or notice (or, I
would add knowledge) of the solicitor’s claim against, or interest in, the
fund. The outcome of the case also recognised that the solicitor’s claim is
limited to the unpaid amount of his charges. Implicit in that is the recognition
that the solicitor’s interest in the fund is a security interest, in the nature
of an equitable charge.</a></p><a name="para37">

</span>It remains to consider whether the decision of the Court of Appeal in
the present case is either an application of that settled principle, or a legitimate
extension of it, in the context of its finding that Edmondson had no
contractual entitlement to its charges from any of the claimants, but only the
expectation of receiving fixed costs, disbursements and a success fee under the
terms of the RTA Protocol. But it is first necessary to determine whether or
not Edmondson did have a contractual entitlement to its charges under the CFA.</a></p><a name="para38">

<p class="ParaHeading"><b><span style="font-style:normal">Construction of the CFA

</span>At the heart of the Court of Appeal’s analysis lay a negative answer to
that question. Like the trial judge, Lloyd Jones LJ identified a tension
between the terms of the CFA itself (incorporating the Law Society’s standard
2005 terms) and the last quoted passage in the Client Care Letter which, being
labelled for the avoidance of any doubt, was held to prevail. At para 18 he
said:</a></p><a name="para39">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The solicitor has no recourse
against his client for the fees and is limited to what he can recover from the
losing side.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Later, at para 30, he continued:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“I consider that the effect of the
client care letter is to override the general provisions in each CFA with the
result that the underlying claimants were not under any personal liability to
pay the fees of Edmondson. Rather, Edmondson has limited its fees to what may
be recovered from the defendants in the underlying proceedings. In these
circumstances, Edmondson would not have a lien over assets received on its
clients’ account because there is no underlying liability of the clients to
Edmondson for the lien to protect.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para39"></a><a name="para40">40.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I respectfully disagree. In my judgment, for the reasons which follow,
the Client Care Letter did not destroy the basic liability of the client for
Edmondson’s charges expressly declared in the CFA and Law Society’s standard terms.
It merely limited the recourse from which Edmondson could satisfy that
liability to the amount of its recoveries from the defendant. It both preserved
and in my view affirmed that basic contractual liability, to the full extent
necessary to form the basis of a claim to an equitable charge as security.</a></p><a name="para40">

</span>The first question is whether the Client Care Letter had contractual
effect at all. Both it and the two other documents sought to make it clear that
the full terms of the retainer were to be found in the CFA document and in the
incorporated Law Society terms. Nonetheless I am prepared to assume, in favour
of the client, that the last quoted passage in the Client Care Letter was
either part of the contract of retainer, or a collateral contract.</a></p><a name="para41">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para41"></a><a name="para42">42.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I consider that the language of that passage does three things. First,
it asserts a right for Edmondson to recover its fees and charges from the
defendant. That affirms the equitable lien, since there would otherwise be no
basis upon which Edmondson could do so. Secondly it states in clear terms that
such a recovery is the means by which Edmondson can give effect to a continuing
responsibility of the client for those fees. Thirdly it limits Edmondson’s
recourse for the fees to the amount recovered from the defendant.</a></p><a name="para42">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para42"></a><a name="para43">43.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There is in my view a compelling parallel in a limited recourse secured
loan agreement. A lender may lend a million pounds to a borrower, take valuable
security, and then agree to limit his recourse to the amount recovered by
enforcing that security. It would be absurd to say that the lender thereby
deprived the security of all effect because the borrower would not have to put
his hand in his pocket to pay anything in addition.</a></p><a name="para43">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para43"></a><a name="para44">44.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Client Care Letter was plainly intended to be read, so far as
possible, in accordance with, rather than in opposition to, the CFA and Law
Society’s terms. Those two documents are, in the passages from them quoted
above, shot through with clear assertions of the client’s responsibility for
the firm’s charges in the event of a win in the litigation, which is defined to
include a settlement of the claim under which there is an agreement to pay the
claimant damages. Full effect can be given to the objective stated in the
Client Care Letter, that the client should not have to put his hand in his own
pocket to pay the solicitors’ charges, without destroying the basic contractual
responsibility of the client for their payment, if it is construed as I have
described.</a></p><a name="para44">

<p class="ParaHeading"><b><span style="font-style:normal">Did Haven have Notice
of Edmondson’s Lien?</span></b></p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para44"></a><a name="para45">45.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The result of the above analysis is that there did exist, in each of the
six cases, a sufficient contractual entitlement of Edmondson against its
claimant clients to form the basis of a claim to an equitable lien over the
agreed settlement debts payable by Haven on behalf of its insured drivers. The
conventional analysis therefore requires the following questions to be
answered: (1) did those settlement debts owe their creation, to a significant
extent, to Edmondson’s services provided to the claimants under the CFAs? and
(2) in the absence of collusion did Haven have notice (or knowledge) of
Edmondson’s interest in the settlement debts?</a></p><a name="para45">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para45"></a><a name="para46">46.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There has been no challenge to an affirmative answer to the first
question, save in the case of Mr Tonkin, to which I shall return below. Edmondson
completed and lodged the CNFs onto the RTA Portal as the first step in its
discharge of its duties under its retainers. Each CNF contained a sufficient
description of the clients’ claims and an indication that, unless settled, they
would in due course lead to litigation. Even though it did not involve
Edmondson in much work, it was enough to trigger Edmondson’s entitlement to its
basic charge, disbursements and success fee under the CFA terms if there ensued
a successful outcome to the claim, and enough to galvanise Haven into making a
direct settlement offer to each of the claimants.</a></p><a name="para46">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para46"></a><a name="para47">47.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The question of knowledge or notice is in dispute. Absence of notice was
the main reason why the claims failed before the judge. In his view it was a
fatal objection that Haven did not know the detailed terms of the CFAs. In the
Court of Appeal it was held that Haven had both express notice, implied notice
and the requisite knowledge in any event. The claim under the traditional
principles of equitable lien failed, not because of absence of notice, but
because there was no underlying responsibility of the clients to pay
Edmondson’s charges.</a></p><a name="para47">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para47"></a><a name="para48">48.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is common ground that, by the time that Haven paid the settlement
sums direct to the claimants, it knew that each of them had retained Edmondson
under a CFA, but not its detailed terms. This much was apparent from the CNFs
which Edmondson placed on the Portal. Haven also knew, from the fact that
Edmondson chose to initiate each claim by using the RTA Portal, that Edmondson
was most unlikely to have been paid its charges up front, but rather that it
expected, if successful, to obtain payment of its charges from monies paid by
Haven under the terms of the RTA Protocol, if the case settled while in the
Portal, or by way of a costs order if it went to court. Either way, Haven knew
that Edmondson was looking to the fruits of the claim for recovery of its
charges.</a></p><a name="para48">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para48"></a><a name="para49">49.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Haven’s knowledge that, if the claim could not be settled direct, it
would have to fund Edmondson’s recoverable charges is also apparent from the
recorded telephone conversations with Mr Tonkin and Mr Grannell set out above. The
judge found that Haven had this knowledge, and intended by settling direct to
avoid having to pay Edmondson’s charges. The claim of collusion failed, not
because Haven lacked the requisite intent, but because each of the claimants
did.</a></p><a name="para49">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para49"></a><a name="para50">50.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In my judgment the Court of Appeal’s approach to the question of notice
is to be preferred to that of the judge. Once a defendant or his insurer is
notified that a claimant in an RTA case has retained solicitors under a CFA,
and that the solicitors are proceeding under the RTA Protocol, they have the
requisite notice and knowledge to make a subsequent payment of settlement
monies direct to the claimant unconscionable, as an interference with the
solicitor’s interest in the fruits of the litigation. The very essence of a CFA
is that the solicitor and client have agreed that the solicitor will be
entitled to charges if the case is won. Recovery of those charges from the
fruits of the litigation is a central feature of the RTA Protocol.</a></p><a name="para50">

<p class="ParaHeading"><b><span style="font-style:normal">The re-formulation of
the Equitable Lien by the Court of Appeal</span></b></p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para50"></a><a name="para51">51.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This court’s conclusion that the CFAs made between Edmondson and its
clients did contain a sufficient contractual entitlement to charges to support
the equitable lien on traditional grounds makes it strictly unnecessary to
address this further question, because the sub-stratum upon which it is based
is missing. There is simply no need, on these facts, to do more than apply the
principles summarised in the <i>Khans </i>case, to reach the conclusion that
Edmondson are entitled to have Haven pay them the charges identified in the
CFAs as recoverable in the event of a win, to the extent that those charges did
not exceed the settlement sums actually agreed to be paid to the claimants.</a></p><a name="para51">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para51"></a><a name="para52">52.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>But the correctness or otherwise of the Court of Appeal’s reformulation
of the principle has been extensively argued, and supported by the Law Society
as intervener. The Court of Appeal rested its conclusion on two alternative
grounds, both of which assumed that Edmondson’s clients had no contractual
responsibility of any kind for its charges. The first was that Edmondson had
its own entitlement to recover its charges from Haven under the RTA Protocol. The
second was that the clients had such an entitlement, and Edmondson had a right
to sue Haven for its enforcement using the client’s name for that purpose.</a></p><a name="para52">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para52"></a><a name="para53">53.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There are in my judgment insuperable obstacles in the way of each of
those alternatives. They stem mainly from the voluntary nature of the RTA
Protocol. It is not contractual in nature (although participants do undertake
certain irrelevant contractual obligations to PortalCo, which operates the RTA
Portal). A failure to comply with some provisions, such as the requirement to
lodge a CNF response within 15 days, automatically leads to the case leaving
the scheme. Other breaches of its terms entitle, but do not oblige, the other
party to take the case out of the scheme. True it is that, in a case where
liability is not in issue, the solicitor participant has an expectation that it
will receive its charges stage by stage under the scheme from the defendant’s
insurer, but that is not a contractual or other legal right. Generally, breach
of protocol terms may lead to adverse costs orders if the matter then becomes
the subject of proceedings in court, but this lies in the discretion of the
court.</a></p><a name="para53">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para53"></a><a name="para54">54.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For this purpose I am prepared to assume that an offer of a settlement
payment, made direct by the insurer to the claimant, which makes no provision
for payment of Stage 2 fixed costs, disbursements and a success fee to the
solicitor, at a time when a case has entered and not yet left the scheme, is a
breach of paragraph 7.37 of the RTA Protocol. But it creates no legal or
equitable rights of any kind, if the client has no responsibility to the
solicitor sufficient to support the solicitor’s lien. There is no legal
entitlement of the solicitor direct against the insurer which the lien can
support by way of security.</a></p><a name="para54">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para54"></a><a name="para55">55.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As for suing in the name of the client, this is (as counsel agreed) a form
of contractual subrogation. The solicitor can be in no better position than the
client, as against the insurer. In the present case, all the clients contracted
with Haven to receive settlement sums which did not include a costs element,
and were paid in full. Any attempt by Edmondson to stand in their shoes by way
of subrogation would be met by an unanswerable defence from Haven, based upon
the settlement agreements.</a></p><a name="para55">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para55"></a><a name="para56">56.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Counsel for Edmondson presented a detailed and vigorous submission to
the effect that the flexibility of the equitable remedy for the protection of
solicitors was apt to respond to any instance of unconscionable conduct by the
insurer, including breach of the RTA Protocol, all the more so because of the
strong public policy in enforcing the scheme, designed as it was to balance the
competing interests of its stakeholders while ensuring access to justice for
the victims of road accidents at proportionate cost. He sought to show, by
reference to the cases which I have summarised, that this remedy had that
flexibility from the outset.</a></p><a name="para56">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para56"></a><a name="para57">57.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I acknowledge that equity operates with a flexibility not shared by the
common law, and that it can and does adapt its remedies to changing times. But
equity nonetheless operates in accordance with principles. While most equitable
remedies are discretionary, those principles provide a framework which makes
equity part of a system of English law which is renowned for its
predictability. I have sought to identify from the cases the settled principles
upon which this equitable remedy works. One of them is that the client has a
responsibility for the solicitor’s charges.</a></p><a name="para57">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para57"></a><a name="para58">58.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is simply wrong in my view to seek to distil from those cases a
general principle that equity will protect solicitors from any unconscionable
interference with their expectations in relation to recovery of their charges. Furthermore
the careful balance of competing interests enshrined in the RTA Protocol
assumes that a solicitor’s expectation of recovery of his charges from the
defendant’s insurer is underpinned by the equitable lien, based as it is upon a
sufficient responsibility of the client for those charges. Were there no such
responsibility, it is hard to see how the payment of charges to the solicitor,
rather than to the client, would be justified. Furthermore, part of the balance
struck by the RTA Protocol is its voluntary nature. Its voluntary use stems
from a perception by all stakeholders that its use is better for them than
having every modest case go to court. If the court were to step in to grant
coercive remedies to those affected by its misuse by others, that balance would
in all probability be undermined.</a></p><a name="para58">

<p class="ParaHeading"><b><span style="font-style:normal">Mr Tonkin</span></b></p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para58"></a><a name="para59">59.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It was submitted for Haven that the particular facts about Mr Tonkin’s
case did not entitle Edmondson to an equitable lien because, it was said,
Edmondson’s work pursuant to its retainer made no significant contribution to
the settlement. The submission was that Haven offered Mr Tonkin a settlement
before, and without regard to, Edmondson logging Mr Tonkin’s claim onto the
Portal.</a></p><a name="para59">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para59"></a><a name="para60">60.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I disagree. The relevant chronology is as follows. On 12 April 2012,
shortly after the accident, Haven contacted Mr Tonkin to discuss the provision
of a hire car for him. This had nothing to do with a personal injury claim,
although of course it arose from the same accident. Mr Tonkin and Edmondson
entered into a CFA for the purpose of pursuing his personal injury claim on 16
April and, on the following day, Edmondson logged the details of that claim
onto the Portal. Three days later, on 20 April, and after Haven had
acknowledged the claim on the Portal, Mr Tonkin telephoned Haven. The
transcript of the conversation shows that he was ringing about the provision of
a hire car. Haven took that opportunity to make him an oral settlement offer
for his personal injuries, initially of £2,200, later revised after negotiation
to £2,350. This was repeated in writing by Haven on 23 April, and accepted by
Mr Tonkin on the following day.</a></p><a name="para60">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para60"></a><a name="para61">61.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Solicitors for a claimant generally contribute to a settlement by
logging an RTA claim onto the Portal in two ways. First, they thereby supply to
the insurer the essential details of the claim necessary for the insurer to
appraise it and decide whether, and if so in what amount, to make a settlement
offer. These go well beyond the details the insurer is likely to receive from
its insured’s accident report, although that report will be likely to assist
the insurer to decide whether liability should be put in issue. Secondly, they
thereby demonstrate that the claimant intends seriously to pursue a claim for
personal injuries, and has obtained, by the CFA, the services of solicitors for
that purpose on terms which do not require the claimant to provide his own
litigation funding up front. The incentive which that will usually supply to
the insurer to settle a modest claim early, before costs increase, and where
liability is not in issue, is obvious.</a></p><a name="para61">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para61"></a><a name="para62">62.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In Mr Tonkin’s case the evidence does not show that Haven had, before
Edmondson logged the claim onto the Portal, already obtained any, let alone any
sufficient, information about the personal injuries claim. The earlier
discussion with Mr Tonkin was about the provision of a hire car. Moreover the
chronology shows that Haven had already received and acknowledged Mr Tonkin’s
personal injury claim via the Portal before it made him a settlement offer. Nor
did Mr Tonkin telephone Haven on 20 April to seek such a settlement. The
inference is plain that Haven was encouraged by the logging of the claim onto
the Portal to make an early offer of settlement, and nothing in the judge’s
findings of fact displaces it.</a></p><a name="para62">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para62"></a><a name="para63">63.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr Tonkin’s claim is not therefore an exception to the others, so far as
concerns the application of the established principles about the solicitor’s
equitable lien. Edmondson made a modest but still significant contribution to
the obtaining of the settlement which ensued, and that was sufficient to
trigger the lien.</a></p><a name="para63">

<p class="ParaHeading"><b><span style="font-style:normal">Conclusion</span></b></p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para63"></a><a name="para64">64.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For those reasons, which differ from those of the Court of Appeal, I
would nonetheless dismiss this appeal, subject to one point of detail.</a></p><a name="para64">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para64"></a><a name="para65">65.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeal proceeded upon the basis that the equitable remedy
could be deployed to provide a means for Edmondson to recover from Haven
precisely those fixed costs, disbursements and success fee provided for under
the RTA Protocol, regardless of the amount agreed to be paid in settlement. By
contrast the remedy exists to provide security for the solicitor’s charges
under his retainer, limited to the amount of the debt created by the settlement
agreement. In the present cases, one effect of the retainer was to limit those
recoveries to the amount recoverable from the defendants or their insurers. To
the extent that the fixed costs regime limits those recoveries below that
recoverable under the tables in the CFAs, that limitation would have to be
taken into account, as it has been by the Court of Appeal’s order.</a></p><a name="para65">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para65"></a><a name="para66">66.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Calculations carried out at the court’s request suggest that the Protocol
based recovery was, in all cases other than Mr Tonkin, slightly greater than
the amounts agreed to be paid in settlement of the respective claims. The Court
of Appeal’s order for payment therefore needs to be reduced to the settlement
amount in each case. The same calculations show that the Protocol-based
recovery was, in the case of Mr Grannell, slightly higher than the
corresponding entitlement under the relevant CFA: (£2,070.50 as against
£2,043.50). But since both amounts exceed the settlement figure of £1,900, no
additional adjustment appears to be necessary. Counsel are asked to agree the
precise form of the order which should now be made, in the light of this
court’s reasoning.</a></p><a name="para66">
