<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1">1.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This appeal is about whether the appellant, Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation (“NNPC”), should have to put up a further USD 100m security (in
addition to USD 80m already provided) in respect of a Nigerian arbitration
award which the respondent, IPCO (Nigeria) Ltd (“IPCO”), has been seeking since
November 2004 to enforce in this jurisdiction. The enforcement proceedings
have, therefore, a long history and it is necessary to set some of it out, to
understand the context.</a></p><a name="para1">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1"></a><a name="para2">2.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The arbitration award has an even longer history. It is dated 28 October
2004 and is for USD152,195,971 plus Naira 5m plus interest at 14% per annum.
The arbitration took place under a contract dated 14 March 1994 whereby IPCO
undertook to design and construct a petroleum export terminal for NNPC. The
contract was subject to Nigerian law and contained an agreement to arbitrate
disputes in accordance with the Nigerian Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1988.</a></p><a name="para2">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2"></a><a name="para3">3.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The award once made was challenged by NNPC before the Nigerian Federal
High Court. Initially, the challenge was for what have been called “non-fraud”
reasons. As from 27 March 2009, NNPC, relying on evidence supplied by a former
IPCO employee, Mr Wogu, has also challenged the whole award on the basis that
IPCO procured it in substantial part by fraudulent inflation of the quantum of
its claim using fraudulently created documentation. Both Field J </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Comm/2014/576.html">[2014] EWHC 576 (Comm)</a> and the Court of Appeal (Christopher Clarke, Burnett and Sales LJJ) <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2015/1144.html">[2015] EWCA Civ 1144</a> concluded that the fraud challenge was made bona fide, that NNPC
has a good prima facie case that IPCO practised a fraud on the tribunal and
that NNPC has a realistic prospect on that basis of proving that the whole
award should be set aside.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para4">4.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is unnecessary to describe the vicissitudes which befell the
challenges before the Nigerian courts. Suffice it to say that they have been
closely examined in the English courts on more than one occasion; and that the
Court of Appeal has concluded (para 164, per Christopher Clarke LJ) that it
would not be “profitable to seek to determine which party (if either) is more
to blame for the delay, which appears, to me in large measure, to result from
the workings of the Nigerian legal system”. At the outset of the English
proceedings, Steel J made an ex parte order for enforcement dated 29 November
2004. This led in turn to an application by NNPC for the ex parte order to be
set aside under sections 103(2)(f) and 103(3) of the Arbitration Act 1996 (the
“1996 Act”), or alternatively for its enforcement to be adjourned under section
103(5), pending the resolution of the non-fraud challenges in the Nigerian
courts. After an inter partes hearing, Gross J held on 27 April 2005 </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Comm/2005/726.html">[2005] EWHC 726 (Comm)</a> that NNPC should pay IPCO a sum of just over USD 13m (which, at
that stage, when only the non-fraud challenge had been raised, appeared
indisputably due), and that NNPC should provide security in the sum of USD 50m
in respect of the adjournment. The USD 13m ordered was duly paid, and the
security was also provided.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para5">5.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At that stage, it was envisaged that the non-fraud challenge in Nigeria
might be resolved with relative despatch. This was not to be, and on 17 July
2007 IPCO applied to have Gross J’s order reconsidered on the basis that the
Nigerian challenge appeared now to be unlikely to be determined for several
years. Tomlinson J in a judgment dated 17 April 2008 concluded that “the change
of circumstances, catastrophic though it is” did not justify a complete
re-opening of the exercise undertaken by Gross J. Nevertheless, he ordered NNPC
to pay a further net sum of around USD 52m (after taking account of USD 7.7m
already paid), plus USD 26m by way of interest. He gave permission to appeal
and ordered a stay pending appeal, conditional upon NNPC providing additional
security to the value of USD 30m. This additional security was also provided.
Tomlinson J adjourned any decision regarding enforcement of the balance of the
award under section 103(5). The Court of Appeal upheld Tomlinson J’s order, but
it was further stayed pending the outcome of a petition to appeal to the House
of Lords.</a></p><a name="para5">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para5"></a><a name="para6">6.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Before this petition was determined (by refusal of leave), NNPC on 2
December 2008 moved to stay Tomlinson J’s order on the ground that it had now
obtained evidence of fraud. Flaux J on 16 December 2008 stayed Tomlinson J’s
order to enable NNPC to make an application under section 103(3) based on this
new evidence and/or under section 103(5) for a further adjournment of
enforcement. He ordered that NNPC maintain the security totalling USD 80m which
had been ordered by Gross J and Tomlinson J. By application dated 18 December
2008 NNPC applied to vary Tomlinson J’s order</a></p><a name="para6">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“so as to provide that recognition
or enforcement of the Award dated 28 October 2004 be refused pursuant to section
103(3) of the Arbitration Act 1996 because it would be contrary to public
policy to do so; alternatively, the decision on whether to enforce the Award be
adjourned pursuant to section 103(5) of the Arbitration Act 1996 with liberty
to apply.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The grounds given for refusal of recognition or
enforcement were that there had been a material change of circumstances and/or
Tomlinson J had been misled into believing that the Award had been properly
obtained and/or public policy. The ground given for the alternative of adjournment
was that the Nigerian courts would or might set aside the Award for fraud,
false evidence or forgery.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para6"></a><a name="para7">7.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On 27 March 2009 NNPC applied to amend its pleadings in the Nigerian
proceedings to raise the fraud challenge (an application adjourned by consent
and never determined). In this light, a consent order dated 17 June 2009 was
made in the English proceedings, whereby inter alia, upon NNPC undertaking to
maintain the USD 80m security until further order of the court, those parts of
Tomlinson J’s order dated 17 April 2008 ordering payment of sums were set aside
(para 1), and “the decision on enforcement of the Award” was “adjourned
pursuant to section 103(5) of the Arbitration Act 1996” (para 2).</a></p><a name="para7">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para7"></a><a name="para8">8.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Delay continued to dog the Nigerian proceedings, and on 24 July 2012
IPCO renewed its application to enforce the Award in England, again on the
ground that there had been a sufficient change of circumstances to justify this.
By order dated 1 April 2014 made after a six day hearing in October 2013 Field
J dismissed this application, but added that, even if it had been appropriate
to reconsider enforcement in England afresh, he would have refused it, on the
ground that NNPC had a good prima facie case of fraud, and that this case
should continue to trial in Nigeria. The security, which NNPC had undertaken by
the consent order to maintain, in these circumstances continued.</a></p><a name="para8">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para8"></a><a name="para9">9.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

material change of circumstances, and decided to cut the Gordian knot caused by
the “sclerotic” process of the proceedings in Nigeria (paras 172-173). By order

</span>The order dated 10 November 2015 did not reflect the Court of Appeal’s
initial conclusions as to the appropriate disposition. They were set out in a
draft, circulated on 4 September 2015 in the usual way, by para 175 of which
the Court proposed to require NNPC to provide security for the whole of the
principal and interest then claimed, around USD 300m. This led to a request by
NNPC to the Court for it, exceptionally, to reconsider the position, on the
ground that the order for security was made without jurisdiction or was
alternatively wrong in principle and/or manifestly wrong. On the former point,
NNPC referred to <i>Soleh Boneh International Ltd v Government of the Republic
of Uganda </i>[1993] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 208 and <i>Dardana Ltd v Yukos Oil Co </i>(“<i>Dardana
v Yukos</i>”) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2002/543.html">[2002] EWCA Civ 543</a>; [2002] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 326. After receiving
submissions from both parties, the Court of Appeal issued two judgments,
neither in precisely the same terms as the original draft. It rejected the
submission of lack of jurisdiction, but acceded to the request that it
reconsider the quantum of security, which it reduced to a requirement for a
further USD 100m.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Decision</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">174.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my judgment the
appropriate course to take is as follows. First, we should order that IPCO’s
application to enforce should be adjourned pending the determination by the
Commercial Court pursuant to section 103(3) of the Act as to whether the Award
should not be enforced in whole or in part because it would be against English
public policy so to do.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">175.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, we should make
that order conditional upon the provision by NNPC of further security in a form
and within a time period to be agreed, or if not agreed, to be determined by
this Court, in the sum of $ 100m.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">176.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, we should order
that, if such security is not provided within a period which we shall specify
from the time when the form of security is agreed or determined, IPCO shall
have permission to enforce the Award.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">177.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, we should order
that, if such security is provided, then, if and to the extent that it is
determined by a final order of the courts of England and Wales that the
enforcement of the Award is not contrary to the public policy of England &amp;
Wales, IPCO may enforce it.</p>

</span>In the Court’s shorter supplementary judgment </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2015/1145.html">[2015] EWCA Civ 1145</a> dealing
more extensively with the issue of jurisdiction, Christopher Clarke LJ said:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Discussion</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the present case it
seems to us that in reality it is NNPC, the Award debtor, which sought the
continuance of the adjournment in the face of IPCO’s attempt to enforce the
Award and bring the adjournment to an end. In its respondent’s notice NNPC said
that, if the judge’s contingent exercise of his discretion was in error, he was
nevertheless correct to conclude that it was appropriate to adjourn under
section 103(5) so that the challenge could proceed in Nigeria inter alia
because, if the court were minded to enforce the Award, it would still have to
decide whether the enforcement of the award was contrary to English public
policy. In other words it was relying on the possibility of a later English
public policy challenge as a reason to uphold the continuance of the
adjournment, ordered by consent on 17 June 2009, pending resolution of the
fraud challenge in Nigeria, rather than suggesting that enforcement should only
abide a section 103(3) determination.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">19.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So far as the ability of
IPCO to enforce any judgment is concerned, much will depend on whether NNPC has
sufficient assets in this country, or any other country in which an English
judgment may be enforced, to ensure that it can swiftly receive the fruits of
any judgment in its favour.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">20.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although NNPC is a large
business we have no details of its assets within such countries, or the form in
which they are held, how long they have been held there, or how readily any
trading arrangements might be changed so as to render enforcement difficult or
impossible. …</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">21.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; … where there is a very
large award, delay without security is inherently likely to prejudice the award
creditor and certainly risks doing so. We regard that as a factor which should
incline us towards providing some security to ensure that if the fraud
challenge fails, IPCO will not be faced with a further round of attempts to
avoid payment of the Award or a situation in which its prospects of recovery
have worsened.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">22.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another material factor
is the need in a case involving such extraordinary delay, extending over a
decade, to provide a strong incentive to securing finality. NNPL <i>[sic] </i>says
that, now that the fraud challenge is to be heard in London, the prospects of
excessive delay are much reduced. Hopefully so. But the history of these
proceedings, and their inordinate delay, persuades us of the need to provide an
incentive, indeed something of a goad, to progress.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">23.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly we bear in mind
that the delay which has already taken place has meant that the ratio between
the amount of security in place and the amount due has greatly decreased.
Interest under the award is running at 14% per annum. Gross J ordered that
security of $ 50m be provided 10½ years ago. $ 50m x 14% x 10 = $ 70m. The same
exercise applied to the $ 30m security provided in 2008 produces about another
$ 31.5m ($ 30m x 14% x 7.5).”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>NNPC now appeals, by permission of this Court, against the Court of
Appeal’s order for security, in essence on the ground that the order was made
without jurisdiction or wrong in principle and/or was illegitimate in
circumstances where NNPC has a good prima facie case of fraud entitling it to
resist enforcement of the whole award.</a></p><a name="para13">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I start with the relationship between the Court of Appeal’s order and
the scheme of section 103 of the Act. The order was that the fraud issue,
raised as an issue of public policy under section 103(3), should, for the
purposes of determining whether enforcement should be ordered, be decided in
the English, rather than Nigerian, proceedings. But the decision of the fraud
issue was made conditional upon the provision by NNPC of a further USD 100m
security, failing which the Court gave leave to enforce without any decision of
the fraud issue. Upon provision of such security, on the other hand, the
Court’s order provided that any further enforcement of the award should be “adjourned”
under section 103(5) pending decision of the fraud issue.</a></p><a name="para22">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para22"></a><a name="para23">23.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The position is therefore that the Court held that an enforcing court’s
decision upon an issue, raised by an award debtor under section 103(3) or, as
must follow, section 103(2) could (and in the instant case should) be made
conditional upon the award debtor’s provision of security in respect of the
award. Further, it regarded the delay which would follow while that decision
was being reached by the enforcing court as involving an “adjournment” within
the meaning of the words “the court … may … adjourn the decision on the
recognition or enforcement of the award” in section 103(5).</a></p><a name="para23">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para23"></a><a name="para24">24.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In both these respects, the Court of Appeal fell in my opinion into
error. First, nothing in section 103(2) or (3) (or in the underlying provisions
of article V of the New York Convention) provides that an enforcing court may
make the decision of an issue raised under either subsection conditional upon
the provision of security in respect of the award. In this respect, there is a
marked contrast with section 103(5), which specifically provides that security
may be ordered where there is an adjournment within its terms.</a></p><a name="para24">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para24"></a><a name="para25">25.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Second, the Court erred in regarding its order that the English court
should as the enforcing court decide the fraud issue as involving “adjournment”
of the decision on that issue within the terms of section 103(5). This error
has two aspects. First, as stated in para 15 above, section 103(5) concerns the
situation where an enforcing court adjourns its decision on enforcement under
section 103(2) or (3), while an application for setting aside or suspension of
the award is pending before the court of the country in, or under the law of
which, the award was made. This was the situation when orders were made by
Gross J on 12 April 2005, by Flaux J on 16 December 2008 and by consent on 17
June 2009. But it ceased to be the situation for the future, once the Court of
Appeal held that the issue whether fraud was an answer to enforcement should no
longer await the outcome of the Nigerian proceedings, but should be decided by
the English courts. Although the literal trigger to the application of section
103(5) is that “an application … has been made to” the courts of the country
where, or under the law of which, the award was made, the adjournment which it
contemplates is <i>pending</i> the outcome of that application. Once it is held
that there should be no such further adjournment, there is no basis for
ordering further security under section 103(5).</a></p><a name="para25">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeal, in ordering that any further enforcement of the
award should be “adjourned” under section 103(5) pending determination of the
section 103(3) proceedings, was, therefore, misusing the word in the context of
section 103(5). Of course, any decision of an issue raised under section 103(2)
or (3) may take a court a little time, even if it is only while reading the
papers, or adjourning overnight or for a number of weeks, in order to consider
and take the decision. But that does not mean that “the decision” was being
adjourned within section 103(5). On the contrary, delays of this nature are all
part of the decision-making process.</a></p><a name="para26">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The second aspect is that section 103(5) contemplates an order for
security being made “on the application of the party claiming recognition or
enforcement of the award”. It is true that in <i>Dardana v Yukos</i>, when<i> </i>giving
the reasons of all members of the court, I said, at para 31:</a></p><a name="para27">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“I am fully prepared to proceed on
the basis that section 103(5) provides the court with jurisdiction to make such
an order, in a case where it, either of its own motion (cf <i>Soleh Boneh</i>)
or at the instance of the party seeking <i>[sic]</i> recognition or
enforcement, decides to adjourn, pending a foreign application to set aside by
the party resisting recognition or enforcement.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Christopher Clarke LJ in his supplementary judgment, para
6, questioned “how section 103(5) was thought to provide jurisdiction to the
court to act of its own motion”. It is unnecessary to consider that question
here, although I shall return to para 6. What is however important to note is
an evident error in the passage cited, which no one appears to have spotted.
The word “seeking” after which I have inserted “<i>sic</i>” should clearly have
read “resisting”, to reflect the actual language of section 103(5). That is
also evident from the actual decision in <i>Dardana v Yukos</i> and its
supporting reasoning.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para27"></a><a name="para28">28.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In <i>Dardana v Yukos</i>, the award debtor (Yukos) was challenging a
Swedish award in Stockholm, but its primary response to an application to
enforce in England was that the English courts should themselves decide whether
the award should be recognised or enforced under section 103(2)(b) and/or (d).
(Only in the alternative, did Yukos apply for an adjournment under section
103(5).) For a considerable time, the award creditor (Dardana) shared the award
debtor’s stance, that the issues should be decided under section 103(2)(b)
and/or (d). But, during the hearing, Dardana appreciated that its case was less
strong than it had thought. It then changed direction, and rather than risk
losing in England, resisted determination of Yukos’s case in England, and
itself in reality sought an adjournment pending the outcome of the Swedish
proceedings (see judgment, para 23). In these circumstances, the Court of
Appeal held in <i>Dardana v Yukos </i>that the English courts had no power
under section 103(5) to order Yukos to provide security on the tacit basis
that, if Yukos did not do this, immediate enforcement would be ordered against
it (paras 26-31). Security pending the outcome of foreign proceedings is, in
effect, the price of an adjournment which an award debtor is seeking, not to be
imposed on an award debtor who is resisting enforcement on properly arguable
grounds.</a></p><a name="para28">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The reasoning in <i>Dardana v Yukos </i>underlines both these aspects. I
have added italics for emphasis:</a></p><a name="para29">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“27.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; … In most cases … it
would be the party resisting recognition or enforcement, who had already begun
proceedings to set aside in the foreign state, who would be seeking an
adjournment of the recognition or enforcement proceedings, pending resolution
of the foreign application. <i>An order for security, on the application of the
party seeking recognition or enforcement, would be the price of the adjournment
sought by the other party, and would protect the party seeking recognition or
enforcement during the adjournment. There is no power under section 103(5) to
order security except in connection with an adjournment.</i> If no foreign
application had been made to set aside, the domestic proceedings under section 103(2)
would have had to be fought out to a conclusion; and there would be no power
under section 103(5) to order security during the period which that took. There
could of course, in an appropriate case be an application for freezing relief …</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">28.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a case where a party
resisting enforcement applies under section 103(2), but later seeks an
adjournment of its application pending resolution of foreign proceedings in
which it is also challenging the award, adjournment may as a matter of general
principle be ordered on condition that security be provided (<i>failing which
the order for adjournment will be vacated and the issues under section 103(2)
will be determined</i>). …</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">29.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reality in the
present case … is that the appellants were obliged to provide the security, on
the tacit basis that, if they did not do so, then enforcement would be ordered
unconditionally against them, despite their outstanding application under
section 103(2). <i>The provision for security was, in other words, made a
condition not of any adjournment sought by the appellants, but of avoiding
immediate and final enforcement; and, failing its provision, the appellants’
outstanding application under section 103(2) would have been liable to be
struck out or dismissed, without determination of its merits. I do not consider
that as a legitimate sanction to attach to any order made for the provision of
security in the present circumstances.</i> It would involve overriding or
fettering an outstanding application under section 103(2), in a way for which
sections 100-104 provide no warrant. It is inconsistent with paragraph 31.9 of
the Arbitration Practice Direction, and the concluding words of Mr Justice
Steel’s order, whereby the award was not to be enforced, if the appellants
applied (as they did) to set aside his order, until the application was finally
disposed of. …”</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:26.0pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Paragraph 31.9 of the Arbitration Practice Direction
has now become CPR 62.18, set out in para 21 above.</span></p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the present case, the Court of Appeal’s order involves the same error
as that identified in the first and third italicised passages. It required
security, not as the price of a further adjournment falling within section
103(5), but as the price of the decision of an issue under section 103(3). The
Court was lifting the adjournments previously ordered pending the outcome of
the Nigerian proceedings, not ordering an adjournment. It had no power under
section 103 to make a decision of the properly arguable case raised by NNPC
under section 103(3) conditional on NNPC providing further security.</a></p><a name="para30">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para30"></a><a name="para31">31.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeal’s reasoning at paras 174-177 of its main judgment
and para 18 of its supplementary judgment demonstrates the same errors that are
evident in its order. Para 18 by focusing on NNPC’s (alternative) submission
that, if Field J’s contingent exercise of his discretion (to refuse
enforcement) was wrong, there should be an adjournment under section 103(5)
case misses the point. What is critical here is not what submissions were
advanced (contingently), but whether there was in the event an adjournment (and,
if there was, whether it was effectively at the award debtor’s instance as well
as pending the outcome of the relevant challenge in the overseas court of the
country in which, or under the law of which, the award was made). Here, no such
adjournment was ordered by the Court of Appeal, which on the contrary decided
that the fraud issue should be resolved in the English proceedings. There was
therefore no adjournment under section 103(5) onto which to hang, as the price,
a requirement of further security.</a></p><a name="para31">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeal’s further reasons at paras 19-23 in its
supplementary judgment do not go to the jurisdiction or power to order security
under section 103, though they might have gone to the exercise of any
discretion, if (contrary to my conclusion) any such discretion had existed
under section 103. The perceived inadequacy by the time of the Court of Appeal’s
order of the security of USD 80m validly ordered as a condition of past
adjournments under section 103(5) was no basis for ordering further security
when further adjournment was being refused.</a></p><a name="para32">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para32"></a><a name="para33">33.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr Michael Black QC suggested that, when the matter came before Field J
and the Court of Appeal, there was no outstanding challenge by NNPC under
section 103(3). If that were so, it is difficult to understand what either
court was doing in considering and deciding, at some length, whether NNPC had
shown a good prima facie case of fraud, and, in the case of the Court of
Appeal, making an order for its decision by the English courts. Further, NNPC
had made a formal challenge by its application dated 18 December 2008; the
decision on that challenge was adjourned, pending the outcome of the Nigerian
proceedings, by the consent order dated 17 June 2009; and the whole purpose and
effect of the Court of Appeal’s decision that there had been a change of
circumstances justifying the reopening of the consent order was to lift the
adjournment and to order that the challenge be decided in the English
proceedings.</a></p><a name="para33">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para33"></a><a name="para34">34.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For these reasons, the Court of Appeal’s order for security was not
within the scope of any jurisdiction or power conferred by section 103 of the
1996 Act. Mr Black has, however, submitted that the order can be and was
justified on grounds not directly considered in <i>Dardana v Yukos</i>, and
touched on, if at all, then only very tangentially by the Court of Appeal. At
the basis of this submission is the proposition that the New York Convention,
and sections 100-104 of the 1996 Act, leave untouched the ordinary procedural
powers of the English courts in respect of proceedings before them. I have no
difficulty accepting the general correctness of that in relation to the conduct
of a challenge to recognition or enforcement being decided under section 103(2)
and/or (3): see further para 45 below. But it provides no basis for making the
raising for decision of a properly arguable challenge under these sections
conditional upon the provision of security for the award.</a></p><a name="para34">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para34"></a><a name="para35">35.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In support of his submission, Mr Black points to article III of the
Convention, providing:</a></p><a name="para35">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Each Contracting State shall
recognize arbitral awards as binding and enforce them in accordance with the
rules of procedure of the territory where the award is relied upon, under the
conditions laid down in the following articles. There shall not be imposed
substantially more onerous conditions or higher fees or charges on the
recognition or enforcement of arbitral awards to which this Convention applies
than are imposed on the recognition or enforcement of domestic arbitral
awards.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Although article III is not itself part of English law,
Mr Black submits that we can and should, on familiar principles, view sections
100-104 of the 1996 Act in its light. I also have little difficulty with that
as a general proposition, although the possible differences between the meaning
of the word “conditions” used twice in article III have given rise to much
discussion. I am prepared for present purposes to proceed on the basis, without
deciding, that the second reference to “conditions” refers in effect to
principles or rules of procedure (as Mr Black submits with the weighty support
of Professor Albert van den Berg’s commentary on <i>The New York Arbitration Convention</i>
<i>of 1958</i> (1981), p 239).</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para35"></a><a name="para36">36.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr Black’s submission is that sections 100-104 only occupy the field of
procedural matters to a limited extent. The second paragraph of article VI
(which led domestically to the second paragraph of section 103(5)) was,
according to the Summary Record of the Seventeenth Meeting of the United
Nations Conference on International Commercial Arbitration held on 3 June 1958,
inserted to address the risk of “abuse” of what became article VI by
proceedings started in the country where, or under whose law, the award was
issued “without a valid reason purely to delay or frustrate the enforcement of
the award”; it may, he submits, have been necessary to regulate this limited
procedural aspect at an international level, because individual states might
not have their own procedural mechanisms to do so; but it did not follow that
states could not attach procedural conditions to challenges made under article
V (ie domestically, under section 103(2) and (3)).</a></p><a name="para36">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para36"></a><a name="para37">37.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The submission continues by pointing to the English courts’ general
power to make conditional orders, including orders on its own motion under CPR
3.1(3)(a) and 3.3. In this connection, Mr Black is able to submit that this is
in fact what the Court of Appeal must, or must also, have had in mind when it
made its order. In para 6 of his supplementary judgment, commenting on the
passage from <i>Dardana v Yukos</i> set out in para 27 above, Christopher
Clarke LJ said this:</a></p><a name="para37">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It is not wholly clear to us how
section 103(5) was thought to provide jurisdiction to the Court to act of its
own motion but, in any event, a court which is asked to adjourn, or continue an
adjournment of, enforcement is entitled to impose conditions on the exercise of
its discretion to do so: CPR 3.1(3)(a); and may do so of its own initiative:
CPR 3.3. Section 103(5) cannot be treated as precluding the exercise of that
right.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para37"></a><a name="para38">38.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Finally, Mr Black argues that the English courts would, contrary to
article III, be discriminating procedurally against foreign awards compared
with awards in arbitrations where the seat is English, if they could not order
security against a party who was merely mounting a challenge under section
103(2) or (3). It is in this connection that he deploys section 70(7) of the 1996
Act. He relies on reasoning of Rix LJ (supported to some extent by that of
Moses LJ, but opposed by that of Buxton LJ) in <i>Gater Assets Ltd v NAK
Naftogaz Ukrainiy </i>(“<i>Gater</i>”) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2007/988.html">[2007] EWCA Civ 988</a>; [2007] 2 Lloyd’s
Rep 588; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2007/988.html">[2008] Bus LR 388</a>. Rix LJ considered that an award debtor resisting
enforcement “by destroying the formal validity of the award, either as a matter
of substantive jurisdiction or serious irregularity or as a matter of public
policy” is in substance in a position of a claimant analogous to that of an
award debtor under an English award seeking to challenge an award under
sections 66 to 69 of the Act, and is liable accordingly to be made subject to
an order for security for costs: see paras 77-80 (see also per Moses LJ para
93, and, to the contrary effect, per Buxton LJ paras 101-104).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para39">39.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On Mr Black’s case, therefore, if English procedural law does not enable
an award creditor under a Nigerian arbitration award to apply and, if the court
thinks fit, to obtain security for the award from an award debtor who is
challenging enforcement under section 103(2) or (3), then it is imposing on the
award creditor “substantially more onerous conditions”, in the sense of
procedural rules, than those applicable to English awards under section 70(7)
of the Act.</a></p><a name="para39">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para39"></a><a name="para40">40.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr Black’s case on these points fails, in my opinion, at a number of
levels. First, the Court of Appeal in <i>Gater </i>was addressing an issue of
security for the future costs of a challenge under section 103(3), which raises
very different considerations to an issue of security for the past award
itself. Even then, although Rix LJ did not make this the ground of decision
because it had not been argued, he noted that the Convention might be regarded
as a “complete code”, precluding the making of a decision under section 103(2)
or (3) conditional upon the provision of security for costs: para 82. More
importantly, in relation to the provision of security for the award itself, he
said this, at para 81:</a></p><a name="para40">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:29.3pt;margin-bottom:26.0pt;
margin-left:72.0pt">“Field J, however, was prepared to refuse enforcement, on
the ground of failure to provide the security for costs ordered. That was the
order that Field J made, setting aside the enforcement order if the security
was not provided, and doing so on a ground not expressly within the Convention.
There is no express basis in the New York Convention for that condition.
Enforcement may be refused ‘only if’ one of the exceptions within article V is
made good. Security is discussed in the Convention, but only security for the
award itself and only in the context of an adjournment of enforcement
proceedings pending an application to set aside or suspend the award to the
competent authority of the country in which, or under the law of which, that
award was made: article VI, reproduced in section 103(5) of the 1996 Act. That
is not just an example of a circumstance in which such security might be
ordered, but is the only circumstance in which it might be: see the decision of
this court in <i>Dardana Ltd v Yukos Oil Co</i> [2002] All ER (Comm) 819, para
27.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para40"></a><a name="para41">41.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In my opinion, the conditions for recognition and enforcement set out in
articles V and VI of the Convention do constitute a code. Just as article V
codifies the grounds of challenge (see Dicey, Morris &amp; Collins on <i>The
Conflict of Laws</i>, 15th ed (2012), para 16-137), so the combination of
articles V and VI must have been intended to establish a common international
approach, within the field which they cover. They contemplate that a challenge
under article V may only be made conditional upon the provision of security in
one situation falling within their scope. Had it been contemplated that the
right to have a decision of a properly arguable challenge, on a ground
mentioned in article V (domestically, section 103(2) and (3)), might be made
conditional upon provision of security in the amount of the award, that could
and would have been said. The Convention reflects a balancing of interests,
with a prima facie right to enforce being countered by rights of challenge.
Apart from the second paragraph of article VI, its provisions were not aimed at
improving award creditors’ prospects of laying hands on assets to satisfy
awards. Courts have, as noted in <i>Dardana v Yukos</i>, other means of
assisting award creditors, which do not impinge on award debtors’ rights of
challenge, eg disclosure and freezing orders.</a></p><a name="para41">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para41"></a><a name="para42">42.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is unnecessary in this context to address the issue which divided the
Court of Appeal in <i>Gater</i>, whether or how far an award debtor challenging
an award should or may be regarded as being in the position of a claimant,
rather than a defendant. Suffice it to say that I would leave open the
correctness of Rix LJ’s view (<i>Gater</i>, paras 77-79) that there is no
material difference at a domestic level between challenges falling within the
scope of section 66 of the Act, read with section 81(1), and challenges falling
within sections 67, 68 or 69. The fact that section 70(6) and (7) only apply to
the latter, and not to challenges under section 66, highlights this point. If
it were appropriate or relevant to have regard to the position regarding an
English award, the true domestic analogy with, at any rate, the present fraud
challenge under section 103(3) would be a challenge under section 66 read with
section 81(1)(c). On that section 70(7) cannot on any view offer any direct
assistance to Mr Black’s submission. In fact, however, the challenges
permissible under section 103(2) and (3) embrace, but do not distinguish
between, matters which could in some cases be raised both under section 66 and
under either section 67 or 68 and in other cases only under one of the latter
two sections. Domestic analogies are in these circumstances unlikely to
illuminate the operation of the internationally-based provisions of sections 100-104.</a></p><a name="para42">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para42"></a><a name="para43">43.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In any event, I do not regard the argument based on article III and
section 70(7) as having any force. First, article III may serve as a caution
against interpreting or applying English procedural provisions in a sense which
discriminates against Convention awards by imposing substantially more onerous
rules of procedure. But this is only so long as “the conditions laid down in”
the following articles of the Convention do not otherwise provide. As I have
indicated, I consider that articles V and VI constitute a code relating to
security for an award when the issue is enforcement or adjournment; and that
the code excludes requiring security for an award in the face of a properly
arguable challenge under article V, except in so far as article VI provides.
Second, even if that were not so, I would have some doubt whether an inability
to order security on a challenge to an overseas award could constitute a
“substantially more onerous” rule of procedure in relation to recognition or
enforcement than a rule allowing such security in the case of an English award.
Third, be that as it may, the fact is that the 1996 Act contains in relation to
Convention awards no equivalent to section 70(7) in relation to English awards.
Whatever article III might require in that respect (if anything), it is not
found in the 1996 Act, and no amount of consistent interpretation can alter the
Act in that respect. Fourth, there is first instance authority, which in my
opinion accurately reflects what would be expected as a matter of principle in
relation to the provision of security for the amount of an award in issue, that
the power under section 70(7) will only be exercised if the challenge appears
“flimsy or otherwise lacks substance”: <i>A v B (Arbitration: Security)</i>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Finally, I turn to CPR 3.1(3). In my opinion, this takes IPCO nowhere.
It is a power, expressed in general terms, to impose conditions on orders. It
cannot authorise the imposition, on a person exercising its right to raise a
properly arguable challenge to recognition or enforcement, of a condition
requiring security for all or any part of the amount of the award in issue. Its
obvious subject matter is the imposition of a condition as the price of relief
sought as a matter of discretion or concession, not the imposition of a fetter
on a person exercising an entirely properly arguable right. The Court of Appeal
was right to underline in <i>Huscroft v P &amp; O Ferries Ltd (Practice Note) </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2010/1483.html">[2010] EWCA Civ 1483</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2010/1483.html">[2011] 1 WLR 939</a>, paras 18-19 that “rule 3.1(3) does not give
the court a general power to impose conditions on one or other party whenever
it happens to be making an order”, and that its purpose is “to enable the court
to grant relief on terms” and that the court should “focus attention on whether
the condition (and any supporting sanction) is a proper price for the party to
pay for the relief being granted”, satisfying itself also that “the condition
it has in mind represents a proportionate and effective means of achieving that
purpose”. CPR 3.1(3) may be relevant where the court only permits the pursuit
on terms of a claim or defence which in some respect is problematic: see <i>Deutsche
Bank AG v Unitech Global Ltd</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2016/119.html">[2016] EWCA Civ 119</a>, paras 72-81 (to which the
appellant’s solicitors very properly drew the Supreme Court’s attention after
the handing down in draft of this judgment). But it is entirely clear that CPR
3.1(3) has no relevance on this appeal.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para45">45.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>That is not to say that CPR 3.1(3) or the court’s other general procedural
powers may never become relevant in the context of an issue being decided under
section 103(2) or (3). I have noted that the court’s power to make disclosure
and freezing orders is one means by which an award may indirectly be secured,
without impinging on a defendant’s right to raise challenges under section 103.
The court may in the course of such a challenge make all sorts of other
procedural orders, and back them where necessary with sanctions. But none of
this has anything to do with this appeal. NNPC here had not misconducted
themselves or given any sort of cause for the exercise of any procedural
discretion to make an order against them or to condition it in any way. Some of
the factors to which the Court of Appeal alluded in paras 19 to 23 of its
supplementary judgment might have had some possible relevance had NNPC in some
way defaulted in the pursuit of a challenge under section 103. As it is, paras
19-21 amount to no more than concern that the award might be difficult to
enforce in practice, while para 23 links this to a perception that the
previously ordered security now appears insufficient. These were not admissible
bases for attaching a condition to the future exercise in this jurisdiction of
a right of challenge under section 103(3). The wish in para 22 to provide a
“goad to progress” was also an inadmissible basis for securing the award,
particularly in the absence of any finding of any relevant prior default by
NNPC from which it needed relief, and is (one might add, if it had had any potential
relevance) difficult to understand as a matter of fact in circumstances where
the fraud issue will from now be case-managed by the Commercial Court.</a></p><a name="para45">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para45"></a><a name="para46">46.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I should not finish without addressing a point made by NNPC in a
footnote - doubtless to avoid too obvious a hostage to fortune on the main
issue - on the last page of its written case. The footnote records that</a></p><a name="para46">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“NNPC also considers that … it
follows that NNPC can allow the guarantees given previously (in a total sum of
US$ 80m) to lapse without affecting its right to have its defence under section
103(3) of the 1996 Act determined prior to IPCO being permitted to enforce the
Award.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">I do not accept that. The security of USD 80m was the
agreed price of adjournments in 2005 and 2008-2009 which have lasted in total
nearly 12 years. NNPC undertook by the consent order dated 17 June 2009 to
maintain the guarantees “until further order of the Court”. That the
adjournment will now lapse is no reason for the Court to permit the existing
security to lapse, still less for any argument that NNPC is entitled to allow
it to lapse. The guarantees should continue in place until further order, pursuant
to NNPC’s undertaking.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para46"></a><a name="para47">47.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For the reasons I have given, the appeal must in my opinion be allowed,
the Court of Appeal’s order attaching conditions (in particular, the
requirement to provide further security of USD 100m) in relation to the
challenges raised by NNPC must be set aside and NNPC’s fraud and non-fraud
challenges must be remitted to the Commercial Court for decision free of any
such further conditions. The parties will have 21 days to make submissions as
to the precise form of order and as to costs.</a></p><a name="para47">
