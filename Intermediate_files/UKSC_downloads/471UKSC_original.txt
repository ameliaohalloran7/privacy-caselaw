<p class="ParaHeading">Introduction</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1">1.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Council Directive 79/7/EEC on the Progressive Implementation of the
Principle of Equal Treatment for Men and Women in Matters of Social Security is
concerned with state benefits, including old age and retirement pensions. It
provides by article 4 that there shall be “no discrimination whatsoever on
ground of sex either directly, or indirectly by reference in particular to
marital or family status ...” The material provisions of the Directive have
direct effect.</a></p><a name="para1">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1"></a><a name="para2">2.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Article 7.1(a) of the Directive provided that it was to be without
prejudice to the right of member states to exclude from its scope the
determination of pensionable age for the purpose of granting old age and
retirement pensions. The United Kingdom has exercised that right. The combined
effect of (i) the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, section
44, (ii) the definition of “pensionable age” in section 122 of the Act, and
(iii) the Pensions Act 1995, Schedule 4, paragraph 1, is that a woman born
before 6 April 1950 becomes eligible for the state retirement pension (referred
to in the legislation as a “Category A retirement pension”) at the age of 60,
and a man born before 6 December 1953 becomes eligible at the age of 65. The
pensionable age of younger persons will converge over a period of time and will
eventually be the same, but these changes do not affect the present appeal.</a></p><a name="para2">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2"></a><a name="para3">3.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At the time which is relevant to this appeal, the acquired gender of a
transsexual person was not recognised for the purpose of determining the
qualifying age for a state pension, if that person was and remained party to a
subsisting marriage. The question at issue on this appeal is whether that state
of affairs was compatible with the Directive.</a></p><a name="para3">

<p class="ParaHeading">The United Kingdom statutory framework</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para3"></a><a name="para4">4.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Until 2005, the law made no provision for gender reassignment in any of
the three jurisdictions of the United Kingdom. A person was for all legal
purposes treated as having the gender determined by the application of
biological criteria at birth without regard to any psychological
characteristics or later surgical intervention. In <i>Goodwin v United Kingdom</i>
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2002/588.html">(2002) 35 EHRR 18</a>, the European Court of Human Rights held that this was
incompatible with article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and
that, so far as it prevented a transsexual from contracting a valid marriage
with a person of the same birth gender, it was also incompatible with article
12.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para5">5.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In consequence, Parliament enacted the Gender Recognition Act 2004,
which received royal assent on 1 July 2004 and came into force on 4 April 2005.
Section 1 of the Act provided that a person could apply to a Gender Recognition
Panel for a full gender recognition certificate recording a change of his or
her birth gender “on the basis of … living in the other gender”. The
applicant’s new gender was referred to as the “acquired gender”.</a></p><a name="para5">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para5"></a><a name="para6">6.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Sections 2 and 3 of the Gender Recognition Act deal with the criteria
for determining whether a change of gender has occurred. Section 2 provides
that the Gender Recognition Panel is required to grant the application if the
applicant has or has had gender dysphoria, has lived in the acquired gender for
at least two years up to the date of the application, intends to live in the
acquired gender until death and satisfies the evidential requirements laid down
by section 3. Section 3 requires the Panel to be furnished with a report from
two medical practitioners or from a medical practitioner and a psychologist. If
the Panel concludes having regard to the evidence required by section 3 that
the criteria in section 2 are satisfied, it must grant the application.</a></p><a name="para6">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para6"></a><a name="para7">7.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>By section 9 of the Act, where a full certificate is issued, the
acquired gender thereafter becomes the person’s gender for all purposes.
Schedule 5, paragraph 7 of the Gender Recognition Act deals specifically with
the effect of a full gender recognition certificate on eligibility for a state
pension. It provides that once the certificate has been issued, any question of
entitlement to a state retirement pension is to be decided as if the person’s
gender has always been the acquired gender. Accordingly, where the person was a
man immediately before the issue of the certificate but had attained the age at
which a woman would have attained pensionable age, she is to be treated as
having attained pensionable age upon the issue of the certificate.</a></p><a name="para7">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para7"></a><a name="para8">8.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At the time that the Gender Recognition Act was passed a valid marriage
could subsist in law only between a man and a woman. This had always been the
law, but had been confirmed by the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, section 11(c).
For this reason, the 2004 Act made special provision for married applicants,
whose change of legally recognised gender would otherwise have resulted in
their being married to a person of the same gender as themselves. This will be
referred to below as the “marriage condition”. By section 4(2) an unmarried
applicant who satisfied the criteria for gender recognition in sections 2 and 3
was entitled to a full gender recognition certificate, whereas by section 4(3)
a married applicant who satisfied the same criteria was entitled only to an
interim gender recognition certificate.</a></p><a name="para8">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para8"></a><a name="para9">9.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Unlike a final gender recognition certificate, an interim gender
recognition certificate did not itself effect any change in the applicant’s
legally recognised gender. It merely entitled a married applicant to apply to
have the marriage annulled by a court. The Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 (as
amended), section 12(g), provided that upon the issue of an interim gender
recognition certificate the applicant’s marriage became voidable. By section 13(2A)
of the same Act, the court was then bound to grant a decree of nullity,
provided that proceedings to that end were instituted within six months from
the date of issue of the interim gender recognition certificate, and subject to
certain other conditions which are irrelevant for present purposes. Only when
this had been done did the applicant become entitled to a full gender
recognition certificate. The court granting the decree of nullity was required
by section 5(1) of the Gender Recognition Act to issue the full certificate.</a></p><a name="para9">

</span>Shortly after the Gender Recognition Act was passed, Parliament passed
the Civil Partnership Act 2004, which received royal assent on 18 November 2004
and came into force on 5 December 2005. The Act provided for the legal recognition
of same-sex partnerships upon registration. A civil partnership was not a
marriage but had substantially the same legal consequences as a marriage. Once
the Civil Partnership Act had come into force, a married person to whom an
interim gender recognition certificate had been issued could, after obtaining
the annulment of the marriage, enter into a civil partnership with his or her
former spouse.</a></p><a name="para10">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>These statutory arrangements were changed by the Marriage (Same Sex
Couples) Act 2013, which came into full force on 10 December 2014. The Act of
2013 provided for same sex couples to enter into a marriage. Schedule 5 amended
section 4 of the Gender Recognition Act 2004 so as to provide that a Gender
Recognition Panel must issue a full gender recognition certificate to a married
applicant if the applicant’s spouse consents. The Act of 2013 does not apply
retrospectively and does not affect the present appeal.</a></p><a name="para11">

</span>MB (the initials have been used in these proceedings to protect her
anonymity) was born on 31 May 1948 and was registered at birth as a man. MB was
married on 21 September 1974. In 1991 she began to live as a woman and in 1995
underwent sex reassignment surgery. MB has not applied for a gender recognition
certificate since the coming into force of the Gender Recognition Act. This is
because she and her wife continued and still continue to live together and wish
to remain married. For religious reasons, they are unwilling to see their
marriage annulled, even if it can be replaced by a civil partnership.</a></p><a name="para13">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para13"></a><a name="para14">14.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On 31 May 2008 MB attained the age of 60. On 28 July 2008, she applied
for a state retirement pension, backdated to 31 May 2008, on the footing that
she was a woman. The application was rejected on 2 September 2008 on the ground
that in the absence of a full gender recognition certificate, she could not be
treated as a woman for the purpose of determining her pensionable age. That
decision was subsequently upheld by the First-tier Tribunal (18 November 2009),
the Upper Tribunal (13 September 2013) and the Court of Appeal (31 July 2014).
Permission to appeal was granted by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom on
11 March 2015.</a></p><a name="para14">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The principal arguments for MB may be summarised as follows:</a></p><a name="para15">

</a><p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para15">(1)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Justice has already recognised that the prohibition in
article 4(1) of the Directive of discrimination on grounds of sex extends to
discrimination between persons of a given birth gender and persons who have
acquired the same gender by later reassignment: <i>P v S and Cornwall County
Council</i> (Case C-13/94) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1996/C1394.html">[1996] ECR I-2143</a>, para 20; <i>Richards v Secretary
of State for Work and Pensions</i> (Case C-423/04) <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2006/C42304.html">[2006] ECR I-3585</a>, paras 24,
29-30.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">(2)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>MB accepts that in principle it is for member states to determine by
their domestic law the conditions on which a person’s change of gender may be
legally recognised: <i>KB v National Health Service Pensions Agency and
Secretary of State for Health</i> (Case C-117/01) <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2004/C11701.html">[2004] ECR I-541</a>, para 35; <i>Richards
v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions</i> (Case C-423/04) <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2006/C42304.html">[2006] ECR I-3585</a>, para 21. But she submits that the power to impose conditions is
confined to conditions relating to the objective physical or psychological
characteristics which determine whether an applicant is a man or a woman: see <i>Richards</i>,
at para 38 (and cf the opinion of Advocate General Jacobs at para 57). It may
not be used to impose conditions relating to such matters as marital status
which have nothing to do with the determination of an applicant’s gender.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">(3)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Since the holder of an interim gender recognition certificate must have
satisfied the physical and psychological criteria for gender recognition, the
imposition of a further condition for obtaining a full certificate which applies
to married applicants only constitutes unlawful discrimination.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">(4)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Even if it were legitimate to impose the marriage condition for the
purpose of protecting the status of marriage as a relationship between a man
and a woman, that could not justify imposing the same condition on eligibility
for a state retirement pension, to which marital status is likewise irrelevant.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">(5)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Although MB’s primary case is that the Gender Recognition Act directly
discriminates against her on grounds of sex, she also contends that it
discriminates indirectly, because the evidence is that the great majority of
persons who have undergone gender reassignment have been reassigned from male
to female. For the above reasons, it cannot be justified.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para16">16.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The principal arguments for the Secretary of State may be summarised as
follows:</a></p><a name="para16">

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">(1)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The decision of the Court of Justice in <i>Richards</i> was concerned
with discrimination arising from the absence at the relevant time of any
provision in English law for recognising gender reassignment. That lacuna has
been filled in the United Kingdom since 2005. The decision is of limited
relevance to the conditions on which gender reassignment may lawfully be
recognised under a comprehensive legislative scheme for recognition.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">(2)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At the time when <i>Richards</i> was decided, the Court of Justice had
already recognised in <i>KB</i> that it was for member states to determine
those conditions, and it reaffirmed that principle in <i>Richards</i> itself:
see para 15(2) above. A corresponding principle is applied under the European
Convention on Human Rights: <i>Goodwin v United Kingdom</i>, para 103.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">(3)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The United Kingdom may properly make the recognition of gender change
dependent on a process of registration or certification, as the Gender
Reassignment Act does. Under the Act, a person born a man is not a woman merely
by virtue of establishing that she has the qualifying social, physical and
psychological characteristics. A full certificate must have been issued.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">(4)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There is no reason why the conditions for the issue of that certificate
should be limited to satisfaction of the social, physical and psychological
criteria of gender. Gender reassignment has significant social implications
which the law may also regulate. The conditions may therefore properly reflect
criteria such as the status of marriage, which are legitimate social
considerations not regulated by EU law. In acknowledging, as para 103 of <i>Goodwin</i>
does, that it was for national law to determine the conditions for recognising
gender reassignment, the European Court of Human Rights acknowledged that they
may include conditions “under which past marriages cease to be valid”. This was
implicitly accepted by the Court of Justice in <i>Richards</i>, when it adopted
the principle thus stated at para 21.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para16">(5)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Since the decision in <i>Goodwin</i>, the European Court of Human Rights
has upheld the marriage condition as being in itself compatible with the Human
Rights Convention (<i>Parry v United Kingdom</i> (Application No 42971/05) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/ECHR/2006/1157.html">[2006] ECHR 1157</a>) as
well as a similar condition in corresponding legislation in Finland (<i>Hamalainen
v Finland</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/2014/787.html"></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2014/787.html">37 BHRC 55</a>). The reason was that, although the Convention
requires states to recognise the acquired gender of transsexual persons, it
does not require them to allow marriages between same sex couples. In the
absence of such a requirement, a state which does not recognise same-sex
marriages has a legitimate interest in maintaining the traditional concept of
marriage between a man and a woman. That interest justified the imposition of
the marriage condition in the Finnish legislation. The proviso could not be
regarded as disproportionate given that a civil partnership was available to
same sex couples as an alternative to marriage.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">(6)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>No question of indirect discrimination arises. Even on the footing that
most gender reassignments are male to female, there is no reason to regard it as
any more difficult for a male to female transsexual to qualify for a full
gender recognition certificate than it is for a female to male transsexual.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">The Supreme Court’s conclusion</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para17">17.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Supreme Court is divided on the question, and in the absence of
Court of Justice authority directly in point considers that it cannot finally
resolve the appeal without a reference to the Court of Justice.</a></p><a name="para17">

<p class="ParaHeading">The question</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The question referred is whether Council Directive 79/7 EEC precludes
the imposition in national law of a requirement that, in addition to satisfying
the physical, social and psychological criteria for recognising a change of
gender, a person who has changed gender must also be unmarried in order to
qualify for a state retirement pension.</a></p><a name="para18">
