against a person fall potentially within the scope of article 8 of the European
Convention on Human Rights in circumstances where a) the prosecutor has
reasonable cause to believe the person to be guilty of the offence with which
they are charged and b) the law relating to the offence is compatible with
article 8? That is the primary question raised by this appeal and it is one of
general importance.</a></p><a name="para1">

</span>If that question is answered in the affirmative, the question arises
whether in the present case the decision by the respondent (“the CPS”) to
charge the appellant with the offence of possessing a false document under
section 25(1) of the Identity Cards Act 2006 was a violation of her article 8
rights.</a></p><a name="para2">

</span>Different states who are parties to the Convention have different
institutions and processes for the investigation and prosecution of offences.
The CPS was established by the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985, section 1. Its
essential functions are to advise the police and others, including immigration
officers, on the institution of criminal proceedings and to take over the
conduct of such proceedings: section 3(2)(a)(aa)(e) and (ec). The head of the
CPS is the Director of Public Prosecutions (“DPP”). Under section 10 the DPP is
required to issue a Code for Crown Prosecutors. The code requires prosecutors to
apply a two-stage test in deciding whether a person should be prosecuted for an
offence. The first stage involves considering whether there is enough evidence
to provide a realistic prospect of conviction. If that requirement is
satisfied, the second stage involves deciding whether a prosecution would be in
the public interest, which may entail weighing a wide variety of considerations.</a></p><a name="para3">

be the police or immigration or other authority, and also independent of the
court before which any prosecution may be brought.</a></p><a name="para4">

</span>Under section 25(1) of the Identity Cards Act 2006 (now substantially
re-enacted by section 4 of the Identity Documents Act 2010), it was an offence
punishable with up to ten years’ imprisonment for a person to be in possession
of an identity card relating to somebody else, with the intention of using it
to establish his identity as that person’s identity. But it has long been

</span>The appellant was born on an island in Somalia on 26 December 1991. She
is a member of a minority clan. She and her family suffered severe violence
from majority clans over many years. The violence included the murder of her
father in 1995 and, two years later, the rape of the appellant herself in front
of her disabled mother. After that attack she and her mother moved to the
mainland, but in 2008 another militant gang murdered her mother and beat the
appellant senseless with a rifle.</a></p><a name="para8">

</span>In December 2008 the appellant fled from Somalia with a friend and she
spent the next year living in Yemen. On 25 December 2009 the appellant left
Yemen with an agent and flew to an unknown destination in Europe, from where
she travelled to Eindhoven in Holland. On 27 December she flew from Eindhoven
to the UK on a false passport provided to her by an agent.</a></p><a name="para9">

</span>On arrival at Stansted Airport on the evening of 27 December the
appellant attempted to pass through immigration control using a British
passport. She was stopped and challenged by immigration officers from the
United Kingdom Border Agency (UKBA), part of the Home Office. She immediately
claimed asylum and gave her true name and date of birth. She was detained
overnight.</a></p><a name="para10">

</span>On 28 December the appellant had an initial asylum screening interview
in which she described how she had left Somalia and come to the UK. She
explained her reasons in summary and said that she was in fear of her life if
she were to return home. Later that day the appellant was told by an
immigration officer, IO Webb, that she could return to Holland and, if so, she
would not be prosecuted. The appellant declined to return to Holland and
maintained her claim for asylum. Thereafter she was arrested on suspicion of
committing an offence under section 25(1) of the 2006 Act.</a></p><a name="para11">

Station by IO Webb. The appellant was represented at that stage by a duty
solicitor. Her account of her movements and her personal circumstances was
consistent with her earlier account. When asked why she had not claimed asylum
in Holland, she said that she knew nothing about Holland and had been advised
to travel to the UK to claim asylum.</a></p><a name="para12">

</span>On 28 January another CPS lawyer, Ms Charlotte Davison, conducted a full
review of the case. She raised a question about what consideration UKBA had
given to the availability of a defence under section 31. On 22 February a Plea
and Case Management Hearing took place at the Crown Court. The appellant’s
counsel served the CPS with a skeleton argument that the proceedings should be
dismissed because her case fell within the scope of the section 31 defence. It
appears from the Crown Court minute sheet that the prosecution had not received
the skeleton argument in advance and it was agreed that the application should
be adjourned.</a></p><a name="para16">

</span>On 26 May the appellant’s full asylum interview took place. Six days
later, on 1 June, the appellant appeared before Chelmsford Crown Court. The CPS
was on this occasion represented by a CPS advocate, Ms Lesli Sternberg. At the
hearing IO Webb told Ms Sternberg that a decision on the appellant’s asylum application
was expected shortly and that it was likely to be granted. In those
circumstances the appellant’s application to dismiss the proceedings was
adjourned until 14 June.</a></p><a name="para18">

appeared that the procedure for bringing it into effect was poor. Ms

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On 1 February 2013 Irwin J dismissed the claim. On the facts, he
accepted that the appellant was very vulnerable and already suffering anxiety
and depression before the decision to prosecute her and her incarceration, and
that her arrest and remand in custody had added to the psychological impact. He
accepted too that if the CPS had learned more from UKBA at an early stage about
conditions in Somalia and the Yemen, it would probably not have begun a
prosecution before the outcome of her asylum application. However, he held that
the decision to prosecute was not capable of engaging article 8. He said that
in presenting false papers to an immigration officer the appellant was not
engaged in an activity which was part of her private life, but was
self-evidently a matter affecting the business of the state. He accepted that
the consequences of the decision to prosecute could affect her enjoyment of a
private life, but he rejected the consequentialist argument as a basis for
applying article 8 to the decision to prosecute. Otherwise, he said, article 8
would apply to every decision to prosecute for any offence, at least where
there was a possibility of a custodial sentence or a remand in custody. He held
that a decision to prosecute could only engage article 8 if the prosecution
targeted an activity which could credibly claim to be an exercise of an article
8 right. If, however, article 8 was engaged, Irwin J concluded that the CPS’s
decision was justified on the material which it had.</a></p><a name="para22">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para22"></a><a name="para23">23.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Irwin J’s dismissal of the appellant’s claim was upheld by the Court of
Appeal on 6 February 2014 in a decision which is reported at </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2014/90.html">[2014] 1 WLR 3238</a>.
The leading judgment was given by Pitchford LJ, with whom the other members of
the court agreed. After reviewing the authorities he accepted that article 8
could apply to a law criminalising behaviour which itself amounted to the
exercise of a right protected by article 8, but he held that section 25 of the
2006 Act did not interfere with rights protected by that article. It did not
impede the appellant’s ability to claim asylum, and the possession of false
identity documentation with intent to deceive at the point of border control
was not an expression of personal autonomy. Pitchford LJ also accepted that a
decision to prosecute for an offence under section 25 might fall within article
8 if, for example, the prosecutor knew that there was no proper basis for the
prosecution. But he held that article 8 was not engaged by a decision to
prosecute for a Convention-compliant offence in the absence of extreme
circumstances. If, however, article 8 was engaged, the concession made that the
appellant’s case passed the evidential test meant that in the absence of
compelling circumstances personal to the appellant the public interest in
prosecution was obvious. The outcome would be a matter for judicial decision
and it was not for the prosecutor, when deciding to prosecute, to concern
herself with questions of remand or likely sentence, which would be for the
court to determine. He concluded therefore that if article 8 was engaged, there
was no breach.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">Did article 8 apply to the decision to prosecute?</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para24">24.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr Richard Hermer QC argued that article 8 applied to the decision to
prosecute for two reasons: it “targeted” conduct which was itself protected by
article 8, and its consequences were to interfere with the enjoyment of the
appellant’s private life.</a></p><a name="para24">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para24"></a><a name="para25">25.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr Hermer submitted that the range of article 8 is broad, that the
threshold for it to apply is low, and that it is almost inevitable that the
decisions of the CPS, as a public body, will impact on the private life of the
defendant and so engage article 8. He said that anything done by a public body
which has the consequence of affecting someone’s private life in a more than
minimal way involves interference with respect for it within the meaning of
article 8.</a></p><a name="para25">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para25"></a><a name="para26">26.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Broad as article 8 undoubtedly is, the consequentialist argument
advanced by Mr Hermer is far too broad. To take an example far removed from the
present case, if a highway authority closes a road for roadworks, or introduces
a partial closure, there may be a more than minimal effect on how long it takes
residents to get to work, but that cannot be enough to make article 8
applicable. Such matters are part of the ordinary incidents of daily life in a
community and involve no lack of respect for personal autonomy of the kind
which article 8 is designed to protect.</a></p><a name="para26">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Questions about the possible application of article 8 to a prosecutorial
decision were considered by the House of Lords and the European Court of Human
Rights in the case reported as <i>R v G </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/37.html">[2009] 1 AC 92</a> and <i>G v United
Kingdom</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2011/1308.html">(2011) 53 EHRR SE25</a>. The appellant aged 15, had sexual
intercourse with a girl aged 12. He pleaded guilty to a charge of rape of a
child under 13, contrary to section 5 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003, on the
written basis that the intercourse was consensual in fact (although by reason
of her age the girl was incapable of giving legal consent) and that he believed
her to be aged 15 because she had told him so. The prosecution accepted his
basis of plea and he received a custodial sentence. He appealed to the Court of
Appeal against conviction and sentence. It was argued that his conduct amounted
to a less serious offence under section 13, aimed specifically at a person
under 18 who had sexual intercourse with a child under 13, and that on the
accepted facts it was a disproportionate interference with his private life,
contrary to article 8, to proceed on the more serious charge, which had the
consequence of giving him a criminal record as a rapist. The Court of Appeal
dismissed his appeal against conviction but substituted a non-custodial sentence.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para28">28.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The House of Lords upheld the Court of Appeal’s decision by a three to
two majority. Lord Hoffmann said that article 8 confers a qualified right
protecting a person’s private or family life, but if the state is justified in
treating the person’s conduct as unlawful that is the end of the matter. Lady
Hale also considered that article 8 did not apply, because a rule which
prevented a child under 13 from giving legally recognised consent to sexual
activity and a statute which treated penile penetration as a most serious form
of such activity did not amount to a lack of respect for the private life of
the penetrating male. If, however, article 8 applied, Lady Hale considered that
the interference was justified and proportionate in the pursuit of the legitimate
aims of the protection of health and morals and of the rights and freedoms of
others. Lord Hope and Lord Carswell disagreed. They considered that
prosecutorial choices must be exercised compatibly with the Convention, and
that the decision to proceed against G under section 5, rather than section 13,
was disproportionate. Lord Mance did not expressly state whether article 8
applied but he agreed with Lord Hoffmann and Lady Hale that it was not
breached.</a></p><a name="para28">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para28"></a><a name="para29">29.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>G took his case to Strasbourg, but the court held that his complaint was
inadmissible. On the question whether article 8 applied, the court said that
not every sexual activity behind closed doors would necessarily fall within its
scope, but, in the circumstances that both parties in fact consented and that G
reasonably believed the girl to be the same age as himself, it was “prepared to
accept” that the sexual activities at issue fell within the meaning of private
life. However, it held that the state’s margin of appreciation regarding the
means of protecting children from sexual exploitation was wide and that the
complaint must be rejected as manifestly ill founded.</a></p><a name="para29">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para29"></a><a name="para30">30.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The focus of the reasoning of the Strasbourg court is significant. It
focused on the nature of G’s conduct. The court was prepared to accept that
uncoerced sexual behaviour of a 15-year old boy with a girl whom he believed to
be the same age could fairly be seen as falling within the meaning of private
life. Perhaps because it was an admissibility decision and the court was
satisfied that the complaint of a breach of article 8 was manifestly ill
founded, it did not directly address Lord Hoffmann’s and Lady Hale’s reasons
for holding that the article did not apply.</a></p><a name="para30">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para30"></a><a name="para31">31.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There is no support in the Strasbourg authorities for the argument that
even if the conduct for which a person is prosecuted was not within the range
of article 8, the article may apply to a decision to prosecute because of the
attendant consequences.</a></p><a name="para31">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para31"></a><a name="para32">32.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>By commencing a criminal prosecution the CPS places the matter before a
court. In other Convention countries the court is itself in charge of deciding
whether a person should be treated as an accused in a criminal case. There is a
striking absence of any reported case in which it has been held that the
institution of criminal proceedings for a matter which is properly the subject
of the criminal law may be open to challenge on article 8 grounds (as Munby LJ
observed in <i>R (E) v Director of Public Prosecutions</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2011/1465.html">[2012] 1 Cr App R 6</a>,
paras 72-75). It would be illogical; for if the matter is properly the subject
of the criminal law, it is a matter for the processes of the criminal law. The
criminalisation of conduct may amount to interference with article 8 rights;
and that will depend on the nature of the conduct. If the criminalisation does
not amount to an unjustifiable interference with respect for an activity
protected by article 8, no more does a decision to prosecute for that conduct.
The consequences will be matters for the determination of the court. Article 6
protects the defendant’s right to a fair hearing within a reasonable time by an
independent and impartial tribunal.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para33">33.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Turning to the argument that the prosecution targeted conduct which was
protected by article 8, Mr Hermer submitted that the courts below wrongly
concentrated too much on the moment when the appellant tried to pass through
immigration control on a false passport and should have looked at her conduct
in the wider context of a vulnerable young person who had suffered grievously
and was trying to escape by the only means available to her. He submitted that
proper investigation should have led the CPS to realise at an early stage that
she had a defence under section 31 and in any event that a prosecution was not
in the public interest.</a></p><a name="para33">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para33"></a><a name="para34">34.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The decision which is challenged is the initial decision to prosecute.
(The issues listed in the agreed statement of facts and issues all focus on
that decision, although in the course of his oral argument Mr Hermer sought to
extend the challenge to include the conduct of the CPS throughout the period
from the decision to prosecute up to the decision to offer no evidence. I refer
to this in the postscript below.) The difficulty for the appellant in advancing
the claim that the decision to prosecute her was a violation of her human
rights is that it is accepted that the offence under section 25 is compliant
with her Convention rights, and it was conceded in the courts below that the
CPS was reasonably entitled to conclude at the time of the decision to
prosecute that the evidential test was satisfied. It is difficult to envisage
circumstances in which the initiation of a prosecution against a person
reasonably suspected of committing a criminal offence could itself be a breach
of that person’s human rights. It is true that the CPS is not bound to prosecute
in every case, depending on its view of the public interest, but I do not see
that the fact that in this jurisdiction a prosecution is not obligatory makes a
difference. Whether it is in the public interest to prosecute is not the same
as whether a prosecution would unjustifiably interfere with a right protected
by article 8.</a></p><a name="para34">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>However, if article 8 was applicable, I agree also that there was no
breach. Things could have been done better and it is regrettable that the
claimant, a vulnerable young woman, spent the time that she did in custody.
Criticism can be made of the CPS for the length of time it took to investigate
the position regarding the Yemen and to conclude that the appellant was likely
to succeed in the section 31 defence, but that is far from there being a breach
of article 8 in the decision to prosecute. Indeed, even if the original
decision to prosecute was an error of judgment by the CPS, it would not in my
view have involved a breach of article 8. It would be a different thing if the state
deliberately trumped up false charges against someone as a form of harassment.
In terms of domestic law, that would involve the torts of malicious prosecution
or misfeasance in public office or both, to which article 8 would add nothing;
but no duty of care is owed by the police towards a suspect (<i>Calveley v
Chief Constable of the Merseyside Police</i> [1989] AC 1228), and the same
applies to the CPS.</a></p><a name="para36">

Michael v Chief Constable of South Wales Police <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/2.html">[2015] AC 1732</a>) two claimants
were arrested, charged and remanded in custody for some weeks before the CPS
discontinued proceedings against them. In the first case the claimant contended
that the CPS was negligent in failing to act with due diligence in obtaining
the results of forensic evidence which showed him to be innocent. In the second
case the claimant contended that it should not have taken the CPS three months
to conclude that the prosecution was bound to fail. In both cases the Court of
Appeal upheld decisions striking out the statements of claim against the CPS.
Steyn LJ in the leading judgment said that a citizen who is aggrieved by a
prosecutor’s decision has potentially extensive remedies for a deliberate abuse
of power, but the court rejected the argument that the CPS should owe a duty of
care towards those it decided to prosecute.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para38">38.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The duty of the CPS is to the public, not to the victim or to the
suspect, who have separate interests. To recognise a duty of care towards
victims or suspects or both, would put the CPS in positions of potential
conflict, and would also open the door to collateral interlocutory civil
proceedings and trials, which would not be conducive to the best operation of
the criminal justice system. Similar considerations are relevant when
considering the applicability of article 8 in the context of a decision to
prosecute. A decision to prosecute does not of itself involve a lack of respect
for the autonomy of the defendant but places the question of determining his or
her guilt before the court, which will itself be responsible for deciding
ancillary questions of bail or remand in custody and the like.</a></p><a name="para38">

</span>As mentioned above, Mr Hermer sought during the course of his oral
argument to advance an additional argument that the prosecution of the
appellant was a breach of her article 8 rights in its continuation, if not in
its commencement. This was not how the case had been presented in the lower
courts or in the appellant’s written case or in the statement of facts and
issues. In those circumstances Mr Havers QC properly objected to this court
being asked to conduct its own factual examination of the CPS’s alleged
shortcomings during the course of the prosecution. If this had been a live
issue, it would have been necessary to consider whether (and, if so, in what
circumstances) article 8 may become applicable to the CPS in the continuation
of a prosecution, if it was not applicable at the time of its commencement. The
court did not hear argument on that question, about which it would therefore
not be appropriate to express a concluded view. It may be that a defendant’s
right to a prompt and fair disposal of criminal proceedings, which have been
properly commenced, lies in the particular provision of article 6 rather than
in the general language of article 8, but without the benefit of considered
argument it is better to say no more.</a></p><a name="para39">

</span>At para 75 of the Court of Appeal’s judgment </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2014/90.html">[2014] 1 WLR 3238</a> Pitchford LJ said:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“I do not accept that before a
prosecutor decides to prosecute she must anticipate and assess all possible
consequences to the defendant of prosecution. Among the hierarchy of Convention
rights article 5 … applies to regulate the defendant’s right not to be detained
arbitrarily. The state has, in performance of its responsibilities under
article 5, instituted a system of criminal justice by which a judicial decision
is made whether it is necessary to detain the defendant pending trial and, in
the event of conviction, whether the defendant should be sentenced to a term of
custody. These are matters all within the wide margin of appreciation afforded
to member states. <i>It is in my judgment, not for the prosecutor, when making
the decision whether to prosecute, save in exceptional circumstances which did
not exist here, to concern herself either with the risk of detention pending
trial or with the probable sentence on conviction</i> (save perhaps as to the
latter for the purpose of assessing the seriousness of the conduct alleged). <i>The
prosecutor would in that event be taking on herself the judgment it is for the
judicial authority to make. She is entitled to have in mind the obligation of
the court itself to act in compliance with the law and the Convention.</i> To
give practical examples: should the judge conclude that the prosecution is
unfair he or she has power to stay the indictment as an abuse of processor to
grant bail; should it emerge that the prosecution is oppressive because the
defendant is physically or mentally unwell, the judge has power to adjourn the
proceedings and/or to grant bail.” (emphasis supplied)</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>These observations must be viewed in light of a later judgment of the
Court of Appeal in <i>Zenati v Metropolitan Police Comr </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2015/80.html">[2015] EWCA Civ 80</a>;
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2015/80.html">[2015] QB 758</a>. In that case a police officer, suspecting that the claimant's
passport might be counterfeit, charged him with offences under the Identity
Cards Act 2006. The claimant was remanded in custody on 10 December 2010. On
the same day, the Crown Prosecution Service asked the officer in the case to
arrange a more comprehensive examination of the passport to be carried out by
the National Document Fraud Unit by 24 December. The request was not forwarded
to the officer until 31 December. On 19 January the officer was informed that
the passport was genuine. At a plea and management hearing on 4 February, the
CPS informed the judge that they needed to obtain a statement from immigration
authorities to confirm that the passport was a forgery. The judge allowed 14
days for this to be done. As a consequence, the claimant was detained for more
than three weeks after the CPS should have been informed that the passport was
genuine. The Court of Appeal found that this was capable of amounting to a breach
of article 5(1)(c) and article 5(3). At para 44 Lord Dyson MR said:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… if the investigating
authorities fail to bring to the attention of the court material information of
which the court should be made aware when reviewing a detention, this may have
the effect of causing a decision by the court to refuse bail to be in breach of
article 5(3). The investigating authorities must not prevent the court from
discharging its duty of reviewing the lawfulness of the detention fairly and
with a proper appreciation of all the relevant facts of which the authorities
should make the court aware. Unless this is done, there is a risk that the
court will make decisions which lead to arbitrary detention in breach of
article 5(3).”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para43">43.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The propriety of continuing a prosecution must be kept under review by
prosecuting authorities, not least for the reason which the Master of the Rolls
articulated. In this case, the possibility of a defence under section 31 of the
1999 Act was in play (or should have been) from the earliest stages. The view
taken by Ms Davison that the period which the appellant had spent in Yemen
precluded such a defence was misconceived for the reasons given by Lord
Toulson. Although it did not feature in the case, there is, therefore, a real
issue as to whether the appellant’s detention beyond the time that it should
have been recognised that she had an unanswerable defence under section 31,
constituted a violation of her article 5 rights.</a></p><a name="para43">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If a decision to prosecute resulting in detention is capable of amounting
to a breach of article 5, it is capable of interfering with article 8. In <i>Norris
v Government of the United States of America</i><i> (No 2) </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2010/9.html">[2010] 2 AC 487</a> Lord Phillips said this at para 52:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… It is instructive to consider
the approach of the Convention to dealing with criminals or suspected criminals
in the domestic context. Article 5 includes in the exceptions to the right to
liberty (i) the arrest of a suspect, (ii) his detention, where necessary,
pending trial, and (iii) his detention while serving his sentence if convicted.
Such detention will necessarily interfere drastically with family and private
life. In theory a question of proportionality could arise under article 8(2).
In practice it is only in the most exceptional circumstances that a defendant
would consider even asserting his article 8 rights by way of challenge to
remand in custody or imprisonment: see <i>R (P) v Secretary of State of the
Home Department</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2001/1151.html">[2001] 1 WLR 2002</a>, para 79, for discussion of such
circumstances. Normally it is treated as axiomatic that the interference with
article 8 rights consequent upon detention is proportionate.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para45">45.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This passage is important in the present context for its implicit
acceptance that detention for the purpose of prosecuting a criminal offence is
at least capable of engaging article 8. That is not an extravagant proposition.
If prosecuting authorities are aware - or ought to have become aware - that the
basis for a proposed prosecution no longer obtains, or that there is a defence
available to the defendant which will provide a complete answer to the crime
charged, and if they fail to act on that information in order to secure the
defendant’s release, that is an obvious instance of a failure to have respect
for the defendant’s right to a private life. The responsibility of the
prosecuting authorities cannot be shirked because the court has a duty to
inquire into the basis on which someone continues to be held in custody pending
trial. That is a relevant circumstance but it does not relieve the prosecution
of its duty to act on a change in circumstances which makes detention no longer
justified. This is particularly so where the court, as in this case, was
dependent on information which it was the prosecution’s obligation to supply
which bore on the question of whether the appellant should continue to be
detained.</a></p><a name="para45">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para45"></a><a name="para46">46.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A decision to prosecute someone against whom there is evidence that they
have committed a criminal offence does not automatically constitute a failure
to have respect for that person’s private life. Respect may be forfeit by
engaging in criminal activity which justifies prosecution, although measures
taken to identify an individual suspected of criminal activity may not involve
forfeiture of the right - see <i>JR38’s application </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/42.html">[2015] UKSC 42</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/42.html">[2016] AC 1131</a>. In that case there was disagreement between the members of the court
as to whether steps taken to identify a minor by publishing photographs of him
engaging in criminal behaviour engaged article 8. That debate is not relevant
in the present case for it has been accepted that there was an evidential basis
for prosecuting the appellant at the time that the prosecution was initiated.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para47">47.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On that basis I agree that this appeal must be dismissed. As Lord
Toulson has pointed out, the focus of the appellant’s case has always been that
the decision to prosecute constituted the breach of article 8. It was simply
not possible to allow a late entry into the field of argument that continuing
to prosecute involved such a violation. The respondents had not produced evidence
germane to that case and it would not have been fair (even if it had been
feasible) to require them to do so.</a></p><a name="para47">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para47"></a><a name="para48">48.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I reach the decision that the appellant must fail in her appeal with
regret. This woman, in her short life, has had to endure experiences of the
most horrific nature. They have been described in Lord Toulson’s judgment. It
is not in the least surprising that she had resort to the subterfuge of false
papers in order to secure the measure of safety which she believed that this
country would afford her. It is sad that her terrible circumstances were
compounded by her incarceration at a time when she was vulnerable and
defenceless.</a></p><a name="para48">
