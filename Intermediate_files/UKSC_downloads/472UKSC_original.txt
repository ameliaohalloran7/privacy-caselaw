</span>“No court will lend its aid to a man who founds his cause of action upon
an immoral or an illegal act.” So spoke Lord Mansfield in <i>Holman v Johnson</i>
</a><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1775/58.pdf"></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1775/58.html">(1775) 1 Cowp 341</a>, 343, ushering in two centuries and more of case law about
the extent and effect of this maxim. He stated that the reason was one of
public policy:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“If, from the plaintiff’s own
stating or otherwise, the cause of action appears to arise ex turpi causa, or
the transgression of a positive law of this country, there the court says he
has no right to be assisted. It is upon that ground the court goes; not for the
sake of the defendant, but because they will not lend their aid to such a
plaintiff. So if the plaintiff and defendant were to change sides, and the
defendant was to bring his action against the plaintiff, the latter would then
have the advantage of it; for where both are equally in fault, potior est
conditio defendentis.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2">2.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Illegality has the potential to provide a defence to civil claims of all
sorts, whether relating to contract, property, tort or unjust enrichment, and
in a wide variety of circumstances.</a></p><a name="para2">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2"></a><a name="para3">3.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Take the law of contract. A contract may be prohibited by a statute; or
it may be entered into for an illegal or immoral purpose, which may be that of
one or both parties; or performance according to its terms may involve the
commission of an offence; or it may be intended by one or both parties to be
performed in a way which will involve the commission of an offence; or an
unlawful act may be committed in the course of its performance. The application
of the doctrine of illegality to each of these different situations has caused
a good deal of uncertainty, complexity and sometimes inconsistency.</a></p><a name="para3">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para3"></a><a name="para4">4.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><i>Holman v Johnson</i> involved a claim for the price of goods which
the plaintiff sold to the defendant in Dunkirk, knowing that the defendant’s
purpose was to smuggle the goods into England. The plaintiff was met with a
defence of illegality. The defence failed. Lord Mansfield held that knowledge
on the part of the plaintiff that the defendant intended to smuggle the goods
did not affect the plaintiff’s entitlement to recover the price of the goods,
since he was not himself involved in the smuggling. By contrast, in <i>Pearce v
Brooks</i> (1866) LR 1 Ex 213 a claim by a coachbuilder against a prostitute
for the hire of what was described in the law report as an “ornamental
brougham” was held to be unenforceable for illegality after the jury found that
the defendant hired it for the purpose of prostitution and that the plaintiff
knew that this was her purpose. It would seem that the difference between <i>Holman
v Johnson</i> and <i>Pearce v Brooks</i> had to do with the type of goods
supplied, because in both cases the plaintiff knew that the defendant was
entering into the contract for an illegal or immoral purpose. In <i>JM Allan (Merchandising)
Ltd v Cloke</i> [1963] 2 QB 340, 348, Lord Denning MR endeavoured to
rationalise the authorities by saying that “active participation debars, but
knowledge by itself does not”. However, the Law Commission commented in its
discussion of the subject in its Consultation Paper on <i>Illegal Transactions:
the Effect of Illegality on Contracts and Trusts</i>, LCCP 154 (1999) that the

</span>It is unclear to what extent the doctrine of illegality applies to a
contract whose object includes something which is in some respect unlawful, or
the performance of which will involve some form of illegality, but not in a way
which is central to the contract. In <i>St John Shipping Corpn v Joseph Rank
Ltd</i> [1957] 1 QB 267, 288, Devlin J said:</a></p><a name="para5">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“If a contract has as its whole
object the doing of the very act which the statute prohibits, it can be argued
that you can hardly make sense of a statute which forbids an act and yet
permits to be made a contract to do it; that is a clear implication. But unless
you get a clear implication of that sort, I think that a court ought to be very
slow to hold that a statute intends to interfere with the rights and remedies
given by the ordinary law of contract. Caution in this respect is, I think,
especially necessary in these times when so much of commercial life is governed
by regulations of one sort or another, which may easily be broken without
wicked intent.”</p>

</span>As to illegality in the manner of performance of a contract, Mance LJ
observed in <i>Hall v Woolston Hall Leisure Ltd</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2000/170.html">[2001] 1 WLR 225</a>, 246, that
the conceptual basis on which a contract not illegal nor prohibited at the time
of its formation may become unenforceable due to the manner of its performance
is open to debate. In <i>Anderson Ltd v Daniel</i> [1924] 1 KB 138 a claim for
the price of goods was held to be unenforceable because the seller had failed
to give the buyer an invoice containing details which the seller was required
to give him by statute. In the <i>St John Shipping</i> case Devlin J rejected
the interpretation that the claim in <i>Anderson Ltd v Daniel</i> failed
because in the course of performing a legal contract the plaintiff had done
something illegal. The correct interpretation, he said, was that “the way in
which the contract was performed turned it into the sort of contract that was
prohibited by the statute”: [1957] 1 QB 267, 284. In the <i>St John Shipping</i>
case the claim was for freight under a charter party. In the course of taking
on bunkers the vessel was overloaded and the master thereby committed an offence,
for which he was prosecuted and fined £1,200. The extra freight earned by the
overloading was £2,295 and to that extent the ship owners stood to profit from
their wrong. The cargo owners refused to pay that part of the freight. Devlin J
rejected their defence. He held that since the goods had been delivered safely,
the ship owners had proved all that they needed. He was not prepared to
construe the statute as having the effect of making the contract prohibited. If
it had been otherwise, the ship owners would not have been entitled to any
freight and would therefore have suffered an additional penalty, much greater
than that provided for by Parliament, for conduct which might have been
unintentional.</p>

</span>In <i>Ashmore, Benson, Pease and Co Ltd v Dawson</i> [1973] 1 WLR 828
the Court of Appeal adopted a different approach. Manufacturers of heavy
engineering equipment entered into a contract of carriage with road hauliers.
There was nothing illegal in the formation of the contract, but the hauliers
overloaded the vehicles which were to transport the load, in breach of road
traffic regulations, and one of the lorries toppled over during the journey as
a result of the driver’s negligence. The manufacturers’ transport manager was
present when the goods were loaded and was aware of the overloading. A claim by
the manufacturers for the cost of repair of the damaged load was rejected on
grounds of illegality. The Court of Appeal did not perform the same analysis as
had Devlin J in the <i>St John Shipping</i> case. They held simply that the
manufacturers participated in the illegal performance of the contract and were
therefore barred from suing on it.</a></p><a name="para7">

</span>In this case the issue is whether Lord Mansfield’s maxim precludes a
party to a contract tainted by illegality from recovering money paid under the
contract from the other party under the law of unjust enrichment (to use the
term now generally favoured by scholars for what used previously to be labelled
restitution and, before that, quasi-contract). On one side it is argued that
the maxim applies as much to such a claim as to a claim in contract, and that
the court must give no assistance to a party which has engaged in any form of
illegality. On the other side it is argued that such an approach would not
advance the public policy which underlies Lord Mansfield’s maxim, once the
underlying policy is properly understood.</a></p><a name="para9">

</span>With that introduction I turn to the facts of Mr Patel’s claim and how
it was decided in the courts below: see paras 11-16. A central part of their
judgments, and of Mr Mirza’s argument, concerns the doctrine of reliance
applied by the House of Lords in <i>Tinsley v Milligan</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1993/3.html">[1994] 1 AC 340</a>: see
paras 17-20. That decision led to the Law Commission conducting a comprehensive
review of the law of illegality and making proposals for addressing what the
Commission perceived to be its unsatisfactory features: see paras 21-49. Paras
33-39 concern European law and its potential impact on our domestic law. The
approach adopted in Australia, Canada and the USA is considered at paras 50-66.
Paras 67-81 address developments since the Law Commission’s report, including
three recent decisions of this court which laid bare a division of opinion
about the framework for deciding issues of illegality. Paragraphs 82-94 contain
a section entitled “The law at a crossroads”. This leads to the critical part
of the judgment, which considers the way forward and ends in a summary and
proposal for the disposal of this appeal: paras 95-121. The reader who is more
interested in what the judgment has to say about the future than the past will
no doubt wish to concentrate on the final section.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">Mr Patel’s claim</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The essential facts can be shortly told. Mr Patel transferred sums
totalling £620,000 to Mr Mirza for the purpose of betting on the price of RBS
shares, using advance insider information which Mr Mirza expected to obtain
from RBS contacts regarding an anticipated government announcement which would
affect the price of the shares. Mr Mirza’s expectation of a government announcement
proved to be mistaken, and so the intended betting did not take place, but Mr
Mirza failed to repay the money to Mr Patel despite promises to do so. Mr Patel
thereupon brought this claim for the recovery of the sums which he had paid.
The claim was put on various bases including contract and unjust enrichment. A
fuller account of the facts is given in the judgments of the courts below and
in the judgment of Lord Neuberger.</a></p><a name="para11">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The agreement between Mr Patel and Mr Mirza amounted to a conspiracy to
commit an offence of insider dealing under section 52 of the Criminal Justice
Act 1993. In order to establish his claim to the return of his money, it was
necessary for Mr Patel to explain the nature of the agreement.</a></p><a name="para12">

</span>A defendant’s enrichment is prima facie unjust if the claimant has
enriched the defendant on the basis of a consideration which fails. The
consideration may have been a promised counter-performance (whether under a
valid contract or not), an event or a state of affairs, which failed to
materialise. (See Professor Andrew Burrows’ <i>A Restatement of the English Law
of Unjust Enrichment</i>, 2012, p 86, para 15). In <i>Sharma v Simposh Ltd</i>
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2011/1383.html">[2013] Ch 23</a>, at para 24, the Court of Appeal cited with approval Professor
Birks’ summary of the meaning of failure of consideration in his revised
edition of <i>An Introduction to the Law of Restitution</i> (1989), p 223:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Failure of the consideration for
a payment … means that the state of affairs contemplated as the basis or reason
for the payment has failed to materialise or, if it did exist, has failed to
sustain itself.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">For Mr Patel to show that there was a failure of consideration
for his payment of moneys to Mr Mirza, he had to show what the consideration
was, and that required him to establish the nature of their agreement.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Applying the “reliance principle” stated in <i>Tinsley v Milligan</i>
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1993/3.html">[1994] 1 AC 340</a>, the judge held that Mr Patel’s claim to recover the sum paid
was unenforceable because he had to rely on his own illegality to establish it,
unless he could have brought himself within the exception of the doctrine
known, misleadingly, as locus poenitentiae; and that he could not bring himself
within that exception since he had not voluntarily withdrawn from the illegal
scheme.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para15">15.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the Court of Appeal the majority agreed with the judge on the
reliance issue, but disagreed with him on the application of the locus
poenitentiae exception. They held that it was enough for the claim to succeed
that the scheme had not been executed. Gloster LJ agreed with the majority that
Mr Patel’s claim should succeed but she took a different approach to it. She
began her thoughtful analysis with a cri de coeur (para 47):</a></p><a name="para15">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“As any hapless law student
attempting to grapple with the concept of illegality knows, it is almost
impossible to ascertain or articulate principled rules from the authorities
relating to the recovery of money or other assets paid or transferred under
illegal contracts.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">In summary, she rejected the view that <i>Tinsley v
Milligan</i> was to be taken as laying down a rule of universal application
that the defence of <i>ex turpi causa</i> must apply in all circumstances where
a claim involves reliance on the claimant’s own illegality. It was necessary in
her view to consider whether the policy underlying the rule which made the
contract illegal would be stultified by allowing the claim. In addressing that
issue, relevant factors included the degree of connection between the wrongful
conduct and the claim made, and the disproportionality of disallowing the claim
to the unlawfulness of the conduct. She identified the mischief at which the
offence of insider trading was aimed as market abuse by the exploitation of unpublished
price-sensitive information obtained from a privileged source. If no such
activity occurred, Gloster LJ said that it was hard to see on what basis public
policy should bar the return of money which had previously been intended to be
used for that purpose. Mr Patel was not seeking to make a benefit from
wrongdoing, and she did not consider that such an outcome would be just and
proportionate.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para15"></a><a name="para16">16.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On the issue of reliance, Gloster LJ did not consider it necessary for
Mr Patel to establish that the intended betting on RBS shares was to be done
with the benefit of insider information; it would have been enough for him to
establish that the funds had been paid for the purpose of a speculation on the
price of the shares which never took place. If, however, she were wrong on that
issue, she agreed with the other members of the court on the locus poenitentiae
issue.</a></p><a name="para16">

<p class="ParaHeading">The reliance principle and Tinsley v Milligan</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para16"></a><a name="para17">17.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The facts of <i>Tinsley v Milligan</i> are well known. Miss Tinsley and
Miss Milligan each contributed to the purchase of a home. It was vested in Miss
Tinsley’s sole name, but on the mutual understanding that they were joint
beneficial owners. It was put in her sole name so as to assist Miss Milligan to
make false benefit claims from the Department of Social Security (DSS), which
she did over a number of years with Miss Tinsley’s connivance. The money
obtained from the DSS helped them to pay their bills, but it played only a
small part in the acquisition of the equity in the house. Eventually Miss
Milligan confessed to the DSS what she had done and made terms with it, but the
parties fell out. Miss Tinsley gave Miss Milligan notice to quit and brought a
claim against her for possession. Miss Milligan counterclaimed for a
declaration that the property was held by Miss Tinsley on trust for the parties
in equal shares.</a></p><a name="para17">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para17"></a><a name="para18">18.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeal by a majority decided in favour of Miss Milligan by
applying the test whether it would be “an affront to the public conscience” to
grant the relief claimed by her. The House of Lords unanimously rejected the
“public conscience” test, but by a three to two majority upheld the Court of
Appeal’s decision. The leading speech was given by Lord Browne-Wilkinson. His
starting point was that title to property can pass under an unlawful transaction;
but he held that the court would not assist an owner to recover the property if
he had to rely on his own illegality to prove his title. The Court of Appeal
had recognised that distinction in <i>Bowmakers Ltd v Barnet Instruments Ltd </i>[1945]
KB 65 in a case concerning personal property, referred to in more detail at
para 111 below, and Lord Browne-Wilkinson held that the same applied to real
property in which the claimant had a beneficial interest. Lord Browne-Wilkinson
held that it was enough for Miss Milligan to show that she had contributed to
the purchase of the property and that there was a common understanding that the
parties were joint owners. She did not have to explain why the property had
been put into Miss Tinsley’s sole name. If the relationship between them had
been that of daughter and mother, and each had contributed to the purchase of a
property in the daughter’s name, the result would have been different, because
there would then have been a presumption of advancement in the daughter’s favour.
The mother would in those circumstances have had to rely on the illegal nature
of the transaction to rebut the presumption, and her claim would therefore have
been defeated by the doctrine of illegality. Lord Browne-Wilkinson acknowledged
the procedural nature of this approach at </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1993/3.html">[1994] 1 AC 340</a>, 374:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The effect of illegality is not
substantive but procedural. The question therefore is, ‘In what circumstances
will equity refuse to enforce equitable rights which undoubtedly exist.’”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para19">19.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Goff, in the minority, held at p 356 that if A puts property in the
name of B intending to conceal A’s interest for a fraudulent or illegal
purpose, neither law nor equity will allow A to recover the property, and
equity will not assist him in asserting an equitable interest in it. It made no
difference whether A’s case could be advanced without reference to the
underlying purpose. He recognised, at p 363, the resulting hardship and said
that he did not disguise his unhappiness at the result, but he did not regard
it as appropriate for the courts to introduce a discretion. He considered, at p
364, that reform should be instituted only by the legislature, after a full
inquiry by the Law Commission, which would embrace not only the advantages and
disadvantages of the present system, but also the likely advantages and
disadvantages of a discretionary system. He added that he would be more than
happy if a new system could be evolved which was both satisfactory in its
effect and capable of avoiding the kind of result which in his judgment flowed
from the established rules in cases such as <i>Tinsley v Milligan</i>.</a></p><a name="para19">

</span><i>Tinsley v Milligan</i> has been the subject of much criticism in this

</span>After the decision in <i>Tinsley v Milligan</i> the Law Commission included
the illegality defence in its Sixth Programme of Law Reform (1995) (Law Com
234). It undertook a full inquiry of the kind which Lord Goff envisaged. It
published its first consultation paper, <i>Illegal Transactions: The Effect of
Illegality on Contracts and Trusts</i> (LCCP 154), in 1999. The responses, and
developments in the case law, led the Commission to re-consider the problems
and its proposals for reform. In 2009 it issued a further public consultation
paper, <i>The Illegality Defence: A Consultative Report</i> (LCCP 189). In 2010
it issued its final confirmatory report, <i>The Illegality Defence</i> (Law Com
320). In relation to trust law, it proposed statutory reform and it produced a
draft bill. In relation to the law of contract and unjust enrichment, the Commission
considered that there were serious problems but that they were capable of
being, and could best be, tackled by the process of judicial development. In
2012 the government announced that it did not intend to take forward the
Commission’s recommendation for statutory reform of the law relating to trusts,
because it did not consider reform of this area of the law to be a pressing
priority for the government.</a></p><a name="para21">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>From its study of the case law and academic writing, the Commission
identified the principal policy rationales for the illegality doctrine as 1)
furthering the purpose of the rule infringed by the claimant’s behaviour, 2)
consistency, 3) prevention of profit from the claimant’s wrongdoing, 4)
deterrence and 5) maintaining the integrity of the legal system. It observed
that these rationales were not mutually exclusive but overlapped to a greater
or lesser degree. A sixth possible rationale, punishment, was controversial.
The large majority of consultees considered that punishment was a matter for
the criminal courts (to which one might add regulators) and should not be
invoked in determining parties’ civil disputes. (LCCP 189, paras 2.5-2.31.)</a></p><a name="para22">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The conclusion that the illegality defence presented serious problems
represented the overwhelming view of academic commentators and consultees
generally. The Commission analysed the problems under four heads - complexity,
uncertainty, arbitrariness and lack of transparency. It did not suggest that
the problems resulted generally in unsatisfactory outcomes, but it was critical
of the way in which they were reached. It said that, on the whole, the case law
illustrated the judges threading a path through the various rules and
exceptions in order to reach outcomes which for the most part would be regarded
as fair between the parties involved, although there were instances of results
which the Commission considered to be unduly harsh, for example in unlawful
employment cases. Generally, the courts managed to avoid unnecessarily harsh
decisions either by creating exceptions to the general rules or by straining
the application of the relevant rules on the particular facts so as to meet the
justice of the case. Seldom was there an open discussion in the judgments of
the considerations which led the court to its decision. (LCCP 189, paras
3.50-3.60.)</a></p><a name="para23">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Commission considered that <i>Tinsley v Milligan</i>,<i> </i>and
cases following it, exemplified the problems of arbitrariness, uncertainty and
potential for injustice. The rule applied in that case was arbitrary in that
the question whether the illegality affected the recognition or enforcement of
the trust depended not on the merits of the parties, nor the policies
underlying the illegality defence, but on a procedural issue. Moreover the
effect of applying the reliance principle in cases involving the presumption of
advancement gave that presumption an overriding importance which it was never
intended to have. It led to uncertainty because there was much confusion over
what exactly amounted to “reliance”, particularly when the claimant was seeking
to establish an equitable interest under a constructive trust. It had the
potential to force the court into unjust decisions because, by focusing on
procedural matters, the reliance principle precluded the court from paying
attention to the policies that justified the existence of the defence, or
taking into account such matters as the seriousness of the illegality and the
value of the interest at stake. (Law Com 320, paras 2.13-2.15.)</a></p><a name="para24">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Commission examined the law in other jurisdictions, European law and
European human rights law. In its first consultation paper in 1999 the
Commission’s proposed recommendation was to introduce statutory reform on the
lines of the New Zealand model. The New Zealand Illegal Contracts Act 1970,
section 7, provides that the court may grant to any party to an illegal
contract “such relief by way of restitution, compensation, variation of the
contract, validation of the contract in whole or part or for any particular
purpose, or otherwise howsoever as the court in its discretion thinks just”. In
its 2009 consultative report the Commission noted that the operation of this
provision had been widely heralded as a success; that it had not created the
deluge of litigation that was feared by some commentators; and that this model
of reform, with slight variations, had been recommended by the law reform
bodies of several other Commonwealth jurisdictions (LCCP 189, para 3.81). Nevertheless,
in its 2009 consultative report and in its final report the Commission did not
recommend statutory change (except in relation to trusts) for a combination of
reasons. Although the proposal for statutory reform in the 1999 consultation
paper had been supported by a majority of consultees, a minority had made
critical comments which persuaded the Commission that judicial reform was a
better way forward, and the Commission found difficulties in drafting a
satisfactory statutory model. Most importantly, developments in the case law
and the critical responses of consultees led the Commission to conclude that it
was open to the courts to develop the law in ways that would render it
considerably clearer, more certain and less arbitrary.</a></p><a name="para25">

</span>Bakewell bought an area of land registered as a common. Owners of
neighbouring properties had for years driven across the land to reach the
public highway. Bakewell brought an action to prevent them from continuing to
do so. The defendants claimed to have acquired rights of way by prescription,
but by driving across the land without the owner’s consent they had committed
offences under the Law of Property Act 1925. So to establish their property
rights the defendants had to rely on conduct which was criminal. This, Bakewell
submitted, they were not entitled to do. Its argument was rejected. The House
of Lords held that public policy did not prevent the defendants from acquiring
an easement where the landowner could have made a grant which would have
removed the criminality of the user. Lord Walker, with whom Lord Bingham and
Lady Hale agreed, said at para 60:</a></p><a name="para27">

</span><i>Gray v Thames Trains Ltd</i> was a case in tort. Mr Gray developed
post-traumatic stress disorder through being involved in a major railway
accident, which caused him to suffer depression and a substantial personality
change. He was previously of unblemished character but two years after the
accident, and while under medical treatment, he pursued and stabbed to death a
man who had stepped in front of his car. His plea of guilty to manslaughter on
the ground of diminished responsibility was accepted and he was ordered to be
detained in a mental hospital. He sued the train operator for negligence and
liability was admitted. His claim for damages included compensation for his
loss of liberty, damage to reputation and loss of earnings during his
detention. The House of Lords held that public policy precluded him from
recovering damages under those heads. The leading opinion was given by Lord
Hoffmann, with whose reasoning Lord Phillips (subject to certain additional
observations) and Lord Scott agreed.</a></p><a name="para28">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Hoffmann observed, at paras 30-32, that the maxim <i>ex turpi causa</i>
expresses not so much a principle but a policy based on a group of reasons,
which vary in different situations. The courts had therefore evolved varying
rules to deal with different situations. Because questions of fairness and
policy were different in different cases and led to different rules, one could
not simply extrapolate rules applicable to one situation and apply them to
another. It had to be assumed that the sentence was what the criminal court
regarded as appropriate to reflect Mr Gray’s personal responsibility for the
crime he had committed. It was therefore right to apply the rule that he could
not recover damages for the consequences of the sentence, reflecting an
underlying policy based on the inconsistency of requiring someone to be
compensated for a sentence imposed because of his personal responsibility for a
criminal act. It was also to right to apply a wider rule that you cannot
recover damage which is the consequence of your own criminal act, reflecting
the idea that it is offensive to public notions of the fair distribution of
resources that a claimant should be compensated (usually out of public funds)
for the consequences of his own criminal conduct.</a></p><a name="para29">

</span>Lord Phillips said, at para 15, that he would reserve judgment as to
whether the <i>ex turpi causa</i> maxim should apply if it were clear from the
judge’s sentencing remarks that the claimant’s offending behaviour played no
part in the decision to impose a hospital order, or, where the claimant’s
criminal act demonstrated a need to detain him both for his own treatment and
for the protection of the public, if the judge made it clear that he did not
believe that the claimant should bear significant personal responsibility for
his crime. Lord Brown agreed with Lord Phillips’ reservations.</a></p><a name="para30">

</span>Lord Rodger said, at paras 78-83, that the civil court must assume that
the order made by the criminal court was appropriate to reflect Mr Gray’s personal
responsibility for the crime he had committed. The right approach on the facts
of the case was that the court must “cleave to the same policy as the criminal
court”. However, he considered that the approach might well be different if the
offence of which he had been convicted was trivial but revealed that he was
suffering from a mental disorder, due to the defendant’s fault, which made a
hospital order appropriate.</a></p><a name="para31">

</span>The Law Commission drew from the various judgments a readiness on the
part of the judges to examine the policy reasons which justified the
application of the illegality defence and to explain why those policies applied
to the facts of the case.</a></p><a name="para32">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Commission also considered the question how far illegal conduct may
deprive claimants of rights under European Union law (LCCP 189, paras
3.82-3.89). Some contractual rights are now derived from EC directives. For
example, the right to equal pay granted by the Equal Pay Directive (directive
75/117/EEC) is implied as a term into the employment contract. In other cases,
such as the Sale of Consumer Goods Directive (directive 99/44/EC), EU law
provides remedies that depend on the existence of a contract. The issue may
therefore arise whether a national illegality doctrine which prevents a party
from enforcing a contract is compatible with the EU law from which the
contractual right arose.</a></p><a name="para33">

</span>In the 1990s various breweries let pubs to tenants on terms containing
beer ties. These were found to be unenforceable because they breached article
81 (previously article 85) of the European Community Treaty. The issue then
arose whether the fact that the tenant had been party to an illegal contract
precluded him from claiming damages from the brewery. In <i>Gibbs Mew plc v
Gemmell</i> [1999] 1 EGLR 43, 49 the Court of Appeal held that this was so,
because “English law does not allow a party to an illegal agreement to claim
damages from the other party for loss caused to him by being a party to the
illegal agreement” (per Peter Gibson LJ).</a></p><a name="para34">

of Appeal referred the question to the European Court of Justice, which took a
different view. Advocate General Mischo expressed the view, at paras 38-43,
that although the individuals protected by article 81 were primarily third
parties (consumers and competitors), a rule which automatically excluded a
party to the agreement from the protection of article 81 was “too formalistic
and does not take account of the particular facts of individual cases”; and
that a party which was too small to resist the economic pressure imposed on it
by the more powerful undertaking had more in common with a third party than
with the author of the agreement. (The potential parallel with the relationship
in some cases between an employer and an employee is obvious.)</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para36">36.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The court agreed with the Advocate General. It held that where a
contract was liable to restrict or distort competition, community law did not
preclude a rule of national law from barring a contracting party from relying
on his own illegal actions, if it was established that that party bore
significant responsibility for the distortion of competition. In that context
the matters to be taken into account by the national court included the
respective bargaining power and the conduct of the parties to the agreement in
the economic and legal context in which they found themselves. It was for the
national court to ascertain whether the party who claimed to have suffered loss
through concluding such a contract was in a markedly weaker position than the
other party, such as seriously to compromise or even eliminate his freedom to
negotiate the terms of the contract. An absolute bar to an action being brought
by a party to a contract which violated the competition rules would not advance
the full effectiveness of the prohibition contained in the Treaty, but rather
the reverse.</a></p><a name="para36">

intended for the protection of parties who infringed it, as a class, but to
treat it as a matter for the national court to determine whether on the facts
of a particular case a party should be regarded as sinned against rather than
sinning, and therefore entitled to damages for the consequences of the
offending provision of the agreement.</a></p><a name="para37">

</span>The potential impact of European law was referred to, obiter, by Mance
LJ in <i>Hall v Woolston Hall Leisure Ltd</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2000/170.html">[2001] 1 WLR 225</a>. The claimant
was dismissed from her employment as a chef when her employer became aware that
she was pregnant. She brought a claim in the industrial tribunal for
compensation under the Sex Discrimination Act 1975. The Act pre-dated the Equal
Treatment Directive (76/207/EEC) but gave effect to its provisions. Mrs Hall
succeeded on liability, but it emerged during the remedies hearing that her
employer was defrauding the Inland Revenue by falsely pretending that her net
salary of £250 per week was her gross salary. She was aware of the fraud,
because she was given pay slips which showed her gross pay as £250, deductions
of £63.35 and net pay of £186.65. She knew that this was untrue, but when she
raised the matter with her employer she was told that this was the way in which
they did business. The tribunal held that the contract was tainted by
illegality and that she had no right to compensation under the Act. Its
decision was upheld by the appeal tribunal but reversed by the Court of Appeal,
which held that her acquiescence in the employer’s conduct was not causally
linked with her sex discrimination claim and that public policy did not
preclude her from enforcing her statutory claim. Mance LJ observed additionally
that the Act should as far as possible be read as providing the same scope of
protection as the Directive. Mrs Hall’s position fell within the wording and
purpose of the Directive despite the tribunal’s finding of her knowledge of the
fraud on the Inland Revenue.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>That case did not involve the direct enforcement of a contractual
obligation, but in cases where European Union rights depend on the existence of
a contract (for example, in the consumer context), the Law Commission doubted
whether the Court of Justice would be content with a system of domestic
illegality rules which were formalistic and did not allow room for a
proportionate balancing exercise to be carried out on the basis of clear principles
of public policy (LCCP 189, para 3.89).</a></p><a name="para39">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para39"></a><a name="para40">40.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Where the terms or performance of a contract involve breach of a
legislative provision, it is rare (as the Commission noted) for the statute to
state expressly what are to be the consequences in terms of its enforceability.
(For an example of an express statutory unenforceability provision, see section
127(3) of the Consumer Credit Act 1974, which arose for consideration in <i>Wilson
v First County Trust Ltd (No 2)</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2003/40.html">[2004] 1 AC 816</a>.) It is to be noted that in
the present case, as Gloster LJ pointed out, section 63(2) of the Criminal
Justice Act 1993 stipulated that “No contract shall be void or unenforceable by
reason only of section 52”, presumably because of a concern that if a contract
which involved insider dealing contrary to section 52 were void, there could be
undesirable consequences for parties down the line. The question whether a
statute has the implied effect of nullifying any contract which infringes it
requires a purposive construction of the statute, as illustrated by the
decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Hughes v Asset Managers plc</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1994/14.html">[1995] 3 All ER 669</a> which the Commission commended.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para41">41.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If a contract involving prohibited conduct is not void as a matter of
statutory construction, the Commission recommended that in deciding whether a
claim arising from it should be disallowed by reason of illegality, the court
should have regard to the policies that underlie the doctrine. It stressed that
it was not advocating a general discretion, but a principled evaluation recognising
(as Lord Walker put it in the <i>Bakewell</i> case, at para 60) that the maxim <i>ex
turpi causa</i> must be applied as an instrument of public policy and not in
circumstances where it would not serve the public interest. The Commission
identified a number of potentially relevant factors: most importantly, whether
allowing the claim would undermine the purpose of the rule which made the
relevant conduct unlawful, and, linked to that question, the causal connection
between the illegality and the claim (including how central the illegality was
to the contract), the gravity of the conduct of the respective parties and the
proportionality of denying the claim. (LCCP 189, para 3.142) The Commission
recommended a broadly similar approach to the maxim <i>ex turpi causa</i> in
cases of unjust enrichment, tort and enforcement of property rights.</a></p><a name="para41">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Commission considered that it was within the power of the courts to
develop the law in that direction and that there were signs of willingness to
do so. The underlying principles were already to be found in the case law and
courts were in practice influenced by them in reaching their decisions, in some
cases more openly than in others.</a></p><a name="para42">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In relation to the application of the illegality defence to claims of
unjust enrichment, the Commission carried out a detailed review in its 1999
consultation paper (LCCP 154, paras 2.32-2.56) and a further review in its 2009
consultative report (LCCP 189, paras 4.1-4.62). An unjust enrichment claim may
simply be to unwind the transaction by repayment of moneys paid and restoration
of the parties to their original position, or it may take the form of a claim
for recompense for benefits provided by one party to the other (a quantum
meruit claim).</a></p><a name="para43">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para43"></a><a name="para44">44.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Commission observed that one might have expected to find that
illegality has little role to play as a defence to a claim for unjust
enrichment, since the claimant is not seeking to execute the contract. However,
after a more liberal start, the courts adopted a much tougher stance, applying
the <i>ex turpi causa</i> maxim to such claims unless the claimant could bring
himself within certain recognised exceptions. These were a) duress, b) possibly
ignorance of a fact or law that rendered the contract illegal, c) possibly
membership of a vulnerable class protected by statute and d) locus poenitentiae.
The locus poenitentiae exception has given rise to difficult and conflicting
case law, which was meticulously analysed in the judgments of the courts below
in the present case with different conclusions. I do not propose to repeat
their analysis because I do not consider it necessary to do so. The topic has
only acquired importance because of the strictness of the basic rule which the
courts have applied.</a></p><a name="para44">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Not every case, however, has received such strict treatment. In <i>Mohamed
v Alaga</i> <i>&amp;</i> <i>Co</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1999/3037.html">[2000] 1 WLR 1815</a> the Court of Appeal took a
more flexible approach. The plaintiff, a Somali translator and interpreter,
sued the defendant solicitors for breach of a contract by which he was to
introduce Somali refugees to the firm, and assist in the preparation and
presentation of their asylum claims, in consideration for a half share of the
legal aid fees received by the firm. Alternatively, he claimed payment for his
professional services as a translator and interpreter on a quantum meruit. His
claim was struck out on the ground that the alleged fee sharing contract
contravened rules which had statutory force under the Solicitors Act 1974 and
that he was therefore precluded by the doctrine of illegality from claiming
payment for services provided under the contract. The Court of Appeal restored
the claim for payment on a quantum meruit.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para46">46.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Bingham CJ (with whom the other members of the court agreed)
differentiated between the claims for breach of contract and quantum meruit. As
to the former, he held that the purpose of the prohibition in the statutory
rules was the protection of the public, and that it would defeat the purpose of
the prohibition if a non-solicitor party to the agreement could invoke the
court’s aid to enforce the agreement. As to the quantum meruit claim, Lord
Bingham acknowledged that on one view of the case the plaintiff was seeking to
recover part of the consideration payable under an unenforceable contract. But
he preferred to view it as a claim for a reasonable reward for professional
services rendered. He considered it relevant (obviously to the question of the
public interest in permitting or disallowing the claim) that the parties were not
equal in blameworthiness. The firm could be assumed to know the rules and the
likelihood was that it had acted in knowing disregard of them. By contrast,
Lord Bingham had no difficulty in accepting that the plaintiff was unaware of
any reason why the firm should not make the agreement, which was a common type
of agreement in other commercial fields.</a></p><a name="para46">

</span>Mr Matthew Collings QC for Mr Mirza submitted in this case that <i>Mohamed

</span>The Commission considered that the policies which underlie the
illegality defence are less likely to come into play where parties are
attempting to undo, rather than carry out, an illegal contract. As in the case
of contractual enforcement, it recommended that a decision on disallowing a
particular restitutionary claim for illegality should be based openly on the
policies underlying the defence, taking into account the same sort of factors
(such as the relative conduct of the parties and the proportionality of denying
the claim).</a></p><a name="para48">

Court of Australia considered essentially the same issues as in <i>Tinsley v
Milligan</i>, which it declined to follow. As the widow of a mariner who had
served in World War 1, Mrs Nelson was eligible under the Defence Service Homes
Act 1918 to buy a house with the benefit of a subsidy from the Commonwealth of
Australia, provided that she did not own or have a financial benefit in another
house. She provided the money to buy a house in Bent Street, Sydney, but the
transfer was taken in the names of her son and daughter. Their common intention
was that Mrs Nelson should be the beneficial owner of the house. The reason for
putting the Bent Street property in the names of her children was to enable her
to buy another property with the benefit of a subsidy under the Act. This she
did. One year later the Bent Street property was sold. By this time Mrs Nelson
and her daughter had fallen out, and a dispute arose as to who was entitled to
the sale proceeds. Mrs Nelson and her son brought proceedings against the
daughter for a declaration that the proceeds were held by the son and daughter
in trust for their mother. The daughter opposed the claim and sought a
declaration that she had a beneficial interest. Under <i>Tinsley v Milligan</i>
the daughter would have succeeded, because the illegal purpose of the parties
in arranging for the property to be transferred into the names of the children
would have prevented Mrs Nelson from rebutting the presumption of advancement
in their favour.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The High Court unanimously rejected that approach. The majority (Deane,
McHugh and Gummow JJ) held that the court should use its equitable jurisdiction
to grant the declaration sought by Mrs Nelson, with the proviso that it should
be subject to terms designed to ensure that the benefit wrongly obtained on the
purchase of the second property should be repaid to the Commonwealth. The
minority (Dawson and Toohey JJ) would have made the declaration without any
such proviso, since the Commonwealth was not a party to the proceedings and
should in their view be left to decide what action, if any, it wished to take.</a></p><a name="para51">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Once we are in the realm of
public policy we are in a rather shadowy world. It is perhaps the more shadowy
here because Mrs Nelson is not asking the court to enforce a contract but
rather to give effect to the resulting trust which would ordinarily arise once
the presumption of advancement has been rebutted.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">…</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">To allow the result in such a
situation to be determined by the procedural aspects of a claim for relief is
at odds with the broad considerations necessarily involved in questions of
public policy.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:72.0pt">…</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">Although the public policy in
discouraging unlawful acts and refusing them judicial approval is important, it
is not the only relevant policy consideration. There is also the consideration
of preventing injustice and the enrichment of one party at the expense of the
other (<i>St John Shipping Corpn v Joseph Rank Ltd</i> [1957] 1 QB 267,
288-289, per Devlin J).”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">McHugh J, at p 609, described as unsatisfactory a doctrine
of illegality that depended upon the state of the pleadings. He said at p 611:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The doctrine of illegality
expounded in <i>Holman</i> was formulated in a society that was vastly
different from that which exists today. It was a society that was much less
regulated. With the rapid expansion of regulation, it is undeniable that the
legal environment in which the doctrine of illegality operates has changed. The
underlying policy of <i>Holman</i> is still valid today - the courts must not
condone or assist a breach of statute, nor must they help to frustrate the
operation of a statute … However, the <i>Holman</i> rule, stated in the bald
dictum: ‘No court will lend its aid to a man who founds his cause of action upon

legal policy in the late twentieth century even when account is taken of the

</span>McHugh J went on to suggest that except in a case where a statute made
rights arising out of a particular type of transaction unenforceable in all
circumstances, a court should not refuse to enforce legal or equitable rights
on the ground of illegality if to do so would be disproportionate to the
seriousness of the conduct or if it would not further the purpose of the
statute. He said at 612-613:</a></p><a name="para53">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It is not in accord with
contemporaneous notions of justice that the penalty for breaching a law or
frustrating its policy should be disproportionate to the seriousness of the
breach. The seriousness of the illegality must be judged by reference to the
statute whose terms or policy is contravened. It cannot be assessed in a
vacuum. The statute must always be the reference point for determining the
seriousness of the illegality.”</p>

</span>In <i>Hall v Hebert</i> </a><a href="http://canlii.ca/t/1fs4g">[1993] 2 SCR 159</a> the owner of a car allowed a
passenger to drive it in the knowledge that he had drunk a large amount of beer
during the course of the evening. The car overturned and the driver suffered
head injuries. The Supreme Court held that the driver’s claim against the owner
in negligence was not barred by illegality, but that there should be a
reduction in damages for contributory negligence. The judgment of the majority
was given by McLachlin J.</p>

</span>She held that the courts should be allowed to bar recovery in tort on
the ground of the plaintiff’s illegal or immoral conduct only in very limited
circumstances. The basis of the power lay in the duty of the courts to preserve
the integrity of the legal system and it was exercisable only where that
concern was in issue. It was in issue where a damage award in a civil suit
would allow a person to profit from illegal or wrongful conduct, or would
permit an evasion or rebate of a penalty prescribed by the criminal law. In
such instances the law refused to give by its right hand what it took away by
its left hand.</a></p><a name="para56">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>McLachlin J emphasised the importance of defining what was meant by
profit when speaking of the plaintiff profiting from his or her own wrong. It
meant profit in the narrow sense of a direct pecuniary award for an act of
wrongdoing. Compensation for something other than wrongdoing, such as for
personal injury, would not amount to profit in that sense. Compensation for the
plaintiff’s injuries arose not from the illegal character of his conduct, but
from the damage caused to him by the negligent act of the owner in letting him
drive. It represented only the value of, or substitute for, the injuries he had
suffered by the fault of another. He would get nothing for being engaged in illegal
conduct. McLachlin J accepted that there might be cases where a claim should be
barred from tort recovery which did not fall within the category of profit, in
order to prevent stultification of the criminal law or the evasion of a
criminal penalty, but the underlying principle was that the use of the power to
deny recovery on the ground of illegality was justified only where the claim
would introduce inconsistency into the fabric of the law.</a></p><a name="para57">

an American citizen lawfully entered Canada and applied for permanent residence

accepted employment but did so without obtaining a work permit as required by
the Immigration Act 1985. She was subsequently laid off and submitted a claim
for benefits under the Unemployment Insurance Act 1985. Her claim was rejected
on the ground that the employment on which she relied in order to found her

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The judgment of the court was given by Robertson JA. The court accepted
that her employment without a work permit was expressly prohibited by the
Immigration Act. It acknowledged that under what it described as the “classical
model” of the illegality doctrine, the fact that the applicant acted in good
faith was irrelevant; her employment under an illegal contract could not
constitute insurable employment for the purposes of the Unemployment Insurance
Act. However, it said at para 24 that in recognition of the rigidity and
oft-times unfair application of the classical illegality doctrine, the courts
had developed several ways in which a party may be relieved of the consequences
of illegality where appropriate. The difficulty with those exceptions arose
from “the legal manoeuvring that must take place to arrive at what is
considered a just result”. The court examined, at paras 25-36, a line of
authorities of the Ontario courts which showed the courts turning from the
classical model towards a modern approach. It expressed the view, at para 42,
that the classical model had lost its persuasive force, and was now honoured
more in the breach than in its observance through the proliferation of
so-called judicial “exceptions” to the rule. The new approach involved an
examination of the purpose underlying the relevant prohibition, and its
rationale was explained by McLachlin J in <i>Hall v Hebert</i>.</a></p><a name="para59">

</span>After citing McLachlin J’s judgment in <i>Hall v Hebert</i>, the court
said at para 49:</a></p><a name="para60">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“As the doctrine of illegality
rests on the understanding that it would be contrary to public policy to allow
a person to maintain an action on a contract prohibited by statute, then it is
only appropriate to identify those policy considerations which outweigh the
applicant’s prima facie right to unemployment insurance benefits. … While on
the one hand we have to consider the policy behind the legislation being violated,
the Immigration Act, we must also consider the policy behind the legislation
which gives rise to the benefits that have been denied, the Unemployment
Insurance Act.”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The court proceeded to consider the objectives underlying each of the
two Acts. As to the policy consideration that a person should not benefit from
his or her own wrong, the court regarded it as a critically significant fact
that she had not deliberately broken the law but acted in good faith, and it
noted that during her employment both the applicant and her employer had
contributed to the unemployment insurance fund. Taking account of the
objectives underlying each Act and the facts of the case, it concluded that
denial of the application was not required in order to preserve the integrity
of the legal system and would be disproportionate to the breach involved in
failing to have obtained a work permit.</a></p><a name="para61">

</span><i>Nizamuddowlah v Bengal Cabaret Inc</i> (1977) 399 NYS 2d 854 provides
a practical example in the case of a devious and oppressive employer. The
central defendant (the effective owner of the company named as first defendant)
met the plaintiff in Bangladesh and offered to employ him at the defendant’s
restaurant in New York City. The plaintiff was to work for an initial period of
three months without payment, after which he was to be paid a waiter’s salary.
The plaintiff accepted the offer. The defendant arranged for the plaintiff’s
travel and entry to the USA on a visitor’s visa, and he also promised to obtain
a resident visa or “green card” for him. The plaintiff worked for the defendant
for 20 months, but he received no payment despite several demands. He also made
repeated inquiries about his green card, but the defendant persistently stalled
him. The plaintiff eventually managed to obtain a green card through his own
efforts and sued the defendant to recover wages under the Minimum Wage Act. The
defendant sought the dismissal of the action on the ground that the contract
was illegal.</a></p><a name="para63">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>By working in the USA before he obtained a green card the plaintiff
violated the immigration laws, and the judge was not prepared to accept his
plea of ignorance, since he was warned in his application form for a visitor’s
visa that gainful employment would constitute a breach of his visa conditions. The
judge concluded that he had willingly fallen in with the defendant’s proposal
because of his strong desire to emigrate to the USA. The judge identified the
public harm liable to result from the type of conduct exposed by the case:
employment of aliens such as the plaintiff in times of high unemployment
deprived citizens and legally admitted aliens of jobs; their employment on
substandard terms could depress wages and working conditions; and it could
diminish the effectiveness of labour unions.</a></p><a name="para64">

</span>However, the judge found that the defendant was the main perpetrator,
intent on evading and taking advantage of the immigration laws. He said that
knowing about the immigration laws, and aware that a party to an illegal
contract could not ask a court to help him to carry out his illegal objective,
the defendant ran his enterprise without fairly compensating his employees. The
judge concluded that the equitable course was that the plaintiff should be paid
on the basis of unjust enrichment, and he calculated the amount of the award by
reference to the statutory minimum wage.</a></p><a name="para65">

</span>The New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, upheld the judgment at (1979)
415 NYS 2d 685. Observing that the Minimum Wage Act contained no indication of
a legislative intent to protect only American workers, the court said:</a></p><a name="para66">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Even illegal aliens have the
right to pursue civil suits in our courts, and the practice of hiring such
aliens, using their services and disclaiming any obligation to pay wages
because the contract is illegal is to be condemned. The law provides penalties
for aliens who obtain employment in breach of their visa obligations, but
deprivation of compensation for labor is not warranted by any public policy
consideration involving the immigration statutes.”</p>

</span>The Court of Appeal supported and followed the approach of the Law
Commission in <i>Les Laboratoires Servier v Apotex Inc</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/593.html">[2012] EWCA Civ 593</a>,
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/593.html">[2013] Bus LR 80</a> and <i>ParkingEye Ltd v Somerfield Stores Ltd</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/1338.html">[2013] QB 840</a>. In the latter case ParkingEye contracted to provide a system of automated
monitoring of car parking at Somerfield’s supermarkets. The system recorded
vehicle registration numbers and customers would be charged for staying beyond a
set period. The contract was to be for an initial term of 15 months and
ParkingEye’s remuneration was to come from the charges levied over that period.
Overstayers were to be sent letters of demand in a standard form agreed between
the parties in advance of the conclusion of the contract. If the first demand
did not result in payment, it was to be followed by a series of further demands
in stronger terms. The third pro forma letter was deceptive because it falsely
represented that ParkingEye had the authority and intention to issue
proceedings against the customer if payment was not made within a stipulated
period. Six months into the contract Somerfield repudiated it for reasons unconnected
with the letters of demand. By that time the monitoring system had been
installed at 17 of its stores. ParkingEye’s claim for damages was met with a
defence which included a plea of illegality based on the intended use of
deception in the performance of the contract.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para68">68.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The trial judge rejected the defence and awarded ParkingEye damages of
£350,000 for loss of profits caused by Somerfield’s repudiatory breach. The
Court of Appeal upheld his decision. The legally objectionable letter was only
a small part of the intended performance of the contract and was not essential
to it. The judge had found that ParkingEye did not appreciate that the letter
would be legally objectionable when the parties agreed on its form, and that,
if someone had pointed the matter out, the letter would have been changed. When
its objectionable nature occurred to Somerfield, the proper and reasonable
course would have been for Somerfield to raise the matter with ParkingEye and
continue to honour the contract, so long as ParkingEye made the necessary
alteration and performed the contract in a lawful manner, as it would have
done. The court held that denial of ParkingEye’s claim was not justified by the
policies underlying the doctrine of illegality and would have led to a
disproportionate result.</a></p><a name="para68">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Rather than having over-complex

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">53.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not to suggest
that a list of policy factors should become a complete substitute for the rules
about illegality in the law of contract which the courts have developed, but
rather that those rules are to be developed and applied with the degree of
flexibility necessary to give proper effect to the underlying policy factors.”</p>

</span>On the relevance of ParkingEye’s state of mind, I referred at para 66 to
<i>Waugh v Morris</i> (1873) LR 8 QB 202. The case arose from a charter party
under which a cargo of hay was to be shipped from Trouville to London. On
arrival in London the master learned that a few months before the conclusion of
the contract an order had been published under the Contagious Diseases
(Animals) Act 1869 making it illegal to land hay brought from France. The
master refrained from landing the cargo and, after some delay, the charterer
transhipped and exported it. Meanwhile the contractual laydays had expired and the
owner claimed for detention. The charterer resisted the claim on the ground
that the contract was void for illegality, because its purpose was the delivery
of the consignment to London, which was prohibited by law. The defence was
rejected.</a></p><a name="para70">

</span>Giving the judgment of the court, Blackburn J said that all that the
owner had bargained for was that on the ship’s arrival in London the freight
should be paid and the cargo unloaded. He contemplated that it would be landed
and thought that this would be legal; but if he had thought of the possibility
of the landing being prohibited, he would probably and rightly have expected
that the charterer would not violate the law. Blackburn J said at 208:</a></p><a name="para71">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“We quite agree, that, where a
contract is to do a thing which cannot be performed without a violation of the
law it is void, whether the parties knew the law or not. But we think, that in
order to avoid a contract which can be legally performed, on the ground that
there was an intention to perform it in an illegal manner, it is necessary to
show that there was the wicked intention to break the law; and, if this be so,
the knowledge of what the law is becomes of great importance.”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Since the decisions of the Court of Appeal in <i>Les Laboratoires
Servier v Apotex Inc</i> and the <i>ParkingEye</i> case, there have been three
decisions by the Supreme Court involving the doctrine of illegality. The first
was<i> Hounga v Allen</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2014/47.html">[2014] 1 WLR 2889</a>, a case with features similar to <i>Nizamuddowlah
v Bengal Cabaret Inc</i>. Miss Hounga was a 14-year old Nigerian. Mr and Mrs
Allen offered to employ her as a home help in the UK in return for schooling
and £50 per month. With their help she entered the UK on false identity
documents and obtained a six months’ visitor’s visa. The plan was masterminded
by Mrs Allen’s brother who lived in Lagos. He drafted an affidavit for Miss
Hounga to swear, giving her surname as that of Mrs Allen’s mother and a false
date of birth. The affidavit led to the issue of a passport in that name. Mrs
Allen’s family then arranged for Miss Hounga to be taken to the British High
Commission in Lagos, where she produced a document purporting to be an
invitation from Mrs Allen’s mother pretending to invite her granddaughter to
visit her in the United Kingdom. The High Commission was duped into issuing her
with entry clearance. Mrs Allen’s brother then bought a ticket for Miss Hounga
to travel to England. On arrival at Heathrow Miss Hounga confirmed to an
immigration officer that the purpose of her visit was to stay with her
grandmother. Subsequently a psychologist reported that Miss Hounga, who was
illiterate, had low cognitive functioning, a learning disability and a
developmental age much lower than her chronological age. Nevertheless she knew
that she had entered the UK on false pretences, that it was illegal for her to
remain beyond six months and that it was illegal for her to take employment in
the UK.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para73">73.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>After her arrival Miss Hounga lived at the Allens’ home, looking after
their children and doing housework. She was not enrolled in a school or paid
any wages. She was told by Mrs Allen that if she were found by the police she
would be sent to prison. This caused her extreme concern. Mrs Allen also
subjected her to serious physical abuse. After 18 months an incident occurred
in which Mrs Allen beat Miss Hounga, threw her out of the house and poured
water over her. Miss Hounga slept that night in the Allens’ garden in wet
clothes. Next day they refused to let her back in, and she made her way to a
supermarket car park, where she was found and taken to the social services
department of the local authority.</a></p><a name="para73">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Miss Hounga brought claims against the Allens in the employment tribunal
for unfair dismissal, breach of contract and unpaid wages. They were dismissed
on the ground that her contract of employment was unlawful. She appealed
unsuccessfully to the appeal tribunal and she did not seek to appeal further. Neither
the Court of Appeal nor the Supreme Court therefore had occasion to consider
whether she was entitled to be paid for the services which she rendered on a
quantum meruit (by analogy with cases such as <i>Mohamed v Alaga &amp; Co</i>
and <i>Nizamuddowlah v Bengal Cabaret Inc et al</i>).</a></p><a name="para74">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Miss Hounga also claimed to have been the victim of the statutory tort
of unlawful discrimination under the Race Relations Act 1976, section 4(2)(c),
in relation to her dismissal. The tribunal found that she had been dismissed
because of her vulnerability consequent upon her immigration status. She was
therefore the victim of unlawful discrimination and she was awarded
compensation for her resulting injury to feelings. The tribunal’s order was set
aside by the Court of Appeal, which held that the claim was tainted by the
illegal nature of her employment and that for the court to uphold it would be
to condone the illegality, but it was restored by the Supreme Court. The
leading judgment was given by Lord Wilson, with whom Lady Hale and Lord Kerr
agreed.</a></p><a name="para75">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para75"></a><a name="para76">76.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Wilson did not consider that the solution of the case lay either in
asking whether Miss Allen needed to rely on an illegal contract or in asking
whether there was an inextricable link between the illegality to which she was
a party and her claim. At the heart of the judgment Lord Wilson set out his
approach in para 42:</a></p><a name="para76">

</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para76">“The defence of illegality rests
on the foundation of public policy. ‘The principle of public policy is this …’
said Lord Mansfield by way of preface to his classic exposition of the defence
in <i>Holman v Johnson</i> </a><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1775/58.pdf"></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1775/58.html">(1775) 1 Cowp 341</a>, 343. ‘Rules which rest on the
foundation of public policy, not being rules which belong to the fixed or
customary law, are capable, on proper occasion, of expansion or modification’: <i>Maxim
Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Co v Nordenfelt</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpCh/1892/194.html">[1893] 1 Ch 630</a>, 661 (Bowen
LJ). So it is necessary, first, to ask ‘What is the aspect of public policy
which founds the defence?’ and, second, to ask ‘But is there another aspect of
public policy to which the application of the defence would run counter?’”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para77">77.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On the first question, drawing on the judgment of McLachlin J in<i> Hall
v Hebert</i>, Lord Wilson addressed the policy consideration of preserving the
integrity of the legal system and not allowing persons to profit from their
illegal conduct. He concluded that an award of compensation for damage to Miss
Hounga’s feelings was not a form of profit from her employment; it did not
permit evasion of a penalty prescribed by the criminal law; and it did not
compromise the integrity of the legal system. Conversely, he said that
application of the defence could encourage those in the situation of Mrs Allen
to believe that they could discriminate against people like Miss Hounga with
impunity and could thereby compromise the integrity of the legal system. On the
second question, Lord Wilson said that the Court of Appeal’s decision ran
strikingly counter to the public policy against forms of people trafficking and
in favour of the protection of its victims. Weighing the policy considerations,
he concluded that insofar as any public policy existed in favour of applying
the illegality defence, it should give way to the public policy to which its application
would be an affront.</a></p><a name="para77">

</span><i>Hounga v Allen</i> was a case in tort, but Lord Wilson’s approach to
the illegality defence was applied by the Court of Appeal in <i>R (Best) v
Chief Land Registrar</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2015/17.html">[2016] QB 23</a>, where the issue was whether a claim to be
registered under the Land Registration Act 2002 (“LRA”) as the proprietor of a
residential building by adverse possession was barred by illegality. The
circumstances were that part of the relevant period of possession involved the
commission of trespass which constituted a criminal offence under section 144
of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (“LASPOA”).</p>

</span>Sales LJ (with whom McCombe LJ agreed) expressed the view, at para 51,
that the best guidance on the relevant analytical framework was to be found in
Lord Wilson’s judgment (from which he quoted para 42 and the passage which
followed it). Applying that guidance, he examined the public policy
considerations underlying the provisions of the LRA governing acquisition of
title to land and the public policy considerations underlying section 144 of
LASPOA. He concluded that the mischief at which section 144 was aimed was far
removed from the intended operation of the law of adverse possession and that public
policy did not preclude the claim for registration.</a></p><a name="para79">

</span>After <i>Hounga v Allen</i> came the decision of the Supreme Court in <i>Les
Laboratoires Servier v Apotex Inc</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2014/55.html">[2015] AC 430</a>. The issue of illegality
arose in the context of a claim to enforce a cross-undertaking in damages given
as a condition of an interlocutory injunction in proceedings which ultimately
failed. The claim was therefore akin to a claim in contract. The facts were
somewhat complicated but do not matter for present purposes. The court held unanimously
that the Court of Appeal had reached the right result, but the majority of this
court expressed the view, at para 21, that the Court of Appeal’s decision could
not possibly be justified by the considerations put forward by that court,
which had in broad terms followed the approach commended by the Law Commission.
I expressed a different view, at para 62, observing that the Court of Appeal
had adopted a similar approach to that taken by this court in <i>Hounga v Allen</i>.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para81">81.

opinion about the proper approach to the defence illegality between, on the one
hand, a strictly rule-based approach and, on the other hand, a more flexible
approach by which the court would look at the policies underlying the doctrine
and decide whether they militated in favour of the defence, taking into account
a range of potentially relevant factors. The majority did not consider it
necessary to resolve the difference in that case, since it did not affect the
result, but Lord Neuberger said at para 15 that it needed to be addressed as soon
as appropriately possible.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">The law at a crossroads</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para82">82.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In his <i>Restatement of the English Law of Contract</i> (Oxford
University Press, 2016), pp 221-222, Professor Andrew Burrows explained the
difficulty of attempting to state the law in relation to illegality:</a></p><a name="para82">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Leaving aside the law on what one
can loosely label ‘statutory illegality’ [cases where a statute makes a contract
or a contract term unenforceable by either or one party] the law on the effect
of illegality in contract (which one may loosely refer to as ‘the common law of
illegality’) is in a state of flux …</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">Traditionally, two Latin maxims
have often been referred to without greatly illuminating the legal position: ex
turpi causa non oritur actio (‘no action arises from a disgraceful cause’) and
in pari delicto potior est conditio defendentis (‘where both parties are
equally in the wrong the position of the defendant is the stronger’). As
previously understood, illegality in the law of contract - as developed from
those Latin maxims - was governed by a series of rules which tended to
distinguish, for example, between illegality in formation and illegality in performance.
Unfortunately, commentators and courts have found it very difficult to state
those rules with confidence and precision. Hence the textbook treatments not
only differ from each other but are characterised by long-winded attempts to
explain the law. Sharp propositions when offered by the courts or the books
have to be qualified by reference to cases or hypothetical examples that do not
fit those rules; and convincing justifications of those rules have proved
elusive. More recently, therefore, and in line with a similar trend in respect
of illegality as a defence in tort, some courts have favoured greater
flexibility culminating in a ‘range of factors’ approach aimed at achieving a
proportionate response to contractual illegality in preference to the
traditional rule-based approach.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para82"></a><a name="para83">83.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Since the law was at a crossroads, Professor Burrows set out alternative
possible formulations of a “rule-based approach” and a “range of factors
approach”.</a></p><a name="para83">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para83"></a><a name="para84">84.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>One possible version of a rule-based approach, at p 224, which <i>Tinsley
v Milligan</i> and <i>Les Laboratoires Servier v Apotex Inc</i> could be
interpreted as supporting, would be a single master rule based on reliance:</a></p><a name="para84">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“If the formation, purpose or
performance of a contract involves conduct that is illegal (such as a crime) or
contrary to public policy (such as a restraint of trade), a party cannot
enforce the contract if it has to rely on that conduct to establish its claim.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para84"></a><a name="para85">85.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>An alternative rule-based formulation, at p 225, saw the reliance rule
as only one of a number of rules and essentially confined to the creation of
property rights. On this approach a formulation of the rules might be:</a></p><a name="para85">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Rule 1. A contract which has as
its purpose, or is intended to be performed in a manner that involves, conduct
that is illegal (such as a crime) or contrary to public policy (such as a restraint
of trade) is unenforceable (a) by either party if both parties knew of that
purpose or intention; or (b) by one party if only that party knew of that
purpose or intention.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">Rule 2. If rule 1 is inapplicable
because it is only the performance of a contract that involves conduct that is
illegal or contrary to public policy, the contract is unenforceable by the
party who performed in that objectionable way but is enforceable by the other
party unless that party knew of, and participated in, that objectionable
performance.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">Rule 3. Proprietary rights created
by a contract that involves conduct that is illegal or contrary to public
policy will not be recognised unless the claimant can establish the proprietary
rights without reliance on that conduct.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para85"></a><a name="para86">86.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Professor Burrows identified six criticisms of those rules and, more
generally, of a “rule-based” approach to illegality.</a></p><a name="para86">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para86"></a><a name="para87">87.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>First, the difficulty with the <i>Tinsley v Milligan</i> reliance rule,
whether as a master rule or as a rule restricted to cases involving the
assertion of proprietary rights, was that it could produce different results according
to procedural technicality which had nothing to do with the underlying
policies. The decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Collier v Collier</i>
[2002] EWCA 1095; </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2002/1095.html">[2002] BPIR 1057</a> provides a good illustration. A father
granted a lease of property to his daughter to hold on trust for him in order
to deceive creditors. His claim to beneficial title was rejected on the ground
of illegality, because it was held that he needed to rely on the illegal
purpose in order to rebut the presumption of illegality which arose in favour
of the daughter. Mance LJ considered at paras 105-106 what appeared to be the
distinction introduced by <i>Tinsley v Milligan</i> between a beneficial
interest which could be established by “some objectively provable and
apparently neutral fact” and a beneficial interest arising only from an
agreement made for an unlawful purpose. He described the effect as “little more
than cosmetic” where the court was perfectly well aware of the close
involvement of both parties in the illegality. Tempted as he was to adopt a
severely limited view of the meaning of reliance (encouraged by the judgment of
Dawson J in <i>Nelson v Nelson</i>), he rightly did not consider that it was
open to the Court of Appeal on the authorities to do so. He expressed strong
sympathy with the criticisms of the law expressed by the Law Commission, and he
concluded at para 113 that he had no liking for the result which the court was
compelled to reach.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para88">88.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Second, the difficulties with rule 1 were illustrated by the <i>ParkingEye
</i>case. The illegality in that case went to the contract as formed, because
from the outset it was intended to send out to customers a form of letter of
demand which contained some deliberate inaccuracies. The rule as stated did not
permit differentiation between minor and serious illegality or between
peripheral and central illegality. To have deprived ParkingEye of what would
otherwise have been a contractual entitlement to damages of £350,000 would have
been disproportionate. Moreover, as Sir Robin Jacob pointed out in that case, at
paras 33-34, there was something odd about a rule which differentiated
according to whether the intention was formed before or after the contract was
made.</a></p><a name="para88">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para88"></a><a name="para89">89.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Third, as with the criticism of rule 1, the reference in rule 2 to
performance that involved illegal conduct drew no distinction between serious
criminality and relatively minor breach of a statutory regulation.</a></p><a name="para89">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para89"></a><a name="para90">90.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Fourth, although a purported advantage of firm rules is greater
certainty, the cases do not always fit the rules because courts have often
sought ways around them when they do not like the consequence. The flexible
approach would not only produce more acceptable results, but would in practice
be no less certain than the rule-based approach.</a></p><a name="para90">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para90"></a><a name="para91">91.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Fifth, although Lord Mansfield made it clear in <i>Holman v Johnson</i>
that the illegality defence operates as a rule of public policy and is not
designed to achieve justice between the parties, that does not mean that any
result, however arbitrary, is acceptable. The law should strive for the most
desirable policy outcome, and it may be that it is best achieved by taking into
account a range of factors.</a></p><a name="para91">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para91"></a><a name="para92">92.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Sixth, although it may be argued that if there are deficiencies in the
traditional rules, the way forward is to refine the rules to remove the
deficiencies by appropriate exceptions, that task is one which has never been
satisfactorily accomplished. The reason is that there are so many variables,
for example, in seriousness of the illegality, the knowledge and intentions of
the parties, the centrality of the illegality, the effect of denying the
defence and the sanctions which the law already imposes. To reach the best
result in terms of policy, the judges need to have the flexibility to consider
and weigh a range of factors in the light of the facts of the particular case
before them.</a></p><a name="para92">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para92"></a><a name="para93">93.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If a “range of factors” approach were preferred, Professor Burrows
suggested, at pp 229-230, that a possible formulation would read as follows:</a></p><a name="para93">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“If the formation, purpose or
performance of a contract involves conduct that is illegal (such as a crime) or
contrary to public policy (such as a restraint of trade), the contract is
unenforceable by one or either party if to deny enforcement would be an appropriate
response to that conduct, taking into account where relevant -</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how seriously illegal
or contrary to public policy the conduct was;</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whether the party
seeking enforcement knew of, or intended, the conduct;</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how central to the contract
or its performance the conduct was;</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how serious a sanction
the denial of enforcement is for the party seeking enforcement;</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whether denying
enforcement will further the purpose of the rule which the conduct has
infringed;</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whether denying
enforcement will act as a deterrent to conduct that is illegal or contrary to public
policy;</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whether denying enforcement
will ensure that the party seeking enforcement does not profit from the conduct;</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whether denying
enforcement will avoid inconsistency in the law thereby maintaining the integrity
of the legal system.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">Professor Burrows noted that the final factor is capable of
a wider or narrower approach, depending on what one understands by
inconsistency.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para93"></a><a name="para94">94.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The reference to what is an “appropriate response” brings to the surface
the moral dimension underlying the doctrine of illegality, which inevitably
influences the minds of judges and peeps out in their judgments from time to
time. <i>Tinsley v Milligan</i> caused disquiet to Lord Goff and others
precisely because its reasoning jarred with their sense of what was just and
appropriate.</a></p><a name="para94">

<p class="ParaHeading">The way forward</p>

</span>In <i>Yarmouth v France</i> (1887) 19 QBD 647, 653, Lord Esher MR said:</a></p><a name="para95">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“I detest the attempt to fetter
the law by maxims. They are almost invariably misleading: they are for the most
part so large and general in their language that they always include something
which really is not intended to be included in them.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">In <i>Lissenden v C A V Bosch Ltd</i> [1940] AC 412, 435,
Lord Wright quoted Lord Esher’s words and added:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Indeed these general formulae are
found in experience often to distract the court’s mind from the actual exigencies
of the case, and to induce the court to quote them as offering a ready made
solution.”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The maxims <i>ex turpi causa</i> and in pari delicto are no exception.
It is interesting that, according to Professor JK Grodecki, Lord Mansfield
himself was “conscious that if the brocard in pari delicto was to be a
beneficial rule of jurisprudence it should not be allowed to become rigid and
inflexible”: <i>In pari delicto potior est conditio defendentis</i> (1955) 71
LQR 254, 258. Professor Grodecki gave examples including <i>Smith v Bromley</i>
(1760) 2 Doug KB 696n; 99 ER 441 and <i>Walker v Chapman</i> (1773) Lofft 342,
98 ER 684.</a></p><a name="para96">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In <i>Smith v Bromley</i> (the earliest case in which the maxim in pari
delicto appears to have been used) Lord Mansfield granted recovery to the
plaintiff of money paid by the plaintiff to procure her brother’s discharge
from bankruptcy, which was an illegal consideration. As he explained, Lord
Mansfield, at p 698, regarded it as in the public interest that the plaintiff
should be repaid notwithstanding the illegal purpose of the payment:</a></p><a name="para97">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Upon the whole, I am persuaded it
is necessary, for the better support and maintenance of the law, to allow this
action; for no man will venture to take, if he knows he is liable to refund.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para97"></a><a name="para98">98.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In <i>Walker v Chapman</i> the defendant, who was a page to the King,
offered to take a bribe of £50 from the plaintiff in return for securing him a
place in the Customs. The bribe was paid but the plaintiff did not obtain the
appointment and so he sued for the return of his money. It was argued for the
defendant that no action would lie, the plaintiff being party to an iniquitous
contract, and that the law would not suffer a party to “draw justice from a
foul fountain”. Lord Mansfield rejected the defence, distinguishing between a
claim to overturn an illegal contract and a claim to obtain benefit from it.
Later judges have taken a different and stricter approach.</a></p><a name="para98">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para98"></a><a name="para99">99.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Looking behind the maxims, there are two broad discernible policy
reasons for the common law doctrine of illegality as a defence to a civil
claim. One is that a person should not be allowed to profit from his own
wrongdoing. The other, linked, consideration is that the law should be coherent
and not self-defeating, condoning illegality by giving with the left hand what it
takes with the right hand.</a></p><a name="para99">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para99"></a><a name="para100">100.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Goff observed in the Spycatcher case, <i>Attorney General v
Guardian Newspapers Ltd (No 2)</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1988/6.html">[1990] 1 AC 109</a>, 286, that the “statement
that a man shall not be allowed to profit from his own wrong is in very general
terms, and does not of itself provide any sure guidance to the solution of a
problem in any particular case”. In <i>Hall v Hebert</i> [1993] 2 SCR 159
McLachlin J favoured giving a narrow meaning to profit but, more fundamentally,
she expressed the view (at 175-176) that, as a rationale, the statement that a
plaintiff will not be allowed to profit from his or her own wrongdoing does not
fully explain why particular claims have been rejected, and that it may have
the undesirable effect of tempting judges to focus on whether the plaintiff is
“getting something” out of the wrongdoing, rather than on the question whether
allowing recovery for something which was illegal would produce inconsistency
and disharmony in the law, and so cause damage to the integrity of the legal
system.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para101">101.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>That is a valuable insight, with which I agree. I agree also with
Professor Burrows’ observation that this expression leaves open what is meant
by inconsistency (or disharmony) in a particular case, but I do not see this as
a weakness. It is not a matter which can be determined mechanistically. So how
is the court to determine the matter if not by some mechanistic process?&nbsp; In
answer to that question I would say that one cannot judge whether allowing a
claim which is in some way tainted by illegality would be contrary to the
public interest, because it would be harmful to the integrity of the legal
system, without a) considering the underlying purpose of the prohibition which
has been transgressed, b) considering conversely any other relevant public
policies which may be rendered ineffective or less effective by denial of the
claim, and c) keeping in mind the possibility of overkill unless the law is
applied with a due sense of proportionality. We are, after all, in the area of
public policy. That trio of necessary considerations can be found in the case
law.</a></p><a name="para101">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The relevance of taking into account the purpose of the relevant
prohibition is self-evident. The importance of taking account of the relevant
statutory context is illustrated by <i>Hardy v Motor Insurers’ Bureau</i>
[1964] 2 QB 745. The Road Traffic Act 1960 required a motorist to be insured
against the risk of causing death or personal injury through the use of a
vehicle on a road, but a line of authorities established that a contract to
indemnify a person against the consequences of a deliberate criminal act is
unenforceable. The plaintiff, a security officer at a factory, was injured when
he was trying to question the driver of a van, who drove off at speed and
dragged him along the road. The driver was convicted of unlawfully causing
grievous bodily harm. The driver being uninsured, the plaintiff sued the
defendant under an agreement between the defendant and the Minister of
Transport, by which the defendant agreed to satisfy any judgment against a
motorist for a liability required to be covered under a motor insurance policy.
The defendant relied on the maxim <i>ex turpi causa</i>, arguing that a
contract purporting to insure the driver against his own deliberate criminal
conduct would have been unlawful. The defence was rejected. Diplock LJ said at p
767:</a></p><a name="para102">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The rule of law on which the
major premise is based - ex turpi causa non oritur actio - is concerned not
specifically with the lawfulness of contracts but generally with the
enforcement of rights by the courts, whether or not such rights arise under
contract. All that the rule means is that the courts will not enforce a right
which would otherwise be enforceable if the right arises out of an act
committed by the person asserting the right (or by someone who is regarded in
law as his successor) which is regarded by the court as sufficiently
anti-social to justify the court’s refusing to enforce that right.”</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Where issues of illegality are
raised, the courts have (as it seems to me) to steer a middle course between
two unacceptable positions. On the one hand it is unacceptable that any court
of law should aid or lend its authority to a party seeking to pursue or enforce
an object or agreement which the law prohibits. On the other hand, it is
unacceptable that the court should, on the first indication of unlawfulness
affecting any aspect of a transaction, draw up its skirts and refuse all
assistance to the plaintiff, no matter how serious his loss nor how
disproportionate his loss to the unlawfulness of his conduct.”</p>

</span>In considering whether it would be disproportionate to refuse relief to
which the claimant would otherwise be entitled, as a matter of public policy,
various factors may be relevant. Professor Burrows’ list is helpful but I would
not attempt to lay down a prescriptive or definitive list because of the
infinite possible variety of cases. Potentially relevant factors include the
seriousness of the conduct, its centrality to the contract, whether it was
intentional and whether there was marked disparity in the parties’ respective
culpability.</a></p><a name="para107">

</span>The integrity and harmony of the law permit - and I would say require -
such flexibility. Part of the harmony of the law is its division of
responsibility between the criminal and civil courts and tribunals. Punishment
for wrongdoing is the responsibility of the criminal courts and, in some
instances, statutory regulators. It should also be noted that under the
Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 the state has wide powers to confiscate proceeds of
crime, whether on a conviction or without a conviction. Punishment is not
generally the function of the civil courts, which are concerned with
determining private rights and obligations. The broad principle is not in doubt
that the public interest requires that the civil courts should not undermine
the effectiveness of the criminal law; but nor should they impose what would
amount in substance to an additional penalty disproportionate to the nature and
seriousness of any wrongdoing. <i>ParkingEye</i> is a good example of a case
where denial of claim would have been disproportionate. The claimant did not
set out to break the law. If it had realised that the letters which it was proposing
to send were legally objectionable, the text would have been changed. The
illegality did not affect the main performance of the contract. Denial of the
claim would have given the defendant a very substantial unjust reward. Respect
for the integrity of the justice system is not enhanced if it appears to
produce results which are arbitrary, unjust or disproportionate.</a></p><a name="para108">

</span>The courts must obviously abide by the terms of any statute, but I
conclude that it is right for a court which is considering the application of
the common law doctrine of illegality to have regard to the policy factors
involved and to the nature and circumstances of the illegal conduct in
determining whether the public interest in preserving the integrity of the
justice system should result in denial of the relief claimed. I put it in that
way rather than whether the contract should be regarded as tainted by
illegality, because the question is whether the relief claimed should be
granted.</a></p><a name="para109">

</span>I agree with the criticisms made in <i>Nelson v Nelson</i> and by
academic commentators of the reliance rule as laid down in <i>Bowmakers</i> and
<i>Tinsley v Milligan</i>, and I would hold that it should no longer be
followed. Unless a statute provides otherwise (expressly or by necessary
implication), property can pass under a transaction which is illegal as a
contract: <i>Singh v Ali</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKPC/1959/1959_29.html">[1960] AC 167</a>, 176, and <i>Sharma v Simposh Ltd</i>
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2011/1383.html">[2013] Ch 23</a>, paras 27-44. There may be circumstances in which a court will
refuse to lend its assistance to an owner to enforce his title as, for example,
where to do so would be to assist the claimant in a drug trafficking operation,
but the outcome should not depend on a procedural question.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In <i>Bowmakers</i> [1945] 1 KB 65 the claim was for conversion of goods
which had been obtained by the plaintiffs and supplied to the defendant under
transactions which were assumed to be tainted by illegality. The Court of
Appeal rightly said, at p 71, that “a man’s right to possess his own chattels
will as a general rule be enforced against one who, without any claim of right,
is detaining them or has converted them to his own use, even though it may
appear either from the pleadings, or in the course of the trial, that the
chattels in question came into the defendant’s possession by reason of an illegal
contract between himself and the plaintiff”, but it added the qualifying words
“provided that the plaintiff does not seek, and is not forced, either to found
his claim on the illegal contract or to plead its illegality in order to
support his claim”. The objections to the proviso have already been identified.
It makes the question whether the court will refuse its assistance to the
claimant to enforce his title to his property depend on a procedural question
and it has led to uncertain case law about what constitutes reliance. The court
ended its judgment, at p 72, by saying:</a></p><a name="para111">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“We are satisfied that no rule of
law, and no considerations of public policy, compel the court to dismiss the
plaintiffs’ claim in the case before us, and to do so would be, in our opinion,
a manifest injustice.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">That conclusion, rather than the answer to a procedural
question, should have been the end of the illegality defence, since it is based
on public policy.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Critics of the “range of factors” approach say that it would create
unacceptable uncertainty. I would make three points in reply. First, one of the
principal criticisms of the law has been its uncertainty and unpredictability. Doctrinally
it is riven with uncertainties: see, for example, paras 4-8 above. There is
also uncertainty how a court will in practice steer its way in order to reach
what appears to be a just and reasonable result.&nbsp; Second, I am not aware of
evidence that uncertainty has been a source of serious problems in those
jurisdictions which have taken a relatively flexible approach. Third, there are
areas in which certainty is particularly important. Ordinary citizens and
businesses enter into all sorts of everyday lawful activities which are
governed by well understood rules of law. Lord Mansfield said in <i>Vallejo v
Wheeler</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1774/102.pdf">(1774) 1 Cowp 143</a>, 153:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In all mercantile transactions
the great object should be certainty: and therefore, it is of more consequence
that a rule should be certain, than whether the rule is established one way or
the other. Because speculators in trade then know what ground to go upon.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">The same considerations do not apply in the same way to
people contemplating unlawful activity. When he came to decide cases involving
illegality, Lord Mansfield acted in accordance with his judgment about where
the public interest lay: see paras 96-98.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para114">114.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In <i>Tinsley v Milligan</i> Lord Goff considered that if the law was to
move in a more flexible direction, to which he was not opposed in principle,
there should be a full investigation by the Law Commission (which has happened)
and that any reform should be through legislation. Realistically, the prospect
of legislation can be ignored. The government declined to take forward the
Commission’s bill on trusts because it was not seen to be “a pressing priority
for government” (a phrase familiar to the Commission), and there is no reason
for optimism that it would take a different view if presented with a wider
bill. In <i>Clayton v The Queen</i> </a><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/2006/58.html">(2006) 231 ALR 500</a>, para 119, Kirby J said
that waiting for a modern Parliament to grapple with issues of law reform is
like “waiting for the Greek Kalends. It will not happen” and that “Eventually
courts must accept this and shoulder their own responsibility for the state of
the common law”. The responsibility of the courts for dealing with defects in
the common law was recently emphasised by this court in <i>R v Jogee</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKPC/2016/7.html">[2016] 2 WLR 681</a>, para 85, and <i>Knauer v Ministry of Justice</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2016/9.html">[2016] 2 WLR 672</a>,
para 26. In each of those cases the court decided that it should depart from
previous decisions of the House of Lords. That is never a step taken lightly.
In departing from <i>Tinsley v Milligan</i> it is material that it has been
widely criticised; that people cannot be said to have entered into lawful
transactions in reliance on the law as then stated; and, most fundamentally,
that the criticisms are well founded.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the present case I would endorse the approach and conclusion of
Gloster LJ. She correctly asked herself whether the policy underlying the rule
which made the contract between Mr Patel and Mr Mirza illegal would be
stultified if Mr Patel’s claim in unjust enrichment were allowed. After
examining the policy underlying the statutory provisions about insider dealing,
she concluded that there was no logical basis why considerations of public
policy should require Mr Patel to forfeit the moneys which he paid into Mr
Mirza’s account, and which were never used for the purpose for which they were
paid. She said that such a result would not be a just and proportionate
response to the illegality. I agree. It seems likely that Lord Mansfield would
also have agreed: see <i>Walker v Chapman</i>. Mr Patel is seeking to unwind
the arrangement, not to profit from it.</a></p><a name="para115">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is not necessary to discuss the question of locus poenitentiae which
troubled the courts below, as it has troubled other courts, because it assumed
importance only because of a wrong approach to the issue whether Mr Patel was
prima facie entitled to the recovery of his money. In place of the basic rule and
limited exceptions to which I referred at para 44 above, I would hold that a
person who satisfies the ordinary requirements of a claim in unjust enrichment
will not prima facie be debarred from recovering money paid or property
transferred by reason of the fact that the consideration which has failed was
an unlawful consideration. I do not exclude the possibility that there may be
particular reason for the court to refuse its assistance to the claimant, applying
the kind of exercise which Gloster LJ applied in this case, just as there may
be a particular reason for the court to refuse to assist an owner to enforce
his title to property, but such cases are likely to be rare. (At para 110 I
gave the example of a drug trafficker.) In <i>Tappenden v Randall</i> (1801) 2
Bos &amp; Pul 467, 471, 126 ER 1388, 1390, a case of a successful claim for the
repayment of money paid for an unenforceable consideration which failed, Heath
J said obiter that there might be “cases where the contract may be of a nature
too grossly immoral for the court to enter into any discussion of it: as where
one man has paid money by way of hire to another to murder a third person”. The
case was mentioned by the Law Commission (LCCP 189, para 4.53), but there is a
dearth of later case law on the point. This is hardly surprising because a
person who takes out a contract on the life of a third person is not likely to
advertise his guilt by suing. But as a matter of legal analysis it is
sufficient for present purposes to identify the framework within which such an
issue may be decided. No particular reason has been advanced in this case to
justify Mr Mirza’s retention of the monies beyond the fact that it was paid to
him for the unlawful purpose of placing an insider bet.</a></p><a name="para116">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In support of his argument that this purpose was sufficient to
disentitle Mr Patel from obtaining the return of his money, Mr Collings relied
on cases such as <i>Parkinson v College of Ambulance Ltd</i> [1925] 2 KB 1. In
that case the plaintiff made a donation to a charity to secure a knighthood.
When the honour failed to materialise he sued for the return of his money. The
claim was rejected.</a></p><a name="para117">

</span>Bribes of all kinds are odious and corrupting, but it does not follow
that it is in the public interest to prevent their repayment. There are two
sides to the equation. If today it transpired that a bribe had been paid to a
political party, a charity or a holder of public office, it might be regarded
it as more repugnant to the public interest that the recipient should keep it
than that it should be returned. We are not directly concerned with such a case
but I refer to it because of the reliance placed on that line of authorities.</a></p><a name="para118">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The essential rationale of the illegality doctrine is that it would be
contrary to the public interest to enforce a claim if to do so would be harmful
to the integrity of the legal system (or, possibly, certain aspects of public
morality, the boundaries of which have never been made entirely clear and which
do not arise for consideration in this case). In assessing whether the public
interest would be harmed in that way, it is necessary a) to consider the
underlying purpose of the prohibition which has been transgressed and whether
that purpose will be enhanced by denial of the claim, b) to consider any other
relevant public policy on which the denial of the claim may have an impact and
c) to consider whether denial of the claim would be a proportionate response to
the illegality, bearing in mind that punishment is a matter for the criminal
courts. Within that framework, various factors may be relevant, but it would be
a mistake to suggest that the court is free to decide a case in an undisciplined
way. The public interest is best served by a principled and transparent
assessment of the considerations identified, rather by than the application of
a formal approach capable of producing results which may appear arbitrary,
unjust or disproportionate.</a></p><a name="para120">

</span>A claimant, such as Mr Patel, who satisfies the ordinary requirements of
a claim for unjust enrichment, should not be debarred from enforcing his claim
by reason only of the fact that the money which he seeks to recover was paid
for an unlawful purpose. There may be rare cases where for some particular
reason the enforcement of such a claim might be regarded as undermining the
integrity of the justice system, but there are no such circumstances in this
case. I would dismiss the appeal.</a></p><a name="para121">

</span>The approach commended by Lord Toulson does not involve engaging with
“an open and unsettled range of factors” - Lord Mance at para 192 of his
judgment. On the contrary, as I see it, Lord Toulson’s judgment outlines a
structured approach to a hitherto intractable problem. It is an approach,
moreover, which, if properly applied, will promote, rather than detract from,
consistency in the law. And it has the added advantage of avoiding the need to
devise piecemeal and contrived exceptions to previous formulations of the
illegality rule.</a></p><a name="para123">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Central to Lord Toulson’s analysis is the “trio of considerations” which
he identified in para 101 of his judgment. The first of these involves an
examination of the underlying purpose of the “prohibition which has been
transgressed”. By this, I understand Lord Toulson to mean the reasons that a
claimant’s conduct should operate to bar him or her from a remedy which would
otherwise be available. That such reasons should be subject to scrutiny is
surely unexceptionable. Whether in order to preserve “the integrity of the
legal system” (<i>per</i> McLachlin J in <i>Hall v Hebert </i>[1993] 2 SCR 159
at 169) or to allow a proper understanding of the true nature of the public
policy imperative for recognising a defence of illegality, the purpose of the
denial of a remedy to which the claimant would otherwise be entitled should be
clearly understood.</a></p><a name="para124">

</span>As it happens, McLachlin J disagreed with Cory J’s suggestion that the
doctrine of <i>ex turpi causa non oritur actio </i>should be replaced with a
power vested in the courts to reject claims on “considerations of public
policy” - p 168. But what is the preservation of the integrity of the legal
system, if not a public policy consideration? Moreover, the underpinning of the
preservation of that integrity (which McLachlin J said was that a person in a
civil suit should not be permitted “to profit from illegal or wrongful conduct”
or to benefit from “an evasion or rebate of a penalty prescribed by the
criminal law”) is <i>par excellence</i> a public policy consideration. And
McLachlin J seemed to acknowledge as much when she said (at p 169) that the
principle could be described “by an old-fashioned Latin name or by the
currently fashionable concept of ‘public policy’”.</a></p><a name="para125">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is doubtful that a public policy consideration in the context of the
defence of illegality could now be properly described as a “currently
fashionable” concept. Indeed, in a number of cases that I will refer to briefly
below, the maxim <i>ex turpi causa </i>has been recognised in this country as
an <i>expression of policy</i>, rather than a principle. And in Canada it
appears to be accepted that the weighing of public policies is the proper
approach to take in order to determine whether a defence of illegality should
be allowed to prevail. In <i>Still v Minister of National Revenue </i>(1997)
154 DLR (4th) 229 (which is discussed by Lord Toulson in paras 58 <i>et seq </i>of
his judgment) the Federal Court of Appeal considered that the doctrine of
illegality now “rests on the understanding that it would be <i>contrary to
public policy </i>to allow a person to maintain an action on a contract prohibited
by statute” (emphasis supplied). On that basis, Robertson JA, who delivered the
judgment of the court, said that it was necessary to identify the policy
considerations which outweighed the applicant’s right to a remedy. Although
this was said in relation to competing policy goals in two items of
legislation, there is no reason not to adopt the same approach in evaluating
rival policy considerations in the non-statutory context.</a></p><a name="para126">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To take this case as an example, why should Mr Mirza’s wrongful
retention of Mr Patel’s money not be weighed against the undoubted illegality
on the part of Mr Patel in entering an agreement to wrongly benefit from Mr
Mirza’s claimed ability to obtain access to insider information?<i> </i>If one
concentrates on the illegal nature of the contract to the exclusion of other
considerations, an incongruous result in legal and moral terms may be produced.
This can be avoided by taking into account and giving due weight to the second
and third of Lord Toulson’s considerations <i>viz </i>countervailing public
policies which would be wrongly discounted by denial of the claim and the
proportionality of refusing to acknowledge its legitimacy.</a></p><a name="para127">

</span>It is, of course, possible to reach the same outcome that a weighing of
the competing policy considerations produces by treating this case as one of
unjust enrichment which warranted returning the parties to the position that
they occupied before the transaction. This is on the basis that the court is
not required to give effect to the illegal contract in order to find that Mr
Mirza should not be allowed to retain Mr Patel’s money. It would “simply return
the parties to the status quo ante where they should always have been.” - Lord Sumption
at para 268. That seems to me, however, to be a much more adventitious and less
satisfactory route to the proper disposal of the case than that represented by
a rounded assessment of the various public policy considerations at stake.</a></p><a name="para128">

</span>Moreover, if the <i>ex turpi causa</i> axiom is itself no more than an
expression of policy, the taking into account of countervailing policy
considerations, in order to decide whether to give effect to it in a particular
instance, is the only logical way to proceed. That it is, in truth, a policy
based rule has been clearly recognised. In <i>Gray v Thames Trains Ltd </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2009/33.html">[2009] UKHL 33</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2009/33.html">[2009] AC 1339</a>, para 30, Lord Hoffmann said that the maxim expressed,
“not so much a principle as a policy” and that it did not have a single basis
of justification but was rather based on “a group of reasons which vary in
different situations”. And in <i>Stone and Rolls Ltd v Moore Stephens</i>
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2009/39.html">[2009] UKHL 39</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2009/39.html">[2009] AC 1391</a>, para 25 Lord Phillips expressly endorsed what
Lord Hoffmann had said about the public policy nature of <i>ex turpi causa</i>,
observing that it was necessary to consider the policy underlying it, in order
to decide whether the defence of illegality was bound to defeat a claim.</p>

justified by one or more of the rationales underlying it existence, Etherton LJ
said, at para 73:</p>

illegality defence is not aimed at achieving a just result between the parties.

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Sumption has said in para 262(iii) of his judgment in this case
that this court in <i>Les Laboratoires Servier </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2014/55.html">[2015] AC 430</a> had overruled
the view expressed by the Court of Appeal that “an illegal act might
nevertheless<i> </i>found a cause of action if it was not as wicked as all
that”. That may be so, but I do not understand the judgment of this court in <i>Les
Laboratoires Servier</i> to have expressly rejected the notion that whether the
defence should be available depends on an examination of the policy
considerations which underlie it in any particular instance and those which
militate against it. At para 61 of his judgment in <i>Les Laboratoires Servier</i>
Lord Toulson quoted with approval the statement of Lord Wilson in <i>Hounga v
Allen </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2014/47.html">[2014] 1 WLR 2889</a> at para 42 to the effect that, in considering
whether to allow a defence of illegality, “it is necessary, first, to ask ‘What
is the aspect of public policy which founds the defence?’ and, second, to ask
‘But is there another aspect of public policy to which application of the
defence would run counter?’” The decision in <i>Hounga </i>was not mentioned in
the judgment of the majority in <i>Les Laboratoires Servier</i>.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para132">132.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Sumption did refer to <i>Hounga</i>, however, in the later case of <i>Bilta
(UK) Ltd</i> <i>v Nazir (No 2) </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/23.html">[2016] AC 1</a>. He sought to explain the
decision in <i>Hounga </i>on<i> </i>the<i> </i>basis<i> </i>that Ms Hounga did
not rely, and did not need to rely, on the circumstances in which she had
entered the United Kingdom (she had entered illegally). This is correct but she
<i>did </i>need to rely on the fact of her employment in advancing a claim for
unlawful discrimination in her dismissal from that employment. Since the
employment was not legally sanctioned, she was therefore confronted with the
illegality defence and, indeed, the Court of Appeal had held that the
illegality of the contract of employment formed a material part of Ms Hounga’s
complaint and that to uphold it would be to condone the illegality. It was held
in <i>Hounga </i>that the appellant’s claim was not inextricably linked to her
illegal conduct. On that account her action could not be defeated on the basis
that her contract of employment was illegal. But Lord Wilson’s discussion of
the manner in which competing public policy considerations should be viewed, in
calculating whether a defence of illegality should be permitted to defeat an
otherwise viable claim, unquestionably forms part of the ratio of the decision.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The way is now open for this court to make its choice between, on the
one hand, cleaving to the rule-based approach exemplified by <i>Tinsley v
Milligan</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1993/3.html">[1994] 1 AC 340</a> and, arguably, the decision of the majority in <i>Les
Laboratoires Servier, </i>and, on the other, a more flexible approach, taking
into account the policy considerations that are said to favour recognising the
defence of illegality, those which militate against such recognition and the
proportionality of allowing the defence to prevail. In <i>Bilta (UK) Ltd</i>
Lord Neuberger said that the proper approach to the defence of illegality
needed to be addressed by this court “as soon as appropriately possible” - para
15. This case unmistakably presents us with the opportunity to address the question
and for the reasons given by Lord Toulson, I believe that the approach which he
commends is plainly to be preferred.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para134">134.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A rule-based approach to the question of the effect of illegality on the
availability of a remedy has failed to deliver on what some have claimed to be
its principal virtues <i>viz </i>ease of application and predictability of
outcome. This case exemplifies the point. There was a sharp but perfectly
respectable difference of view in the judgments of the Court of Appeal as to
whether the necessary ingredient of reliance on the illegal aspect of the
agreement between Mr Mirza and Mr Patel was present. This is hardly surprising.
In many situations in which transactions between parties are tainted by some
form of illegality, it is not always easy to decide what it is that needs to be
relied on when an unravelling of those transactions or some means of dealing
with their failure is sought.</a></p><a name="para134">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para134"></a><a name="para135">135.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On the question of unravelling or unpicking an agreement, I do not
consider that <i>Tinsley</i> is an example of the court conducting an
unravelling exercise or of its returning the parties to the <i>status quo ante</i>.
This much is clear from the speech of Lord Browne-Wilkinson at 376F of the
report:</a></p><a name="para135">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… Miss Milligan established a
resulting trust by showing that she had contributed to the purchase price of
the house and that there was common understanding between her and Miss Tinsley
that they owned the house equally. She had no need to allege or prove <i>why</i>
the house was conveyed into the name of Miss Tinsley alone, since that fact was
irrelevant to her claim: it was enough to show that the house was in fact
vested in Miss Tinsley alone. The illegality only emerged at all because Miss
Tinsley sought to raise it. Having proved these facts, Miss Milligan had raised
a presumption of resulting trust. There was no evidence to rebut that
presumption. Therefore, Miss Milligan should succeed.” (original emphasis)</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para135"></a><a name="para136">136.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In effect, in <i>Tinsley </i>the majority <i>gave effect </i>to rather
than unravelled the illegal agreement made between the parties. The agreement
was that the ownership of the house should be shared equally between Miss
Milligan and Miss Tinsley, and that they should represent to the Department of
Social Security that it was owned solely by Miss Tinsley. It was because Miss
Milligan did not need to rely on the illegal component of the agreement (that
they make the false representation to the department) that she was able to
succeed. This was not, therefore, a case of unravelling the agreement or
restoring the parties to the <i>status quo ante. </i>To the contrary, it was an
instance of segregating the illegal part of the agreement from that which, it
was considered, could be enforced. Reference to or reliance on the
objectionable part could thereby be avoided. To claim that such a contrivance
produces a predictable, much less a certain, outcome, for such arrangements is,
I believe, extremely far-fetched.</a></p><a name="para136">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para136"></a><a name="para137">137.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Even if the claim to predictability of outcome for the reliance test
could be made good, however, it is questionable whether particular weight should
be given to this consideration in circumstances where a claimant and defendant
have been parties to an agreement which is plainly illegal. Certainty or
predictability of outcome may be a laudable aim for those who seek the law’s
resolution of genuine, honest disputes. It is not a premium to which those
engaged in disreputable conduct can claim automatic entitlement. For the
reasons I have given, however, I do not believe that outcomes are easier to
forecast on a rule-based approach.</a></p><a name="para137">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para137"></a><a name="para138">138.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Quite apart from the difficulty in predicting whether a claimant has to
rely on the illegal dimension of an agreement in order to advance his claim,
there is something unattractive and contrived about the means by which attempts
have to be made in order to avoid the spectre of reliance. Professor Burrows in
his <i>Restatement of the English Law of Contract </i>(Oxford University Press)
outlined what he described as his single reliance master rule at p 224 in this
way:</a></p><a name="para138">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“If the formation, purpose or
performance of a contract involves conduct that is illegal (such as a crime) or
contrary to public policy (such as a restraint of trade), a party cannot
enforce the contract if it has to rely on that conduct to establish its claim.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para138"></a><a name="para139">139.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In this case the formation of the contract, its purpose and its
performance <i>all </i>involved illegality. Under the single reliance master
rule, it is said that all of this can be ignored because it is not necessary to
rely on the terms of the agreement, other than to demonstrate that there was no
legal basis for the payment of the money to Mr Mirza. So, the looming presence
of illegality does not require to be confronted at all. The issue is
side-stepped and avoided. This cannot be the correct way in which to deal with
the impact of illegality - in fact, under this approach, illegality is not
addressed at all. It is surely better and more principled to examine why
illegality should or should not operate to deny Mr Patel a remedy.</a></p><a name="para139">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para139"></a><a name="para140">140.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Returning the parties to the status quo ante likewise side-steps the
issue of illegality. This approach proceeds on the basis that the transaction
should simply never have taken place or that the parties should be returned to
the condition that they ought always to have occupied. The contract is unpicked
because it should not have been made. Mr Mirza is deprived of the money because
it is unjust enrichment. No examination of the effect that the illegality has
is warranted; recognition that there has been unjust enrichment is all that is
required.</a></p><a name="para140">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para140"></a><a name="para141">141.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This is objectionable not only because it effectively ignores the
illegality that surrounded the making of the contract but also because it
produces an inconsistent result with that which is founded on a breach of
contract claim. This leads to what Professor Peter Birks, in an article
entitled, <i>“Recovering Value Transferred under an Illegal Contract” </i>(2000)
1 TIL 155,<i> </i>describes as self-stultification. Entitlement to restitution
of money paid on foot of an illegal contract on the basis of unjust enrichment
makes a nonsense, he says, of refusal to enforce the contract and, at p 160, it
is “important that the law as stated in one area should not make nonsense of
the law as stated in another”.</a></p><a name="para141">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para141"></a><a name="para142">142.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Self-stultification can be avoided by adoption of the approach suggested
by Lord Toulson. His mode of analysis requires examination of the justification
for the defence of illegality in whatever context it arises, not a decision to
circumvent the defence because of the type of remedy that is claimed. That
appears to me to be a much more principled approach than one which avoids
having to engage with the merits of the defence at all. Not having to engage
with the merits on the basis that one does not have to rely on the illegality
is a matter of fortuity. Because of that incidental circumstance an avenue to
an equivalent outcome to that which would result from enforcement of the
contract opens up. An examination of the impact of the illegality becomes
irrelevant. That this should be a matter of happenstance is deeply unsatisfactory.</a></p><a name="para142">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para142"></a><a name="para143">143.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Toulson’s solution to this question also permits readier access to
investigation of the traditional justifications for the <i>ex turpi causa </i>maxim
- preservation of the integrity of the legal system and preventing profit from
wrongdoing. If, on examination of the particular circumstances of the case,
these can be shown to weigh heavily in the balance, it is more likely that the
defence will be upheld. Carving out an exception to the application of the
defence on the basis that it does not affect a claim for unjust enrichment
where the illegality of the claimant does not require to be relied on does
nothing to directly protect or uphold these values.</a></p><a name="para143">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para143"></a><a name="para144">144.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For these reasons and those given by Lord Toulson, I would dismiss the
appeal.</a></p><a name="para144">

<p class="NewSpeech">LORD NEUBERGER:</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para144"></a><a name="para145">145.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The present appeal concerns a claim for the return of money paid by the
claimant to the defendant pursuant to a contract to carry out an illegal
activity, and the illegal activity is not in the event proceeded with owing to
matters beyond the control of either party.</a></p><a name="para145">

<p class="ParaHeading">The specific issue on this appeal</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para145"></a><a name="para146">146.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In such a case, the general rule should in my view be that the claimant
is entitled to the return of the money which he has paid. In the first place,
such a rule (“the Rule”) is consistent with the law as laid down in the 18th
century by two eminent judges, one of whom is regarded as the founder of many
aspects of the common law, including illegality; in addition it has support
from some more modern cases. Secondly, the Rule appears to me to accord with
policy, which is particularly important when illegality arises in the context
of a civil claim. Thirdly, the Rule renders the outcome in cases in one area of
a very difficult topic, that of contracts involving illegality, and the maxim <i>ex
turpi causa non oritur actio </i>(ie that no claim can be based on an illegal
or immoral arrangement), relatively clear and certain.</a></p><a name="para146">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para146"></a><a name="para147">147.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I turn first to the authorities. In <i>Smith v Bromley </i>(1760) 2 Doug
KB 696n, the Court of King’s Bench permitted a plaintiff to recover money she
had paid to someone who had agreed to procure her brother’s discharge from
bankruptcy, which was an illegal consideration. Lord Mansfield CJ said at p 698
in the course of his judgment that, although the payment had been made for an
illegal purpose:</a></p><a name="para147">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Upon the whole, I am persuaded it
is necessary, for the better support and maintenance of the law, to allow this
action; for no man will venture to take, if he knows he is liable to refund.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Lord Mansfield subsequently followed this approach in <i>Walker
v Chapman </i>(1773) Lofft 342, where a bribe to the defendant to secure a job
for the plaintiff in Government service was held recoverable, in circumstances
where the job was not in fact obtained.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para147"></a><a name="para148">148.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In <i>Neville v Wilkinson</i> </a><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1782/117.pdf">(1782) 1 Bro CC 543</a>, 547 Lord Thurlow LC
approved this approach, and “declared his opinion” that:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“[I]n all cases where money was
paid for an unlawful purpose, the party, though <em>particeps criminis</em>,
might recover at law; and that the reason was, that if courts of justice mean
to prevent the perpetration of crimes, it must be not by allowing a man who has
got possession to remain in possession, but by putting the parties back to the state
in which they were before.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para149">149.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the following century, the same approach was adopted in <i>Taylor v
Bowers </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpKQB/1876/29.html">(1876) 1 QBD 291</a> (which involved transfer of goods rather than of
cash). Cockburn CJ said at first instance at p 295 that it was “well
established” that “where money has been paid, or goods delivered, under an
unlawful agreement, but there has been no further performance of it”, then “the
party paying the money or delivering the goods may repudiate the transaction,
and recover back his money or goods”. The Court of Appeal agreed, and at p 300
Mellish LJ, with whom Baggallay JA and Grove J agreed, said this:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“To hold that the plaintiff is
enabled to recover does not carry out the illegal transaction, but the effect
is to put everybody in the same situation as they were before the illegal
transaction was determined upon, and before the parties took any steps to carry
it out ...”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">It is true that the actual decision in that case can be
justified on the ground that property in the goods concerned had never passed
(which was the basis of James LJ’s judgment), but it seems to me that the
reasoning of Mellish LJ, like that of Cockburn CJ, reflects the proposition
found in the 18th century judgments I have quoted.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para150">150.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is also fair to say that Fry LJ doubted the correctness of Mellish
LJ’s dictum in <i>Kearley v Thomson </i>(1890) 24 QBD 742, 746, and that in
some subsequent cases the principle has not been applied. An obvious example is
<i>Parkinson v College of Ambulance </i>[1925] 2 KB 1, where a donor was held
to be disentitled from recovering a gift to a charity obtained by the charity’s
illegal (and dishonest) promise to obtain an honour for the donor. I consider
that that case was wrongly decided. It seems to me that the judgment in that
case got close to representing what Bingham LJ described as the court “on the
first indication of unlawfulness affecting any aspect of a transaction,
draw[ing] up its skirts and refus[ing] all assistance to the plaintiff, no
matter how serious his loss nor how disproportionate his loss to the
unlawfulness of his conduct” (which he considered to be “unacceptable”) - <i>Saunders
v Edwards</i> [1987] 1 WLR 1116, 1134. I agree with the view that the decision
in <i>Parkinson </i>represented “a new and regrettable extension of the scope
of the maxim” of <i>ex turpi causa </i>(to quote from Professor Grodecki’s
article (1955) 71 LQR 254, 263), and I consider that it should be overruled.</a></p><a name="para150">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para150"></a><a name="para151">151.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Rule also derives some support from the Court of Appeal’s decision
in <i>Tribe v Tribe </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1995/20.html">[1996] Ch 107</a>, where the plaintiff was held to be
entitled to recover shares which he had transferred to his son in order
deceptively to improve his negotiating position in relation to an anticipated
claim by his landlord, which in the event did not materialise. The question for
the Court of Appeal was whether, following the controversial decision of the
House of Lords in <i>Tinsley v Milligan </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1993/3.html">[1994] 1 AC 340</a> (the details of
which are set out in paras 17-19 above), the father could “rebut the
presumption of advancement by giving evidence of his illegal purpose”, to quote
from Millett LJ’s judgment at pp 129H-130A. It was held that he could, on the
basis that “[t]he transferor can lead evidence of the illegal purpose whenever
it is necessary for him to do so provided that he has withdrawn from the
transaction before the illegal purpose has been wholly or partly carried into
effect” - per Millett LJ at pp 134G-H.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para152">152.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There is some support in the cases for the notion that different
considerations should apply depending whether the claimant’s claim for return
of money or property paid pursuant to an unperformed illegal contract is based
on a common law claim or a claim in equity (compare the Privy Council decisions
in <i>Singh v Ali </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKPC/1959/1959_29.html">[1960] AC 167</a><i> </i>and <i>Chettiar v Chettiar </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKPC/1962/1962_4.html">[1962] AC 294</a>). I do not consider that such a distinction is appropriate (and it may
be that in that connection I differ from Millett LJ in <i>Tribe </i>at p 129G -
although see at p 130E). I agree with Lord Browne-Wilkinson’s observation in <i>Tinsley
</i>at p 371, where he said that “[i]f the law is that a party is entitled to
enforce a property right acquired under an illegal transaction, … the same rule
ought to apply to any property right so acquired, whether such right is legal
or equitable”.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para153">153.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>That proposition is supported, as I see it, by the second reason
supporting the Rule, namely policy. As Millett LJ said in <i>Tribe </i>at p 133F,
“the justification for this rule [which precludes the court from lending its
assistance to a man who founds his cause of action on an illegal or immoral
act] is not a principle of justice but a principle of policy”, citing Lord
Mansfield in <i>Holman v Johnson </i></a><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1775/58.pdf"></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1775/58.html">(1775) 1 Cowp 341</a>, 343. That approach is
also supported by Lord Hoffmann in <i>Gray v Thames Trains Ltd </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2009/33.html">[2009] AC 1339</a>, para 30, where he went on to say that the “policy is not based upon a
single justification but on a group of reasons, which vary in different
situations”. Similarly, in <i>Bakewell Management Ltd v Brandwood</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2004/14.html">[2004] 2 AC 519</a>, para 60, Lord Walker said that “<a name="para60">the maxim <i>ex turpi
causa</i> must be applied as an instrument of public policy, and not in
circumstances where it does not serve any public interest</a>”.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para154">154.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>More broadly, it appears to me that policy supports the Rule, in part
for the simple reasons given in the passages cited in para 147 above. Further,
as Lord Mance points out, there is obvious attraction in the notion that, if
all transfers made pursuant to an unexecuted illegal contract are
re-transferred, then the parties are back in the position that they were, ie as
if there had been no illegal contract, which again would seem to comply with
policy.</a></p><a name="para154">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para154"></a><a name="para155">155.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It also appears to me that the Rule is consistent with the approach
adopted in McLachlin J’s analysis in the Canadian Supreme Court case <i>Hall v
Hebert </i>[1993] 2 SCR 159, 176. She explained that the basic justification
for refusing relief to a plaintiff who relied on an illegal contract was that
“to allow recovery … would be to allow recovery for what is illegal. It would
put the courts in the position of saying that the same conduct is both legal,
in the sense of being capable of rectification by the court, and illegal. It
would, in short, introduce an inconsistency in the law”. Later at pp 179-180,
she suggested that the court’s “power” to refuse relief in a claim where
illegality is involved “is a limited one” and that the use of the power “is
justified where allowing the plaintiff’s claim would introduce inconsistency
into the fabric of the law, either by permitting the plaintiff to profit from
an illegal or wrongful act, or to evade a penalty prescribed by criminal law”.
This approach (which is more fully analysed by Lord Mance) finds an echo in
Lord Rodger’s observation in <i>Gray</i>, para 82,<i> </i>that “the civil court
should cleave to the same policy as the criminal court”.</a></p><a name="para155">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para155"></a><a name="para156">156.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For some time, it was assumed that the Rule could be invoked not merely
when the anticipated illegal purpose not been proceeded with at all, but with
the super-added requirement that it had not done so because of the “repentance”
of the plaintiff who was seeking to get his money back. Like Millett LJ in <i>Tribe
</i>at p 135D-E, I would reject that notion. As he said, “[j]ustice is not a
reward for merit”, and in any event the notion that repentance is needed “could
lead to bizarre results”. Further, a claimant’s repentance may be born of, or
combined with, self-interest, in which case, if repentance is the essential
factor, the court would face a real difficulty. In my opinion, the notion that
the application of a rule should depend on whether or not the claimant has
repented typifies the inappropriately moralistic approach of some courts when
they have to deal with claims based in some way on illegality, which was
rightly criticised by Bingham LJ in <i>Saunders </i>[1987] 1 WLR 1116, 1134.
Rather, the courts should adopt a more objective and analytical approach like
that of McLachlin J in <i>Hall.</i></a></p><a name="para156">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para156"></a><a name="para157">157.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Quite apart from principle, it appears to me that the Rule would
establish, or maintain, a degree of clarity and certainty in relation to one
aspect of the law on the vexed topic of the effect of illegality on contractual
claims. One thing which is clear from reading only some of the large number of
judgments on the law on that topic over the past 350 years is the inconsistency
of reasoning and outcome in different cases. Those responsible for making and
developing the law in any area must strive to achieve as much clarity and as
much certainty as are consistent with principle and practicality.</a></p><a name="para157">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para157"></a><a name="para158">158.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There is, I acknowledge, some attraction in the point that the need for
certainty in this area is diminished by the fact that parties to an arrangement
which is illegal have less cause for complaint if the law is uncertain.
However, criminals are entitled to certainty in the law just as much as anyone
else. In any event, third parties are often affected by the enforceability of
rights acquired or lost under contracts, and innocent third parties, it could
be said with force, are in a particularly strong position to expect certainty
and clarity from the law. Quite apart from this, there is a general public
interest in certainty and clarity in all areas of law, not merely because it is
a fundamental aspect of the rule of law, but also because the less clear and
certain the law on any particular topic, the more demands there are on the
services of the courts.</a></p><a name="para158">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para158"></a><a name="para159">159.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>That leaves open two issues. First, the issue of what constitutes an
illegal contract for the purpose of the Rule. In my view, as a general
proposition, the rule would apply to any contract where the illegality would
result in the court (if it could otherwise do so) not being able to order
specific performance of the contract or damages for its breach. It would thus
normally apply to any contract whose performance would inevitably involve the
commission of a crime (i) because the whole purpose of the contract was the
commission of a crime (eg a contract killing), or (ii) because it was a
contract whose essential ingredient was the commission of a crime (the present
case is an example), or (iii) because the contract could not be performed
without the commission of a crime. In practice, of course, category (iii) would
cover the other two categories, but setting out the three categories may help
to illustrate the extent of the application of the rule.</a></p><a name="para159">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para159"></a><a name="para160">160.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As to category (iii), I have difficulties in seeing how a court could
order specific performance of a contract which necessarily involved one or
other of the parties committing a crime (even a minor crime). Requiring the
contract to be performed would involve the court ordering a party to act
illegally: that cannot be a course open to a court. For the same reason I have
difficulties in seeing how a court could normally award damages for breach of
such a contract. Conceptually, damages are a substitute for non-performance,
and performance is not something the court can award; and it seems inconsistent
with the court’s function to penalise a defendant in damages for not doing
something illegal or to compensate a claimant for not having a benefit which
would have required either or both of the parties doing something illegal. For
the court to make an order for specific performance or damages in such cases
would seem to infringe the principle of consistency discussed in the judgment
of McLachlin J in <i>Hall</i>.</a></p><a name="para160">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para160"></a><a name="para161">161.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The second issue is foreshadowed by the fact that I have described the
Rule as being generally applicable. That is because the need for certainty
must, particularly given the importance of policy, yield to the fact that, in
this difficult and potentially multi-faceted area, there will inevitably be
exceptions. Experience and common sense both suggest that any attempt to lay
down a clear and inflexible rule on even one aspect of the topic of illegality
in the context of contractual claims will lead to difficulties. (Both the
majority and the minority reasoning in <i>Tinsley </i>are a good example of
this). Indeed, the very fact that the approach of the courts in cases on this
topic is based on policy suggests that strict immutable rules are
inappropriate. Nonetheless, that does not negate any attempt to identify
principles such as that suggested by McLachlin J and general rules such as that
described in the cases mentioned in paras 147 and 148 above. The fact that the
approach of the law to contracts with an illegal aspect is based on policy does
not discharge judges from the normal duty of ensuring that the law on any topic
is as clear and certain as it can be.</a></p><a name="para161">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para161"></a><a name="para162">162.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>By way of example, I would mention two possible exceptions. First, where
one of the parties, especially the defendant, is in a class which is intended
to be protected by the criminal legislation involved, it may well be
inappropriate to invoke the Rule. Secondly, there could well be no recovery (or
only partial recovery) by a plaintiff where the defendant was unaware of the
facts which gave rise to the illegality - especially if he had received the
money and had altered his position so that it might be oppressive to expect him
to repay it. There will no doubt be other exceptions, but I do not think that
that undermines the usefulness of having the Rule as the prima facie or
presumptive approach. (I discuss in paras 172-175 below with the test for
determining whether it is appropriate to apply the Rule in any particular
case).</a></p><a name="para162">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para162"></a><a name="para163">163.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the present case, Mr Patel paid £620,000 to Mr Mirza pursuant to a
contract, under which Mr Mirza was to use the money to trade in RBS shares with
the benefit of inside information for their common benefit. That was a contract
whose agreed fundamental purpose was illegal. In fact, the anticipated inside
information was not forthcoming and the contract effectively lapsed. I can see
no good reason on these simple facts for not applying the Rule and accordingly
I consider that Mr Patel is entitled to the return of the £620,000.</a></p><a name="para163">

<p class="ParaHeading">Venturing further</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para163"></a><a name="para164">164.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The majority, and indeed Lord Mance and Lord Sumption, would go wider in
their judgments on this appeal, by laying down some wider and more general
principles or rules relating to the effect of illegality on contracts. There is
considerable attraction in doing so, not least because the law is in a state of
uncertainty. The reasoning of the majority in the most recent decision of the
House of Lords, <i>Tinsley</i>, is generally thought to be unsatisfactory: for
a convincing analysis see the judgments in the decision of the High Court of
Australia in <i>Nelson v Nelson</i> </a><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/25.html">[1995] HCA 25</a>, (1995) 184 CLR 538 (discussed more fully in
paras 50-54 above). And the result arrived at by the minority in <i>Tinsley </i>is
plainly unsatisfactory. I fear that the different approaches adopted by members
of this court in the recent cases of <i>Hounga v Allen</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2014/47.html">[2014] 1 WLR 2889</a>, <i>Les
Laboratoires Servier v Apotex Inc</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2014/55.html">[2015] AC 430</a> and<i> Bilta (UK) Ltd v
Nazir (No 2)</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/23.html">[2016] AC 1</a> have left the law on the topic in some disarray.
As I said in <i>Bilta</i>, para 15, “<a name="para15">the proper approach to the
defence of illegality needs to be addressed by this court (certainly with a
panel of seven and conceivably with a panel of nine Justices) as soon as
appropriately possible</a>”.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para165">165.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Nonetheless, there are arguments for not looking more widely at the
issue of illegality in the contractual context. Thus, in all three recent
Supreme Court cases (as in the present one), while there are some fairly sharp
differences of opinion as to the proper approach, there is no real dispute as
to the outcome. More broadly, the common law traditionally develops on a case
by case basis, and there are self-evident dangers for a court to paint on an
unnecessarily broad canvas, particularly bearing in mind that it is proceeding
by reference to the facts of one particular case. And that can be said to be
particularly true in the area of illegal contracts, where, as already
mentioned, experience has shown that it is a topic fraught with difficulties,
as is evidenced by the fact that the reasoning and outcomes in a number of
cases concerning contracts affected by illegality over the past 300 years are
hard to reconcile. Reading those cases also shows that it would be impossible
to envisage, and therefore to cater for, every type of problem which might
arise in this field.</a></p><a name="para165">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para165"></a><a name="para166">166.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Nonetheless, it seems to me right to venture further in this case,
essentially for the reasons summarised in para 164 above.</a></p><a name="para166">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para166"></a><a name="para167">167.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The first general point I should make is that, in my view, even where
the contemplated illegal activity has been performed in part or in whole, it
would be right to apply the Rule in appropriate cases. Thus, in the case of an
illegal contract where money is paid by the claimant to the defendant, and the
contract is then partly or wholly performed by the defendant paying a lesser
sum to the claimant, I do not see why, at least in the absence of good reasons
to the contrary, the court should not order that the claimant should recover
the money that he paid the defendant, albeit reduced by the lesser sum which
the claimant subsequently received from the defendant. Similarly, where the
contract is wholly performed.</a></p><a name="para167">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para167"></a><a name="para168">168.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In effect, the reasons supporting the application of the Rule in cases
where the illegal activity has not occurred, apply for the same reasons to
contracts where the contemplated illegal activity has been wholly or partly
performed. And there is the added reason of consistency with a case where the
contract has not been performed. Thus, in my view, if the defendant in this
case had only been able to purchase just a few shares on inside information and
had accounted to the claimant for the proceeds of sale of those shares in the
sum of, say £10,000, the contract would have been partly performed, but I
consider that the claimant could have successfully sued to recover the £620,000
he had paid, less the £10,000 which he had received.</a></p><a name="para168">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para168"></a><a name="para169">169.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There are, I think, three arguments against such a conclusion. The first
is that there are a number of judgments, including those in and <i>Taylor v
Bowers </i>1 QBD 291, <i>Kearley v Thomson </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpKQB/1889/154.html">24 QBD 742</a> and <i>Tribe v Tribe </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1995/20.html">[1996] Ch 107</a>, where it has been expressly stated that the Rule only applies where the
“illegal purpose has [not] been wholly or partly performed” to quote from
Millett LJ in <i>Tribe </i>at p 124E. However, perhaps particularly once one
strips away the notion that repentance is irrelevant, I can see no good reason
for not extending the rule to partly or even wholly performed contracts where <i>restitutio
in integrum </i>can be achieved in practical terms and would be consistent with
policy and proportionality. In the present case, for example, it would seem to
be penal on the claimant that he could be deprived of £610,000 (and by the same
token it would seem absurdly gratuitous that the defendant could benefit to the
tune of £610,000) simply because the contract had been performed to a small
extent.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para170">170.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Secondly, it may be argued that, once the contract has been partly
performed, the basis for <i>restitutio in integrum </i>has gone. But that
argument is only right if the basis of the Rule is total failure of
consideration. In my view, that is not necessarily the correct analysis (unless
the illegal consideration for which the money was paid is treated in law as no
consideration, because it is illegal). Indeed, in the end, the correct analysis
is not the centrally important issue, given that the question as to how the
court deals with illegal contracts is ultimately based on policy. The ultimate
function of the courts in common law and equity is to formulate and develop
rules of a clear and practical nature. Now that the judiciary (rightly) pay
more attention than we did to legal books and articles, we judges can look to
legal academics not only to identify what they think are judicial
inconsistencies and errors, but also to develop and modify their analyses of
legal principles when we consider it necessary to change, develop or clarify
the law.</a></p><a name="para170">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para170"></a><a name="para171">171.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Thirdly, it may be said that application of the Rule would result in the
court sometimes getting precious close to enforcing an illegal contract - a
course which the court most certainly cannot take, as already mentioned. I
accept that application of the Rule would sometimes involve the court making an
order whose effect in practice is similar to performance of the illegal
contract. But there is nothing in that point. If a particular outcome is
correct, then the mere fact that the same outcome could have been arrived at on
a wrong basis does not make it the wrong outcome. Indeed, it is worth noting
that the outcome in <i>Tribe </i>was precisely what it would have been if the
contract in question had been enforced. The father had transferred the shares
on the basis that it would help him avoid a threatened claim and that they
would be transferred back when the claim was no longer threatened; he sought an
order for the retransfer after the threat had gone away, and application of the
rule resulted in that order.</a></p><a name="para171">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para171"></a><a name="para172">172.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>That, of course, leaves open what would constitute “an appropriate case”
for the application of the Rule and “good reasons to the contrary” for these
purposes. The exceptions which I have referred to in para 162 above would be
examples of where it might not be appropriate to invoke the Rule. However, it
seems to me to be clear that there could be many other circumstances where
application of the Rule would not be appropriate in circumstances where the
illegal activity has been wholly or partly put into effect.</a></p><a name="para172">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para172"></a><a name="para173">173.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In that connection, some assistance can be obtained from the guidance
given by McLachlin J. Beyond that, it may be that some or all of the factors
identified by Professor Burrows in the passage quoted by Lord Toulson in para
93 above could be relevant depending on the facts and issues in any particular
case. However, I am not convinced that it is helpful to list all the
potentially relevant factors and say that it is a matter for the court in each
case to decide which of those factors apply in that case and what weight to
give them. Once a judge is required to take into account a significant number
of relevant factors, and the question of how much weight to give each of them
is a matter for the judge, the difference between judgment and discretion is, I
think, in practice pretty slight.</a></p><a name="para173">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para173"></a><a name="para174">174.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I have come to the conclusion that the approach suggested by Lord
Toulson in para 101 above provides as reliable and helpful guidance as it is
possible to give in this difficult field. When faced with a claim based on a
contract which involves illegal activity (whether or not the illegal activity
has been wholly, partly or not at all undertaken), the court should, when
deciding how to take into account the impact of the illegality on the claim,
bear in mind the need for integrity and consistency in the justice system, and
in particular (a) the policy behind the illegality, (b) any other public policy
issues, and (c) the need for proportionality.</a></p><a name="para174">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para174"></a><a name="para175">175.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I must admit that I was initially not attracted by this approach because
it seemed close to giving a discretion to judges when it comes to deciding how
to deal with a claim based on a contract with an illegal element. However, on
further reflection, it appears to me that, unlike the multi-factorial approach
proposed by Professor Burrows, the structured approach proposed by Lord Toulson
is not akin in practice to a discretion, and, in any event, it is the best
guidance that can sensibly be offered at the moment. Experience shows that it
is simply not possible to identify a more helpful or rigorous test. When
considering whether it is possible to give more specific or firm guidance, I
have considered some examples, which ultimately have helped to persuade me that
greater clarity, strictness or specificity is simply not possible, at any rate
at this stage, and they have served to conform the aptness of the approach set
out in para 101 above.</a></p><a name="para175">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para175"></a><a name="para176">176.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A simple example is a case where the consideration for which the claimant
paid or owed money was inherently illegal, rather than happening to involve an
illegal act in order to be achieved. In such cases, it seems to me that
considerations of certainty and policy indicate that the claimant should
generally be able to refuse to pay any money which is due under the contract
and, indeed, to recover the money he had paid. Thus, if the claimant paid a sum
to the defendant to commit a crime, such as a murder or a robbery, it seems to
me that the claimant should normally be able to recover the sum, irrespective of
whether the defendant had committed, or even attempted to commit, the crime. If
the defendant had not attempted the crime, the Rule would generally apply. If
he had actually succeeded in carrying out the crime, he should not be better
off than if he had not done so. I suppose one could justify that conclusion on
the ground that the law should not regard an inherently criminal act as
effective consideration.</a></p><a name="para176">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para176"></a><a name="para177">177.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>That example might appear to suggest that more specific guidance could
be given. However, even in relation to cases of the type described in para 176,
there could be exceptions such as those mentioned in para 162 above. And,
bearing in mind the enormous number of different crimes and different factual
circumstances which could arise, it would be little short of foolhardy to
imagine that there could not be other cases of this type where it would be
inappropriate to apply the Rule.</a></p><a name="para177">

</span>Further, different considerations would often, I suspect very often,
apply where the contract was not inherently illegal, but necessarily involved
an illegal action. An extreme case might be where an employer employed a
builder to carry out construction work which they both knew would inevitably
require the builder to park illegally - say on a double red line. As already
explained in para 160 above, if the defendant refused to carry out the work,
the contract could not be enforced prospectively by the employer, but he would
be entitled to recover any money he had paid. However, if the builder carried
out the work, the employer would not be able to avoid liability to pay in full:
the fact that the defendant could not perform his obligations under the
contract without committing a relatively technical and incidental crime would
not deprive him of the right to payment in full for such performance.</a></p><a name="para178">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>However, greater problems and uncertainties could arise in other cases -
eg where the nature of the criminal activity was more serious and/or more
central to the activity involved, where the illegal activity was expressly
included in the contract, or where one of the parties did not know or intend
that the activity in question to be carried out was illegal but the other did,
or where the proceedings arose out of the fact that such a contract had only
been partly performed.</a></p><a name="para179">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Further, where a claimant has performed his part of a contract which was
inherently lawful but was unlawful for some other reason, there is real room
for debate in any particular case whether he should be entitled to claim
payment on a <i>quantum meruit </i>basis, even though he cannot enforce his
right to contractual payment - compare <i>Mohamed v Alaga</i> &amp; <i>Co</i>
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1999/3037.html">[2000] 1 WLR 1815</a> and <i>Taylor v Bhail</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1995/54.html">[1996] CLC 377</a>. While it would be
possible to lay down a general rule as to whether or not a claimant could
recover in such a case, it seems to me to be more satisfactory for the outcome
to turn on the factors mentioned in para 174 above.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para181">181.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Similarly, it seems to me that the justification for the decision of the
majority in <i>Tinsley </i>was, as Lord Toulson says, that it would have been
disproportionate to have refused to enforce Miss Milligan’s equitable interest
in the relevant property on the grounds of her illegal activity, and the policy
behind the law making the activity in question illegal was not infringed by
acceding to her claim.</a></p><a name="para181">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para181"></a><a name="para182">182.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is also worth referring back to the two examples set out in para 162
above. If the purpose of rendering an activity illegal is to protect a class of
persons which includes only one of the parties to the contract, then, absent
any other argument based on policy or proportionality, it would seem
appropriate that that party should not be disadvantaged by the illegality,
and/or should be entitled to rely on the fact that the activity is illegal, as
against the other party. And, if a claimant seeks recovery of money paid to a
defendant under a contract which can only be performed illegally, and has not
been performed, proportionality and policy may well justify the court refusing
repayment if the defendant has spent the money and was unaware of the facts
giving rise to the illegality at the time he spent it.</a></p><a name="para182">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para182"></a><a name="para183">183.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I would make three concluding points. First, quite apart from being
persuaded by the reasons which justify the approach I have summarised in para 174
above, I consider that the fact that it is consistent with judgments of the
courts in Australia and Canada, as explained by Lord Toulson in paras 50-61
above is a good reason for adopting the approach. When considering how to
characterise, or whether to develop, any fundamental principle of the common
law, it is normally sensible for a judge to consider how the principle has been
approached in other common law jurisdictions, and it is desirable, if not
always achievable, that all common law jurisdictions adopt the same approach.</a></p><a name="para183">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para183"></a><a name="para184">184.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Secondly, I should briefly address the fact that the criminal law and
the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (“POCA”) may inevitably have some impact on the
rights and duties of parties who have entered into contracts with an illegal
connection. The involvement of the criminal law played a very important part in
the judgment of McLachlin J in <i>Hall v Hebert</i>. It seems to me to have two
main components. First, it is for the criminal law, not the civil law, to
penalise a party or parties for entering into and/or performing a contract with
an illegal component. Secondly, in so far as the civil law is fashioned by
judges in a particular case, they must ensure that it is not inconsistent with
the criminal law.</a></p><a name="para184">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para184"></a><a name="para185">185.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>So far as POCA is concerned, it enables the courts, through statutory
powers, to do that which a common law judge cannot do, and which many might
think was the best outcome in many of the more serious cases involving
illegality, namely to ensure that the proceeds of crime are retained by neither
party, but are paid over to the Government. This is not the occasion to discuss
the effect of POCA, save to say that I would take some persuading that the
common law should be influenced by the fact that POCA is or is not being
invoked in any particular case, although the civil courts should not make any
order, or at least permit the enforcement of any order, if its effect would run
counter to the provisions of POCA or to any step which was being contemplated
under POCA by the relevant authorities.</a></p><a name="para185">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Finally, I should say that, although my analysis may be slightly
different from that of Lord Toulson, I do not think that there is any
significant difference between us in practice. I agree with his framework for
arriving at an outcome, but I also consider that there is a prima facie
outcome, namely <i>restitution in integrum</i>.</a></p><a name="para186">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>That the law of illegality, particularly as it results from <i>Tinsley v
Milligan</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1993/3.html">[1994] 1 AC 340</a>, merits at the highest level the consideration now
being given to it, I would be among the first to accept. I indicated as much as
a party to the unsatisfying decision which the Court of Appeal had to reach in <i>Collier
v Collier </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2002/1095.html">[2002] BPIR 1057</a>: see in particular para 106. Whether it is,
however, appropriate to abandon basic principles going back nearly 250 years,
resting on the sound appreciation of as a great a judge as Lord Mansfield CJ
and approved and elucidated by the Supreme Court of Canada in an
authoritatively reasoned judgment in 1993, is a different matter.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para188">188.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The basic problem, identified clearly and succinctly by Lord Mansfield
in <i>Holman v Johnson</i> </a><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1775/58.pdf"></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1775/58.html">(1775) 1 Cowp 341</a>, is that there are at least three
potential interests when questions of illegality arise for consideration: those
of two parties and the public interest. It is, as he said, for reasons of
public interest that an otherwise good cause of action may sometimes fail,
where there has been illegality. In the absence of any relevant statutory
power, the court has no direct power to mediate between these three interests,
by for example requiring the public interest to be satisfied by a payment to
the public purse. It does not even have the power, conferred by statute in New
Zealand, to vary or validate an illegal contract in part “or otherwise
howsoever” (New Zealand Illegal Contracts Act 1970, section 7).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para189">189.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The application of the principle stated by Lord Mansfield was expanded
in scope after his day (notably by Lord Eldon in <i>Muckleston v Brown</i> (1801)
6 Ves 52 as described by Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <i>Tinsley v Milligan</i> at
p 372F. But, more recently it has diminished, <i>Tinsley v Milligan </i>being
itself actually an example of this, in so far as it confirmed both that legal
title to property could pass under an illegal contract and that equitable title
was capable of recognition. The court’s recognition of the equitable title was,
however, made subject to the (problematic) pre-condition that the claimant could
avoid reliance on illegality by relying on a procedural presumption. The court
was able, in <i>Tinsley v Milligan</i>, to derive this presumption from the
objectively demonstrable contribution made by Miss Milligan to the cost of
acquiring the property. At the same time the court was prepared to ignore the
fact, perfectly well-known to it, of the parties’ illegal intentions.</a></p><a name="para189">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In common with Lord Toulson (paras 100-101), I consider that valuable insight
into the appropriate approach to the significance of illegality under today’s
conditions is found in the judgment of McLachlin J (as she was) writing for the
majority the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Hall v Hebert</i> [1993] 2 SCR 159.
The case concerned a claim in tort by a passenger against the owner of a car,
who lost the keys when they fell out of the ignition when the car stalled and
who decided in these circumstances that his passenger (who he knew to have
drunk 11 or 12 bottles of beer) should drive while he tried to push-start the
car. Unsurprisingly, the manoeuvre led to the passenger losing control, the car
turning over and the passenger being injured. The Canadian Supreme Court upheld
the passenger’s claim, subject to contributory negligence.</a></p><a name="para190">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para190"></a><a name="para191">191.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The majority in the Canadian Supreme Court rightly regarded the case as
one of “great importance”. A number of points emerge with great clarity from
McLachlin J’s judgment:</a></p><a name="para191">

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">i)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>First, rejecting Cory J’s suggestion that “a power to reject claims on
considerations of public policy” should replace the maxim <i>ex turpi causa non
oritur action</i>, McLachlin J expressed her concern that public policy would
provide no “clear guidance as to when judges could exercise this draconian
power and upon what grounds”. She went on:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“I fear that unless placed upon a
firm doctrinal foundation and made subject to clear limits, this general power
to invalidate actions on grounds of public policy might prove more problematic
than has the troubled doctrine of ex turpi causa non oritur actio. We would be
trading one label for another without coming to grips with the fundamental
problem.” (p 169)</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">ii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Second, she saw tort, not contract, as the real problem area in relation
to illegality, expressing the view that:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The use of the doctrine of ex turpi
causa to prevent abuse and misuse of the judicial process is well established
in contract law and insurance law, where it provokes little controversy. The
same cannot be said for tort.” (p 171)</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">iii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Third, after examining authorities where the maxim applied to prevent
claimants from profiting or obtaining exemplary damages in circumstances of
illegality, she identified its rationale in today’s world, in terms which have
equal relevance to contract and tort:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The narrow principle illustrated
by the foregoing examples of accepted application of the maxim of ex turpi
causa non oritur actio in tort, is that a plaintiff will not be allowed to
profit from his or her wrongdoing. This explanation, while accurate as far as
it goes, may not, however, explain fully why courts have rejected claims in
these cases. Indeed, it may have the undesirable effect of tempting judges to
focus on the issue of whether the plaintiff is ‘getting something’ out of the
tort, thus carrying the maxim into the area of compensatory damages where its
use has proved so controversial, and has defeated just claims for compensation.
A more satisfactory explanation for these cases, I would venture, is that to
allow recovery in these cases would be to allow recovery for what is illegal.
It would put the courts in the position of saying that the same conduct is both
legal, in the sense of being capable of rectification by the court, and
illegal. It would, in short, introduce an inconsistency in the law. It is
particularly important in this context that we bear in mind that the law must
aspire to be a unified institution, the parts of which - contract, tort, the
criminal law - must be in essential harmony. For the courts to punish conduct
with the one hand while rewarding it with the other, would be to ‘create an
intolerable fissure in the law’s conceptually seamless web’: Weinrib [‘Illegality
as a Tort Defence’ (1976) 26 UTLJ 28], at p 42. We thus see that the concern,
put at its most fundamental, is with the integrity of the legal system.” (pp
175-176)</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">iv)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Fourth, McLachlin J said that such compensatory damages as were claimed
in <i>Hall v Hebert </i>are</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“not properly awarded as
compensation for an illegal act, but only as compensation for personal injury.
Such damages accomplish nothing more than to put the plaintiff in the position
he or she would have been in had the tort not occurred. No part of the award
which compensates injury can be said to be the profit of, or the windfall from,
an illegal act.” (p 176)</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:35.45pt">In substance, McLachlin J can
in this passage be said to have been applying a reliance test in tort. To
establish a right to compensation, all that the plaintiff had to rely on was
the tortious conduct, consisting of the causing of injury by negligent driving.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2">v)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Finally, she concluded that:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:70.9pt">“there is a need in the law of
tort for a principle which permits judges to deny recovery to a plaintiff on
the ground that to do so would undermine the integrity of the justice system.
The power is a limited one. Its use is justified where allowing the plaintiff’s
claim would introduce inconsistency into the fabric of the law, either by
permitting the plaintiff to profit from an illegal or wrongful act, or to evade
a penalty prescribed by criminal law. Its use is not justified where the plaintiff’s
claim is merely for compensation for personal injuries sustained as a
consequence of the negligence of the defendant.” (pp 179-180)</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para191"></a><a name="para192">192.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In my opinion, what is called for is a limited approach to the effect of
illegality, focused on the need to avoid inconsistency in the law, without depriving
claimants of the opportunity to obtain damages for wrongs or to put themselves
in the position in which they should have been. This will offer the opportunity
of resolving such problems as have, rightly, been identified in the present
law, without replacing it wholesale with an open and unsettled range of
factors. The latter might, in McLachlin J’s words, “prove more problematic than
has the troubled doctrine of ex turpi causa” itself.</a></p><a name="para192">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para192"></a><a name="para193">193.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>McLachlin J’s emphasis on the admissibility of compensatory claims leads
me to the principle traditionally addressed under the head of <i>locus
poenitentiae</i>. This principle in fact had a relevant role in the <i>Tinsley
v Milligan</i> in so far as it was recognised as demonstrating that “the effect
of illegality is not to prevent a proprietary interest in equity from arising
or to produce a forfeiture of such right: the effect is to render the equitable
interest unenforceable in certain circumstances”: per Lord Browne-Wilkinson, p 374D.
But its true significance is considerably greater. Where it applies, it fulfils
a not dissimilar function to a claim for damages in tort. It puts the parties
back in the position that they should have been in, in this case but for the
entry into of the contract which was or became affected and unenforceable by
reason of the illegality.</a></p><a name="para193">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para193"></a><a name="para194">194.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In early authorities the principle was put in wide terms. <i>Smith v
Bromley</i> (1760) 2 Doug KB 696n was a case where the plaintiff was able to
recover money she had paid to procure her brother’s discharge from bankruptcy,
which was an illegal payment. The primary reason was that the law making it
illegal was for the protection of bankrupts and their families (so that the
plaintiff and the defendant were <i>non in pari delictu</i>). An editor’s
footnote (F7) on p 697 gives this as one of two exceptions to the principle
that, in a case of illegality, matters are left to lie where they fall (<i>potior
est conditio defendentis</i>). But Lord Mansfield CJ reinforced this reason by
the more general consideration at p 698, that, although the payment had been
made for an illegal purpose:</a></p><a name="para194">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Upon the whole, I am persuaded it
is necessary, for the better support and maintenance of the law, to allow this
action; for no man will venture to take, if he knows he is liable to refund.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The other exception identified in the footnote was that
where the “contract is not excecuted, there is a <i>locus poenitentiae</i>, the
<i>delictum </i>is incomplete, and the contract may be rescinded by either
party”.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para194"></a><a name="para195">195.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In <i>Neville v Wilkinson</i> </a><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1782/117.pdf">(1782) 1 Bro CC 543</a>, 547, Lord Thurlow LC
approved this approach, and “declared his opinion” that:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“[I]n all cases where money was
paid for an unlawful purpose, the party, though particeps criminis, might
recover at law; and that the reason was, that if courts of justice mean to
prevent the perpetration of crimes, it must be not by allowing a man who has
got possession to remain in possession, but by putting the parties back to the
state in which they were before.”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In <i>Taylor v Bowers </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpKQB/1876/29.html">(1876) 1 QBD 291</a> possession of goods had been passed
by the plaintiff, their owner, to A, in exchange for fictitious bills of
exchange, in order to deceive creditors. But no compromise was achieved with
creditors, “the illegal transaction was not carried out”, and “it wholly came
to an end” (p 300). In these circumstances, the plaintiff successfully sought
recovery of the goods:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“To hold that the plaintiff is
enabled to recover does not carry out the illegal transaction, but the effect
is to put everybody in the same situation as they were before the illegal
transaction was determined upon, and before the parties took any steps to carry
it out.” (p 300)</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The plaintiff was not seeking to enforce the illegal
transaction, “but, on the contrary, setting it aside” and “not setting up his
own fraud in order to make a title, but … repudiating the fraud and setting up
his own prior rightful title as owner of the goods” (p 301).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para197">197.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Like Lord Sumption (paras 245-252), I see this principle of rescission
as having become unduly limited with time, particularly in 20th century
authority, and I consider that it should be restored to its former significance
and generalised. Further, I consider that there is no reason why rescission
should necessarily be restricted, as it was even in these earlier authorities,
by reference to a test of execution or carrying out of the illegal purpose. The
logic of the principle is that the illegal transaction should be disregarded,
and the parties restored to the position in which they would have been, had
they never entered into it. If and to the extent that the rescission on that
basis remains possible, then prima facie it should be available.</a></p><a name="para197">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para197"></a><a name="para198">198.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In addition, as at present advised, I would not see any necessary
objection to permitting rescission after part performance, by making, where
possible, appropriate adjustments for benefits received. Equally, picking up
points in Lord Neuberger’s judgment (para 162) which I have read since writing
the bulk of this judgment, I would not as at present advised see an imbalance
or lack of parity of delict between the parties as a necessary or even probable
bar to rescission, though I would agree that, in accordance with general
principle, factors such as change of position could well preclude rescission.
Complications may also arise in a context where a benefit received under an
illegal transactions is capable of forfeiture under the Proceeds of Crime Act
2002. We did not hear submissions on the position in such circumstances, and I
express no opinion on it.</a></p><a name="para198">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On the above basis, reliance on illegality remains significant as a bar
to relief, but only in so far as it is reliance in order to profit from or
otherwise enforce an illegal contract. Reliance in order to restore the status
quo is unobjectionable. The result is, as I see it, not dissimilar to that
which (leaving aside the potential effects of section 7) results under section
6(1) of the New Zealand Illegal Contracts Act 1970, providing that:</a></p><a name="para199">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Notwithstanding any rule of law
or equity to the contrary, but subject to the provisions of this Act and of any
other enactment, every illegal contract shall be of no effect and no person
shall become entitled to any property under a disposition made by or pursuant
to any such contract …”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The approach I adopt avoids unsatisfactory results such as that reached
in <i>Collier v Collier</i>, where it would have been entirely possible to
achieve rescission even though the illegal scheme had been in some measure
“executed” or “carried out”. The father there could require the restoration of
the property of which he had for an illegal purpose allowed his daughter to
have the legal title. Similarly, in a situation like that in <i>Tinsley v
Milligan</i>, it should be possible to avoid reliance on the artificial
procedural concept of a presumption of a resulting trust. Such a presumption
was available in that case to give effect to (though without necessarily
referring to) the parties’ actual intentions regarding equitable ownership or
the reason (although the court was well aware of it) for structuring the transactions
as they were. But, as <i>Collier v Collier </i>demonstrates, an artificial
procedural presumption of this nature cannot be relied upon to be available in
every case.</a></p><a name="para200">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In future, Miss Milligan should simply be able to reverse the effect, as
between herself and Miss Tinsley, of the property transactions which they
arranged for the illegal purpose, which they carried out, of deceiving public
authorities. Because the court would be reversing, rather than enforcing the
illegal transactions, the court could take into account both the objective fact
of joint contributions and the parties’ actual and, by itself, legal purpose of
joint ownership. Setting on one side the transactions by which they sought to
achieve their illegal purpose, the underlying equitable interests, which they
shared based on their contributions and intentions, would be enforceable as
such. The court could on that basis order the property to be registered in the
joint names of Miss Tinsley and Miss Milligan.</a></p><a name="para201">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It follows from what I have so far said that I cannot accept Lord
Toulson’s view (para 116) that it is unnecessary to consider the scope of <i>locus
poenitentiae</i>. The underlying concept behind locus poenitentiae is
restitutionary. It recognises that neither an admission of nor reliance on illegality
is a bar to relief involving the reversal of an illegal transaction. In the
full restitutionary sense I have discussed, the concept must be seen as an
integral part of the overall principle governing illegality, and as the
corollary of McLachlin J’s limited rationalisation of that principle.
Understood in that sense, free of early 20th century moralising, it restores
the position to what it would and should have been, without any illegality. It
avoids windfall benefits and disproportionate losses, without involving the
positive enforcement of or the recovery of profits based on illegal bargains.
No doubt, however, it would be desirable to avoid the moral undertones of the
Latin brocard, and to encapsulate the full width of the modern principle, by referring
in future simply to parties’ normal entitlement to reverse the effects of an
illegal transaction, where possible, even though the transaction may have been
wholly or in part executed or carried into effect.</a></p><a name="para202">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It also follows that in the present case I consider that no problem
exists about recognising that Mr Patel is entitled to require Mr Mirza to
return the stake which Mr Patel put up for the illegal purpose of use by Mr
Mirza to make profits for their joint benefit by misuse of inside information. The
claim does not seek to enforce or profit by the illegality. It seeks merely to
put the position back to where it should have been, and would have been had no
such illegal transaction ever been undertaken. I add that, having written the
above and read Lord Neuberger’s judgment in draft, it seems to me that, thus
far, my analysis is essentially the same as that which Lord Neuberger describes
in his judgment as “the Rule”.</a></p><a name="para203">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Before leaving the case, I must however return to the suggestion,
unnecessary in my view for the resolution of this appeal, that the law of
illegality should be generally rewritten. The new approach is advocated primarily
by Lord Toulson, but Lord Neuberger appears, unless I have misunderstood him,
to suggest that it could serve both as a potential modification or
qualification of the Rule and as an approach to be adopted to claims positively
to enforce a contract, and to claims for damages for breach of contract or a
quantum meruit for services rendered under an illegal contract (see his paras 174-175
and 178-180). The new approach is ostensibly based by Lord Toulson on <i>Hall v
Hebert</i>, but it is transmuted by the statement (by Lord Toulson in para 101)
that:</a></p><a name="para204">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“one cannot judge whether allowing
a claim which is in some way tainted by illegality would be contrary to the
public interest, because it would be harmful to the integrity of the legal
system, without a) considering the underlying purpose of the prohibition which
has been transgressed, b) considering conversely any other relevant public
policies which may be rendered ineffective or less effective by denial of the
claim, and c) keeping in mind the possibility of overkill unless the law is
applied with a due sense of proportionality. We are, after all, in the area of
public policy. That trio of necessary considerations can be found in the case
law.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para204"></a><a name="para205">205.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Under consideration c), it is then indicated (paras 107 and 108) that:</a></p><a name="para205">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“107.&nbsp; In considering whether it
would be disproportionate to refuse relief to which the claimant would
otherwise be entitled, as a matter of public policy, various factors may be
relevant. Professor Burrows’ list is helpful but I would not attempt to lay
down a prescriptive or definitive list because of the infinite possible variety
of cases. Potentially relevant factors include the seriousness of the conduct,
its centrality to the contract, whether it was intentional and whether there
was marked disparity in the parties’ respective culpability.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">108.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The integrity and harmony

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>What is apparent is that this approach, would introduce not only a new
era but entirely novel dimensions into any issue of illegality. Courts would be
required to make a value judgment, by reference to a widely spread mélange of ingredients,
about the overall “merits” or strengths, in a highly unspecific non-legal
sense, of the respective claims of the public interest and of each of the
parties. But courts could only do so, by either allowing or disallowing
enforcement of the contract as between the two parties to it, unless they were
able (if and when this was possible) to adopt the yet further novelty, pioneered
by the majority of the Australian court in <i>Nelson v Nelson</i> </a><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/25.html">[1995] HCA 25</a>, (1995) 184 CLR 538, of requiring the account to the public for any profit
unjustifiably made at the public expense, as a condition of obtaining relief.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para207">207.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Although other jurisdictions are invoked, it is notable how slender the
basis for doing so is. It comes down to the New Zealand statute and the
Australian authorities of <i>Nelson v Nelson</i> and <i>Fitzgerald v F J
Leonhardt Pty Ltd </i> </a><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1997/17.html">[1997] HCA 17</a>, (1997) 189 CLR 215. We have no idea or
information as to whether or not the approach there has proved unproblematic
for the profession or the courts. What we do however have is an authoritative
decision of the Canadian Supreme Court in <i>Hall v Hebert</i>, which does not
in any way support the wholesale abandonment of a clear cut test, but rather
explains and redefines the principle <i>ex turpi causa</i> in a manner which
(consistently with the way in which the common law usually develops) offers
every prospect of avoiding the evident anomalies which an over formalistic
approach has in the past evidenced.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para208">208.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Toulson also starts his judgment with a series of paragraphs (1 to
9) instancing what are supposed to be problems existing under the present law.
I would only say as to <i>Holman v Johnson </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1775/58.html">(1775) 1 Cowp 341</a> and <i>Pearce
v Brooks</i> (1866) LR 1 Ex 213 that the question what constitutes knowing
participation sufficient to render a contract unenforceable is a discrete
problem, which is unlikely to be resolved any more simply under the “range of
factors” approach now advocated. Likewise, the <i>St John Shipping </i>case
[1957] 1 QB 267 and <i>Ashmore Benson Pease &amp; Co Ltd v A V Dawson Ltd </i>[1973]
1 WLR 828 arose in areas where the purpose and effect of statutory provisions
were central to the decision (as it was in cases such as <i>Hall v Woolston
Hall Leisure Ltd </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2000/170.html">[2001] 1 WLR 225</a>, <i>Still v Minister of National Revenue </i>(1997)
154 DLR (4th) 229 and <i>Nizamuddowlah v Bengal Cabaret Inc</i> (1977) 399 NYS
2d 854, mentioned by Lord Toulson in paras 6, 58-61 and 63-66). Questions as to
the effect of collateral or minor illegality (such as parking on a double red
line, instanced by Lord Neuberger in para 178) on the enforceability of
contractual rights have not, I believe, led to real difficulty in achieving
just solutions under these and other authorities (compare also McLachlin J’s
view cited in para 191(ii) above) - and certainly not to such difficulty as to
justify tearing up the existing law and starting again. Again, the new approach
now advocated, with its wide range of additional factors, over and above
statutory purpose and effect, would be unlikely to avoid similar analysis of
statutory policy and similarly nice issues. More importantly, these are
problems in areas far removed from the present, and do not to my mind throw any
light on the issues we have to decide on this appeal.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As I see it, there is no disagreement between members of the court as to
the correct disposal of this appeal. It is that the appeal must be dismissed
because Mr Patel is entitled to restitution of the £620,000 that he paid to Mr
Mirza on the basis that otherwise Mr Mirza would be unjustly enriched. As it
seems to me, the application of orthodox principles of unjust enrichment,
rescission and <i>restitutio in integrum </i>leads to this conclusion. Those
principles are consistently set out by Lord Mance and Lord Sumption. Although
Lord Sumption sets out a broader statement of principle, he agrees with Lord
Mance and <i>vice versa</i>. As it seems to me, there is no difference between
their approach and the application by Lord Neuberger of what he calls “the
Rule”, which he defines in paras 145 and 146, as the right to return of money
paid by the claimant to the defendant pursuant to a contract to carry out an
illegal activity and the illegal activity is not in the event proceeded with
owing to matters beyond the control of either party. Lord Sumption, at para
252, emphasises that the Rule arises automatically and by operation of law; a
“right to restitution that in principle follows from the legal ineffectiveness
of the contract …”. I do not understand Lord Neuberger or Lord Mance to
disagree with that. As Lord Neuberger says in para 146, the Rule is consistent
with authority and with policy and renders the outcome in cases of contracts
involving illegality and the maxim <i>ex turpi causa non oritur action </i>relatively
clear and certain.</a></p><a name="para210">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As Lord Neuberger says at para 154, in agreement with Lord Mance, there
is obvious attraction in the notion that, if all transfers made pursuant to an
unexecuted illegal contract are re-transferred, then the parties are back in
the position they were, ie as if there had been no illegal contract, which
would seem to comply with public policy.</a></p><a name="para211">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This approach does not require any balancing of a series of different
factors. It simply applies the principles derived from the authorities to the
facts of the case. Lord Neuberger, Lord Mance and Lord Sumption have referred
in detail, and (so far as I can see) consistently, to the authorities over very
many years. None of them supports a balancing of the kind suggested by Lord
Toulson. To my mind the most important sources are the judgments of Lord
Mansfield CJ in <i>Holman v Johnson </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1775/58.html">(1775) 1 Cowp 341</a> and McLachlin J (now
CJ) in <i>Hall v Hebert </i>[1993] 2 SCR 159.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para213">213.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Mance sets out in para 191 what he calls a number of points which
emerge with great clarity from McLachlin J’s judgment. I will not repeat those
passages here. The critical point for present purposes is that she stressed the
importance of having a firm doctrinal foundation for what she described as a
narrow principle. She was concerned, at p 169, that public policy would provide
“no clear guidance as to when judges could exercise this draconian power and
upon what grounds”. The draconian power was “a power to reject claims on
considerations of public policy”. On the facts of <i>Hall v Hebert </i>she
concluded that such compensatory damages as were claimed in that case were not
properly to be regarded as awarded as compensation for an illegal act but only
as compensation for personal injury. Then, as Lord Mance says, finally she
concluded that:</a></p><a name="para213">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“there is a need in the law of
tort for a principle which permits judges to deny recovery to a plaintiff on
the ground that to do so would undermine the integrity of the justice system.
The power is a limited one. Its use is justified where allowing the plaintiff’s
claim would introduce inconsistency into the fabric of the law, either by
permitting the plaintiff to profit from an illegal or wrongful act, or to evade
a penalty prescribed by criminal law. Its use is not justified where the plaintiff’s
claim is merely for compensation for personal injuries sustained as a
consequence of the negligence of the defendant.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para213"></a><a name="para214">214.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I entirely agree with that approach. I have always thought that the
power of the court to deny recovery on the ground of illegality should be
limited to well defined circumstances. I agree with Lord Mance in para 192
that, in the absence of such circumstances, claimants should not be deprived of
the opportunity to obtain damages for wrongs or to put themselves in the
position in which they should have been. As I see it, there is no need to
replace that approach with what he calls an open and unsettled range of
factors.</a></p><a name="para214">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para214"></a><a name="para215">215.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I agree with Lord Sumption’s opinion in this regard. As he puts it at
para 257, the search for principle which led McLachlin J to identify
consistency as the foundation of this area of the law was a response to Cory J,
who had favoured a more flexible approach which would have depended upon
whether the relevant public policy required that result on the facts of each case.
The majority, including McLachlin J, did not agree. In para 258 Lord Sumption
draws attention to the similar opinion of Lord Goff in <i>Tinsley v Milligan </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1993/3.html">[1994] 1 AC 340</a> at 358E-F, where he objected to the “public conscience test” adopted
in the Court of Appeal, under which the court must “weigh, or balance, the
adverse consequences of respectively granting or refusing relief”. Lord Goff
added that that was “little different, if at all, from stating that the court
has a discretion whether to grant or refuse relief” and that it was very
difficult to reconcile with the principle of policy stated by Lord Mansfield in
<i>Holman v Johnson</i>. As Lord Sumption observes, on this point Lord Goff was
supported by the whole of the Appellate Committee.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para216">216.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Between paras 259 and 265 Lord Sumption considers what he calls the
“range of factors” approach and gives his reasons for rejecting it. I agree
with him, and will not repeat his reasoning here, save for the following
passage at para 262(iv):</a></p><a name="para216">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The ‘range of factors’ test
discards any requirement for an analytical connection between the illegality
and the claim, by making the nature of the connection simply one factor in a
broader evaluation of individual cases and offering no guidance as to what sort
of connection might be relevant. I have already observed that the reliance test
is the narrowest test available. If it is no longer to be decisive, the
possibility is opened up of an altogether wider ambit for the illegality
principle, extending to cases where the relevant connection was remote or
non-existent but other factors not necessarily involving any connection at all,
were thought to be compelling.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">In short, such a test does not apply the principles laid
down in the cases, and is inconsistent with the approach in <i>Tinsley v
Milligan </i>and, in particular, the reliance test.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para216"></a><a name="para217">217.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In para 265 Lord Sumption says that he cannot agree with the conclusion
of Lord Toulson (at para 109) that the application of the illegality principle
should depend on</a></p><a name="para217">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“the policy factors involved and …
the nature and circumstances of the illegal conduct, in determining whether the
public interest in preserving the integrity of the justice system should result
in the denial of the relief claimed.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">I agree with Lord Sumption that this is far too vague and
potentially far too wide to serve as the basis on which a person may be denied
his legal rights. As he says, it converts a legal principle into an exercise of
judicial discretion, in the process exhibiting all the vices of “complexity,
uncertainty, arbitrariness and lack of transparency” which Lord Toulson
attributes to the present law. The illegality defence deprives claimants of
their legal rights. The correct response for us is not to leave the problem to
a case by case evaluation by the lower courts by reference to a potentially
unlimited range of factors, but to address the problem by supplying a framework
of principle which accommodates legitimate concerns about the present law.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para217"></a><a name="para218">218.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Mance expresses much the same conclusion in paras 204 to 207, with
which I also agree. It is to my mind noteworthy that Lord Toulson puts his
conclusion thus in para 109:</a></p><a name="para218">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The courts must obviously abide
by the terms of any statute, but I conclude that it is right for a court which
is considering the application of the common law doctrine of illegality to have
regard to the policy factors involved and to the nature and circumstances of
the illegal conduct in determining whether the public interest in preserving
the integrity of the justice system should result in denial of the relief
claimed. I put it in that way rather than whether the contract should be
regarded as tainted by illegality, because the question is whether the relief
claimed should be granted.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para218"></a><a name="para219">219.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The striking feature of that approach is as I see it that it puts the
question, not whether the contract should be regarded as tainted by illegality
but whether the relief claimed should be granted. That seems to me to be
essentially a question of discretion, or at least a consideration of all the
relevant factors in order to decide where the balance should be struck. As I
see it, there is no support in any of the authorities for that approach and it
is directly contrary to many of the cases referred to by Lord Sumption and Lord
Mance, in particular the reasoning of the majority in <i>Hall v Hebert </i>and
of the House of Lords in <i>Tinsley v Milligan</i>, where it was expressly
rejected by Lord Goff. It would be close to reviving the public conscience
test. In my opinion the question posed in para 109 is the wrong question.</a></p><a name="para219">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para219"></a><a name="para220">220.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I recognise that common law principles develop from time to time. Two
such developments are relevant here. The first is this. Lord Sumption and Lord
Mance both focus on the scope of the principle of <i>restitutio in integrum</i>,
as does Lord Neuberger. For example, Lord Neuberger first sets out the basis of
the Rule, which seems to me to be consistent with the principles identified by
Lord Sumption and Lord Mance. Thus in much of his judgment, notably in paras
145 to 160, Lord Neuberger stresses that the Rule supports the importance of
certainty in the law. He then gives some examples of possible extensions of the
Rule. So, for example, he says in paras 167 to 169 that the Rule may apply
where the illegal contract is wholly or partly performed by the plaintiff
paying a lesser sum to the defendant. I agree, but that is on the basis that it
is essentially ordering restitution so far as appropriate in accordance with
the underlying principle embodied in the Rule. As Lord Neuberger puts it in
para 169, there is no good reason for not extending the Rule to partly or even
wholly performed contracts where <i>restitutio in integrum </i>can be achieved
in practical terms and would be consistent with policy and proportionality. As
I read his judgment, save at the very end his approach is orthodox and
contemplates a development of the legal principles identified by Lord Sumption
and Lord Mance.</a></p><a name="para220">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para220"></a><a name="para221">221.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The second relevant development is this. It is now recognised that some
of the reasoning in <i>Tinsley v Milligan</i> can no longer stand: see in
particular Lord Sumption at paras 236 to 239 and Lord Mance at paras 199 to 201.
It is I think now accepted on all sides that, if <i>Collier v Collier </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2002/1095.html">[2002] BPIR 1057</a> came before the courts today it would be decided differently. That is
not however because the court will adopt the proposals of Lord Toulson but
because the relevant legal principles have developed in a normal way.</p>

second is whether, if so, Mr Patel is entitled to restitution of the £620,000
that he paid to Mr Mirza.</a></p><a name="para224">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The first question has divided the courts below. The Deputy Judge (David
Donaldson QC) and the majority of the Court of Appeal (Rimer LJ and Vos LJ)
thought it plain that Mr Patel’s claim was founded on an illegal agreement and
could not be sustained unless he could invoke a special exception for executory
agreements. They considered that there was such an exception. Gloster LJ on the
other hand declined to see the problem in terms of rule and exception. At the
risk of a rather crude summary of her thoughtful analysis, I would summarise
her reasons as follows. Her first and main point (paras 67, 69-70, 72, 79-80)
was that the rationale of the illegality rule did not require Mr Patel to be
denied restitutionary relief, because it did not involve enforcing his contract
with Mr Mirza or enabling him to derive any benefit from it. Mr Patel’s right
to restitution was, she considered, “collateral”. Second, that Mr Mirza and Mr
Patel were not equally blameworthy because Mr Mirza was a finance professional
while Mr Patel was not, and would not necessarily have known that insider
dealing was illegal. Third, section 63(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 1993
provided that no contract should be void or unenforceable by reason of the
prohibition of insider dealing in section 52. The fourth was that Mr Patel did
not need to rely on the illegal character of his agreement with Mr Mirza in
order to recover the money. It was enough that he had paid it for a speculation
that never occurred.</a></p><a name="para225">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The present appeal exposes, not for the first time, a long-standing
schism between those judges and writers who regard the law of illegality as calling
for the application of clear rules, and those who would wish address the
equities of each case as it arises. There are recent statements of this court
in support of both points of view: see <i>Les Laboratoires Servier v Apotex Inc</i>
[2015] AC 340 and <i>Hounga v Allen</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2014/47.html">[2014] 1 WLR 2889</a>, paras 44-45. It also
raises one of the most basic problems of a system of judge-made customary law
such as the common law. The common law is not an uninhabited island on which
judges are at liberty to plant whatever suits their personal tastes. It is a
body of instincts and principles which, barring some radical change in the
values of our society, is developed organically, building on what was there
before. It has a greater inherent flexibility and capacity to develop independently
of legislation than codified systems do. But there is a price to be paid for
this advantage in terms of certainty and accessibility to those who are not
professional lawyers. The equities of a particular case are important. But
there are pragmatic limits to what law can achieve without becoming arbitrary,
incoherent and unpredictable even to the best advised citizen, and without
inviting unforeseen and undesirable collateral consequences.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Ancient as it is, the classic statement of the principle as it has
traditionally been understood remains that of Lord Mansfield CJ in <i>Holman v
Johnson</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1775/58.html">(1775) 1 Cowp 341</a>:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The objection, that a contract is
immoral or illegal as between plaintiff and defendant, sounds at all times very
ill in the mouth of the defendant. It is not for his sake, however, that the
objection is ever allowed; but it is founded in general principles of policy,
which the defendant has the advantage of, contrary to the real justice, as
between him and the plaintiff, by accident if I may so say. The principle of
public policy is this; <i>ex dolo malo non oritur actio</i>. No court will lend
its aid to a man who founds his cause of action upon an immoral or an illegal
act. If, from the plaintiff’s own stating or otherwise, the cause of action
appears to arise <i>ex turpi causa</i>, or the transgression of a positive law
of this country, there the court says he has no right to be assisted.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para228">228.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There was a time when the courts approached the application of the
illegality principle on the footing that a court should not be required to
sully its hands by dealing with criminal ventures. In <i>Everet v Williams</i>
(1725), noted at (1893) LQR 197, the notorious case in which two highwaymen
sought an account of the division of their profits, the court not only dismissed
the action but fined the plaintiff’s solicitors for the indignity visited upon
it. There are periodic echoes of this attitude in later cases, notably <i>Parkinson
v College of Ambulance Ltd</i> [1925] 2 KB 1, 13, in which Lush J thought that
no adjudication on a contract to procure an honour could be undertaken with
“propriety or decency”. This notion has sometimes been thought to derive
support from Lord Mansfield’s reference to the court withholding its aid. But
the truth is that it has rarely risen above the level of indignant judicial
asides. There are many purposes for which courts must necessarily inquire into
the illegal acts of litigants. There are principled exceptions to the
illegality principle, which may entitle a party to base a claim on an illegal
act. There are statutory schemes of apportionment which may require liability
for dishonest acts to be distributed among the wrongdoers. The notion of
judicial abstention could never be unqualified, nor has it been historically.
The law, as Bingham LJ observed in <i>Saunders v Edwards</i> [1987] 1 WLR 1116,
1134, must</a></p><a name="para228">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“steer a middle course between two
unacceptable positions. On the one hand it is unacceptable that any court of
law should aid or lend its authority to a party seeking to pursue or enforce an
object or agreement which the law prohibits. On the other hand, it is
unacceptable that the court should, on the first indication of unlawfulness
affecting any aspect of a transaction, draw up its skirts and refuse all
assistance to the plaintiff, no matter how serious his loss nor how
disproportionate his loss to the unlawfulness of his conduct.”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In its consultative report of 2009,<i> The Illegality Defence</i> (LCCP
189), at para 2.5, the Law Commission identified six policy rationales for the
rule, which could be found in the case-law and the academic literature. They
were: (1) furthering the purpose of the rule which the claimant's illegal
behaviour has infringed; (2) consistency; (3) the need to prevent the claimant
profiting from his or her own wrong; (4) deterrence; (5) maintaining the
integrity of the legal system; and (6) punishment.</a></p><a name="para229">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para229"></a><a name="para230">230.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>By “maintaining the integrity of the legal system” (rationale (5)), the
Law Commission meant sparing the judiciary from involvement in serious
wrongdoing: see para 2.24. I have given my reasons for rejecting this rationale.
The Law Commission itself (paras 2.28-2.29) rejected rationale (6), punishment,
on the ground that although rules of civil law might have a punitive effect,
this was no part of their purpose. With very limited exceptions, such as
certain rules of causation in fraud cases or the rare occasions for awarding
punitive damages, I think that this is correct. The other four rationales
overlap. All of them to my mind are subsumed in no (2), the principle of
consistency. The most influential statement of that principle is to be found in
the much admired judgment of McLachlin J delivering the judgment of the
majority of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Hall v Hebert</i> [1993] 2 SCR
159, 169:</a></p><a name="para230">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Whether we describe the principle
under which judges are allowed to deny recovery to a plaintiff by an
old-fashioned Latin name or by the currently fashionable concept of ‘public
policy’, the underlying problem remains the same: under what circumstances
should the immoral or criminal conduct of a plaintiff bar the plaintiff from
recovering damages to which he or she would otherwise be entitled.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">My own view is that courts should
be allowed to bar recovery in tort on the ground of the plaintiff’s immoral or
illegal conduct only in very limited circumstances. The basis of this power, as
I see it, lies in duty of the courts to preserve the integrity of the legal
system, and is exercisable only where this concern is in issue. This concern is
in issue where a damage award in a civil suit would, in effect, allow a person
to profit from illegal or wrongful conduct, or would permit an evasion or
rebate of a penalty prescribed by the criminal law. The idea common to these
instances is that the law refuses to give by its right hand what it takes away
by its left hand.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">After examining cases in which damages were refused when
they represented a loss of benefits which would have been derived from an
illegal contract or activity, she observed, at p 176:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“A more satisfactory explanation
for these cases, I would venture, is that to allow recovery in these cases
would be to allow recovery for what is illegal. It would put the courts in the
position of saying that the same conduct is both legal, in the sense of being
capable of rectification by the court, and illegal. It would, in short,
introduce an inconsistency in the law. It is particularly important in this
context that we bear in mind that the law must aspire to be a unified
institution, the parts of which - contract, tort, the criminal law - must be in
essential harmony. For the courts to punish conduct with the one hand while
rewarding it with the other, would be to ‘create an intolerable fissure in the
law’s conceptually seamless web’.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Her conclusion, at pp 179-180, was that:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:32.55pt;margin-bottom:
26.0pt;margin-left:72.0pt">“… there is a need in the law of tort for a
principle which permits judges to deny recovery to a plaintiff on the ground
that to do so would undermine the integrity of the justice system. The power is
a limited one. Its use is justified where allowing the plaintiff’s claim would
introduce inconsistency into the fabric of the law, either by permitting the
plaintiff to profit from an illegal or wrongful act, or to evade a penalty
prescribed by criminal law.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber"><i>Hall v Hebert</i> was a tort case, and the
implications of illegality are not in all respects the same in the law of tort
as in they are other branches of law. I shall return to this point below. But,
as McLachlin J pointed out in the passage cited, the law is a unified
institution. At the most fundamental level of policy, its internal coherence
requires that contract, tort and criminal law should be in harmony.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In practice the illegality principle has almost invariably been raised
as a defence to a civil claim based on a breach of the criminal law. In <i>Les
Laboratoires Servier v Apotex Inc</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2014/55.html">[2015] AC 430</a>, this court held that with
immaterial exceptions the defence is available only in such cases. This
conclusion tends to reinforce the significance of the principle of consistency
as a rationale. The civil courts of the state cannot coherently give effect to
legal rights founded on criminal acts which are contrary to the state’s public
law. There is no reason to regard this as any less important according to
whether the civil claim lies in contract or tort.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para232">232.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The English courts have taken a broader view than McLachlan J did of
what constitutes “profiting” from an illegal act, but that is by the way. Her
rationalisation of the illegality principle as being based on the consistency
and internal coherence of the law has been consistently adopted in England in
tort and contract cases alike by this court and by the Appellate Committee of
the House of Lords before it: see<i> R v Islam</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2009/30.html">[2009] AC 1076</a>, para 38

<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/23.html">[2016] AC 1</a>, para 172 (Lord Toulson and Lord Hodge). In <i>Gray v Thames Trains</i>
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2009/33.html">[2009] 1 AC 1339</a>, Lord Hoffmann (with whom the rest of the Appellate Committee
agreed) put forward the principle of consistency as the rationale of what he
called the “narrower rule” precluding the recovery of damages representing loss
directly arising from the sentence of a criminal court. He was inclined to
think that the “wider rule” that a person cannot recover for damage which is
the consequence of his own criminal act was based on a different principle
concerned with “public notions of the fair distribution of resources”: para 51,
and cf Lord Rodger at para 84. Certainly, the inconsistency of awarding damages
representing loss arising from a criminal sentence is more obvious and direct
than it is when the claimant is claiming other damages causally flowing from
his commission of a crime. But it seems to me, as it did to McLachlan J and
those who have adopted her approach more generally, that the internal coherence
of the law is also the reason why it will not give effect in a civil court to a
cause of action based on acts which it would punish in a criminal court. As
Lord Hughes put it in <i>Hounga v Allen</i> (para 55), a dissenting judgment
but not on this point, “the law must act consistently; it cannot give with one
hand what it takes away with another, nor condone when facing right what it
condemns when facing left.”</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">When is a civil claim “founded” on an illegal act?</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The starting point is that the courts exist to provide remedies in
support of legal rights. It is fundamental that any departure from that concept
should have a clear justification grounded in principle, and that it should be
no more extensive than is required by that principle. The underlying principle
is that for reasons of consistency the court will not give effect, at the suit
of a person who committed an illegal act (or someone claiming through him), to
a right derived from that act.</a></p><a name="para233">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The test which has usually been adopted for determining whether this
principle applies is the reliance test. The question is whether the person
making the claim is obliged to rely in support of it on an illegal act on his
part. The reliance test is implicit in Lord Mansfield’s statement of principle,
which assumes that the plaintiff’s action is “founded on” his illegal act. But
the modern origin of the test is the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Bowmakers
Ltd v Barnet Instruments Ltd</i> [1945] 1 KB 65, which concerned a hire
purchase agreement illegal under wartime regulations. When the hirer disposed
of the goods, the owner was held entitled to damages for conversion
notwithstanding the illegality, because his right of action was based on his
ownership. He could establish that without relying on the illegal hire purchase
agreement. The reliance test was subsequently approved by the Privy Council in <i>Singh
v Ali</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKPC/1959/1959_29.html">[1960] AC 167</a> and<i> Chettiar v Chettiar</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKPC/1962/1962_4.html">[1962] AC 294</a> and by the
House of Lords in <i>Tinsley v Milligan</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1993/3.html">[1994] 1 AC 340</a>. All of these
decisions, were about title to property, real or personal. But in <i>Clunis v
Camden and Islington Health Authority</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1997/2918.html">[1998] QB 978</a> the Court of Appeal
applied it to a claim in tort. In <i>St John Shipping Co Ltd v Joseph Rank Ltd</i>
[1957] 1 QB 267, 291-292, Devlin J had applied it to a claim for freight under
a contract of carriage. In <i>Hewison v Meridian Shipping Services PTE Ltd</i>
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2002/1821.html">[2003] ICR 766</a>, the Court of Appeal applied it to a concurrent claim for
damages in contract and tort in which the measure of damages depended on the
terms of a contract. The claimant’s action for damages against his employer for
an injury at work failed because in order to prove his loss of earnings he had
to show that he would have continued to deceive his employer about his fitness
to operate machinery, as he had in the past.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para235">235.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There is, as these decisions suggest, nothing about the reliance test
that limits its relevance to certain causes of action. But the test may apply
in different ways, depending on what it is that the law regards as illegal. In
a tort case or a property case it is generally enough to identify the illegal
act and demonstrate the dependence of the cause of action upon the facts making
it illegal. In a contract case, the position is less straightforward. A contract
may be affected by illegality because terms lawful in themselves are intended
to be performed in an illegal way or for an illegal purpose not apparent from
the contract itself. This does not mean that contracts vitiated by this
circumstance can be enforced simply by putting the case without reference to
the illegal purpose or proposed mode of performance. It is enough to give rise
to the defence that the claimant must rely on a contract which is in fact
illegal, whether that is apparent from the terms or not.</a></p><a name="para235">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para235"></a><a name="para236">236.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The problem about the reliance test is not so much the test itself as
the way in which it was applied in <i>Tinsley v Milligan</i>. The facts of that
case are well known. Ms Tinsley and Ms Milligan contributed in approximately
equal shares to the cost of buying a house in which both of them intended to
live and run their lodging rooms business. They decided that it would be
conveyed into the sole name of Ms Tinsley so as to enable Ms Milligan to
defraud the Department of Social Security by pretending that she did not own
her home and paid rent. Ms Tinsley claimed an order for possession on the
footing that she was the sole owner. The Appellate Committee held by a majority
that Ms Milligan was entitled to assert a 50% interest in the house
notwithstanding the illegal purpose for which it had been conveyed into Ms
Tinsley’s sole name. There were two stages in the reasoning of Lord
Browne-Wilkinson, who delivered the leading speech for the majority. The first
was that where property is transferred for an illegal purpose, the transferee
nevertheless obtains a good title, notwithstanding that the transaction being
illegal it would not have been specifically enforced. This is so whether the
title in question is legal or equitable. The decision of the majority on this
point settled a question on which there had been inconsistent authorities
dating back to the beginning of the 19th century. It did so in a way which
reflected the law’s traditional reluctance to disturb settled titles. The result
represents a notable difference between the law relating to the creation of
legal or equitable titles and the law relating to contractual obligations
generally. It means that although a contract may be vitiated by its illegal
purpose or the illegal way in which it was intended to be performed, this is not
true of title to property. It followed in that case that Ms Tinsley had a good
title to the disputed property. The second stage of the reasoning was that an
equitable interest in the property would also be recognised, provided that the
person claiming it was not “forced to plead or rely on the illegality” (p
376E). In Ms Milligan’s case, equity presumed a resulting trust in her favour
by virtue only of her contribution to the purchase price. She did not therefore
have to plead or prove the reasons why the property had been conveyed into Ms
Tinsley’s sole name. It followed that she could make good her claim to an interest.</a></p><a name="para236">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para236"></a><a name="para237">237.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The problem about this is that it makes the illegality principle depend
on adventitious procedural matters, such as the rules of pleading, the
incidence of the burden of proof and the various equitable presumptions. If Ms
Tinsley had been a man and Ms Milligan had been his daughter, the decision
would have gone the other way because the presumption of resulting trust would
have been replaced by a presumption of advancement. She would have had to rebut
it by reference to the actual facts. This is what the Privy Council decided in <i>Chettiar
v Chettiar</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKPC/1962/1962_4.html">[1962] AC 294</a> and the Court of Appeal in <i>Collier v Collier</i>
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2002/1095.html">[2002] BPIR 1057</a>, in both of which property was gratuitously transferred for an
illegal purpose by a father to his son or daughter. The father was accordingly
unable to establish his interest. Yet the distinction between these cases and <i>Tinsley
v Milligan</i> is completely arbitrary. This is because the equitable
presumptions operate wholly procedurally, and have nothing to do with the
principle which the court is applying in illegality cases.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para238">238.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In <i>Nelson v Nelson</i> </a><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/25.html">[1995] HCA 25</a>, (1995) 184 CLR 538, the majority’s analysis in
<i>Tinsley v Milligan</i> was criticised on this ground in the High Court of
Australia: see pp 579-580 (Dawson J), 592-593 (Toohey J), 609-610 (McHugh J). In
my opinion, these criticisms are justified, although I would not go as far as
McHugh did in <i>Nelson v Nelson</i>. He, alone among the judges of the High
Court of Australia, would have jettisoned the reliance test altogether. What
then is the true principle? In property cases, as the House held in <i>Tinsley
v Milligan</i>, title is not vitiated by an antecedent illegal arrangement. An
equitable interest in property may accordingly arise from a tainted scheme.
Whether an equitable interest exists depends on the intentions of the parties.
The true principle is that the application of the illegality principle depends
on what facts the court must be satisfied about in order to find an intention
giving rise to an equitable interest. It does not depend on how those facts are
established. Ms Milligan was entitled to the interest which she claimed in the
property because she paid half of the price and there was no intention to make
a gift. That was all that the court needed to be satisfied about. Likewise, if <i>Collier
v Collier</i> were to come before the courts today, the result should be the
same notwithstanding that the equitable presumption went the other way. Mr
Collier leased his property to his daughter for an illegal purpose, namely to
deceive his creditors in the event that he became insolvent. He had an
equitable interest in the property because the lease was gratuitous and there
was no intention to make a gift. It would make no difference to the recognition
of that interest that the purpose of the transaction was illegal. Why he chose
to organise his affairs in that way would no doubt emerge in the course of the
evidence, but would be irrelevant to the facts which founded his claim. The
point was well made by Dawson J in <i>Nelson v Nelson</i>, at p 580:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“There may be an illegal purpose
for the transfer of the property and that may bear upon the question of
intention, but it is the absence of any intention to make a gift upon which
reliance must be placed to rebut the presumption of advancement. Intention is
something different from a reason or motive. The illegal purpose may thus be
evidentiary, but it is not the foundation of a claim to rebut the presumption
of advancement.”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Shorn of the arbitrary refinements introduced by the equitable
presumptions, which in any event apply only in property cases, the reliance
test accords with principle. First, it gives effect to the basic principle that
a person may not derive a legal right from his own illegal act. Second, it
establishes a direct causal link between the illegality and the claim,
distinguishing between those illegal acts which are collateral or matters of
background only, and those from which the legal right asserted can be said to
result. Third, it ensures that the illegality principle applies no more widely
than is necessary to give effect to its purpose of preventing legal rights from
being derived from illegal acts. The reliance test is the narrowest test of
connection available. Every alternative test which has been proposed would

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This last objection applies in particular to the main alternative test
which has been proposed in the case law, namely that the facts relied upon
should be “inextricably linked” with the illegal act. The difficulty about
inextricable linkage as a test of connection is that it is far from clear what
it means. On the face of it, the only link between the illegal act and the
claim which is truly “inextricable”, is a link based on causation and necessary
reliance. So far as the test of inextricable linkage broadens the required
connection more widely, it seems to me to be contrary to principle. Its vices
may be illustrated by reference to the decision in <i>Cross v Kirkby</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2000/426.html">[2000] EWCA Civ 426</a>, The Times 5 April 2000, where it was first proposed by Beldam LJ.
The facts were that a hunt saboteur started a fight with a hunt follower at a
meet and came out of it worst. He ended up with a fractured skull, and sued the
hunt follower for damages occasioned by his injuries. The main issue was
whether the hunt follower had defended himself with excessive force. Beldam LJ
held that he had not. But in case he was wrong about that, he held that the
saboteur’s injuries were inextricably linked with the fact that he had started
the fight, so that his claim was barred by the illegality principle. Otton LJ
agreed generally with Beldam LJ, but Judge LJ agreed only on the primary
ground. To my mind, Beldam LJ’s alternative ground was unprincipled. It only
arose if the hunt follower responded to the attack with excessive force, and on
that footing it was irrelevant who started the fight. The illegality principle
served simply to deprive the plaintiff of a proper claim arising from the
unlawful use of excessive force against him. The case illustrates the tendency
of any test broader than the reliance test to degenerate into a question of
instinctive judicial preference for one party over another.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To the principle that a person may not rely on his own illegal act in
support of his claim, there are significant exceptions, which are as old as the
principle itself and generally inherent in it. These are broadly summed up in
the proposition that the illegality principle is available only where the
parties were <i>in pari delicto</i> in relation to the illegal act. This
principle must not be misunderstood. It does not authorise a general enquiry
into their relative blameworthiness. The question is whether they were <u>legally</u>
on the same footing. The case law discloses two main categories of case where
the law regards the parties as not being <i>in pari delicto</i>, but both are
based on the same principle.</a></p><a name="para241">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>One comprises cases in which the claimant’s participation in the illegal
act is treated as involuntary: for example, it may have been brought about by fraud,
undue influence or duress on the part of the defendant who seeks to invoke the
defence. The best-known example is <i>Burrows v Rhodes</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpKQB/1899/60.html">[1899] 1 QB 816</a>,
where the illegality consisted in the plaintiff having enlisted in the defendant’s
private army for the Jameson raid, contrary to the Foreign Enlistment Act 1870.
The illegality principle was held not to arise because he had been induced to
do so by the defendant’s fraudulent misrepresentation that the raid had the
sanction of the Crown, which if true would have made it legal. Cases in which
the illegality consisted in the act of another for which the claimant is
responsible only by virtue of a statute imposing strict liability, fall into
the same category: see <i>Osman v J Ralph Moss Ltd</i> [1970] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 313;
<i>Les Laboratoires Servier v Apotex</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2014/55.html">[2015] AC 430</a>, para 29. In such cases,
however, the construction and purpose of the statute in question will call for
careful attention.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The other category comprises cases in which the application of the
illegality principle would be inconsistent with the rule of law which makes the
act illegal. The paradigm case is a rule of law intended to protect persons
such as the plaintiff against exploitation by the likes of the defendant. Such
a rule will commonly require the plaintiff to have a remedy notwithstanding
that he participated in its breach. The exception generally arises in the
context of acts made illegal by statute. In <i>Browning v Morris</i> (1778) 2
Cowp 790, 792, Lord Mansfield expressed the point in this way:</a></p><a name="para243">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Where contracts or transactions
are prohibited by positive statutes for the sake of protecting one set of men
from another set of men, the one, from their situation and condition being
liable to be oppressed or imposed upon by the other, there the parties are not <i>in
pari delicto</i>; and in furtherance of these statutes, the person injured,
after the transaction is finished and completed, may bring his action and
defeat the contract.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaNoNumber"><a name="para243">The classic modern illustration is <i>Kiriri Cotton Co
Ltd v Dewani</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKPC/1959/1959_27.html">[1960] AC 192</a>, in which a tenant was held entitled to recover
an illegal premium paid to the landlord, notwithstanding that his payment of it
involved participating in a breach of an ordinance regulating tenancies. Lord
Denning, delivering the advice of the Privy Council, observed at p 205 that: “The
duty of observing the law is firmly placed by the Ordinance on the shoulders of
the landlord for the protection of the tenant.” <i>Hounga v Allen</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2014/47.html">[2014] 1 WLR 2889</a> on its facts illustrates the same principle. The claimant had been
illegally trafficked into the United Kingdom by her employer. Her vulnerability
on that account enabled her employer to exploit and ultimately to dismiss her.
An attempt to bar her claim for unlawful discrimination on account of her
participation in her own illegal trafficking failed. There was no claim under
the employment contract itself, which was illegal, but it may well be that a
claim for a <i>quantum meruit</i> for services performed would have succeeded
on the same ground. There is New York authority for such a result: see <i>Nizamuddowlah
v Bengal Cabaret Inc</i> (1977) 399 NYS 2d 854.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Protective statutes are the plainest examples of rules of law which
implicitly exclude the operation of the illegality principle, but they are not
the only ones. Some statutes, on their proper construction, are inconsistent
with the application of the illegality principle even if they are in no sense
protective. The statutory prohibitions against the overloading of ships are
wholly directed to the operational safety of ships and their crews. On that
ground, among others, Devlin J held in <i>St John Shipping Corpn v Joseph Rank
Ltd</i> [1957] 1 QB 267 that a breach of the Merchant Shipping (Safety and Load
Line Conventions) Act 1932 did not justify shippers and bill of lading holders
in defending an action for freight. For the same reason, the illegality
principle has been held to have no application to claims to contribution under
the Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978. The reason is that this would be
inconsistent with the scheme of the Act: <i>K v P</i> [1993] Ch 140. In <i>Stone
and Rolls Ltd v Moore Stephens</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2009/39.html">[2009] AC 1391</a>, three members of the

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>English law does not have a unified theory of restitution. Failure or
absence of basis, which supplies such a theory in most civil law systems, was
rejected as the overarching rationale of the law of restitution in <i>Woolwich
Equitable Building Society v Inland Revenue Comrs</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1992/TC_65_265.html">[1993] AC 70</a>, 172 (Lord
Goff). For the moment, therefore, as Lord Hoffmann observed in <i>Deutsche
Morgan Grenfell Group plc v Inland Revenue Comrs</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/49.html">[2007] 1 AC 558</a>, para 21,
“the claimant has to prove that the circumstances in which the payment was made
come within one of the categories which the law recognizes as sufficient to
make retention by the recipient unjust.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para247">247.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is nonetheless true that failure of basis is the reason (or at least
a reason) why the retention of a benefit is treated in some categories of case
as unjust. One of these is the category of case in which a money benefit is
conferred on the recipient under or in anticipation of a contract and the basis
for that transfer has failed, for example by frustration, total failure of consideration
or want of contractual capacity or <i>vires</i> on the part of one of the
parties. As a general rule, benefits transferred under a contract which is void
or otherwise legally ineffective are recoverable: <i>Westdeutsche Landesbank
Girozentrale v Islington London Borough Council</i> [1994] 4 All ER 890
(Hobhouse J), approved (<i>obiter</i>) on appeal to the House of Lords </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1996/12.html">[1996] AC 669</a>, 681-682 (Lord Goff), 714 (Lord Browne-Wilkinson), 723 (Lord Woolf). In <i>Guinness
Mahon &amp; Co Ltd v Kensington and Chelsea Royal London Borough Council</i>
[1999] QB 215, the Court of Appeal held that the ineffectiveness of the
transaction was a ground of restitution independent of total failure of
consideration, and therefore available even if the contract had been partly
performed. The reason, as Morritt LJ observed (p 230) is that: “The bank did
not get in exchange for that performance all it expected, for it did not get
the benefit of the contractual obligation.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para248">248.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>One would expect the same reasoning to apply where the contract is
unenforceable for illegality. In fact, however, the courts have not said this.
The reason is that they have treated restitution as being available only where
the payer was entitled to a <i>locus poenitentiae</i> in which to withdraw from
the transaction. The breadth of this <i>locus</i> has varied with judicial
fashion, but for much of the 20th century it was very narrowly interpreted
indeed. This approach is not consistent with the recognition of a general right
to the restitution of money paid under an illegal contract, in spite of the
close analogy with other cases of ineffective contracts.</a></p><a name="para248">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para248"></a><a name="para249">249.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In one sense, the contract between these parties may be said to have
been frustrated by the failure of the inside information to materialise, or to
have resulted in a total failure of consideration because as a result the
shares were never purchased. But that cannot be an adequate explanation of the
reason why someone in Mr Patel’s position may be entitled to restitution even
on the limited basis which the concept of a <i>locus poenitentiae</i> allows.
That concept permits the recovery of money paid even before (indeed, especially
before) the time for performance has arrived, and therefore in many cases before
the contract was frustrated or the question of failure of consideration could
arise. The ground of restitution in these circumstances can only be that the
contract was illegal and that the basis for the payment had failed.</a></p><a name="para249">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para249"></a><a name="para250">250.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Of course, in order to demonstrate that the basis for the payment had
failed, Mr Patel must say what that basis was, which would necessarily disclose
its illegality. In my opinion, the reason why the law should nevertheless allow
restitution in such a case is that it does not offend the principle applicable
to illegal contracts. That principle, as I have suggested above, is that the
courts will not give effect to an illegal transaction or to a right derived
from it. But restitution does not do that. It merely recognises the
ineffectiveness of the transaction and gives effect to the ordinary legal
consequences of that state of affairs. The effect is to put the parties in the
position in which they would have been if they had never entered into the
illegal transaction, which in the eyes of the law is the position which they
should always have been in.</a></p><a name="para250">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The judges who first formulated the modern law of illegality at the end
of the 18th century had no difficulty about this. In <i>Smith v Bromley</i>
(1760) 2 Doug 696n, 697, one of Lord Mansfield’s earliest statements on this
area of law, he thought that restitution of an illegal consideration was
“necessary for the better support and maintenance of the law”. In <i>Neville v
Wilkinson</i> (1782) Lord Chancellor Thurlow referred to this statement and
“declared his opinion, that, in all cases where money was paid for an unlawful
purpose, the party, though <em>particeps criminis</em>, might recover at law;
and that the reason was, that if courts of justice mean to prevent the
perpetration of crimes, it must be not by allowing a man who has got possession
to remain in possession, but by putting the parties back to the state in which
they were before”. This was the basis on which relief was granted, at any rate
by Mellish LJ and Bagallay LJ, in <i>Taylor v Bowers</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpKQB/1876/29.html">(1876) 1 QBD 291</a>
traditionally regarded as the leading case, and by Lord Atkinson delivering the
advice of the Privy Council in <i>Petherpermal Chetty v Muniandi Servai</i>
(1908) LR 35 Ind App 98, 103.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para252">252.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the course of the twentieth century, the law took a different and to
my mind less satisfactory turn. The courts began to treat the right of
restitution as depending on the moral quality of the plaintiff’s decision to
withdraw. They reasoned that if the object of allowing restitution was to
encourage withdrawal from an illegal venture, it ought to be withheld if the claimant
had withdrawn involuntarily, for example because the other party withdrew first
or the venture became impossible or failed for some reason other than his
genuine regret. Although there are earlier traces of this notion, it is first
overtly expressed in <i>Parkinson v College of Ambulance</i> [1925] 2 KB 1, 16,
where Lush J suggested that there was no <i>locus poenitentiae</i> if there was
no penitence. It may be said to have reached its high point in the three
decisions in <i>Alexander v Rayson</i> [1936] 1 KB 169, <i>Berg v Sadler &amp;
Moore</i> [1937] 2 KB 158 and <i>Bigos v Bousted</i> [1951] 1 All ER 92. The
concept of penitential withdrawal leads to difficult distinctions and suggests
an enquiry into a party’s state of mind of a kind which the law rarely contemplates.
It was rejected, rightly to my mind, by Millett LJ in <i>Tribe v Tribe</i>
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1995/20.html">[1996] Ch 107</a>, 135 “Justice is not a reward for merit”, he said: “restitution
should not be confined to the penitent.” I agree. But for the same reason I
would reject the suggestion that Millett LJ went on to make that the right to
restitution should still depend on the voluntary character of the plaintiff’s
withdrawal. As with the notion of penitence, this is to put a moral gloss on a
principle that depends simply on the right to restitution that in principle follows
from the legal ineffectiveness of the contract under or in anticipation of
which the money was paid.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para253">253.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The courts’ view about when the right of restitution ceases to be
available has closely reflected the way in which they have analysed that right.
At the outset, and throughout the 19th century, they held that the right of
restitution ceased in contract cases once the contract had been executed at
least in part. The reason for this was that they viewed the right of
restitution as arising from a principle analogous to rescission for mistake or
misrepresentation. They therefore applied to it the then current doctrine that
an executed contract could not be rescinded at law except for fraud. In <i>Lowry
v Bourdieu</i> (1780) 2 Doug 468, 471, Buller J observed that in this context
there was a “sound distinction between contracts executed and executory; and if
an action is brought to rescind a contract, you must do it while the contract
continues executory”. Lord Mansfield, who sat in that case, presumably agreed,
for he had expressed the same view less expansively in <i>Browning v Morris</i>
(1778) 2 Cowp 790. Later, when the courts came to regard the <i>locus poenitentiae</i>
as depending on the moral quality of the plaintiff’s reason for resiling, they
reframed the proposition so as to suggest that the right of restitution ceased
to be available when the illegal purpose of the venture had been carried out.
This might be the same as the point of time when the contract was executed. But
it might be later, as in the numerous cases where a person nominally
transferred his property to another with a view to defrauding his creditors.
This test seems to me to be practically unworkable. Are we to distinguish
between cases where the relevant representation was never made to the creditors
and cases where it was but they did not believe it? More fundamentally, it
proceeds from the same spurious moral gloss on the legal principle as the
notion that the claimant’s withdrawal must have been voluntary or penitent. The
rule against rescinding executed contracts has now gone, and the limitation to
cases in which the unlawful purpose has not been carried out never was sound.
The rational rule, which I would hold to be the law, is that restitution is
available for so long as mutual restitution of benefits remains possible. In
most such cases, the same facts will give rise to a defence of change of
position.</a></p><a name="para253">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I would also reject the dicta, beginning with <i>Tappenden v Randall</i>
(1801) 2 B&amp;P 467, 470 and <i>Kearley v Thomson</i> (1890) 24 QBD 742, 747,
to the effect that there may be some crimes so heinous that the courts will
decline to award restitution in any circumstances. There are difficulties about
distinguishing between degrees of illegality on what must inevitably be a
purely subjective basis. But the suggestion is in any event contrary to
principle. If I pay £10,000 to a hitman to kill my enemy, he should not kill my
enemy and should not have £10,000. The fact that when it comes to the point he
is unwilling or unable to kill my enemy does not give him any legal or moral
entitlement to keep the £10,000. If he does kill him, the rational response is
the same. He should be convicted of murder, but he should never have received
the money for such a purpose and by the same token should not be allowed to
retain it. Of course, in practice, this is all rather artificial. In a case
involving heinous crimes, both parties would be exposed to confiscation orders
under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. St Thomas Aquinas thought the ideal
solution to such a conundrum was that neither party should have the money,
which should be paid to charity: <i>Summa Theologica</i> II.2, Q 62, para 5.
The courts have no power to order that, but statute has now intervened to produce
something like the same result.</a></p><a name="para254">

</span>I say nothing about cases in which an order for restitution would be
functionally indistinguishable from an order for enforcement, as in a case of
an illegal loan or foreign exchange transaction. The traditional view is that
if the law will not enforce an agreement it will not give the same financial
relief under a different legal label: <i>Boissevain v Weil</i> [1950] AC 327. I
am inclined to think that the principle is sound, but I should prefer not to
express a concluded view on the point. It is not the position here.</a></p><a name="para255">

remember that the search for principle which led McLachlin J to identify
consistency as the foundation of this area of law was a response to the
judgment of Cory J in the same case. He had favoured a more flexible test for
applying the illegality principle, which would have depended on whether the
relevant public policy required that result on the facts of each case: see p
205. That approach was not accepted by the rest of the court. Part of McLachlin
J’s concern about it arose from</a></p><a name="para257">

16, and the exercise need not be repeated here. In summary, Lord Goff objected
to a test for applying the illegality principle which would require the court
to “weigh, or balance, the adverse consequences of respectively granting or
refusing relief” (p 358E-F). The adoption of such a test, he considered, at p
363, “would constitute a revolution in this branch of the law, under which what
is in effect a discretion would become vested in the court to deal with the
matter by the process of a balancing operation, in place of a system of rules,
ultimately derived from the principle of public policy enunciated by Lord
Mansfield CJ in <i>Holman v Johnson</i>”. On this point, Lord Goff was
supported by the whole of the Appellate Committee.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For many years, the chief critic of this approach was the Law Commission,
which at one stage proposed legislation along the lines of the New Zealand Illegal
Contracts Act 1970 to make the application of the illegality principle subject
to a broad judicial discretion. More recently, Professor Burrows has proposed
that the same solution should be adopted by judicial decision, in his <i>Restatement
of the Law of Contract</i> (2016). He would make the application of the
illegality principle dependent, at any rate in contract cases, on a “range of
factors” approach. This would require the judge to assess whether to deny a
remedy would be an “appropriate response” to the claimant’s conduct, taking
account where relevant of eight factors. These factors are for the most part
derived from the Law Commission’s Consultative Report (paras 8.3, 8.11). They
are: (a) how seriously illegal or contrary to public policy the conduct was;
(b) whether the party seeking enforcement knew of, or intended, the conduct;
(c) how central to the contract or its performance the conduct was; (d) how
serious a sanction the denial of enforcement is for the party seeking
enforcement; (e) whether denying enforcement will further the purpose of the
rule which the conduct has infringed; (f) whether denying enforcement will act
as a deterrent to conduct that is illegal or contrary to public policy; (g)
whether denying enforcement will ensure that the party seeking enforcement does
not profit by the conduct; (h) whether denying enforcement will avoid
inconsistency in the law, thereby maintaining the integrity of the legal system.
Lord Toulson, in his judgment on the present appeal, supports this approach
while suggesting that yet further factors may also be relevant.</a></p><a name="para259">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>With the arguable exception of (a) and (d) all of the considerations
identified by Professor Burrows have been influential factors in the
development of the rules of law comprised in the illegality principle as it
stands today. Thus (b) is reflected in the requirement that, except where the
making of the contract was itself illegal, there should have been some degree
of participation by the claimant in the illegal act. It is also reflected in
the exception for cases in which he was liable for the acts of another by
virtue only of a rule imposing strict liability. As to (c), the purpose of the
reliance test is to confine the illegality principle to cases in which the
illegal act was truly central. Factor (e) is the basis of the exception
discussed earlier in this judgment for cases in which the application of the
illegality principle would be inconsistent with the legal rule which makes the
act illegal, for example because its object is the protection of someone in the
position of the claimant. It is also the basis on which claims are allowed for
the restitution of money paid under an illegal contract. As to (f) and (g),
there can be no doubt that historically the hope of deterring illegal conduct
and depriving those responsible of any benefit arising from it have been important
factors in the development of the illegality principle, although I personally
doubt whether any but the best-advised litigants have enough knowledge of the
law to be deterred by it. Factor (h), as I have suggested, is the most widely
accepted rationale for the illegality principle in the modern law.</a></p><a name="para260">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The real issue, as it seems to me, is whether the “range of factors”
identified by the Law Commission and Professor Burrows are to be regarded (i)
as part of the policy rationale of a legal rule and the various exceptions to
that rule, or (ii) as matters to be taken into account by a judge deciding in
each case whether to apply the legal rule at all. As matters stand, the former
approach represents the law. The latter would require the courts to “weigh, or
balance, the adverse consequences of respectively granting or refusing relief”
on a case by case basis, which was the very proposition that the House of Lords
unanimously rejected in <i>Tinsley v Milligan</i>. We are entitled to change
the law, but if we do that we should do it openly, acknowledging what we are
doing and assessing the consequences, including the indirect consequences, so
far as we can foresee them. In my opinion, it would be wrong to transform the
policy factors which have gone into the development of the current rules, into
factors influencing an essentially discretionary decision about whether those
rules should be applied. Neither party contended for such a result, and their
reticence was in my view entirely justified. It would be unprincipled and
uncertain, and far from confining the ambit of the illegality principle to its
essential minimum, it could only broaden it beyond its proper limits. Perhaps
most important of all, justice can be achieved without taking this
revolutionary step.</a></p><a name="para261">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para261"></a><a name="para262">262.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The reason why the application of the “range of factors” test on a case
by case basis is unprincipled is that it loses sight of the reason why legal
rights can ever be defeated on account of their illegal factual basis. It is I
think right to make four points:</a></p><a name="para262">

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">i)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Whatever rationale one adopts for the illegality principle, it is
manifestly designed to vindicate the public interest as against the interests
and legal rights of the parties. That is why the judge is required to take the
point of his own motion even if the parties have not raised it, as the deputy judge
did in this case. The operation of the principle cannot therefore depend on an
evaluation of the equities as between the parties or the proportionality of its
impact upon the claimant.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">ii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The “range of factors” test largely devalues the principle of
consistency, by relegating it to the status of one of a number of evaluative
factors, entitled to no more weight than the judge chooses to give it in the
particular case. The criminal law, which is in almost every case the source of
the relevant illegality, is a critical source of public policy. It is the prime
example of the “positive law” (Lord Mansfield’s phrase) which has always
moulded the law of illegality in civil proceedings. The courts cannot
consistently or coherently recognise legal consequences for an act which the
law treats as punishable. Gloster LJ, for example, thought it relevant that
there was no finding that Mr Patel knew that insider dealing was illegal. Yet
that would have been of no relevance in a criminal court, and it is difficult
to see why it should be any more relevant in a civil one. Professor Burrows’
factor (f) (whether denying enforcement will ensure that the party seeking
enforcement does not profit by the conduct) is surely fundamental to the
principle of consistency, and not just a factor to be weighed up against
others.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para262">iii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The main justification for the “range of factors” test has always been
that it enables the court to avoid inflicting loss on the claimant
disproportionate to the measure of his badness. This was the instinct that led
the Court of Appeal in <i>Euro-Diam Ltd v Bathurst</i> [1990] 1 QB 1 to propose
that the illegality principle should be applied only where the alternative
would be shocking to the public conscience. That concept was rejected in <i>Tinsley
v Milligan</i>. Since then, it has been suggested that there may be cases at
the opposite end of the spectrum of gravity, in which the offence was too
trivial to engage the illegality principle: see <i>Gray v Thames Trains Ltd</i>,
at para 83 (Lord Rodger). One would expect most if not all such offences to be
covered by the exception for cases in which the application of the illegality
principle would be inconsistent with the legal rule which makes the act
illegal. But, extremes apart, it is difficult to reconcile with any kind of
principle the notion that there may be degrees of illegality, as Professor
Burrows’ factor (a) seems to envisage. If the application of the illegality
principle is to depend on the court’s view of how illegal the illegality was or
how much it matters, there would appear to be no principle whatever to guide
the evaluation other than the judge’s gut instinct. This was why this court
recently rejected the view expressed by the Court of Appeal in <i>Les
Laboratoires Servier v Apotex Inc</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/593.html">[2013] Bus LR 80</a> that an illegal act
might nevertheless found a cause of action if it was not as wicked as all that.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">iv)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The “range of factors” test discards any requirement for an analytical
connection between the illegality and the claim, by making the nature of the
connection simply one factor in a broader evaluation of individual cases and
offering no guidance as to what sort of connection might be relevant. I have
already observed that the reliance test is the narrowest test available. If it
is no longer to be decisive, the possibility is opened up of an altogether
wider ambit for the illegality principle, extending to cases where the relevant
connection was remote or non-existent but other factors not necessarily
involving any connection at all, were thought to be compelling.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para263">263.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The reason why the adoption of a “range of factors” test on a case by
case basis would be uncertain is obvious in the light of these considerations.
An evaluative test dependent on the perceived relevance and relative weight to
be accorded in each individual case to a large number of incommensurate factors
leaves a great deal to a judge’s visceral reaction to particular facts.
Questions such as how illegal is illegality would admit of no predictable
answer, even if the responses of different judges were entirely uniform. In
fact, it is an inescapable truth that some judges are more censorious than
others. Far from resolving the uncertainties created by recent differences of
judicial opinion, the range of factors test would open a new era in this part
of the law. A new body of jurisprudence would be gradually built up to identify
which of a large range of factors should be regarded as relevant and what
considerations should determine the weight that they should receive. No one
factor would ever be decisive as a matter of law, only in some cases on their
particular facts. The size of the authorities bundles in this and other recent
appeals to this court on the illegality principle is testimony to the volume of
litigation which the principle has generated in every period of its history. I
do not suppose that those who are about to enter into an illegal transaction
are in the habit of studying the decisions of the courts on the point, but
those who advise them after the event do, and the resultant uncertainty is
likely to generate a great deal of wasteful and unnecessary litigation. I would
readily accept that certainty is not the only value, or even necessarily the
most important. But we are concerned in this case with the law of contract, an
area in which the value of certainty is very great. It is one thing to say that
a legal right may be overridden by a rule of law. It is another thing
altogether to make a legal right, and particularly a contractual right,
dependent on a judge’s view about whether in all the circumstances it ought to
be enforced.</a></p><a name="para263">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para263"></a><a name="para264">264.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Finally, I would point out that the adoption of such a revolutionary
change in hitherto accepted legal principle is unnecessary to achieve
substantial justice in the great majority of cases. The unsatisfactory features
of the illegality principle as it has traditionally been understood have often
been overstated, in part because of the way in which they were emphasised by
Lord Goff in <i>Tinsley v Milligan</i>. It was, he said, “not a principle of
justice; it is a principle of policy, whose application is indiscriminate and
so can lead to unfair consequences as between the parties to litigation” (p
355B-C). That observation, however, reflected his view that no equitable
interest in property could ever be claimed where the legal title had been
vested in another for dishonest purposes. The law had been stated in this way
by Lord Eldon at the beginning of the 19th century: see <i>Muckleston v Brown</i>
</a><a href="http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/EngR/1801/241.pdf">(1801) 6 Ves 52</a> and <i>Curtis v Perry</i> <a hred="http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/EngR/1802/125.pdf">(1802) 6 Ves 739</a>. But Lord Eldon’s
approach, although adopted by Lord Goff, was rejected by the majority of the
Committee. When the law of illegality is looked at as a whole, it is apparent
that although governed by rules of law, a considerable measure of flexibility
is inherent in those rules. In particular, they are qualified by principled exceptions
for (i) cases in which the parties to the illegal act are not on the same legal
footing and (ii) cases in which an overriding statutory policy requires that
the claimant should have a remedy notwithstanding his participation in the
illegal act. Properly understood and applied, these exceptions substantially
mitigate the arbitrary injustices which the illegality principle would
otherwise produce. At the same time, the wider availability of restitutionary
remedies which will result from the present decision will do much to mitigate
the injustices which have hitherto resulted from the principle that the loss
should lie where it falls.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para265">265.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For these reasons, I regret that I cannot agree with the conclusion of
Lord Toulson (para 109) that that the application of the illegality principle
should depend on</a></p><a name="para265">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“the policy factors involved and …
the nature and circumstances of the illegal conduct, in determining whether the
public interest in preserving the integrity of the justice system should result
in the denial of the relief claimed.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">In my opinion, this is far too vague and potentially far
too wide to serve as the basis on which a person may be denied his legal
rights. It converts a legal principle into an exercise of judicial discretion,
in the process exhibiting all the vices of “complexity, uncertainty,
arbitrariness and lack of transparency” which Lord Toulson attributes to the
present law. I would not deny that in the past the law of illegality has been a
mess. The proper response of this court is not to leave the problem to case by
case evaluation by the lower courts by reference to a potentially unlimited
range of factors, but to address the problem by supplying a framework of
principle which accommodates legitimate concerns about the present law. We
would be doing no service to the coherent development of the law if we simply
substituted a new mess for the old one.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">Application to the present case</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para265"></a><a name="para266">266.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Against that background it is in my view entirely clear that the transaction
into which these parties entered was affected by the illegality principle. The
agreement pleaded, and found by the deputy judge to have been made, was not
simply that Mr Mirza would place bets on movements of RBS shares for the joint
account of himself and Mr Patel, but that he would do so with the benefit of
inside information. Subject to immaterial exceptions, section 52 of the
Criminal Justice Act 1993 makes it an offence for a person in possession of
inside information to deal or encourage another person to deal in “securities”,
including contracts for differences. This was accordingly an agreement for Mr
Mirza to commit a criminal offence. It was also a criminal conspiracy to that
end.</a></p><a name="para266">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para266"></a><a name="para267">267.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Section 63(2) of the 1993 Act provides that: “No contract shall be void
or unenforceable by reason only of section 52.” The contracts affected by
section 52 are contracts by way of dealing in securities. It follows that if Mr
Mirza had placed the spread bets with IG Index, as he had conditionally
promised to do, the contract would have been enforceable as between himself and
IG Index. But Mr Patel could not have obtained specific performance of the
distinct contract between himself and Mr Mirza or damages for breach of it.
This is because, first, he would have had to rely on the contract, which
provided as one of its terms that the dealing should be carried out with the
benefit of inside information. Mr Patel could not have avoided this result by
simply characterising it as an agreement to speculate in RBS shares without
referring to the basis on which it was agreed that that should happen. Secondly,
none of the possible exceptions apply. The parties were on the same legal
footing. Both would be liable to conviction for conspiracy in a criminal court,
and any difference in the degree of their fault would be relevant only to the
sentence. Section 52 of the Criminal Justice Act 1993 is not a statute designed
to protect the interests of persons entering into an agreement to commit the
offence of insider dealing, and there is no other overriding statutory policy
which requires their participation in the offence to be overlooked when it
comes to determining its civil consequences.</a></p><a name="para267">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para267"></a><a name="para268">268.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>However, restitution still being possible, none of this is a bar to Mr
Patel’s recovery of the £620,000 which he paid to Mr Mirza. The reason is
simply that although Mr Patel would have to rely on the illegal character of
the transaction in order to demonstrate that there was no legal basis for the
payment, an order for restitution would not give effect to the illegal act or
to any right derived from it. It would simply return the parties to the status
quo ante where they should always have been. The only ground on which that
could be objectionable is that the court should not sully itself by attending
to illegal acts at all, and that has not for many years been regarded as a
reputable foundation for the law of illegality. This was Gloster LJ’s main
reason for upholding Mr Patel’s right to recover the money. Although my
analysis differs in a number of respects from hers, I think that the
distinction which she drew between a claim to give effect to a right derived
from an illegal act, and a claim to unpick the transaction by an award of
restitution, was sound.</a></p><a name="para268">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para268"></a><a name="para269">269.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the circumstances, Mr Mirza’s only arguable defence was that he had
paid the money to Mr Georgiou, the intermediary who had proposed the deal. But
the judge declined to make a finding to this effect, and rejected a defence of
change of position on the ground that even if it was true, Mr Mirza had had no
reason to repay the money to anyone but Mr Patel from whom he had received it.</a></p><a name="para269">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para269"></a><a name="para270">270.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeal gave judgment for Mr Patel for £620,000 with
interest. For the reasons which I have given, which correspond to those given
by Lord Mance and Lord Clarke, I would dismiss the appeal against that order.</a></p><a name="para270">
