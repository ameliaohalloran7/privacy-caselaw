It concerns </a><a name="_Hlk41824669">the standard of proof, or degree of conclusivity, required for the determination of the result of an inquest into a death where the question is whether the deceased committed suicide. </a>The result of an inquest may be given in a single short form conclusion (using simply the word suicide) and/or in a brief narrative statement (“a narrative conclusion”). This appeal has to consider whether the degree of conclusivity is the same in both cases, and what it is.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2">2.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in the relevant primary legislation, which is the Coroners and Justice 2009 Act (“the 2009 Act”), about this. However, Note (iii) to the form for recording the results of an inquest prescribed by the Coroners (Inquests) Rules 2013 (SI 2013/1616) (“the 2013 Rules”) states the standard of proof for narrative conclusions is on a balance of probabilities, which is the rule (“the civil rule”) for civil proceedings, and for short form conclusions of ‘suicide’ and ‘unlawful killing’ it is the criminal standard, so the coroner or jury must be sure, and that means that they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. The civil rule applies in civil proceedings even if the issue is whether someone committed a criminal offence. A coroner’s inquest is not a criminal proceeding. At the time of the 2013 Rules, the common law was understood to be as stated in Note (iii). As I shall explain, there were at one time links between inquests and criminal proceedings. The 2013 Rules concretised the differential standard for short form and narrative conclusions in Note (iii). One of the issues on this appeal is whether that approach correctly reflects the common law, either historically or currently.</a></p><a name="para2">

The Divisional Court saw the logical difficulty in a situation where there might be narrative findings showing that the two elements of suicide were satisfied and yet no short form conclusion of suicide: </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2018/1955.html">[2018] EWHC 1955 (Admin)</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2018/1955.html">[2019] 1 All ER 561</a>. It held:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“A narrative conclusion to the effect that on the balance of probabilities the deceased did a deliberate act which caused his own death intending the outcome to be fatal clearly amounts to a conclusion that the deceased committed suicide whether or not the word ‘suicide’ is used. It is sophistry to say that such a conclusion is not one of suicide because the required standard of proof has not been met. The standard of proof even if referred to in the record of inquest, as it was in this case, is not itself part of the substantive conclusion adopted by the coroner or jury. It is simply a statement of the evidential test which must be met in order to reach a particular conclusion. If the standard of proof required to determine that the deceased committed suicide is the criminal standard and the necessary facts have been proved only on the balance of probabilities, this does not mean that a conclusion which records those facts is not one of suicide. It means that the coroner or jury cannot lawfully reach that conclusion.” (para 25)</p>

He was pronounced dead. He had had a history of mental health issues and was agitated on the previous evening and threatened self-harm. At the inquest into the circumstances of Mr James Maughan’s death, the coroner, the Senior Coroner for Oxfordshire, applying the Chief Coroner’s Guidance No 17: Conclusions: Short-Form and Narrative (referred to below as “Guidance No 17 issued by the Chief Coroner”), decided that the jury could not safely reach a short form conclusion of suicide on the basis of the criminal standard of proof, that is, on the basis that the jury was sure that Mr James Maughan had committed suicide. Nonetheless, the coroner considered that the jury should have the opportunity to make a narrative statement of the circumstances of Mr James Maughan’s death on a balance of probabilities. The jury answered the questions put to them by saying that the deceased had a history of mental health issues and that on a balance of probabilities the deceased intended fatally to hang himself and that increased vigilance would not have prevented his death. There was no short form conclusion of suicide. The appellant submits that this course was not open in law on the legal requirements as to standard of proof. If those standards were correctly applied, no issue is taken on the findings themselves.</a></p><a name="para5">

They result from the recent transformation of many inquests from the traditional inquiry into a suspicious death into an investigation which is to elicit the facts about what happened, and in appropriate cases identify lessons to be learnt for the future. This is the position in inquests which the state is now required to carry out because of the European Convention on Human Rights (enforceable in the domestic law of England and Wales since 2 October 2000). Article 2 of the Convention protects the right to life. One of the consequences of this is that there must generally be an effective investigation of deaths which occur while a person is in the custody of the state (“state-related deaths”), and one of the ways in which this obligation may be discharged is by holding a coroner’s inquest, in which the next of kin of the deceased can participate. The relevant principles of domestic law have been established by decisions of the courts, including, in particular, the decision of the House of Lords in <i>R (Middleton) v West Somerset Coroner </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2004/10.html">[2004] UKHL 10</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2004/10.html">[2004] 2 AC 182</a> (“<i>Middleton</i>”).</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“opens up the field for conclusions about underlying or contributory causes, such as failures to prevent suicide in prison. It may require a coroner to deliver (or elicit from a jury) a more extensive and judgmental form of narrative conclusion. The manner of eliciting such a conclusion in a jury case is for the coroner’s discretion but it is often done by means of questions (as in this case).” (para 19)</p>

It concerned a vulnerable 16-year-old boy, Joseph Scholes, who was sent to a young offender institution instead of a secure home for boys of his age and who shortly thereafter hanged himself. The inquest revealed a worrying situation with regard to the detention of young offenders and the Secretary of State was required to take steps to improve the situation. There had to be an increase in the number of places available in secure homes for such individuals. Even though his mother’s attempt to obtain a further inquiry failed, several improvements in the system resulted from the findings at the inquest. This case illustrates a point also made by the Chief Coroner that the family of the deceased often want findings to be made at an inquest so that steps can be taken to ensure that the same tragedy does not occur again.</p>

I will assume that, as in this case, the coroner sits with a jury. The purpose of the inquest is to determine how, when and where the deceased came by his death (2009 Act, section 5(1)). Where article 2 is engaged, “how, when and where” includes “in what circumstances the deceased came by his or her death” (2009 Act, section 5(2)). The inquest will generally hear evidence on these matters.</a></p><a name="para11">

The Convention does not require any particular standard of proof or degree of conclusivity for these findings. The coroner will determine which facts in issue are at the centre of the case. A narrative statement of facts will often be necessary to express the findings of the jury on these facts (<i>Middleton</i>, para 36, and Guidance No 17 issued by the Chief Coroner). The coroner may formulate some questions to help the jury, and their answers will form the narrative conclusions recorded at the end of the inquest. The conclusion in such a narrative is of a factual nature (<i>Middleton</i>, para 37). That is reinforced by section 10(2) of the 2009 Act, which provides that a determination may not be framed so as to appear to determine any question of any question of criminal responsibility on the part of any named person or any civil liability.</a></p><a name="para12">

Form 2 in the Schedule to the 2013 Rules is the mandatory prescribed form for this. The conclusion may be a short form conclusion which should be from the list provided in Form 2, such as suicide, accident or unlawful killing, but it may be or be also a narrative statement. Guidance No 17 issued by the Chief Coroner sets out a three-stage process for arriving at a conclusion, namely: (a) that the facts should be found (on the evidence); (b) that the manner in which the deceased came by his death should then be distilled from the narrative findings; and, (c) the conclusion flowing from (a) and (b) should then be recorded.</a></p><a name="para13">

Without in any way detracting from the importance of the Chief Coroner’s Guidance or the Coroners’ Bench Book, I do not repeat those passages in this judgment, save one, namely para 62 of the Chief Coroner’s Guidance, which advises on the possible explanation a coroner sitting without a jury might give where the coroner considers that suicide is not established to the criminal standard. Para 62 states:</a></p><a name="para18">

The issue was whether a statutory power to make rules for “the procedure on appeals” of a school’s independent appeal panel included power to make a rule that a decision to exclude a pupil should be taken on a balance of probabilities. W<span style="color:black">ilson LJ, as he then was, gave the leading judgment. He held that the power was wide enough to cover the question of the standard of proof to be applied by the tribunal. I agree with this. As Wilson LJ sets out, the word “procedure” should be given a wide, purposive meaning to enable it to cover all the steps in the proceedings:</span></p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The procedure on appeals is synonymous with the processing of appeals; and, when the panel takes the step (or reaches the stage) at which it determines a question whether a fact is established, a necessary part of its processing of that part of the appeal is to apply a particular standard of proof in reaching an answer to the question. A regulation about the inadmissibility of evidence of a specified character would in my view clearly fall within the rubric of ‘procedure on appeal’ and there is in my view no material difference between a requirement that the panel should exclude evidence of a specified character and a requirement that it should apply a specified standard of proof to its appraisal of such evidence as is properly before it.” (para 43)</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para22">22.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The expression of “practice and procedure” must have been intended to cover all the matters on which rules would be required for the efficient management of the inquests and so I see no reason therefore why the expression should not include the standard of proof to be required. The standard of proof is after all a necessary part of the process of making a determination and it is sometimes called the evidential standard, thus engaging the express provision in section 45(2)(a) authorising coroners rules to make “provision about evidence”. So far so good.</a></p><a name="para22">

Section 45 requires that the rules should be made “for”, that is, for the purpose of, “regulating the practice and procedure at or in connection with inquests”. That is the purpose of the power and the decision-maker must not use it for any other extraneous purpose. Such purpose may include the provision of a new regulation for a matter which is already regulated by some other means. I will return to this particular point later.</a></p><a name="para23">

They were preceded by a public consultation conducted by the Ministry of Justice (“MoJ”) on the draft 2013 Rules: <i>Implementing the coroner reforms in part one of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 consultation on rules, regulations, coroner areas and statutory guidance</i> CP 2/2013, 1 March 2013. This annexed Form 2 in draft, including Note (iii), but the body of the consultation document did not refer to the evidential standard. One of the consultation questions was:</a></p><a name="para24"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Question 18: &nbsp;Are you content with the draft rule and form on conclusions, determinations and findings? If not, how could they be improved?

Some of the consultees in their responses sought to raise the issue whether the standard of proof for the short form conclusion of suicide should be the civil standard, others sought to have the criminal standard applied. In the subsequently published analysis of responses, <i>Implementing the coroner reforms in Part 1 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 Response to consultation on rules, regulations, coroner areas and statutory guidance </i>4 July 2013 the MoJ recorded:</a></p><a name="para25"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“<b>Suicide standard of proof</b></p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">We also received comments on the most appropriate standard of proof needed for a coroner or jury to give a ‘suicide’ conclusion at an inquest. Under current practice (common law precedence), coroners may return a verdict of suicide only where the criminal standard of proof has been established, ie that it was beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased intended to take their own life. Some respondents expressed strong views on whether the current criminal standard should be replaced by the civil standard.” (internal p 37)</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para25"></a><a name="para26">26.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The MoJ response made it clear that the Government proposed to retain the standard established by case law:</a></p><a name="para26"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“As the requirement to use the criminal standard of proof when returning a suicide verdict is established under case law rather than coroner legislation we cannot take forward a change in the law through secondary legislation flowing from the 2009 Act.

Mr Straw submits that a mere consultation document and response would not be admissible on statutory interpretation in the same way that explanatory notes on an Act would be. But this is not so. The courts will look beyond explanatory notes (which are a comparatively recent innovation) in their endeavour to find the true intention of Parliament. In my judgment, the consultation documents and the response documents are documents which show the “mischief” to which Note (iii) was directed and their contents are therefore admissible when the courts seek to interpret Note (iii): see <i>Bennion on Statutory Interpretation</i>, 7th ed (2017), section 24.3 (“External aids to construction may be used for a variety of different purposes. For example, they may be used … to provide evidence as to the intended meaning of the words used …”). Moreover, the consultation document and the response document were made available to Parliament, which is of some weight when deciding whether they should be admissible on interpretation. What is clear from these documents is that the mischief to which Note (iii) was directed was not any dissatisfaction with the case law or policy objective of altering it. The Note was simply part and parcel of an exercise of updating the forms in the light of the 2009 Act.</a></p><a name="para27">

Such an approach was not, however, considered to be appropriate:</a></p><a name="para28"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Present practice is that most short form inquest ‘verdicts’ should be established to the civil standard of proof - the ‘balance of probabilities’ test. But for verdicts of ‘suicide’ and ‘unlawful killing’ it is the higher criminal standard of proof ‘beyond reasonable doubt’ which is applied. The justification for this appears to lie in the need for outcomes which determine, or appear to determine, legal liability (albeit not that of a named individual) to be reached on the basis of standards which are properly applicable in the appropriate civil or criminal court. It is not feasible, however, for such standards to be systematically applied in an inquisitorial process whose role is to determine what may be a set of complex and interrelated facts.” (para 30)</p>

It may be that this was in part because the Report also recommended a substantial change in short form conclusions in any event (para 37).

These articles drew attention to the differential evidential standards for the conclusion of suicide, perhaps for the first time in UK scholarly literature. They also drew attention to a body of Commonwealth authority applying the civil standard. They also made the point that, if narrative findings could be made but the standard of proof for a short form conclusion precluded a short form conclusion of suicide, and no other short form conclusion was appropriate, the coroner would have to enter an open conclusion.</a></p><a name="para30">

In those circumstances the power to make rules could understandably not be used to state some new rule. A new rule stating the position at common law was unnecessary and a new rule altering the common law would not be a rule “for” regulating coronial practice and procedure. It would be for achieving a change in an existing rule of law. So the carefully worded response of the MoJ was: “we cannot take forward a change in the [case] law through secondary legislation.” So there was no point in even opening a dialogue on the point and it could not hold up placing the draft rules before Parliament. But the fact that this exchange took place in public documents is a valuable aid to interpretation of the 2013 Rules and enables the courts more clearly to see the meaning which Parliament intended Note (iii) to have.</a></p><a name="para31">

It is true that in <i>R v HM Coroner for North Humberside and Scunthorpe, Ex p Jamieson</i> [1995] QB 1, 25, the Court of Appeal (Sir Thomas Bingham MR, McCowan and Hirst LJJ) held that the notes on the then current form 22 scheduled to the Coroners Rules 1984 (which covered different matters) were not binding. However, while no reason was given for this observation, the observation is readily distinguishable because the use of form 22 as opposed to Form 2 was not mandatory (see the Coroners Rules 1984 (SI 1984/552), rule 60).</a></p><a name="para32">

In the Court of Appeal, Davis LJ, with whom Underhill and Nicola Davies LJJ agreed, came to the same conclusion, </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2019/809.html">[2019] EWCA Civ 809</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2019/809.html">[2019] QB 1218</a>:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“If it was desired by the Coroners rules to make provision for the standard of proof (and it was common ground before us that section 45 of the 2009 Act would have so permitted) then the obvious place to do so would have been in the body of the Coroners rules themselves. The notes appended to the prescribed form cannot, in my view, be given the substantive status of rules.

As Brett MR held in <i>Attorney General v Lamplugh</i> (1878) 3 Ex D 214, 229: “[A] schedule in an Act of Parliament is … as much a part of the statute, and is as much an enactment as any other part”. Moreover, all parts of a statute have operative effect and provisions are not to be treated simply as for the avoidance of doubt or guidance. Very occasionally, however, the contrary may be stated or the contrary may occur. Parliament may, for instance, occasionally provide examples which are not necessarily intended to be used as aids to restrict the interpretation of the principal provision.</a></p><a name="para35">

The principal authority on this is <i>Hunt v RM Douglas (Roofing) Ltd</i> [1990] 1 AC 398, to which the President of the Supreme Court, Lord Reed, drew counsel’s attention. The House of Lords there held that Parliament could change the law, in that case by harmonising different rules of procedure, by means of enacting a footnote to a form in a schedule to rules of procedure.</a></p><a name="para36">

The case concerned the start date for the accrual of interest on costs awarded by order of the court and it turned on a note to a prescribed form and the effect of its deletion. The appellant argued that under section 17 of the Judgments Act 1838 interest on costs ran from the date of judgment. The practice between the common law and the chancery courts between 1839 and 1875 differed in that the former took the date of the judgment and the latter the date of the certificate of taxation (there was no similar practice at common law). Eminent judges held different views as to which was the fairer rule. The Rules of Court 1875 enacted by section 16 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1875 annexed a writ of execution (known as a writ of fi fa) for use in relation to judgments of the High Court and Court of Appeal adopting by way of a footnote the chancery practice. However, a new form of writ of execution was required to be used by new rules enacted in 1883. A footnote to this form provided that interest ran from the date of judgment. This footnote was not attached to the form when it appeared in the Rules of the Supreme Court 1965.</a></p><a name="para37">

The footnote to the form of writ of execution in the 1883 Rules had swept away the chancery practice, as had been held by Field J in <i>Pyman &amp; Co v Burt, Boulton</i> [1884] WN 100 and by a unanimous Court of Appeal in <i>Boswell v Coaks</i> (1887) 57 LJ (NS) Ch 101 (Cotton, Lindley and Lopes LJJ).

The 1883 Rules applied because the proceedings were still in progress until the assessment of costs and enforcement were completed and there was no vested right in a rule of practice.

I reach this conclusion as a matter of interpretation and my conclusion should not in any way be read as departing from the strong presumption that every provision of an enactment has legislative force. It turns on the very special background applying to Note (iii) informing the court in its interpretative role as to the presumed intention of Parliament.</a></p><a name="para42">

It will be recalled that shortly before 1883 the courts of common law and equity had been fundamentally reorganised by the Judicature Acts 1873 to 1875 so that there would in future be only one Supreme Court of Judicature in England and Wales in which the courts administered both law and equity, so harmony was essential and consistent with legislative policy. In relation to interest on costs, that legislative policy could not be achieved unless the common law and chancery rules were harmonised. The judgments in <i>Boswell v Coaks</i>, described in para 39 above, show that the debate was well-known. The Court of Appeal interpreted the note against the background of the prior differences in practice. There was no equivalent debate in the case law in this case as to the correctness of the common law rule reflected in Note (iii) prior to its enactment.</a></p><a name="para43">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“<i>As to Schedules - </i>Great care should be taken in the preparation of schedules.

All that can be said is that nothing should be placed in a schedule to which the attention of Parliament should be particularly directed; for example, the <i>constitution</i> of an electoral or financial body of persons should be found in the body of the Act; but the mode of conducting the election of the electoral body, and the rules as to proceedings at meetings of the financial body, may not improperly be placed in a schedule.” (pp 100-101, reprint (1902))</p>

The 2013 Rules were considered by the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments with further explanation. The conventions observed by legislative drafters as described by Lord Thring in the passage I have set out make admirable good sense. Those conventions are part of the unwritten principles on which the British constitution depends, and the courts ought to proceed on the presumption that high standards of drafting have been observed. There is no reason to think that the principle behind the passage that I have quoted from Lord Thring is not equally valid today.</a></p><a name="para46">

I do not agree for the reasons given above. The apparent width of section 45 of the 2009 Act is nothing to the point. The one place where the users might naturally expect to find guidance in this context on what the relevant law is, as opposed to some new operative provision, is in the notes to a prescribed form and Note (iii) provides that guidance for so long as the common law remains the same. But Note (iii) does not take away the role of the courts in reviewing the common law.</a></p><a name="para47">

That point cannot be universally true because there was no rule abolishing the chancery rule as to the commencement date for interest on costs in <i>Hunt v RM Douglas (Roofing) Ltd</i>, but as I have explained the context in which the footnote had to be interpreted was entirely different in that case. There is no equivalent or compelling legislative policy made known to the court here.</a></p><a name="para48">

If the source was the 2013 Rules, then the only relevant provision was Note (iii). It is hard to see how this could be because the word “required” is logically referring to a source of law which pre-existed the 2013 Rules. That could be the 2009 Act, but that made no such provision. By a process of elimination, the provenance of that standard of proof could only be the common law.</a></p><a name="para49">

I venture to suggest that it was not used there because the drafter could not point to any source for the statement outside the 2013 Rules and was merely making a statement based on his or her understanding of the effect of common law principles in this case. The courts had not had the opportunity of considering the standard of proof for narrative statements at that point. The drafter was merely making a deduction from the general principle that, in civil proceedings, the civil standard of proof applies.</a></p><a name="para50">

It does not use the future tense. In my judgment, that means that the provision does not have the effect of ruling out any further change in the common law. The correct interpretation in the light of the background material is that Note (iii) was merely speaking as to the state of the law as at the date on which the 2013 Rules came into effect. Starting from the position that the standard of proof is set by the common law, the word “is” means “has been held to be and is”, and not “is to be” or “shall be”. If it had been intended to be mandatory for the future, it would have used the words “shall be” especially as these forms were to be seen and used not just by coroners but by jurors and other non-lawyers.</a></p><a name="para51">

That reflects the constitutional principle that it is primarily a judicial function to lay down rules which govern the conduct of judicial hearings. It is the principle on which much of Schedule 4 to the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 on the division of functions between the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales is based. Given that there was no statutory provision dealing with the standard of proof in inquests, and that it was governed by the common law, it would be very strange if the effect of the rules was to prevent the courts developing the common law in the future. The identity of the Lord Chief Justice as the person who was to make the rules (in consultation with the Lord Chancellor) would seem in any event to run counter to the notion that in that capacity he had power to make rules bringing about a substantial change, especially one that was controversial.</a></p><a name="para52">

</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para54">“(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a principle of legal policy that law should be altered deliberately rather than casually, and that Parliament should not change either </a><a name="ORIGHIT_1"></a><a name="HIT_1"></a>

All that has happened is that Note (iii) has set out the common law as at the date of the 2013 Coroners Rules and did not exclude the power of the courts to develop the common law.

The conclusion of suicide is a very serious one for the family of the deceased, as this case shows, and the family appearing at the inquest may be disadvantaged by the inquisitorial nature of the proceedings. It would not violate article 2 of the Convention to require the criminal standard.

The proceedings being inquisitorial, there are no parties. There is a statutory definition of “interested persons” which is wide enough to include the family but there are restrictions on the part that they can play in the proceedings. For instance, they can examine witnesses, but the coroner may disallow their questions. There are no closing submissions on the facts after the evidence has been led. There is no automatic disclosure of documents. In this case, Mr James Maughan’s widow was legally represented at the inquest and his family participated in the inquest, but there are considerable restrictions on public funding for representation of the family at an inquest.</a></p><a name="para65">

There would on this basis be no narrative findings as to the elements of suicide if the suicide conclusion could not be reached on the criminal standard. That would, she submits, be a way of avoiding the strange situation in which a jury is able to make narrative findings on the elements of suicide but not make the short form conclusion itself.</a></p><a name="para66">

However, the issue of the correct standard of proof for a short form conclusion of suicide has to be decided on the basis of legal principle. The position is that to hold that a criminal standard applies is out of line not only with narrative conclusions but also with the principle applying to civil proceedings generally. I see no reason why the normal legal principles should not apply. On the contrary there are good reasons why they should apply. Short form conclusions on the basis of the civil standard may for instance enhance the recording of suicides and assist research for the future. In my judgment the arguments for doing so are compelling. I explain my reasons for so concluding below.</a></p><a name="para68"> 
<p class="ParaHeading"><b><span style="font-style:normal">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On legal principle, the civil standard should apply, and the common law does not demonstrate any cogent reason for not applying that principle</span></b></p>

I have considered them for the assistance which they can give to this court today in deciding what standard of proof the law requires. The assistance is somewhat limited. In, for example, <i>R v West London Coroner, Ex p Gray</i>, [1988] QB 467, the Divisional Court was not bound by any earlier decision for the reasons which the Divisional Court in this case gave (para 59). So the Divisional Court in <i>Gray</i> had to articulate their own reasoning but they did not do so, perhaps because they had been misled into thinking that the earlier case of <i>R v City of London Coroner,</i> <i>Ex p Barber</i> [1975] 1 WLR 310 was decisive of the issue. The Divisional Court simply came to the view that it was “unthinkable” that any lesser standard should apply (see para 60 of the Divisional Court’s judgment in this case). It is as if the common law had accepted that the criminal standard applied because of the links between coronial proceedings and criminal proceedings, the serious consequences of suicide (which at one time led to the denial of normal burial rites and the barbaric practice of burial on the highway impaled by a stake), and the then generally prevailing societal norms attaching stigma to suicide. There are rare occasions when the reason for a rule has disappeared but the rule remains. This would appear to be one of those situations.</a></p><a name="para70"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para70"></a><a name="para71">71.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The rule cannot be left as it is. As the Divisional Court first pointed out, if the appellant is right and the criminal standard is applied to the findings which pertain to the elements of suicide, then some conclusions will be reached on one basis and some on another within a single inquest. A system of fact-finding on this basis is internally inconsistent and unprincipled and does not meet the standards of a modern, principled legal system. It is quite different from the situation which Woolf LJ (as he then was) (with whom Lord Donaldson MR and Stocker LJ agreed) considered and found satisfactory in <i>McCurbin</i>. In that case, Woolf LJ saw no difficulty in the jury considering unlawful killing on the basis of the criminal standard and if not sure, misadventure on the civil standard:</a></p><a name="para71"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“I am quite satisfied that, in a case where it is open to a jury, as a result of a coroner’s inquest, to come to a verdict of unlawful killing, the appropriate direction which the coroner should give to the jury is the simple one that they should be satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt or, as sometimes said, satisfied so that they are sure. That provides clear guidance to the coroner’s jury which they will be able to follow, and it is not necessary for them to be involved with sliding scales which are more appropriate for a judge than a jury.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">It is true that, in many cases where it is open to a coroner’s jury to find a verdict of unlawful killing, they may also have to consider the question of death by misadventure. However, in my view, this does not and should not give rise to problems. The coroner should indicate to the jury that they should approach, initially, the question as to whether or not they are satisfied so that they are sure that this is unlawful killing. If they come to the conclusion that it is unlawful killing, there is no need for them to go on to consider death by misadventure. But, if they come to the conclusion that it is not unlawful killing, they are not satisfied so that they are sure that that verdict is appropriate, then they will consider the question of misadventure and, in so doing, they do not need to bear in mind the heavy standard of proof which is required for unlawful killing. They can approach the matter on the basis of the balance of probabilities. The situation is that, just as it is important that a jury should not bring in a verdict of suicide unless they are sure, likewise they should not bring in a verdict of unlawful killing unless they are sure.” (p 728)</p>

As the Divisional Court pointed out (para 56), a conclusion on the balance of probabilities still involves showing that it is more likely than not that the deceased took his own life and intended so to do. It is not enough for the coroner or the jury to think that because certain possibilities (for example, unlawful killing by a person unknown) can be discounted, that suicide must have occurred.</a></p><a name="para72">

It is important not to adopt a stereotypical attitude here as elsewhere. Society needs to understand the causes and to try and prevent suicides occurring. Statistics are the means whereby this can be done. If a criminal burden of proof is required, suicide is likely to be under-recorded. This is especially worrying in the case of state-related deaths. If there is an open verdict because the criminal standard of proof cannot be achieved, the circumstances of the case have to be analysed before it can be included in any statistics to show the true number of suicides. There is a considerable public interest in accurate suicide statistics as they may reveal a need for social and medical care in areas not previously regarded as significant. Each suicide determination can help others by revealing how suicide risks may be managed in future. I accept that to some extent policy makers and researchers can seek to mitigate the under-recording of cases by examining cases of open conclusions but they may not be able to do so accurately and lowering the standard of proof would be a more satisfactory way of getting accurate figures.</a></p><a name="para74">

Section 1 of the Suicide Act 1961 enacts that: “The rule of law whereby it is a crime for a person to commit suicide is hereby abrogated.” Although the offence has been abolished, it is still a crime to encourage or assist a person to commit suicide (Suicide Act 1961, section 2).</a></p><a name="para76">

This change is charted by Lloyd LJ in <i>Kirkham v Chief Constable of the Greater Manchester Police</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1989/3.html">[1990] 2 QB 283</a>. In that case, the court was faced with the argument that there was a defence to a claim for damages against a prison authority where a person had committed suicide in circumstances where it was alleged that the prison authorities had been negligent, on the basis of the defence of ex turpi causa, namely that it was contrary to public policy for a person who had committed suicide to recover damages. Lloyd LJ rejected that defence, holding:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It is apparent from these authorities that the ex turpi causa defence is not confined to criminal conduct. So we cannot adopt the simple approach favoured by the judge. We have to ask ourselves the much more difficult question whether to afford relief in such a case as this, arising, as it does, directly out of a man’s suicide, would affront the public conscience, or, as I would prefer to say, shock the ordinary citizen. I have come to the conclusion that the answer should be in the negative. I would give two reasons. In the first place the Suicide Act 1961 does more than abolish the crime of suicide. It is symptomatic of a change in the public attitude to suicide generally. It is no longer regarded with the same abhorrence as it once was. It is, or course, impossible for us to say how far the change in the public attitude has gone. But that there has been a change is beyond doubt. The fact that aiding and abetting suicide remains a crime under section 2 of the Suicide Act 1961 does not diminish the force of the argument. The second reason is that in at least two decided cases courts have awarded damages following a suicide or attempted suicide. In <i>Selfe v Ilford and District Hospital Management Committee, The Times</i>, 26 November 1970, Hinchcliffe J awarded the plaintiff damages against a hospital for failing to take proper precautions when they knew that the plaintiff was a suicide risk. In <i>Pigney v Pointer’s Transport Services Ltd </i>[1957] 1 WLR 1121, to which I have already referred, Pilcher J. awarded damages to the dependants of a suicide under the Fatal Accidents Act 1846. Moreover, in <i>Hyde v Tameside Area Health Authority</i>, Court of Appeal (Civil Division) Transcript No 130 of 1981 another hospital case, the judge awarded £200,000 damages in respect of an unsuccessful suicide attempt. The Court of Appeal allowed the defendant’s appeal, on the ground that there had been no negligence on the part of the hospital, but not on the ground that the plaintiff’s cause of action arose ex turpi causa. <i>Selfe</i> and <i>Pigney</i> are not binding on us. But they are important for this reason. They show, or appear to show, that the public conscience was not affronted. It did not occur to anyone to argue in either case that the granting of a remedy would shock the ordinary citizen; nor did it occur to the court.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">For the above reason I would hold that the defence of ex turpi causa is not available in these cases, at any rate where, as here, there is medical evidence that the suicide is not in full possession of his mind. To entertain the plaintiff’s claim in such a case as the present would not, in my view, affront the public conscience, or shock the ordinary citizen.” (p 291)</p>

In the more recent case of <i>Braganza v BP Shipping Ltd</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/17.html">[2015] UKSC 17</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/17.html">[2015] 1 WLR 1661</a>, this court had to consider the application of the civil standard of proof where an employer alleged that the death of an employee, a chief engineer on a ship, who was lost overboard in the Atlantic, was suicide. The deceased was a Roman Catholic and considered that suicide was a mortal sin (per Lady Hale at para 41). If he had committed suicide, he would be disqualified from receiving a death in service benefit. In determining his entitlement, the employer had to take into account in forming its view the improbability of suicide having occurred. The deceased’s view of suicide must be recognised but it could not any more be described as a generally prevailing social attitude.</p>

The Court of Appeal considered that, if the civil standard applied to unlawful killing cases as well as suicide, that would promote consistency of approach within the proceedings, be consistent with principle and remove the internal inconsistency caused by having different rules for short form and narrative conclusions in this area too. However, the Court of Appeal rejected the view that the civil standard also applied to unlawful killing. While under section 10(2) of the 2009 Act, a finding of unlawful killing could not name the person thought to be responsible, criminal law concepts applied: see, for example, <i>R (Duggan) v North London Assistant Deputy Coroner</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2017/142.html">[2017] EWCA Civ 142</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2017/142.html">[2017] 1 WLR 2199</a>. Moreover, the Court of Appeal was bound by the decision in <i>McCurbin</i> to hold that the criminal standard applied.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para85">85.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Davis LJ also held that section 10(2) of the 2009 Act contemplated that the criminal standard would be available. Section 10(2) provides that the determination of the result of the inquest</a></p><a name="para85"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“may not be framed in such a way as to appear to determine any question of criminal … liability on the part of a named person …”</p>

Such conclusion might make it more likely that a criminal prosecution is brought. In practice, despite the provisions of section 10(2) of the 2009 Act (see para 12 above), the name of that person may be more likely to be identified if the standard of proof for unlawful killing is the civil standard, because that standard may be more easily met. That person might thus be less able to enjoy the protection that section 10(2) conferred on him.</a></p><a name="para87">

The Chief Coroner explains that the application of the criminal standard in unlawful killing cases derives from the fact that coronial proceedings used to be a means for finding criminal liability. It used to be the duty of the coroner’s jury where they found that the death was murder, manslaughter or infanticide, to state in the verdict the name of the person considered to have committed the offence or of being an accessory before the fact.</a></p><a name="para88"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para88"><span style="color:black"></span></a><a name="para89">89.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, section 56 of the Criminal Law Act 1977 provided that a coroner’s verdict shall not make any finding that any person is guilty of murder, manslaughter or infanticide or charge any person with any of these offences. On that basis, the criminal standard for unlawful killing has lost at least some of its historical purpose.</a></p><a name="para89"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para89"></a><a name="para90">90.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The able and concise submissions of Mr Straw are principally directed to the question of the appropriate standard of proof for a verdict of unlawful killing. He submits that the civil standard should apply in all non-criminal cases, unless there is some good reason to the contrary. There is no principled basis for distinguishing suicide and unlawful killing in this regard. He points out, as did Professor Matthews in his articles, that one unfortunate result of the criminal standard is that an open conclusion has to be entered and the family will be denied the determination of the jury on issues as to how the deceased came by his death and what could have been done in his case, or what could be done in the future, to prevent a recurrence. The person implicated in an unlawful killing is at no greater risk of prosecution than he would be if findings of fact had been made against him in civil proceedings.</a></p><a name="para90"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para90"></a><a name="para91">91.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr Straw further submits that the identity of the person whom the jury considered was responsible for the death may be obvious to persons familiar with the facts, and he is at no greater risk than he would be in a civil trial.</a></p><a name="para91"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para91"></a><a name="para92">92.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms Monaghan submits that the criminal standard of proof should be maintained for both unlawful killing and suicide. On her submission, it is additionally desirable to uphold that standard for unlawful killing as the person responsible for the death will often in practice be identifiable.</a></p><a name="para92"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para92"></a><a name="para93">93.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my judgment, the short form conclusions of unlawful killing and suicide cannot satisfactorily be distinguished with respect to the standard of proof. As Davis LJ accepted, both such decisions contrast with the standard applying to narrative statements and different standards of proof may therefore confusingly apply to different conclusions within the same inquest. It is said that it would not promote public confidence in the legal system if a conclusion of unlawful killing is reached in an inquest on the civil standard, and a prosecution is mounted as a result which then fails. But that can happen in any event, even if the existing criminal standard is maintained, and it is at least as likely that public confidence in the legal system will be diminished if the evidence at the inquest cannot lead to clear findings on a balance of probabilities. It would appear to the public as if the system has conspired to prevent the truth from being available to them. It seems to me that the public are likely to understand that there is difference between a finding at an inquest and one at a criminal trial where the accused has well-established rights to participate actively in the process.</a></p><a name="para93"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para93"></a><a name="para94">94.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, if there appears to be a risk that criminal proceedings will be brought before an inquest has been completed, the inquest can be adjourned, and in some circumstances must be adjourned (see the 2009 Act, Schedule 1). In that way the person who is at risk of prosecution is protected against a short form conclusion reached on a civil standard which is unfavourable to him.</a></p><a name="para94"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para94"></a><a name="para95">95.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The person implicated in the conclusion of unlawful killing is equally liable to suffer prejudice from the findings by way of narrative statement, which can be found on a balance of probabilities. They may equally point a finger at him. In addition, as Mr Straw points out, the accused would be in the same position in an inquest as he already is if civil proceedings are brought against him.</a></p><a name="para95"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para95"></a><a name="para96">96.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In summary, a common standard applying to both unlawful killing and suicide is more consistent with principle and removes an inherent inconsistency in the determinations made at an inquest. It reflects the general rule for the standard of proof in civil proceedings. In short, it seems to me that the arguments in favour of applying the rule that in most civil proceedings the civil standard will apply are stronger than those against, and that this Court should take the opportunity of so deciding.</a></p><a name="para96">

The 2009 Act should in my view be approached as a new statute intended to restate the law in modern form, without undue regard to the history, but against the background of the current view of standards of proof in civil cases. The modern approach to that issue in respect of alleged suicide is usefully exemplified by the judgments of this court in <i>Braganza</i> (cited by Lady Arden at para 79). As was there recognised, earlier decisions, such as <i>Ex p Gray</i>, had been in effect overtaken by the approach authoritatively established in <i>In re H (Minors) (Sexual Abuse: Standard of Proof)</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1995/16.html">[1996] AC 563</a> and <i>In re B (Children) (Care Proceedings: Standard of Proof)</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/35.html">[2008] UKHL 35</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/35.html">[2009] AC 11</a>, which made clear that in civil cases there is only one standard of proof, viz the balance of probabilities:</p>

The rule contains no specific reference to the notes as such, nor anything to suggest that the notes are intended to prescribe a standard of proof, or anything else. In the form itself, item 4 (“Conclusion … as to the death”) specifically incorporates a reference to notes (i) and (ii). The purpose is to indicate the possible “short-form conclusions” and the possibility of a “brief narrative conclusion” as an alternative or in addition.

First, from the nine possible short-form conclusions outlined in Note (i) (traditionally known as verdicts) only unlawful killing and suicide are identified as those to which the criminal standard applies. Secondly, the use of the word “is” clearly denotes that if a verdict of suicide or unlawful killing is to be reached, that may only occur where the coroner or the jury has been brought to a point of conviction beyond reasonable doubt that such a verdict is warranted.</a></p><a name="para114">

The rendering of a short-form conclusion is not obligatory - but if one is expressed, then in the case of two specifically chosen verdicts, the criminal standard of proof must be applied. The reasons for this are not difficult to divine. A short-form conclusion that the deceased died from, say, accident or misadventure; or natural causes; or a road traffic accident will, in the general run of cases, not be as significant as finding that they were unlawfully killed or committed suicide. The latter verdicts denote a solemn pronouncement and they have clear resonances beyond those of other short form conclusions.</a></p><a name="para115">

The clear distinction (in cases of unlawful killing and suicide) between a short-form conclusion (verdict) and a narrative statement (recital of the relevant testimony and transitory conclusions) should be recognised. A narrative statement recounts the salient evidence and circumstances. In the case of unlawful killing and suicide it should not purport to constitute a final conclusion on that evidence unless the coroner or the jury has become convinced beyond reasonable doubt that it is justified.</a></p><a name="para116">

The relevant regulations made provision as to the standard of proof to be applied. Wilson LJ held that “the procedure on appeals” covered the issue as to the particular standard of proof that was applicable in reaching an answer to a question. At para 43 he said:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… The procedure on appeals is synonymous with the processing of appeals; and, when the panel takes the step (or reaches the stage) at which it determines a question whether a fact is established, a necessary part of its processing of that part of the appeal is to apply a particular standard of proof in reaching an answer to the question. A regulation about the inadmissibility of evidence of a specified character would in my view clearly fall within the rubric of ‘procedure on appeal’ and there is in my view no material difference between a requirement that the panel should exclude evidence of a specified character and a requirement that it should apply a specified standard of proof to its appraisal of such evidence as is properly before it.”</p>

I agree. It is no less binding than a provision contained in a section of the Act itself. Its meaning and force should be considered as if it was prominent in the opening provision of the legislation. As <i>Bennion </i>states, “If material is put into the form of a footnote it is still fully part of the Act and must be construed accordingly.” And in <i>Hunt v RM Douglas (Roofing) Ltd</i> [1990] 1 AC 398 it was held that inclusion of rules in a footnote to a form that must be used has the effect of creating binding law.</a></p><a name="para119">

Lady Arden’s approach to its interpretation is that the word “required” in the first sentence of the note is “logically referring to a source of law which pre-existed the 2013 Rules” - para 49 of her judgment. But why should this be so? In my view, the verb “required” in this context has a straightforward meaning. It is that the standard of proof which must be observed is the criminal standard. To construe it as referring to some form of “provenance” or earlier prescription of the standard to be applied is, in my respectful opinion, contrived. In its natural and ordinary meaning the note is simply saying that this is the standard that is needed before a verdict of suicide or unlawful killing may be returned.</a></p><a name="para120">

I cannot agree with the (admittedly speculative) suggestion that this was because “the drafter could not point to any <span style="color:black">source for the statement outside the 2013 Rules and was merely making a statement based on his or her understanding of the effect of common law principles in this case”.

On this basis, the meaning of the note would shift and change to reflect future developments in the common law. That would be, to say the least, an unusual way to proceed and one which would surely require express articulation in the provision itself. Again, therefore, I find myself in regretful disagreement with the suggestion that the use of the present tense in the note supports this conclusion and cannot see any warrant for investing the word “is” with the quite different connotation from the normal understanding of the word suggested in para 51 of Lady Arden’s judgment. In fact, of course, her discussion of the use of the present tense requires that the note be interpreted as if the word ‘is’ meant not only, as she suggests, “has been held to be and is” but “has been held to be and is <i>until future change in the common </i>law”. I cannot believe that such an unnatural meaning is justified when the text of the note is susceptible to a simple, straightforward construction <i>viz</i> that this is the standard to be applied so long as the statutory provision remains in force.</span></a></p><a name="para122">

Her consideration of this matter is at paras 24 to 31 of her judgment. I need not repeat details of the consultation document and the responses received. These have been fully set out in Lady Arden’s judgment. Part of the Ministry’s response to the consultation (set out by Lady Arden at para 26) does bear repetition, however:</span></a></p><a name="para123"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“As the requirement to use the criminal standard of proof when returning a suicide verdict is established under case law rather than coroner legislation we cannot take forward a change in the law through secondary legislation flowing from the 2009 Act.

Lady Arden has interpreted the Ministry’s response as meaning that it had been decided that the 2013 Rules could not make a change in the law. I agree that this is an interpretation which may be placed on the Ministry’s response. But I do not agree that it was “outside the enabling power in section 45 to make a rule” for coronial proceedings which replaced a common law rule - para 31 of Lady Arden’s judgment.</a></p><a name="para124">

Of course, the note did not purport to change the law. But it confirmed the existing law.

Significantly, at paras 56 and 82-83, Lord Hope stated that it was not an invariable rule that the lower standard of proof must be applied in civil proceedings. In some cases, he said, the interests of fairness, the “criminal or quasi-criminal” nature of an allegation, or the serious consequences of a finding could require the criminal standard. The other members of the Appellate Committee agreed with Lord Steyn and Lord Hope.</p>

Consideration of whether the verdict should be returned is one of the utmost seriousness and potential complexity, not least because it involves consideration of whether the deceased intended to kill himself or herself. Until the introduction of the Suicide Act 1961, a finding of suicide was also a finding of guilt of a criminal offence. Encouraging or assisting the suicide or attempted suicide of another still constitutes a criminal offence: section 2 of the 1961 Act.</a></p><a name="para135">

A verdict of suicide causes “stigma to the memory of the deceased” in circumstances in which there is a “clearly established policy of avoiding so far as possible any unnecessary stigma” - per Simon Brown J in <i>R v Inner South London Coroner, Ex p Kendall </i>[1988] 1 WLR 1186, 1192.</a></p><a name="para136">

In <i>Braganza v BP Shipping Ltd </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/17.html">[2015] UKSC 17</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/17.html">[2015] 1 WLR 1661</a>, Lady Hale said at para 36 that such a finding had serious consequences for the family of the deceased and at para 41 that for many religions suicide was a mortal sin. At para 61 Lord Hodge stated that a finding that an employee had committed suicide carried a stigma for his spouse. Lord Neuberger acknowledged (at para 107) that, having suffered the blow of losing her husband, the finding of an inquiry that he had killed himself would involve “additional blows”.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para138">138.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There can be no doubt, therefore, of the gravity of a finding of suicide or of the need to distinguish it from other causes of death in terms of the level of proof required to establish it. There are, of course, contrary views as to whether the criminal standard should be applied. Some of these have been referred to in the judgment of Lady Arden. But none suggests that a verdict of suicide is other than a very serious matter.</a></p><a name="para138">

Note (iii) expressly does so and, for the reasons given at para 116 above, there is nothing incongruous in the circumstance that a short form conclusion requires that heightened level of proof, whereas the narrative version does not.</a></p><a name="para139">

Whatever anomaly might be said to arise, it is not open to the courts to disapply what is unambiguous statutory language. True it may be, as Lady Arden says in para 27 of her judgment, that the Ministry of Justice decided that it could not make a change in the law by the 2013 Rules. And it may also be true, as she says in the same para, that the criminal standard was not <i>established</i> by those rules, for it had its origins in the common law. But what the 2013 Rules unquestionably established was a statutory basis for the application of the criminal standard of proof for verdicts (or short form conclusions) in cases of suicide and unlawful killing and that statutory imperative cannot be displaced by judicial pronouncement. It has full force and effect until amended or abolished by subsequent statutory provision.</a></p><a name="para140"> 
<p class="ParaHeading">The nature of proceedings in an inquest</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para140"></a><a name="para141">141.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As submitted by the appellant, inquests are not civil or criminal proceedings. They are <i>sui generis</i> proceedings with rules of procedure of their own. In <i>R v South London Coroner, Ex p Thompson</i> (1982) 126 SJ 625; The Times, 9 July 1982, Lord Lane CJ said:</a></p><a name="para141"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… it should not be forgotten that an inquest is a fact-finding exercise and not a method of apportioning guilt. The procedure and rules of evidence which are suitable for one are unsuitable for the other. In an inquest it should never be forgotten that there are no parties, there is no indictment, there is no prosecution, there is no defence, there is no trial, simply an attempt to establish facts. It is an inquisitorial process, a process of investigation quite unlike a criminal trial where the prosecutor accuses and the accused defends, the judge holding the balance or the ring, whichever metaphor one chooses to use.”</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para141"></a><a name="para142">142.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is unwise, therefore, to categorise inquests as civil proceedings simply because they do not fit the criminal model. It is even less appropriate to consider that the civil standard of proof should apply to all matters which fall to be decided in an inquest. Given the unique nature of inquests, it is not surprising that some issues should be susceptible to differing standards of proof.</a></p><a name="para142"> 
<p class="ParaHeading">Overall conclusion</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para142"></a><a name="para143">143.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It would be ironic, to say the least, that Note (iii) which, on its face, decrees that verdicts of suicide and unlawful killing should only be returned if proof of them measures up to the criminal standard, proved to be the instrument of the abolition of this traditional rule. The inference that this is its effect is based on what is perceived to be the anomaly that a narrative conclusion effectively permits a verdict of suicide on the basis of the balance of probabilities, whereas a short form conclusion requires proof beyond reasonable doubt. For the reasons that I have sought to explain, there is, in truth, no incongruousness between the two. In my view, on a proper understanding of the effect of Note (iii), the present state of the law is that there must be proof beyond reasonable doubt before a verdict of suicide or unlawful killing may be returned.</a></p><a name="para143">
