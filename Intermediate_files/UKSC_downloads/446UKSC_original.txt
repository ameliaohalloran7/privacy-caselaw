<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The issue raised on this appeal concerns the extent to which the
jurisdiction of the First-tier Tribunal to make an order for costs is fettered
by the provisions of the Rules regulating the procedure of the Tribunal.
Although the Rules in question govern the procedure of the Tax and Chancery
Chamber, we were told that our conclusion will apply to the other Chambers of
the First-tier Tribunal (“FTT”).</a></p><a name="para1">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1"></a><a name="para2">2.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Subsections (1) and (2) of section 29 of the Tribunals, Courts and
Enforcement Act 2007 provide that the “costs of and incidental to” any
proceedings in the FTT “shall be in the discretion of the Tribunal in which the
proceedings take place”, and that the Tribunal has “full power” to make orders
for costs. However, subsection (3) of the same section stipulates that the
preceding two subsections “have effect subject to Tribunal Procedure Rules”.</a></p><a name="para2">

<p class="ParaHeading">The Rules</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2"></a><a name="para3">3.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Rules which governed the instant proceedings are the Tribunal
Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Tax Chamber) Rules 2009 (SI 2009/273) (L1)
(“the Rules”). Rule 2 describes the “overriding objective” of the Rules as
being to enable the FTT “to deal with cases fairly and justly”, which includes
dealing with cases proportionately.</a></p><a name="para3">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1"><a name="para3"></a><a name="para4">4.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Rule 5 is headed “Case management powers” and it is in these terms:</a></p><a name="para4">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject to the provisions
of the 2007 Act and any other enactment, the Tribunal may regulate its own
procedure.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Tribunal may give a
direction in relation to the conduct or disposal of proceedings at any time,
including a direction amending, suspending or setting aside an earlier
direction.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In particular, and
without restricting the general powers in paragraphs (1) and (2), the Tribunal
may by direction -</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">…</p>

<p class="ParaLevel4">(i)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>require a party to produce a bundle for a hearing …”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">In addition to
sub-paragraph (i), rule 5(3) has eleven other sub-paragraphs, which include powers
to (a) extend or shorten time for complying with the Rules, (c) permit or
require an amendment, (f) hold a case management hearing, (h) adjourn a
hearing, and (k) transfer proceedings to another tribunal.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para4"></a><a name="para5">5.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Rule 10 is headed “Orders for costs”. Rule 10(1) is somewhat convoluted,
and it is in these terms:</a></p><a name="para5">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The Tribunal may only make an
order in respect of costs (or, in Scotland, expenses) -</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under section 29(4) of
the 2007 Act (wasted costs) …;</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if the Tribunal
considers that a party or their representative has acted unreasonably in
bringing, defending or conducting the proceedings;</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if -</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the proceedings have
been allocated as a Complex case under Rule 23 (allocation of cases to
categories); and</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the taxpayer (or,
where more than one party is a taxpayer, one of them) has not sent or delivered
a written request to the Tribunal, within 28 days of receiving notice that the
case had been allocated as a Complex case, that the proceedings be excluded
from potential liability for costs or expenses under this sub-paragraph …”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para5"></a><a name="para6">6.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>With one exception, it would therefore appear that, at least under rule
10(1), the FTT can only make two types of costs order. The first is a wasted
costs order under sub-para (a), and the other is an order for costs where a
party has behaved unreasonably under sub-para (b). The one exception is under
sub-para (c), which envisages that there will be no such limitation on the
FTT’s jurisdiction to award costs if two conditions are satisfied - namely (i)
the proceedings are a “Complex case” under Rule 23, and (ii) the taxpayer has
not served a request (within the requisite 28-day period) that there should be
no potential liability under rule 10(1)(c).</a></p><a name="para6">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para6"></a><a name="para7">7.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Rule 10(3) sets out how an application for costs under rule 10(1) is to
be initiated. Rule 10(4) provides that such an application must be made within
28 days of the FTT’s decision disposing of the proceedings. Rule 10(5) forbids
the FTT from making an order for costs under rule 10(1) without first giving
notice to the potential payer and enabling him to make representations. Rule
10(6) sets out three different ways in which costs under rule 10(1) can be
assessed (summary assessment, agreement and normal assessment). Rule 10(7)
provides that the sum so assessed can be recovered through proceedings in the
County Court or the Costs Office of the High Court.</a></p><a name="para7">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The only other reference to recovery of costs or expenses to which we
were taken to in the Rules is in Rule 16, which is concerned with “Summoning or
citation of witnesses and orders to answer questions or produce documents”.
Rule 16(2)(b) provides that a summons issued by the Tribunal requiring a person
to attend proceedings (other than a party to the proceedings) “must … make
provision for the person’s necessary expenses of attendance to be paid, and
state who is to pay them”.</a></p><a name="para8">

</span>Eclipse Film Partners No 35 LLP (“Eclipse”) filed a tax return in
respect of the period which ended on 5 April 2007. The Revenue issued a closure
notice determining that Eclipse did not carry on a trade or business, which, if
correct, would have had severely adverse tax consequences for Eclipse.
Accordingly, Eclipse appealed to the FTT against the closure notice. The appeal
was allocated as a Complex case under Rule 23, and, within the 28-day period specified
therein, Eclipse served a request under rule 10(3), that “the proceedings be
excluded from potential liability for costs or expenses under” rule 10(1)(c).</a></p><a name="para9">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para9"></a><a name="para10">10.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, Eclipse and the Revenue agreed directions for the procedure
leading up to the hearing. The FTT duly made those directions, which included
in para 13 a direction that the parties should try and agree an appropriate
bundle of documents, which should be prepared by Eclipse, who were to serve
three copies on the Revenue and three copies on the FTT. Paragraph 13 of the
agreed Directions also provided that, if the parties were unable to agree the
Bundle, each party was to prepare its own bundle of documents and serve three
copies on the other party and on the FTT.</a></p><a name="para10">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para10"></a><a name="para11">11.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The parties were unable to agree a Bundle, and there was a hearing
before the FTT, at which, among other issues, that problem was discussed. The
upshot of the hearing so far as this problem was concerned was an oral
direction by the FTT that Eclipse prepare the Bundle, and that “the costs
should be shared”. Eclipse’s solicitors accordingly prepared the Bundle, which
was very extensive indeed (the total for the parties ran to over 700 lever-arch
files), and its size was in part attributable to requests by the Revenue for
the inclusion of documents of what some might think were of marginal relevance.</a></p><a name="para11">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para11"></a><a name="para12">12.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In due course, the hearing took place, and, after some fourteen days of
evidence and argument, the FTT gave a reserved decision dismissing Eclipse’s
appeal on the substantive issue of the validity of the closure notice - </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKFTT/TC/2012/TC01963.html">[2012] UKFTT 270 (TC)</a>. (That decision was subsequently affirmed by the Upper Tribunal,
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKUT/TCC/2013/639.html">[2014] BTC 503</a>, whose decision was in turn upheld by the Court of Appeal,
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2015/95.html">[2015] BTC 10</a>, and we refused Eclipse permission to appeal to the Supreme Court
on 13 April 2016).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para13">13.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Following the hearing before the FTT, Eclipse’s agents sent the Revenue
invoices for a total of £108,395.48 (inclusive of VAT), representing half the
cost to Eclipse of preparing the Bundles. After some discussion between the
parties, and after the FTT had given its decision, the Revenue applied to the
FTT to set aside the oral direction that the parties should share the costs of
preparing the Bundles (“the Order”), on the ground that the FTT had no
jurisdiction to give such a direction, in the light of Rule 10. The FTT held
that it had had such jurisdiction and therefore dismissed the Revenue’s
application. The Revenue appealed, and the Upper Tribunal took a different
view, and held that the Order was made without jurisdiction, and consequently
set it aside - [2013] UKUT 1041 (TCC). Eclipse’s appeal to the Court of Appeal
failed - </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2014/184.html">[2014] EWCA Civ 184</a>. Eclipse now appeals to this court.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">Discussion</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para14">14.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The reasoning of the Court of Appeal and the Upper Tribunal, which is
reflected in the Revenue’s argument before us, is very simple, and it is as
follows. This was a Complex case under Rule 23, and therefore the FTT would
have had a broad jurisdiction as to costs if no request (“Request”) under rule
10(1)(c)(ii) had been served, but, as such a Request was served by Eclipse, the
effect of rule 10(1)(c) is that the FTT could only make an order for costs if,
and to the extent that, rule 10(1)(a) (wasted costs) and/or rule 10(1)(b)
(unreasonable behaviour) could be invoked, and neither of those provisions
applied here.</a></p><a name="para14">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para14"></a><a name="para15">15.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Two arguments are advanced on behalf of Eclipse to counter this
analysis. As an initial point, it is said that the Order was not really an
order for the payment of costs; it was on analysis an order for the sharing of
costs. The flaw in that argument is that it assumes that the sharing of costs
cannot involve the payment of costs. On the facts of this case, even though the
result of the payment of half Eclipse’s expenses in preparing the Bundles could
fairly be described as the Revenue “sharing” those costs, it would also
undoubtedly involve the Revenue “paying” costs, in the sense that they would be
reimbursing Eclipse half the expenses which it had incurred in having the
Bundles prepared. What the Order plainly envisaged was (i) Eclipse incurring
the expense of the preparation of the Bundles and (ii) then recovering half the
expense from the Revenue. Step (ii) is plainly an order, albeit a partially
proleptic order, for the recovery of costs.</a></p><a name="para15">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para15"></a><a name="para16">16.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The second, and main, argument advanced on behalf of Eclipse is that it
is inherent in rule 5(3) that the orders that the FTT makes thereunder can
include terms as to costs. For instance, it is said that it would be
unrealistic to suggest that the FTT might grant permission to one party to
amend its case under rule 5(3)(c) or to have an adjournment under rule 5(3)(h),
without being able to do so on terms as to costs which compensate the other
party for any prejudice suffered as a result. Despite its initial attraction, I
do not find that argument convincing, for a number of reasons.</a></p><a name="para16">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para16"></a><a name="para17">17.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>First, Eclipse’s interpretation of rule 5(3) robs rule 10(1) of much of
its force. The purpose of rule 10(1) is to shut out the FTT from making
cost-shifting orders in all “ordinary” cases save in those where a party or a
party’s legal advisers have behaved unreasonably or worse, and even in Complex
cases the taxpayer can opt to avoid cost-shifting. While this would prevent a
taxpayer from recovering costs from the Revenue, its principal purpose is no
doubt to protect a taxpayer from a costs exposure which goes beyond having to
pay his own lawyers. Warren J said in <i>Atlantic Electronics Ltd v Revenue and
Customs Comrs </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKUT/TCC/2012/45.html">[2012] STC 931</a>, para 8, that the policy that “in cases other
than Complex cases … the inability to recover costs is not seen as likely to
lead to a denial of access to justice” but that “in Complex cases, the choice
of the taxpayer is to prevail”. The only quarrel I have with that is that it
seems to me that in non-Complex cases, the normal inability of either the
taxpayer or the Revenue to recover costs is positively intended to improve
access to justice in the majority of such cases.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para18">18.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The logic of Eclipse’s argument means that every time that the FTT makes
a direction, not merely under one of the subparagraphs of rule 5(3), but under
the more general powers contained in rule 5(2), it can attach an order for
costs, even where neither the party against whom the order is made, nor its
legal advisers, have behaved unreasonably. While this would not, of course,
mean that the FTT could deal with costs as if there was no fetter on its
powers, it would very significantly cut down the effectiveness of the no
costs-shifting scheme in rule 10(1).</a></p><a name="para18">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para18"></a><a name="para19">19.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Secondly, Eclipse’s argument is inconsistent with rules 10(3) to 10(7).
As explained in para 7 above, those paragraphs contain rules as to how any
costs awarded by the FTT pursuant to rule 10(1) are to be assessed and
recovered. If there is a power to award costs under Rule 5, as Eclipse
effectively argues, there would appear to be a lacuna in the Rules, because
there are no such provisions governing the assessment and recovery of such
costs. I appreciate that this argument has limited force in relation to paras
10(3) to 10(5), as the paying party would normally (but not always) be expected
to have the opportunity to make submissions about costs at the hearing at which
such costs could, on Eclipse’s case, be awarded. However, that point does not,
I think, apply to rules 10(6) and 10(7).</a></p><a name="para19">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para19"></a><a name="para20">20.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Thirdly, rejecting Eclipse’s case does not mean that the FTT cannot give
permission to amend, or grant an adjournment, on terms as to costs. If, for
instance, a party wishes to amend its case or be granted an adjournment, there
is nothing in the Rules which would prevent the FTT from deciding that it will
only give permission to amend, or grant the adjournment, on terms that that
party pays the other party’s costs wasted or incurred as a result of the
proposed amendment or adjournment. However, that is not what happened in this
case.</a></p><a name="para20">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para20"></a><a name="para21">21.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Fourthly, while of very slender force, there is rule 16(2)(b), which
enables, indeed requires, the FTT to provide for the costs of a witness, who is
required to attend a hearing, to be paid for by one or other party. It was
suggested on behalf of Eclipse that it showed that rule 10(1) did not amount to
an absolute code. To my mind, if anything, rule 16(2)(b) supports the Revenue’s
case: it shows that, where the Rules intend to enable or require the FTT to
render a party liable for costs, they say so.</a></p><a name="para21">

<p class="ParaHeading">Some supplementary points</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para21"></a><a name="para22">22.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Four other points should be mentioned. First, I have only referred to
the basic facts of this case. Although Moses LJ, who gave the only reasoned
judgment in the Court of Appeal thought otherwise (see paras 19-22 of his
judgment), I agree with Mr Maugham QC, for Eclipse, that, in connection with
the point at issue, it is inappropriate to consider the detailed facts of this
case relating to the preparation of the Bundle and which led to the making of
the Order. This case raises an issue of principle, which turns on the
interpretation of the Rules.</a></p><a name="para22">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para22"></a><a name="para23">23.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Secondly, there was some suggestion that, given that they relate to the
procedure of a tribunal rather than a court, the Rules should be interpreted on
a somewhat looser basis than Rules of court. I accept that the procedure of the
tribunals is intended to be less formal and more flexible than that of the
traditional courts. While that consideration can, indeed should, properly be
taken into account when interpreting the Rules, I do not believe that it
justifies a different result. Indeed, if anything, it is a point which supports
the conclusion I have reached, based as it is on the fact that the Rules point
strongly against costs-shifting in the tribunal, whereas costs-shifting in
litigation in traditional courts is still the norm.</a></p><a name="para23">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para23"></a><a name="para24">24.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Thirdly, the fact that things could have been arranged so as to achieve
the same result as the Order is irrelevant to the outcome of this appeal. As
Moses LJ pointed out in para 22 of his judgment, the FTT could have ordered
both parties to prepare the Bundles jointly, in which case there would have
been a powerful argument for saying that Eclipse could have recovered the £108,395.48
which they now claim, simply on the basis of a contribution between two jointly
liable parties. But that is not what happened here: Eclipse were liable for the
preparation of the Bundles, and it is not sensibly possible to characterise the
Order as having any effect other than requiring the Revenue to pay some of
Eclipse’s costs, an order which was precluded by rule 10(1).</a></p><a name="para24">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para24"></a><a name="para25">25.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Finally, it is perhaps worth recording that, during the hearing of this
appeal, Lord Toulson mentioned the possibility of Eclipse having a claim
against the Revenue for £108,395.48 based on restitution, in the same way that a
restitutionary claim may be made where services are performed under a contract
which is for some reason unenforceable or void. That argument could not be
pursued before us, and therefore I should say no more about it.</a></p><a name="para25">

<p class="ParaHeading">Conclusion</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para25"></a><a name="para26">26.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the event, for the reasons given in paras 17 to 21 above, I would
dismiss this appeal.</a></p><a name="para26">
