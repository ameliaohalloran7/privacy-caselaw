<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This appeal concerns the interpretation of Council Regulation (EC) No
44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement
of judgments in civil and commercial matters (“the Judgments Regulation”). The
question is whether the English courts have jurisdiction to hear the claim by the
appellant (“AMTF”) against the respondent (“MMGR”) for damages for the tort of
inducing breach of contract.</a></p><a name="para1">

<p class="ParaHeading">Factual background</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1"></a><a name="para2">2.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>AMTF is incorporated in the United Kingdom and is based in London. It
provides services as a non-advisory, “execution only”, derivatives broker for
clients who wish to trade in derivatives and who are referred to it by
introducing brokers. Among AMTF’s clients were people who were domiciled in
Germany, Austria, Switzerland or Belgium (“the former clients”) and who were
introduced to AMTF by independent brokers based in Germany (“the introducing
brokers”). AMTF charged its clients commission for its service and paid
commission to the introducing brokers.</a></p><a name="para2">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2"></a><a name="para3">3.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>About 70 former clients, who were dissatisfied with the financial
results of their transactions, commenced legal proceedings in Germany against
both the introducing brokers and AMTF seeking damages under the German law of
delict. The claim against the introducing brokers was that they had given bad
investment advice or had failed to warn of the risks of the investments. The
claim against AMTF was based on a liability which was accessory to that of the
brokers: it was alleged that AMTF had encouraged the brokers to behave as they
did by paying them commission from the transaction accounts which it operated
for its clients and that it owed and had breached a duty in delict (tort) to
the clients to prevent any transactions being undertaken contrary to their
interests. AMTF challenged the jurisdiction of the German court. But many of
the former clients have recovered damages from AMTF by way of settlement. AMTF
estimates that by August 2013 it had spent £2,191,881.68 on investigating the German
claims, legal costs in Germany and England and settlement costs.</a></p><a name="para3">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para3"></a><a name="para4">4.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The agreements between AMTF and the former clients varied over time. But
each contained clauses which provided (a) that English law would govern the
rights and obligations of the contracting parties and the construction of their
contract and (b) that the English courts would have exclusive jurisdiction in
legal proceedings relating to the contract. AMTF asserts that the former
clients have breached their contracts with it by raising legal proceedings
against it in Germany and asserting rights under the German law of delict. AMTF
has raised legal proceedings against many of the former clients seeking damages
for breach of contract in the High Court in London.</a></p><a name="para4">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para4"></a><a name="para5">5.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>MMGR is a company incorporated under the laws of Germany and carries on
business as a firm of lawyers in Germany. AMTF alleges that MMGR induced the
former clients to issue proceedings against it in Germany and to advance causes
of action under German law, in breach of the exclusive jurisdiction and
applicable law clauses in their contracts with AMTF. It has commenced
proceedings in the High Court in London against MMGR, based on the English law
tort of inducing breach of contract, in which it seeks both damages and
injunctive relief to restrain MMGR from inducing clients to bring further
claims in Germany asserting causes of action under German law. AMTF argues that
the English courts have jurisdiction over its claim under article 5.3 of the
Judgments Regulation, which gives jurisdiction in tort claims to the courts for
the place in which the harmful event occurred or may occur. MMGR challenges the
jurisdiction of the English courts to entertain this action. To that end MMGR
applied for a declaration that the English courts did not have jurisdiction
over it in respect of the subject matter of AMTF’s claim.</a></p><a name="para5">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Popplewell J in a judgment dated 11 April 2014 (</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Comm/2014/1085.html">[2014] EWHC 1085 (Comm)</a>);
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2015/143.html">[2015] QB 699</a> refused MMGR’s application and held that the English courts had
jurisdiction. He decided that the relevant harm which gives rise to
jurisdiction under article 5.3 occurred in England as AMTF had in each case
been deprived of the benefit of the exclusive jurisdiction clause, which, he
held, created a positive obligation on a former client to bring proceedings in
England. The Court of Appeal in a judgment dated 26 February 2015 (<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2015/143.html">[2015] EWCA Civ 143</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2015/143.html">[2015] QB 699</a>), in which Christopher Clarke LJ wrote the leading
judgment, concluded that the English courts did not have jurisdiction as the
relevant harm had occurred in Germany. The Court of Appeal were not
enthusiastic about the conclusion which they felt compelled to reach as it
meant the ancillary claim in tort against MMGR for inducing the breach of the
contracts could not be made in the court which the contract breaker had agreed
would have exclusive jurisdiction over the contract. Thus AMTF’s claims against
its former clients for breach of contract, which could proceed in England under
the exclusive jurisdiction clauses of their contracts, would be separated from
the ancillary claim against MMGR. AMTF appeals to this court against that
judgment. It submits that the English courts have jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para7">7.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In order to address AMTF’s challenge it is appropriate, first, to
examine the relevant provisions of the Judgments Regulation and the
authoritative case law on those provisions and, secondly, to consider how that
case law applies to the facts of this case. Both AMTF and MMGR submit that the
law is clear and is in their favour. In the event that this court disagrees
with its interpretation, each of AMTF and MMGR seeks a reference to the Court
of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”). I therefore, thirdly, address the
question whether in the light of developments of its jurisprudence it is
necessary to refer a question of interpretation to the CJEU. In discussing the
prior case law in this judgment I refer to both that court and its predecessor,
the Court of Justice of the European Communities, by the acronym “CJEU”.</a></p><a name="para7">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The basic rule in the Judgments Regulation is that a person may be sued
in the member state of his domicile. Article 2 provides:</a></p><a name="para8">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject to this
Regulation, persons domiciled in a member state shall, whatever their

</span>As the opening words of article 2.1 suggest, the basic rule of domicile
is not an exclusive ground of jurisdiction. Other articles within the
Regulation provide alternative grounds. Thus in article 5 there are rules
concerning matters relating to contract and delict among others. Article 5
provides, so far as relevant:</a></p><a name="para9">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“A person domiciled in a member
state may, in another member state, be sued:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">1.(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in matters relating to a

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in matters relating to

<p class="ParaLevel1">Article 6 provides so far as relevant:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“A person domiciled in a member

number of defendants, in the courts for the place where any one of them is
domiciled, provided the claims are so closely connected that it is expedient to
hear and determine them together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments
resulting from separate proceedings; …”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">In relation to contracts conferring exclusive jurisdiction,
article 23 provides:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“If the parties, one or more of
whom is domiciled in a member state, have agreed that a court or the courts of

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The CJEU has provided authoritative rulings on the Judgments Regulation
and its predecessor, the Brussels Convention. Rulings on the interpretation of
provisions of that Convention remain valid for the equivalent provisions in the
Judgments Regulation: <i>Zuid-Chemie BV v Philippo’s Mineralenfabriek NV/SA </i>(Case
C-189/08) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2009/C18908.html">[2010] 2 All ER (Comm) 265</a>, para 18. I discuss the earlier case law
as if it addressed the latter provisions.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para11">11.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Judgments Regulation contains rules of jurisdiction which are
designed to promote legal certainty by allowing prospective litigants, whether
claimants or defendants, to foresee with sufficient certainty which court will
have jurisdiction. The aim of the Judgments Regulation is to prevent parallel
proceedings between courts of different member states and thereby avoid or
limit irreconcilable judgments and non-recognition of judgments. The compulsory
system of jurisdiction which the Judgments Regulation creates is underpinned by
the principle of mutual trust between the courts of the member states. For
those propositions see, for example, <i>Overseas Union Insurance Ltd v New
Hampshire Insurance Co </i>(Case C-351/89) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1991/C35189.html">[1992] QB 434</a>, para 17; <i>Erich

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para12">12.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The general principle is that civil actions are to be brought against
individuals and companies in the courts of the place where they are domiciled.
It would be contrary to the objectives of the Judgments Regulation to interpret
it as requiring the recognition of the jurisdiction of the courts of the
claimant’s domicile, except where it expressly so provides, as that would
enable the claimant to determine the competent court by choosing his own
domicile: <i>Dumez France SA and Tracoba Sarl v Hessische Landesbank (Helaba) </i>(Case
C-220/88) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1990/R22088.html">[1990] ECR I-49</a>, paras 16-19; <i>Kronhofer v Maier </i>(Case
C-168/02) <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2004/C16802.html">[2004] 2 All ER (Comm) 759</a>, para 20.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para13">13.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The derogations from the general rule which confers jurisdiction on the
courts of the defendant’s domicile, including article 5.3, must be
restrictively interpreted in order to achieve the aims of the Judgments
Regulation: <i>Kronhofer v Maier</i> (above), paras 12-14; <i>Coty Germany GmbH
v First Note Perfumes NV </i>(Case C-360/12) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2014/C36012.html">[2014] Bus LR 1294</a>, paras 43-45.
The derogating grounds of jurisdiction are justified because they reflect a
close connection between the dispute and the courts of a member state other
than that in which the defendant is domiciled. That close connection promotes
the efficient administration of justice and proper organisation of the action: <i>Dumez
France SA and Tracoba Sarl v Hessische Landesbank </i>(above), para 17; <i>Kronhofer
v Maier</i> (above), para 15.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para14">14.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is necessary, in my view, to distinguish between the terms of a
derogating ground of jurisdiction on the one hand and the rationale or
justification for the ground on the other as it is the former which confers
jurisdiction, not the latter. I discuss this point further in para 29 below.</a></p><a name="para14">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para14"></a><a name="para15">15.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The CJEU has ruled on the correct approach to article 5.3. It has
interpreted the phrase “the place where the harmful event occurred” (a) to give
the claimant the option of commencing proceedings in the courts of the place
where the event occurred which gave rise to the damage or in the courts of the
place where the damage occurred (if the event and damage were in different
member states): <i>Handelskwekerj GJ Bier BV v Mines de Potasse d’ Alsace SA </i>(Case
C-21/76) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1976/R2176.html">[1978] QB 708</a>, para 24; (b) as “the place where the event giving rise
to the damage, and entailing tortious … liability, directly produced its
harmful effect upon the person who is the immediate victim of the event” and
thus not the place where an indirect victim, such as the parent company of the
immediate victim, suffered financial loss as a result: <i>Dumez France and
Tracoba Sarl v Hessische Landesbank (Helaba) </i>(above), para 20; and (c)
consistently with (b) above, where a victim suffered harm in one member state
and consequential financial loss in another, as referring to the place where
the initial damage occurred: <i>Marinari v Lloyd’s Bank Plc</i> (Case C-364/93)
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1995/C36493.html">[1996] QB 217</a>, paras 14 and 15. The focus in (b) and (c) is thus on where the
direct and immediate damage occurred.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para16">16.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Similarly, in <i>Kronhofer v Maier</i> (above) an investor domiciled in
Austria raised an action in his country against investment consultants based in
Germany who had given him investment advice by telephone which led him to send
funds to Germany to be placed in an investment account and used in an
unsuccessful speculative investment. He argued that, because the financial loss
caused by that investment diminished the totality of his assets which were
concentrated in Austria, he could sue in the courts of the country of his domicile.
The CJEU did not agree. It held that article 5.3 did not allow a claimant who
had suffered financial damage resulting from the loss of part of his assets in
another contracting state to sue in the place of his domicile or where his
assets were concentrated.</a></p><a name="para16">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para16"></a><a name="para17">17.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The CJEU, in the interests of the sound administration of justice, has
had to identify the place where a harmful event has occurred in the course of
an international transaction, where that place was not evident from a
straightforward application of the article. In <i>Réunion Européenne SA v
Spliethoff’s Bevrachtingskantoor BV </i>(Case C-51/97) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1998/C5197.html">[2000] QB 690</a>, which
concerned a claim in damages arising out of the poor quality of a consignment
of peaches which had been carried by sea from Australia to Rotterdam for
delivery to a town in France, the harmful event was a breakdown of the cooling
system during the sea voyage. The CJEU held (para 35) that the place where the
harmful event occurred was to be regarded as the place where the maritime
carrier was to deliver the goods, ie Rotterdam. The Court justified the choice
by reference to the requirements of foreseeability and legal certainty and the
existence of a particularly close connecting factor with the dispute (para 36).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para18">18.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The CJEU has also had to interpret article 5.3 so that it can apply in
circumstances in which it is not possible to identify one place where the
relevant harm has occurred. For example, it has interpreted the phrase “place
where the harmful event occurred” in contexts where a claimant suffers harm to
his personality rights by the publication of libellous material in several member
states. It has held that the claimant may bring an action for damages against
the publisher either (a) before the courts of the member state where the
publisher of the defamatory material is established, which have jurisdiction to
award damages for all the harm caused by the defamation, or (b) before the
courts of each member state in which the publication was distributed and where
he claims that his reputation has been injured, which have jurisdiction only in
respect of the harm caused in the state of the court seised: <i>Shevill v
Presse Alliance SA </i>(Case C-68/93) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1995/C6893.html">[1995] 2 AC 18</a>, paras 31-33.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para19">19.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The publication of material on the internet can make information which
is damaging to a claimant’s personality right available on a worldwide basis,
making it impossible to locate the relevant harm for the purpose of article 5.3
without developing a special rule. The CJEU has recognised that the solution
which it adopted in <i>Shevill</i> based on ascertaining damage caused by
distribution within a particular member state did not address the harm caused
by the availability of such information on the internet. It has therefore
created an additional option for the alleged victim in such circumstances,
attributing jurisdiction to the court of the place where the alleged victim had
its centre of interests: <i>eDate Advertising GmbH v X</i> (Cases C-509/09 and
C-161/10) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2011/C50909.html">[2012] QB 654</a>, paras 40-48, 52.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para20">20.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The CJEU has also developed special rules for the application of article
5.3 to the infringement of intellectual property rights in the context of the
accessibility of the internet. <i>Wintersteiger AG v Products 4U
Sonder-maschinenbau GmbH </i>(Case C-523/10) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2012/C52310.html">[2013] Bus LR 150</a> is a case
concerning a national trademark which in principle protects only in the
territory of the member state in which it is registered. The claimant, which
was the proprietor of an Austrian trademark “Wintersteiger”, asserted that its
trademark had been infringed by the defendant’s registration of the word
“Wingersteiger” in the Google search engine although the registration was
limited to searches carried out via the top level-domain for Germany (ie
“google.de”). The obvious mischief for the claimant was that Austrian customers
could readily use google.de when searching for products causing Wintersteiger
to lose orders in Austria. The CJEU held that the objectives of foreseeability
and the sound administration of justice pointed to treating the courts of the
member state in which the property right in issue was protected (ie Austria) as
the place where the damage occurred (paras 29 and 39) and identifying the place
of establishment of the advertiser (Germany) as the place where the event
giving rise to the damage occurred (paras 37 and 39).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para21">21.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The CJEU has also considered the application of article 5.3 where
reproductions of a work protected by copyright throughout the EU were available
for sale by marketing on the internet in many member states. In circumstances
of infringement of such a right via the internet to which courts does article
5.3 give jurisdiction? In <i>Pinckney v KDG Mediatech AG</i> (Case C-170/12)
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2013/C17012.html">[2013] Bus LR 1313</a>, paras 43-45, the CJEU answered the question by holding that
the court of a member state which protected the copyright would have
jurisdiction because the harmful event alleged might occur within its
jurisdiction. But the court’s jurisdiction was limited to determining the
damage caused within the member state in which it was situated.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para22">22.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Claims for damages against international cartels for breaches of EU
competition law have also required the development of special rules in the
interpretation of article 5.3. In <i>Cartel Damage Claims (CDC) Hydrogen
Peroxide SA v Akzo Nobel NV </i>(Case C-352/13) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2015/C35213.html">[2015] QB 906</a>, it was not
possible to identify a single place where the cartel had come into being as it
resulted from collusive agreements made during several meetings which had taken
place in various places in Europe. It was also difficult to identify in a
conventional way the place where the damage occurred as the claimants’ loss
consisted in a restriction of the buyers’ freedom to contract as a result of
the cartel supplying goods at artificially high prices. The CJEU categorised
the relevant loss as the additional costs incurred because of the artificially
high prices. It held that the place where the damage occurred was identifiable
only for each alleged victim taken individually and was located, in general, at
each victim’s registered office (paras 52 and 56). Once again, the CJEU adapted
the interpretation of article 5.3 to circumstances in which the place of the
relevant harm could not otherwise be identified. The CJEU relied on the
justifications of the rule - the efficacious conduct of potential proceedings
in a court best suited to assess the claim for damages - in devising that
interpretation (para 53).</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">Applying the CJEU’s jurisprudence in this appeal</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para23">23.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There is no dispute in this case that the event occasioning damage, the
alleged inducement of the former clients by MMGR to commence the German legal
proceedings, occurred in Germany. AMTF therefore relies on the alternative
basis under article 5.3, the place where the relevant damage occurred, in
support of its assertion that the English courts have jurisdiction. First,
adopting the reasoning of Popplewell J, it asserts that the relevant harm is
the deprivation of the contractual benefit of dispute resolution in England
under English law so that the English courts could protect and enforce its
substantive rights. Secondly, it submits that Popplewell J’s judgment is
supported by (a) the principles underlying article 5.3, conferring jurisdiction
on a foreseeable court which has a close connection with the underlying
dispute, (b) the nature of the contractual benefit conferred by an exclusive
jurisdiction clause and (c) considerations of the sound administration of
justice in relation to a tort which is a form of accessory liability for breach
of contract. It points out that the CJEU has innovated on its interpretation of
article 5.3 in cases such as <i>eDate Advertising</i>, <i>Wintersteiger </i>and
<i>Cartel Damage Claims</i> by locating the relevant harm at the claimant’s
centre of interests. Such a rule, which would locate the harm in the
jurisdiction of the contractually adopted court, has, it submits, the virtue of
foreseeability, as the CJEU pointed out in <i>Wintersteiger</i> at para 23, and
should be applied when the tort of inducing breach of contract occurs in the
context of an exclusive jurisdiction clause.</a></p><a name="para23">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para23"></a><a name="para24">24.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I am not persuaded by those submissions. The task for the court is to
identify where the relevant harm occurred. That is relatively straightforward
in most circumstances, where there is no need for any special rule such as
those which the CJEU has developed when it has not been possible readily to
identify one place where that harm occurred. It is straightforward in this
case.</a></p><a name="para24">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para24"></a><a name="para25">25.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I deal with AMTF’s first submission. The contractual obligation of the
former clients was, if they chose to sue AMTF, to sue only in England. The
breach of contract which MMGR is said to have induced was the raising of legal
proceedings in Germany. AMTF accepts that the raising of those proceedings in
Germany was the event which gave rise to the damage for the purposes of article
5.3. But AMTF also incurred damage in Germany by having to engage in the German
proceedings and settle claims there.</a></p><a name="para25">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para25"></a><a name="para26">26.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is clear that AMTF did not get the benefit of having any dispute with
the former clients determined under English law by English courts. But the
former clients were under no positive obligation to sue AMTF, which could have
no objection if it was not sued. They were under an obligation not to sue in
Germany or elsewhere than England. The former clients could have performed
their contractual obligations to AMTF either by not raising proceedings in Germany
or, having raised those proceedings, by discontinuing them. Thus the
circumstances of this case can be distinguished from those in <i>Dolphin
Maritime &amp; Aviation Services Ltd v Sveriges Angfartygs Assurans Forening</i>
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Comm/2009/716.html">[2010] 1 All ER (Comm) 473</a>, in which the contractual obligation, of which the
defendants had induced the breach, was the positive obligation to pay money
into the claimants’ bank account in England. In that case, the harm suffered by
the victim of the tort occurred in England where the money should have been
paid.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para27">27.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It may also be, as was suggested during the legal debate in court, that
the raising of the German proceedings has damaged AMTF’s business model as it
sought, through the exclusive jurisdiction clause, to preserve the focus of its
business in London if it traded with overseas clients. But that loss of focus
is consequential upon the direct harm caused by the raising of the German
proceedings. On the clear jurisprudence of the CJEU in cases such as <i>Dumez France
SA and Tracoba Sarl v Hessische Landesbank </i>(above) and <i>Marinari v
Lloyd’s Bank plc</i> (above), article 5.3 is not concerned with such
consequential loss. In my view, which is essentially the same as that of the
Court of Appeal, the direct harm which AMTF suffered from the alleged tort was
the expenditure occasioned by the German proceedings. Thus for the purposes of
article 5.3 the place where the harmful event occurred was Germany. That is
sufficient to determine the appeal.</a></p><a name="para27">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para27"></a><a name="para28">28.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is, nonetheless, appropriate to address AMTF’s second submission,
which in substance seeks this court to craft a special rule for the tort of
inducing breach of contract where the contractual term which has been breached
is an exclusive jurisdiction clause. In my view the rule which AMTF advocates
would be contrary to the clear jurisprudence of the CJEU.</a></p><a name="para28">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para28"></a><a name="para29">29.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>AMTF asserts that the outcome which it favours accords with the
principles underlying or justifying article 5.3. But there is a clear
distinction between a rule of special jurisdiction in the Judgments Regulation,
such as article 5.3, and the justification for such a rule. The rule of special
jurisdiction in a tort case is that harm has occurred or may occur within the
jurisdiction of the court seised. When, as in this case, the court is not
concerned with the event giving rise to the harm, it is the occurrence of the
direct and immediate harm and nothing else that is the connecting factor in
article 5.3. It is that connecting factor which creates the benefits of
foreseeability and promotes the sound administration of justice. Those
benefits, which justify the ground of jurisdiction, are not themselves
connecting factors. To invoke a special ground of jurisdiction a claimant must
bring itself within that ground: <i>Folien Fischer AG v Ritrama SpA </i>(Case
C-133/11) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2012/C13311.html">[2013] QB 523</a>, paras 39 and 40. A claimant cannot establish
jurisdiction under the Judgments Regulation by merely invoking the
justification or rationale of the ground.</p>

</span>Similarly, a focus on the nature of the contractual benefit of which
AMTF has been deprived and the accessory nature of the tort of inducing breach
of contract does not assist. I have discussed the former in para 26 above and
comment on the nature of the tort below. Nor does the inconvenience, which the
separation of the resolution of the contractual claims against the former
clients from the pursuit of the claims against MMGR entails, carry much weight
when one considers the aims of the Judgments Regulation.</a></p><a name="para30">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The fact that a claim in tort is connected with a contractual claim has
not led the CJEU to elide the grounds of jurisdiction in matters relating to a
contract with those in matters relating to tort. In <i>Kalfelis v Bankhaus Schröder,
Münchmeyer, Hengst and Co </i>(Case C-189/87) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1988/R18987.html">[1988] ECR 5565</a> (paras 21-23) the
CJEU held that where a claimant pursued a claim based on tort and contract and
for unjust enrichment, the court which had jurisdiction under article 5.3 to
deal with the claim in tort did not have jurisdiction to deal with the other
elements of the same claim. More recently, in <i>Réunion Européenne SA v
Spliethoff’s Bevrachtingskantoor BV </i>(above) (paras 49-51) the CJEU
confirmed the principle in <i>Kalfelis</i>.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para32">32.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In both <i>Kalfelis</i> and <i>Réunion Européenne</i> the CJEU has
recognised that the scheme of the Judgments Regulation creates the difficulty
that one jurisdiction may not be able to deal with all the related points in a
dispute. This inconvenience is the price which the scheme in the Judgments
Regulation imposes by setting out well-defined rules in order to achieve its
primary purpose of ensuring that there shall be no clash between the
jurisdictions of member states of the EU, as Lord Goff of Chieveley observed in
<i>Airbus Industrie GIE v Patel </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1998/12.html">[1999] 1 AC 119</a>, pp 131-132.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para33">33.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This difficulty is evident in the wording of the Judgments Regulation.
Article 6 of the Judgments Regulation does not confer jurisdiction on the
courts of a member state over a co-defendant as a result of the close
connection of the claims unless one of the defendants is domiciled in that
member state. Jurisdiction on an article 5 ground does not suffice. Similarly,
article 23 can confer exclusive jurisdiction on a court as a result of the
agreement of the parties but that jurisdiction cannot be pleaded against people
who are not parties to the agreement.</a></p><a name="para33">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para33"></a><a name="para34">34.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Under the Judgments Regulation there is no scope outside the rules for
identifying a forum conveniens. The German courts, if seised of the matter, can
apply English law if it is the governing law. The fact that parties to a
contract have selected a jurisdiction to resolve their dispute does not entitle
the courts of the selected member state to review or seek to restrain the
jurisdiction of the court on which a rule of the Judgment Regulation has
conferred jurisdiction: <i>West Tankers Inc v Allianz SpA (formerly RAS
Riunuine Adriatica di Sicurità SpA) </i>(Case C-185/07) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2009/C18507.html">[2009] AC 1138</a>, paras
29-32.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para35">35.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The application of the Judgments Regulation, as I construe it, will
separate the determination of AMTF’s contractual claims against its former
clients from the determination of its tort claim against MMGR. But such
inconvenience is the price of achieving the legal certainty and foreseeability
which are among the principal aims of the Judgments Regulation, as the CJEU has
recognised and endorsed. Further, I do not see any jurisdictional difficulty
for AMTF if it were to seek to protect itself against any future attempts by
MMGR to induce AMTF’s other clients to breach their contractual obligations:
AMTF can raise proceedings in Germany, in the courts of MMGR’s domicile.</a></p><a name="para35">

<p class="ParaHeading">Whether a reference to the CJEU is mandated?</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para35"></a><a name="para36">36.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr De la Mare for AMTF submits as a fall back that if it is not clear
that article 5.3 should be applied as he submits where the contractual
provision which has been breached as a result of the defendant’s inducement is
an exclusive jurisdiction clause, this court should refer the issue to the
CJEU. Guidance would be needed as to whether article 5.3 would establish the
jurisdiction of the English courts where MMGR’s alleged tortious behaviour has
undermined the contractual creation of a sole jurisdiction in England, a
connecting factor which has the advantage of foreseeability, would promote the
sound administration of justice and avoid the fragmentation of disputes.</a></p><a name="para36">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The circumstances which have caused the CJEU to develop special rules to
interpret article 5.3 in order to identify the place where the harmful event
occurred, such as to locate harm at a claimant’s registered office (<i>Cartel
Damage Claims</i>) or at its centre of interests (<i>eDate Advertising</i>) do
not arise in this case, in which there is no difficulty in locating where the
relevant harm has occurred. The event giving rise to harm and the relevant harm
which that event directly caused both occurred in Germany.</a></p><a name="para38">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para38"></a><a name="para39">39.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>AMTF also submits that EU legislation has recently shown more favour
towards exclusive jurisdiction clauses. Article 31(2) of the recast Judgments
Regulation (Regulation EU No 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 12 December 2012) provides that where a court, on which the parties
have conferred exclusive jurisdiction by an agreement which complies with
article 25, is seised, any court of another member state must stay its
proceedings until the former court declares that it has no jurisdiction. AMTF
submits that this may mean that the CJEU would take a more accommodating
approach to exclusive jurisdiction clauses. Be that as it may, it does not
assist AMTF to establish for the purpose of jurisdiction under article 5.3 that
the place where the harmful event occurred was England.</a></p><a name="para39">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para39"></a><a name="para40">40.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Recent case law of the CJEU does not suggest that the court has moved
from the principles and approach which I have set out in paras 11 to 13, 15 and
16 above. The CJEU has repeatedly stated in recent times that the provisions of
the Regulation must be interpreted independently by reference to its scheme and
purpose, and derogations from the general rule that jurisdiction is given to
the court of the defendant’s domicile have to be interpreted restrictively: <i>Melzer
v MF Global UK Ltd </i>(Case C-228/11) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2013/C22811.html">[2013] QB 1112</a>, paras 22 and 24; <i>Coty
Germany (above)</i>, paras 43-45; and <i>Kolassa v Barclays Bank Plc </i>(Case
C-375/13) <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2015/C37513.html">[2015] ILPr 14</a>, para 43.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para41">41.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The focus in article 5.3, which is relevant to AMTF’s claim, remains on
the place where the event resulted in the initial damage: <i>Zuid-Chemie BV v
Philippo’s Mineralenfabriek NV/SA </i>(above), paras 26-32; <i>Universal Music
International Holding BV v Schilling, Schwarz, Brož </i>(Case C-12/15)
(</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/EUECJ/2016/C1215.html">EU:C:2016:449</a>), paras 30-34. There is no complexity in the present case in
identifying that place which might cause the CJEU to develop a special rule as
to the location of the harmful event.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para42">42.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In support of an innovative interpretation of article 5.3, AMTF relies
on the characteristics of the English law tort of inducing breach of contract
and the application of the tort to an exclusive jurisdiction clause. Creating a
special rule in this way to accommodate the domestic law of tort of a
particular member state would, in my view, undermine the certainty and
foreseeability of that ground of jurisdiction, which is available to people and
organisations in all of the member states of the EU.</a></p><a name="para42">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para42"></a><a name="para43">43.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>These considerations, which depend on EU law and not domestic law and
are thus equally obvious to the courts of other member states, persuade me that
the matter is acte clair and that no reference is mandated, having regard to
the criteria laid down in <i>CILFIT v Ministero della Sanità </i>(Case
C-283/81) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1982/R28381.html">[1982] ECR 3415</a>.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">Whether consideration of AMTF’s claim by the English court
would infringe EU law</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para44">44.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As I have concluded that the Judgments Regulation does not give
jurisdiction to the English courts over AMTF’s claim, it is not necessary to
address the issue, which MMGR raised, as to whether the English court which
purports to hear AMTF’s claim thereby breaches EU law by impermissibly
interfering with the judgments of the German courts.</a></p><a name="para44">

<p class="ParaHeading">MMGR’s cross appeal on costs</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para44"></a><a name="para45">45.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>MMGR appeals against the decision of the Court of Appeal to award it
only part of its costs at first instance and on appeal (the part relating to
the issue whether the place of the harmful event was in England) and to require
it to pay AMTF’s costs at first instance and on appeal on the question of
whether AMTF’s claim had real prospects of success.</a></p><a name="para45">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para45"></a><a name="para46">46.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At first instance, MMGR had challenged the prospects of success of
AMTF’s claim on the basis that the exclusive jurisdiction clause was
unenforceable because the former clients were consumers who were protected by
the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 and articles 16, 17 and
23(5) of the Judgments Regulation. Popplewell J rejected this submission. In
the Court of Appeal the argument took the form that the English courts could
not grant an injunction or award damages against MMGR without impermissibly
attacking the assumption of jurisdiction by the German courts. The Court of
Appeal did not require to determine this question but observed that it did not
appear to be well founded (a) because an injunction against MMGR from inducing
a breach of contract did not preclude anyone from commencing proceedings in
Germany and (b) because a claim for damages against MMGR for the loss
occasioned by the breach of contract which MMGR had induced was not a
collateral attack on the jurisdiction of the German courts.</a></p><a name="para46">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para46"></a><a name="para47">47.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I deal with this challenge to the award of costs briefly. The court has
a broad discretion in relation to costs under CPR rule 44.2. While there is a
starting point that the unsuccessful party will pay the costs of the successful
party (CPR rule 44.2(2)(a)), the court is entitled in CPR rule 44.2(4) to have
regard to the parties’ relative success on the issues raised. The court has a
discretion on the question of relative success and an appellate court will
overturn its decision on such a matter only if it has gone beyond the limits of
its discretion or otherwise erred in law.</a></p><a name="para47">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para47"></a><a name="para48">48.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>MMGR did not renew in the Court of Appeal its challenge based on the
alleged status of the former clients as consumers. The Court of Appeal
expressed a clear although not conclusive view on the challenge on the merits
which MMGR advanced before them.</a></p><a name="para48">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para48"></a><a name="para49">49.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I see no basis for impugning the discretionary decision of the Court of
Appeal. Insofar as the challenged element of the award covered MMGR’s
submission on the merits before Popplewell J, an argument with which MMGR has
not persisted, the Court of Appeal’s award should stand. Insofar as MMGR, in
raising the second issue in this court, has renewed the arguments it advanced
on the merits before the Court of Appeal, it can raise the question of costs in
relation to those arguments in any submissions on costs which it chooses to
make to this court after the court’s judgment is handed down.</a></p><a name="para49">

<p class="ParaHeading">Conclusion</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I would dismiss the appeal.</a></p><a name="para50">
