</span></a></span><a name="para1"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The issue in this case is whether
the Crown is bound by the prohibition of smoking in most enclosed public places
and workplaces, contained in Chapter 1 of Part 1 of the Health Act 2006 (for
shorthand, I shall call its provisions “the smoking ban”). The issue comes
before this Court because a prisoner, who is serving an indeterminate sentence at
Her Majesty’s Prison Wymott and a non-smoker with a number of health problems,
complains that the ban is not being properly enforced in the common parts of
the prison. But the same issue affects the myriad of premises which are
occupied by central government departments, the civil servants and other people
who work there, and the members of the public who visit the premises for
business or pleasure. They need to know whether the smoking ban which applies
to those premises is simply an instruction from the managers or whether it is
backed up by criminal sanctions and other enforcement measures having the force
of law.</span></a></p><a name="para1">

<p class="ParaHeading">This case</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1"></a><a name="para2">2.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellant suffers from a number of health problems which are
exacerbated by tobacco smoke, including hypertension and coronary heart
disease. He has a history of myocardial infarction and required surgical
coronary intervention in 2009. He complains about his exposure to second-hand
tobacco smoke in the common parts of the prison. He alleges that both staff and
prisoners often smoke in areas of the prison where smoking is prohibited. The
Secretary of State disputes this, but it is not the business of these
proceedings to resolve that factual dispute.</a></p><a name="para2">

</a><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:26.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2"><span style="font-size:
13.0pt"></span></a><a name="para3">3.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In September 2013, the appellant
asked that the National Health Service Smoke-free Compliance Line (SFCL) be put
on the prison phone system for all prisoners. This would enable them to report
breaches of the smoking ban to the local authorities charged with enforcing it.
He followed this up with a pre-action protocol letter as a prelude to issuing
judicial review proceedings. At first, this brought him the result he was
looking for - on 13 January 2014, the prison issued instructions that
arrangements be made for him to have access to the SFCL on his individual phone
account. By itself, that might be thought to indicate that the prison thought
that the smoking ban applied to them, for what would otherwise be the point of
relaxing the general ban on adding Freephone numbers to prisoners’ mobile
phones, if not to enable them to alert the enforcement authority of possible
breaches of the ban?</span></a></p><a name="para3">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para3"></a><a name="para4">4.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>However, that is unlikely to be the case, because the very next day the
Secretary of State stated in a letter, in answer to the pre-action protocol
letter, that</a></p><a name="para4">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Part 1 of the Health Act does not
bind the Crown. Accordingly, the Secretary of State is of the view that Local
Authorities (including on reference by the Compliance Line) have no statutory
role in relation to the enforcement of smoke-free provisions at HMP Wymott.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaNoNumber"><a name="para4">The appellant therefore launched these proceedings in
March 2014, seeking judicial review of the Secretary of State’s refusal to
provide confidential and anonymous access to the SFCL to prisoners. He was
successful before Singh J, who held that the Act did bind the Crown and quashed
the Secretary of State’s decision: </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2015/528.html">[2015] EWHC 528 (Admin)</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2015/528.html">[2015] 1 WLR 3963</a>.
The Secretary of State appealed successfully to the Court of Appeal, which held
that the Act did not bind the Crown: <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2016/125.html">[2016] EWCA Civ 125</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2016/125.html">[2016] QB 1060</a>. The
appellant now appeals to this Court.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">The background to the smoking ban</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para5">5.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It has, of course, been known for a long time that smoking tobacco is
hazardous to the health of the smoker. Recognition of the dangers of passive
smoking is more recent. An account of the genesis of the smoking ban, in the
context of hospitals, including mental health units, can be found in Appendix A
to the judgment of the Court of Appeal in <i>R (G) v Nottinghamshire Healthcare
NHS Trust </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2009/795.html">[2009] EWCA Civ 795</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2009/795.html">[2010] PTSR 674</a>, an unsuccessful challenge
to the smoking ban at Rampton Hospital on human rights grounds. Briefly, in
1998, <i>Smoking kills: A White Paper on Tobacco </i>(Cm 4177) estimated that
smoking in the United Kingdom caused 46,500 deaths from cancer and 40,300
deaths from all circulatory diseases. Smokers who smoked regularly and then
died of smoking-related diseases lost on average 16 years from their life
expectancy when compared with non-smokers. However, at that time it was thought
that the case for legal action to restrict smoking was not sufficiently strong.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para6">6.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In reports of 1998 and 2004, the Scientific Committee on Tobacco and
Health concluded that exposure to second-hand smoking (SHS) was a cause of a
range of serious medical conditions and recommended restrictions on smoking in
public places and work-places so as to protect non-smokers from SHS. The
overall increased risk of lung cancer for non-smokers exposed to SHS was put at
24%. In December 2005, the House of Commons Health Committee reported that SHS
caused at least 12,000 deaths a year in the United Kingdom of which a minimum
of 500 were due to the presence of smoke in the workplace (First Report Session
2005-2006, <i>Smoking in Public Places</i>, HC 485-I, para 17). One year after
the smoking ban came into force, the Department of Health published a report, <i>Smoke-free
England - one year on </i>(2008), which stated:</a></p><a name="para6">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Medical and scientific evidence
shows that exposure to second-hand smoke increases the risk of serious medical
conditions such as lung cancer, heart disease, asthma attacks, childhood respiratory
disease, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and reduced lung function.
Scientific evidence also shows that ventilation does not eliminate the risks to
health of second-hand smoke in enclosed places. The only way to provide
effective protection is to prevent people breathing in second-hand smoke in the
first place.”</p>

</a><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:26.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para6"><span style="font-size:

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In his foreword to that Report,
Sir Liam Donaldson, Chief Medical Officer, recalled that he had first called
for public places and workplaces to made smoke-free in his 2002 Annual Report,
which was met with considerable hostility as well as support. The following
year, his 2003 Annual Report set out the economic case for smoke-free
legislation, and recommended that smoke-free workplaces and smoke-free enclosed
public places should be created as a priority through legislation.</span></a></p><a name="para7">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">This recommendation was reinforced
by the international obligations undertaken by the United Kingdom. In 2003, the
World Health Organisation published its <i>Framework Convention on Tobacco
Control</i>. The United Kingdom ratified this in December 2004 and it came into
force on 27 February 2005. Article 8, headed <i>Protection from exposure to

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parties recognize that

and implement in areas of existing national jurisdiction as determined by

</span>In 2004, after extensive public consultation, the Department of Health
published a White Paper <i>Choosing Health - Making Healthy Choices Easier</i>
(Cm 6374), canvassing a number of health-related initiatives. Among these,
reducing the number of people who smoke was a priority:</a></p><a name="para9">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“because it leads to heart
disease, strokes, cancer and many other fatal diseases; because many people
felt this was an area in which they needed more support in addressing the
problem; because many people were concerned about the effects of second-hand
smoke; and because many parents were concerned about their children taking up
smoking.” (Executive Summary, para 10)</p>

thus:</a></p><a name="para10">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Change has been slow and public demand

balance significantly in favour of smoke-free environments. Subject to

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">We will use the intervening period

in certain establishments - such as hospices, prisons and long stay residential
care. In implementing this policy there are also a range of practical issues that
will need to be addressed - we will need to consult, for example, with schools

a smoking ban in government departments and the NHS before other premises,
nowhere is it stated that any proposed legislation would not cover government

</span>The Queen’s Speech on 17 May 2005 announced that legislation to restrict
smoking in enclosed public places and workplaces would be introduced in that
session. In June 2005, the Government published its <i>Consultation on the
Smoke-free Elements of the Health Improvement and Protection Bill</i>, covering
matters such as definitions, exceptions, signage, offences and enforcement.
Paragraph 1 announced that the aim of the policy was to make “almost all
enclosed public places and workplaces smoke-free”. Only a limited number of
exceptions would be permitted in regulations. Once again, there is no hint that
the legislation would not bind the Crown or apply to central government
departments. Exceptions were canvassed for establishments where people lived,
and “prisons and other places of detention” were listed.</a></p><a name="para13">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Neither the Department of Health

immunity during our inquiry. It is not mentioned in the Explanatory Notes to

We find these omissions extraordinary especially as Crown Immunity removes the
necessity for exempting many premises.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The Government’s response (Cmnd 6769, March 2006) was
this, at para 7 of its conclusions and recommendations:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Through convention, legislation
is not usually binding on Crown land. The Health Bill is no exception. No
specific reference was therefore made since this legislation followed this
usual convention.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">While Crown Immunity does remove
the requirement for specific premises to be exempted from smoke-free
legislation, it is important that plans are in place for such places to become
smoke-free, keeping in the spirit of the legislation. Strategies are in place
which will see all central government and NHS buildings in England become
totally smoke-free by the end of 2006.”</p>

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">While the Bill was going through
Parliament, the Department of Health consulted on the proposed regulations: <i>Smoke-free
premises and vehicles: Consultation on proposed regulations to be made under
powers in the Health Bill </i>(July 2006). This made it clear that “there is no
intention through smoke-free legislation to prevent individuals from smoking in
areas of premises which are considered to be private residential space.
Nevertheless, in certain types of residential accommodation, balance is needed
between allowing people to smoke in their own residential spaces and protecting
others from exposure to second-hand smoke, including the other people who call
the premises home and the people who work there”. Among the premises listed
where such a balance was needed were prisons (para 3.12). Once again, there was
no suggestion in the Consultation that government premises would be exempt from
the ban, and therefore that only private prisons would be included.
Accordingly, the Smoke-free (Exemptions and Vehicles) Regulations 2007 (SI
2007/765), regulation 5, provide that the person in charge of such premises,
including prisons, may designate bedrooms or smoking rooms as not smoke-free.
Prisons are expressly exempt from the requirement that doors which open onto
smoke-free premises must be automatically self-closing (regulation 5(3)(e)).</span></a></p><a name="para20">

whether an Act giving the municipality power to lay water mains for the purpose
of water supply through, across or under any street and into, through or under
any land in the city allowed it to lay a water main in a private road belong to
the government. Lord du Parcq, giving the judgment of the Board, said this (at
61):</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The general principle to be
applied in considering whether or not the Crown is bound by general words in a
statute is not in doubt. The maxim of the law in early times was that no
statute bound the Crown unless the Crown was expressly named therein, ‘Roy n’est
lie par ascun statute si il ne soit expressement nosme.’ But the rule so laid
down is subject to at least one exception. The Crown may be bound, as has often
been said, ‘by necessary implication.’ If, that is to say, it is manifest from
the very terms of the statute, that it was the intention of the legislature
that the Crown should be bound, then the result is the same as if the Crown had
been expressly named. It must then be inferred that the Crown, by assenting to
the law, agreed to be bound by its provisions.”</p>

</span></a></span><a name="para24"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">There being no express provision,
the Board was concerned with necessary implication. They rejected the view of
the Chief Justice that the necessary implication could be found if the law
could not operate “efficiently and smoothly” if the Crown were not bound. This
seemed to ignore the possibility that the legislature may have expected that
the Crown would “co-operate with the corporation so far as its own duty to
safeguard a wider public interest made co-operation possible and politic” (p
62). The Board also rejected the view, albeit supported by much earlier
authority, that the Crown must be held to be bound by any statute enacted “for
the public good”, because every statute must be supposed to be for the public
good (p 63). Nevertheless the purpose was relevant:</span></a></p><a name="para24">

Lordships prefer to say that the apparent purpose of the statute is one
element, and may be an important element, to be considered when an intention to
bind the Crown is alleged. If it can be affirmed that, at the time when the
statute was passed and received the royal sanction, it was apparent from its
terms that its beneficent purpose must be <i>wholly frustrated</i> unless the
Crown were bound, then it may be inferred that the Crown has agreed to be
bound.” (emphasis supplied)</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:26.0pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The Board also declined to adopt a rather different
approach which had found favour in Scotland (see further below) (p 64) and

cautela” without necessarily implying that the Crown was bound by other provisions
in the Act (p 65).</span></p>

Advocate v Dumbarton District Council </i>[1990] 2 AC 580, where Lord Keith of

rather more comprehensively with the modern cases. The issue was whether the
Ministry of Defence was entitled to cone off a section of the A814 road without
the permission of the roads authority under the Roads (Scotland) Act 1984 or
the local planning authority under the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act
1972. The first question was whether the law of Scotland was the same as the
law of England in this respect. Before the Acts of Union, Scots law did not
have the same presumption as English law, and there were Scottish cases
suggesting that the rule was rather different there. Lord Keith held that there
were no rational grounds for adopting a different approach to the construction
of statutes in Scotland and in England and that the modern English approach
should prevail (p 591).</span></a></p><a name="para25">

This was not directly concerned with whether the statute in question bound the
Crown, but with whether the Crown was a “person” for a particular purpose.
While holding that the Crown was such a person, their Lordships reiterated the
classic doctrine, Lord MacDermott and Lord Reid locating this as a rule of
statutory construction rather than an aspect of the royal prerogative.
Similarly in <i>Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</i> <i>v Jenkins </i>[1963]
2 QB 317, it was held that the Crown was not bound by the Town and Country
Planning Act 1947 to get planning permission for the afforestation of its land.</p>

to be prohibited by the statute) and actions such as this interference with the
highway (which was unlawful and thus presumed to be prohibited). He rejected
this distinction as undesirable, requiring as it would a minute inquiry into
the powers of the Crown in the particular context and involving a different
construction of the same statute depending upon the outcome of that inquiry. He
concluded thus, at 604:</span></a></p><a name="para30">

it is preferable, in my view, to stick to the simple rule that the Crown is not

only by express words or necessary implication. The modern authorities do not,
in my opinion, require that any gloss should be placed upon that formulation of
the principle.”</span></p>

The issue was whether or not the Coroners Act
2009, and specifically the investigatory powers contained in Schedule 5, was
binding on the Crown, so that the Commissioners were entitled and obliged to
provide the coroner with historical occupational information for the purpose of
investigating whether the deceased had died of an industrial disease,
overriding their statutory duty of confidentiality. The Court held that the Act
did bind the Crown, as it was intended to strengthen the powers of coroners and
to enable them to conduct an effective investigation into deaths for which the
state might bear some responsibility, as required by article 2 of the European
Convention on Human Rights. That legislative purpose would be frustrated if it
was not binding on the Crown. Mr James Eadie QC, for the Secretary of State in
this case, accepts that the <i>Liverpool Coroner’s </i>case was rightly decided<i>.</i></p>

result that the smoking ban is binding on the Crown. In reverse order, these

existing rule in such a way that the smoking ban binds the Crown.</span></a></p><a name="para32">

</span>Mr Havers points out that the rule has been subject to criticism from
distinguished commentators, ranging from Glanville Williams, who called it “a
gap made in the ‘rule of law’” (in <i>Crown Proceedings,</i> London, Stevens,
1948, at p 49); and <i>Bennion on Statutory Interpretation</i>, which describes
insistence on necessary implication as “typical of the unrealistic attitude
displayed by some judges in resisting implied meaning in statutes” (London,
LexisNexis, 6th ed, Oliver Jones (ed), 2013, at p 181), to Paul Craig, who
describes the present law as unsatisfactory, unclear and the product of a
misinterpretation of earlier authority (in <i>Administrative Law</i>, London,
Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 8th ed (2016), at para 29.003). In his view, careful
thought is not always given to whether the Crown should be bound, which may be
overlooked or receive scant attention when legislation is drafted.</a></p><a name="para33">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Two solutions have been canvassed.
One, favoured by Glanville Williams and Paul Craig, is to reverse the
presumption, so that the Crown is bound unless expressly excluded from some or
all of the Act’s provisions. This would have the merit of clarity and
certainty. It would force the Crown to think carefully about whether and to
what extent it should be bound and to justify any exemption. The other,
favoured by Bennion, is that there should be a single test: what did Parliament
intend? In other words, there would be no presumption either way and no
requirement that any implication be “necessary”. This would be to apply the
general rule of statutory interpretation to the question, but it would not
produce the clarity and certainty of the alternative suggestion.</span></a></p><a name="para34">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">It is easy to see the merits of
the solution put forward by Glanville Williams and Paul Craig. However, the
problem for this Court in adopting either of the solutions proposed is that the
presumption, as stated in the <i>Bombay</i>, <i>Madras</i> and above all the <i>Dumbarton
</i>cases, is so well established in modern times that many, many statutes will
have been drafted and passed on the basis that the Crown is not bound except by
express words or necessary implication. Decisions of this Court, or indeed any
court, generally operate retrospectively to alter the previous understanding of
the law. It may be possible for the Court to declare that a new understanding of
the law will operate only prospectively: the possibility was canvassed at
length in <i>In re Spectrum Plus Ltd </i></span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2005/41.html">[2005] UKHL 41</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2005/41.html">[2005] 2 AC 680</a>. But
such a course would be wholly exceptional and the case for doing so has
certainly not been made before us. I would therefore decline to abolish the
rule or reverse the presumption, although I would urge Parliament, perhaps with
the assistance of the Law Commission, to give careful consideration to the
merits of doing so.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Modify the test</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:26.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm"><span style="font-size:

</span></a></span><a name="para36"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">It is certainly open to this Court
to clarify the test, even if such clarification has the effect of modifying the
understanding which some, at least, may have had of it. We can begin with some
simple propositions:</span></a></p><a name="para36">

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Crown is not
bound by a statutory provision except by express words or necessary
implication.</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not an
immunity from liability, strictly so-called, but a rule of statutory
interpretation.</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The goal of all
statutory interpretation is to discover the intention of the legislation.</p>

</a><p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt"><a name="para36">(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That intention is to
be gathered from the words used by Parliament, considered in the light of their
context and their purpose. In this context, it is clear that Lord Hobhouse’s
dictum in <i>R (Morgan Grenfell &amp; Co Ltd) v Special Commissioner of Income
Tax </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2002/21.html">[2002] UKHL 21</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2002/21.html">[2003] 1 AC 563</a>, at para 45, that “A <i>necessary </i>implication
is one which necessarily follows from the express provisions of the statute
construed in their context” must be modified to include the purpose, as well as
the context, of the legislation.</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In considering the
intention of the legislation, it is not enough that it is intended for the
public good or that it would be even more beneficial for the public if the
Crown were bound.</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it is not
necessary that the purpose of the legislation would be “wholly frustrated” if
the Crown were not bound. In the <i>Bombay case</i>, it is clear that the Board
was only using this as one example of where the Crown would be bound by
necessary implication. In this case, it is accepted that the <i>Liverpool
Coroner’s case </i>was rightly decided. The purpose of the Coroners Act would
not have been “wholly frustrated” had it not bound the Crown. But one very
important purpose of the Act would have been frustrated: that was to render the
inquest process compliant with the United Kingdom’s obligations under the
European Convention on Human Rights, so that deaths for which the state might
bear some responsibility could be properly investigated.</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In considering
whether the purpose of the Act can be achieved without the Crown being bound,
it is permissible to consider the extent to which the Crown is likely
voluntarily to take action to achieve it. Inaction cannot be assumed. It may be
that the Act’s purpose can as well be achieved by the Crown exercising its
powers properly and in the public interest. But if it cannot, that is a factor
to be taken into account in determining the intention of the legislation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:26.0pt;

</span></a></span><a name="para37"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In my view, that is all that need
be said. It is neither necessary nor desirable to add further glosses to the
test, or to characterise it by adjectives such as “strict”. The question is
whether, in the light of the words used, their context and the purpose of the
legislation, Parliament must have meant the Crown to be bound.</span></a></p><a name="para37">

</span>Some strong points can be made in favour of the conclusion that
Parliament did indeed mean the Crown to be bound by the smoking ban. Although
the government announced an intention to bring in a ban before the legislation
was passed, there is no hint in the government publications leading up to the
adoption of the policy that the Crown would not be bound by the legislation
when it came into force (other than the exchange with the Health Committee
referred to at para 14 above). If this had been made clear, one might have expected
the anti-smoking campaigners and the trade unions and staff associations
protecting the interests of civil servants and others working for the
government to say something about it. The ban was intended to protect workers
and visitors from the known dangers of being exposed to second-hand smoke, when
reliance on voluntary measures had not proved effective, and omitting Crown
premises would deny statutory protection to large numbers of people.</a></p><a name="para38">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">There are very significant
differences between a smoking ban voluntarily imposed by an occupier or
employer and the smoking ban imposed by the Act:</span></a></p><a name="para39">

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The signs displayed
have to say that “it is against the law” to smoke in these premises.</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The occupier or
manager is guilty of a criminal offence if such signs are not displayed.</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a criminal
offence to smoke in smoke-free premises.</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The manager has to
take reasonable steps to stop people smoking and is guilty of a criminal
offence if he or she does not.</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Environmental health
officers can be called in to enforce the ban, either against smokers, or
against occupiers and managers, or both.</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(vi)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Environmental health
officers have powers of entry to enable them to do so.</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(vii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Individual
non-smokers who complain about breaches of the ban do not have to bear the
expense and burden of bringing proceedings to enforce it.</p>

</a><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:26.0pt;

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">None of this applies to a ban
voluntarily imposed in government premises. Any signs displayed cannot say that
smoking is “against the law”. The ban is not backed up by criminal sanctions against
smokers or managers. It is not backed up by the enforcement powers of
environmental health officers. The only method of challenging a refusal to
impose or to enforce a smoking ban would be to bring judicial review
proceedings. It is unrealistic to expect workers and members of the public who
are adversely affected by exposure to second-hand smoke in government premises
to bring judicial review proceedings. These are expensive, time-consuming and
inaccessible to most people, nor will they necessarily produce a remedy which
is anything like as effective as the statutory enforcement process.</span></a></p><a name="para40">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In principle, it is not an
objection to the Crown being bound that the Act imposes criminal liability.
This was not mentioned as an objection in the leading English and Scottish
cases. In practice, apart from the smokers themselves, it would be the
individual managers of the premises in question who might be prosecuted, rather
than the relevant Secretary of State. Nor, in principle, is it an objection
that enforcement powers are given to local environmental health officers. The
similar enforcement provisions in the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974
and in the Food Safety Act 1990 do apply to the Crown. There is nothing
unconstitutional about local government officers, or officers of the Health and
Safety Executive, enforcing obligations intended for the protection of workers
or the public in government premises.</span></a></p><a name="para41">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The strongest indication in the
language of the Act that the ban is intended to apply to government premises is
the express mention of prisons in section 3(2). At the time of its enactment,
there were only ten private prisons. All the rest were state run and the great
majority still are. No sensible reason has ever been given for distinguishing
between state and private prisons. Any practical problems of enforcement by
environmental health officers are as great in private prisons as they are in
public prisons. Prisoners in public prisons are in just as much need of
protection from second-hand smoke, and discouragement from smoking, as are
prisoners in private prisons. Her Majesty’s Prison Service certainly thought
that the ban would apply to them and that view must have been shared by the
Department of Health’s Director of Prison Health, who signed the Foreword to
the research study, <i>Stop Smoking Support in HM Prisons: the Impact of
Nicotine Replacement Therapy </i>(January, 2007).</span></a></p><a name="para42">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Against all that, there are
powerful indicators in the language of the Act itself that the Crown was not to
be bound by the smoking ban. First and foremost, it does not say so and it
would have been easy enough so to do.</span></a></p><a name="para43">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Secondly, in Acts with comparable
structures and enforcement powers, there are provisions dealing expressly with
exactly how and to what extent the Act is to apply to the Crown. A good example
is section 48 of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974:</span></a></p><a name="para44">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Furthermore, the 2006 Act contains
just such a provision in another Part of the Act. Section 23, which is
contained in Chapter 1 of Part 3, dealing with the Supervision of Management
and Use of Controlled Drugs, provides:</span></a></p><a name="para46">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“<b>23.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crown application</b></p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Chapter binds the
Crown.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No contravention by the
Crown of any provision of this Chapter shall make the Crown criminally liable;
but the High Court (or, in Scotland, the Court of Session) may declare unlawful
any act or omission of the Crown which constitutes such a contravention.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The provisions of this
Chapter apply to persons in the public service of the Crown as they apply to
other persons.”</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:26.0pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Thus the Crown has to abide by the requirements of
that Chapter but the serious criminal offences imposed in section 21 for
obstructing the powers of entry and inspection conferred by section 20 cannot
be committed by the Crown. They can however be committed by persons in the
public service of the Crown.</span></p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para46"></a><a name="para47">47.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As it happens, virtually identical provision is made in the Scottish
equivalent to the smoking ban contained in Chapter 1 of Part 1 of the 2006 Act,
by section 10 of the Smoking, Health and Social Care (Scotland) Act 2005, which
preceded the 2006 Act:</a></p><a name="para47">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“<b>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crown application</b></p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Part binds the
Crown.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No contravention by the
Crown of this Part or any regulations under it makes the Crown criminally
liable; but the Court of Session may, on the application of a council in the
area of which the contravention is alleged to have taken place, declare
unlawful any act or omission of the Crown which would, but for this subsection,
have been an offence.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsection (2) does not
extend to persons in the public service of the Crown.”</p>

</a><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:26.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para47"><span style="font-size:

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Had Parliament intended Part 1 of Chapter
1 of the 2006 Act to bind the Crown, nothing would have been easier than to
insert such a provision into that Part. It would have made clear who could be
prosecuted for the offences created. Furthermore, the Report of the Health
Committee does indicate that Parliament was alive to the question of whether
the smoking ban would bind the Crown and aware of the case for further
exemptions if the Act were to do so. It might also be taken to indicate that
Parliament was aware that the mischief at which the Bill was aimed was smoking
on private premises over which the Government had no control.</span></a></p><a name="para48">

</a><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:26.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para48"><span style="font-size:

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">It might well be thought
desirable, especially by and for civil servants and others working in or
visiting government departments, if the smoking ban did bind the Crown. But the
legislation is quite workable without doing so. It cannot be suggested, in the
way that it could be suggested in the <i>Liverpool Coroner’s case</i>, that a
major plank of the Act’s purpose would remain unfulfilled if the Act did not
bind the Crown. The Crown can do a good deal by voluntary action to fill the
gap. The Commissioners were not able to fill the gap unless their obligations
under the Act overrode their duty of confidentiality.</span></a></p><a name="para49">

</a><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:26.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para49"><span style="font-size:

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Thus, not without considerable
reluctance, I am driven to the conclusion that this appeal must fail. There is
a presumption that Acts of Parliament only bind the Crown by express words or
necessary implication. Necessary implication entails that Parliament must have
meant to bind the Crown. The fact that where Parliament did mean to do so in
this Act, it said so, and made tailored provision accordingly, is to my mind
conclusive of the question.</span></a></p><a name="para50">
