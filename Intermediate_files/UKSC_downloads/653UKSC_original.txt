<p class="ParaHeading">Introduction</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1">1.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This appeal concerns the statutory right of appeal against decisions by
the Secretary of State for the Home Department (“the Secretary of State”) to
refuse protection claims and human rights claims under Part 5 of the
Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (“the 2002 Act”) as amended. The
particular question for decision is as follows: Where a person has already had
a protection claim or a human rights claim refused and there is no pending
appeal, do further submissions which rely on protection or human rights grounds
have to be accepted by the Secretary of State as a fresh claim in accordance
with rule 353 of the Immigration Rules if a decision in response to those
representations is to attract a right of appeal under section 82 of the 2002
Act?</a></p><a name="para1">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1"></a><a name="para2">2.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is a conspicuous feature of litigation in the field of immigration
and asylum in this jurisdiction that those whose protection claims or human
rights claims have already been refused seek to make further applications
adducing further submissions or evidence in support. It is necessary that provision
be made for such renewed applications for which there is a sound basis, not
least because circumstances may change significantly and unforeseeably
following the rejection of a claim. In <i>R v Secretary of State for the Home
Department, Ex p Onibiyo</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1996/1338.html">[1996] QB 768</a> Sir Thomas Bingham MR noted (at pp
781-782) that, for example, it is not hard to imagine cases in which an initial
claim for asylum might be made on insubstantial, or even bogus, grounds, and be
rightly rejected, but in which circumstances would subsequently arise or come
to light showing a threat of a kind requiring the grant of asylum. As he
observed, a scheme of legal protection which could not accommodate that
possibility would be seriously defective. In appropriate cases, it will be necessary
to afford access to the statutory system of appeals when a second or subsequent
submission is rejected. Nevertheless, it is necessary to protect such a scheme
of legal protection from abuse. There is, therefore, a need to exclude from the
statutory system of appeals second or successive applications which are made on
grounds which have previously been rejected or which have no realistic prospect
of success, and which are often advanced simply in order to delay removal from
the United Kingdom. The challenge is to provide a system which can deal fairly
and effectively with all such applications while also complying with the United
Kingdom’s international obligations.</p>

</span>The appellant, Mr Jamar Robinson, is a national of Jamaica who was born
on 14 May 1991. He arrived in the United Kingdom on 9 October 1998 when he was
seven years old. He was given leave to enter until 9 April 1999 and then
remained in the United Kingdom without leave.</a></p><a name="para3">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para3"></a><a name="para4">4.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In 2005, at the age of 13, he applied for indefinite leave to remain in
the United Kingdom as a dependant of his aunt who had made an application under
a “one off exercise” to allow families who have been in the United Kingdom for
three years or more to stay. His aunt was granted indefinite leave to remain on
13 May 2011. The appellant’s application was refused as part of later
deportation proceedings.</a></p><a name="para4">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para4"></a><a name="para5">5.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellant has a number of criminal convictions. The index offences
which triggered deportation proceedings were two robberies for each of which he
was sentenced on 20 April 2011 to 18 months’ detention, to run concurrently. At
sentence he was 19 years of age. On the same occasion he was convicted of
failing to comply with the requirements of a previous community order. On 31
August 2011, aged 20, he was convicted of an offence of robbery and an offence
of theft, in respect of which he was sentenced to terms of 40 months’ detention
and 16 months’ detention respectively, to run concurrently. On 12 October 2012,
aged 21, he was convicted of an offence of violent disorder, committed while he
was an inmate at HMP Feltham, for which he was sentenced to 12 months’
imprisonment.</a></p><a name="para5">

</span>On 10 June 2011 he was notified by the Secretary of State of his
liability to deportation. His previous legal representatives responded on 16
August 2011. On 17 July 2013 a deportation order was signed in respect of the
appellant. He appealed to the First-tier Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum
Chamber) (“FTT”) against his proposed deportation. His appeal was based on his
claimed right to respect for his private life in the United Kingdom. It was
accepted that at that time there was no family life in play. His appeal was
dismissed and he was refused permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal
(Immigration and Asylum Chamber) (“UT”) by the FTT and by the UT. He exhausted
his rights of appeal on 1 May 2015.</a></p><a name="para6">

</span>On 13 May 2015 the appellant’s previous solicitors made brief further
submissions to the Secretary of State on his behalf. The focus of these
submissions was that the appellant’s then partner was pregnant and due to give
birth on 28 July 2015. The application did not explicitly request that the
deportation order be revoked, nor did it explicitly make reference to human
rights.</a></p><a name="para7">

</span>The Secretary of State treated the further representations as an
application to revoke the appellant’s deportation order on the basis that
deportation would breach article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
She responded to those submissions in a letter of 23 June 2015. She concluded
that deportation would not breach article 8. She refused to revoke the
deportation order, and she decided that his submissions did not amount to a
fresh human rights claim under rule 353 of the Immigration Rules.</a></p><a name="para8">

</span>The appellant’s son was born on 26 July 2015. He is a British citizen by
birth because his mother is British. The appellant then made further
submissions to the Secretary of State on 28 July 2015 regarding the birth of
his son and providing some documentation from the hospital. The Secretary of
State responded to these further submissions in a letter dated 31 July 2015.
Once again, the Secretary of State concluded that deportation of the appellant
would not breach article 8 and that his further submissions did not amount to a
fresh claim under rule 353 of the Immigration Rules.</a></p><a name="para9">

</span>A request for temporary admission was made on 30 July 2015 in order to
enable the appellant to visit his son. The enclosed documents included a
statutory declaration from the appellant declaring that he is the child’s
father. The appellant was subsequently named as the father on the child’s birth
certificate.</a></p><a name="para11">

</span>On 5 August 2015 the appellant’s solicitors gave notice of appeal to the
FTT against the Secretary of State’s decision of 31 July 2015. In a decision
dated 7 August 2015, promulgated on 10 August 2015, the FTT declined
jurisdiction on the basis that there was no right of appeal against the
decision of 31 July 2015.</a></p><a name="para12">

</span>On 7 August 2015 the appellant made an application for permission to
apply for judicial review of the Secretary of State’s decisions of 23 June 2015
and 31 July 2015 not to accept the further representations as fresh claims and
the removal directions given on 18 July 2015. After the proceedings were lodged
the Secretary of State confirmed that removal of the appellant would be
deferred.</a></p><a name="para13">

</span>The appellant applied to amend his grounds to include the FTT as second
respondent and to challenge its decision of 7 August 2015 that the appellant
had no right to appeal against the decision of 31 July 2015. UT Judge Allen
granted the appellant permission to join the FTT and to amend his grounds.</a></p><a name="para14">

permission to appeal. The Secretary of State sought to deport the appellant to
Jamaica on 13 April 2016. On 12 April 2016 Rafferty LJ granted the appellant a
stay on removal. On 2 December 2016 Underhill LJ, on consideration of the

subsequent claim which constitutes a “fresh claim” within rule 353 of the
Immigration Rules. He also rejected a submission that the Supreme Court
considered precisely the same question in <i>R (BA (Nigeria)) v Secretary of
State for the Home Department </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2009/7.html">[2009] UKSC 7</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2009/7.html">[2010] 1 AC 444</a> when
construing the phrase “a human rights claim” in section 92(4)(a) of the 2002
Act as it then stood. The decision of the Supreme Court on the meaning of
“human rights claim” in <i>BA (Nigeria) </i>did not apply to statutory provisions
which determine whether a right of appeal exists at all. In his view, it would
be an absurd reading of section 82, in either its previous or current form, to
interpret it as permitting an applicant to make the same human rights claim
over and over again, each time appealing to the FTT against the rejection of
that claim. He concluded that “a human rights claim” in section 82(1)(b) of the
2002 Act must mean an original human rights claim or a fresh human rights claim
which falls within rule 353 of the Immigration Rules.</p>

</span>First, he submits that the <i>Onibiyo</i> line of authority - which
established that in the case of a second or successive submission it was for
the Secretary of State to decide whether this constituted a fresh claim giving
rise to a right to appeal - did not survive the decision of the Supreme Court
in <i>BA (Nigeria)</i>, and that, accordingly, there is no longer any role for
rule 353 of the Immigration Rules. In this regard he submits that this court
should reject the reading of <i>BA (Nigeria)</i> favoured by Lord Neuberger of
Abbotsbury MR in the Court of Appeal in <i>R (ZA (Nigeria)) v Secretary of

</span>Secondly, he submits that the amendments to Part 5 of the 2002 Act
effected by the 2014 Act abrogate the control mechanism established by the <i>Onibiyo</i>
line of authority and rule 353 of the Immigration Rules and that the words
“human rights claim” as they appear in section 82(1)(b) of the 2002 Act
following amendment by the 2014 Act are to be interpreted without reference to
rule 353.</p>

</span>On this basis he submits that any second or subsequent submission which
is a “human rights claim” under section 113(1) attracts a right of appeal under
section 82, notwithstanding that the individual has made a previous claim that
removal would breach a relevant obligation, whether the same relevant
obligation or a different one, whether on the same basis or a different one,
whether with the same or different submissions and evidence, but subject
however to the certification provisions in sections 94 and 96.</a></p><a name="para27">

</span><i>BA (Nigeria)</i> does not establish that the words “human rights
claim” as they appear in Part 5 of the 2002 Act are to be interpreted without
reference to the <i>Onibiyo</i> line of authority or rule 353 of the
Immigration Rules. The actual decision in <i>BA (Nigeria)</i> was that rule 353
had no further part to play for the purposes of section 92(4)(a) once there was
an appeal against an immigration decision. It did not determine that the
Secretary of State was no longer entitled to decide the prior question as to
whether a second or subsequent submission constituted a claim at all. In his
support he relies on the analysis of <i>BA (Nigeria)</i> by Lord Neuberger MR
in <i>ZA (Nigeria)</i>.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(2)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The amendments to the 2002 Act effected by the 2014 Act have not changed
the position. It remains the case that there will only be an asylum or human
rights claim to be determined if, in relevant cases, further submissions are
considered to amount to a fresh claim.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading"><u>The Onibiyo line of authority</u></p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para28"></a><a name="para29">29.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In order to address the issues raised by this appeal it is necessary to
consider in some detail the way in which a line of authority concerning second
or subsequent submissions to the Secretary of State has developed. It starts in
1996 with the decision of the Court of Appeal (Sir Thomas Bingham MR, Roch and
Swinton Thomas LJJ) in <i>Onibiyo</i>. The applicant had made an application
for asylum under the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993 (“1993 Act”),
based on the political activities of his father. The Secretary of State refused
his application and his appeal under section 8(3)(b) of the 1993 Act was
dismissed. The applicant then indicated that he was making a fresh claim for
asylum based on his own association with the opposition in Nigeria. Rule 346,
Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules (1994) (HC 395), which was then current,
provided:</a></p><a name="para29">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“When an asylum applicant has
previously been refused asylum in the United Kingdom and can demonstrate no
relevant and substantial change in his circumstances since that date, his
application will be refused.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The Home Office stated in a letter that it was of the
view that the representations did not constitute a fresh claim for asylum and
had been treated as further information to the original claim. The request for
revocation of the deportation order against him was refused on the ground that
there had not been any material change in circumstances since the previous
refusal decision sufficient to justify revocation. The applicant’s solicitors
took issue with this letter and submitted a notice of appeal to a special
adjudicator under section 8(3)(b) of the 1993 Act. The Secretary of State
maintained his position and in a subsequent letter explained that the first
letter had not constituted a refusal of asylum but a consideration and
dismissal of the further information provided. In the circumstances the
Secretary of State had not made a fresh decision and the appeal was invalid.
The applicant applied for judicial review.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para29"></a><a name="para30">30.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A preliminary question was whether a person may during a single
uninterrupted stay in the United Kingdom make more than one claim for asylum
within the 1993 Act. The Master of the Rolls, with whom the other members of
the court agreed, rejected the submission of the Secretary of State that once a
person had made a “claim for asylum”, been refused by the Secretary of State and
unsuccessfully exercised his rights of appeal, that exhausted his legal rights.
The obligation of the United Kingdom under the Refugee Convention not to return
a refugee to a county where his life or freedom would be threatened for a
Convention reason remained binding until the moment of return. Accordingly,
three questions arose for consideration. First, what constitutes a fresh claim?
Secondly, how and by whom is it decided whether a claim is a fresh claim or
not? Thirdly, what are the procedural consequences of a decision that a claim
is or is not a fresh claim?</a></p><a name="para30">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para30"></a><a name="para31">31.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In response to the first question, it was not controversial that there
had to be a significant change from the claim as previously presented, such as
might reasonably lead a special adjudicator to take a different view.</a></p><a name="para31">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The acid test must always be
whether, comparing the new claim with that earlier rejected, and excluding
material on which the claimant could reasonably have been expected to rely in
the earlier claim, the new claim is sufficiently different from the earlier
claim to admit of a realistic prospect that a favourable view could be taken of
the new claim despite the unfavourable conclusion reached on the earlier
claim.” (at pp 783H-784B)</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">In response to the second question, rule 328 of the
Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules made clear that all asylum
applications would be determined by the Secretary of State in the first
instance. In response to the third question, no particular difficulty arose
where the Secretary of State treated the submission as a fresh claim, whether
asylum was then granted or refused. In the latter case, the same consequences
should follow as on a refusal of an initial claim. A problematic situation
arose, however, where, as on the facts of that case, the Secretary of State did
not recognise the submission as a fresh claim and, therefore, declined to take
or omit to take any action which would trigger a right of appeal. It would
clearly be open to the asylum seeker, in those circumstances, to have resort to
the court to challenge that decision. However, a question of “considerable
difficulty” was whether the court should approach this as a question of
precedent fact or whether the decision should be susceptible to challenge only
on <i>Wednesbury</i> principles. As the answer to the question was not
determinative of the appeal, the Master of the Rolls proffered “a tentative
answer” in favour of the latter view. (at pp 784D-785D)</p>

</span>Following the decision in <i>Onibiyo</i>, rule 346 was amended to
reflect the judgment in that case. The amended version provided:</a></p><a name="para32">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Where an asylum applicant has
previously been refused asylum … the Secretary of State will determine whether
any further representations should be treated as a fresh application for
asylum. The Secretary of State will treat representations as a fresh
application for asylum if the claim advanced in the representations is
sufficiently different from the earlier claim that there is a realistic
prospect that the conditions set out in para 334 will be satisfied. In
considering whether to treat the representations as a fresh claim, the
Secretary of State will disregard any material which:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is not significant; or</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is not credible; or</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was available to the
applicant at the time when the previous application was refused or when any
appeal was determined.” (CM 3365)</p>

</span>In <i>Cakabay v Secretary of State for the Home Department</i> <i>(Nos 2
and 3)</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1998/1116.html">[1999] Imm AR 176</a>, after the appellant’s appeals against the refusal
of asylum had been dismissed, he had submitted further evidence which the Secretary
of State concluded did not constitute a fresh claim. The appellant purported to
appeal against this decision. The Secretary of State successfully applied for a
declaration that the appellate authorities had no jurisdiction in the matter.
The judge, reviewing the decision on <i>Wednesbury</i> principles, also
concluded that the Secretary of State’s decision could not be held to be
unreasonable. The Court of Appeal (Peter Gibson, Schiemann and Potter LJJ)
upheld the decision. Schiemann LJ explained that the statute made no express
provision as to what is to be done in the case of repeated claims for asylum by
the same person. Nevertheless, there was a need for categorisation and to
distinguish between what he termed “a repetitious claim” and “a fresh claim”:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In the case of a repetitious
claim no more is required to be done: the first decision has ensured that the
United Kingdom has complied with its obligations under the Convention. Section
6 of the 1993 Act creates no inhibition on the claimant’s removal: the
Secretary of State has on the occasion of his decision on the first claim
decided the repetitious claim. So far as the decision on the claimant’s
repetitious application for leave to enter is concerned, the claimant will be
told that leave has already been refused and that there is no need for any new
decision.” (at p 181)</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Despite the focus on “repetitious claims”, it is clear
that the reasoning of Schiemann LJ applies equally to any further submissions
that failed to meet the test in rule 346. Similarly, Peter Gibson LJ (at p 193)
considered that if the representations amounted to no more than the same claim
as that which had already failed, or if the criteria of rule 346 were not met,
there would be no claim for asylum within the statute and therefore no appeal
would lie under section 8(1) of the 1993 Act against a determination adverse to
the asylum seeker that there had been no fresh claim. Consistently with what
the Court of Appeal in <i>Onibiyo</i> had assumed to be correct, the court went
on to hold that no appeal lay under section 8(1) of the 1993 Act from the
determination of the Secretary of State that fresh representations do not
amount to a claim for asylum. Schiemann LJ accepted that a categorisation
decision has potentially severe consequences and that, in such a context,
arguments based on the possibilities of abuse should not weigh heavily in
matters of construction. Nevertheless, Parliament had not provided for an

</span>In this way the courts imposed a gloss on the operation of the statutory
scheme which made no express provision for the handling of second or successive
submissions. The effect of these decisions was that it was for the Secretary of
State to decide whether further submissions amounted to a fresh claim. Where
the Secretary of State had taken a rational decision that further submissions
did not amount to a fresh claim for asylum under rule 346 of the Immigration
Rules, there was no asylum claim to determine and therefore no need to make any
decision to refuse leave to enter. In these circumstances, no right of appeal
arose under section 8 of the 1993 Act. A categorisation decision was, however,
open to challenge by judicial review.</a></p><a name="para34">

</span>On 7 November 2002 Parliament enacted the 2002 Act, which effectively
replaced the 1993 Act. The 2002 Act itself has subsequently been amended on a
number of occasions. Part 5 of the 2002 Act concerns immigration and asylum
appeals. Section 82 conferred a statutory right of appeal against an
“immigration decision” and listed what constituted an immigration decision. The
grounds of appeal included in section 84(1)(g) that removal would breach the
United Kingdom’s obligations under the Refugee Convention or would be unlawful
under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 as being incompatible with the
appellant’s Convention rights. Section 92 required an appeal to be out of
country unless it concerned one of five of the immigration decisions listed in
section 82(2) or the individual had made an asylum or human rights claim.
Section 94 empowered the Secretary of State to issue a certificate that an
asylum or human rights claim was clearly unfounded, in which case an appeal
would be limited to an out of country appeal. Section 96 empowered the
Secretary of State to issue a certificate relating to an earlier right of
appeal in which a matter now relied upon could and should have been raised, in
which case an appeal could not be brought at all.</a></p><a name="para35">

provision for appeal from a decision of the Secretary of State as to the
existence of a fresh claim and, accordingly, the court was engaged only through
the medium of judicial review. The Secretary of State’s decision as to whether
there was a fresh claim was not a fact, nor precedent to any other decision,
but was the decision itself. The court could not take that decision out of the

applicability of the <i>Onibiyo</i> approach. The Secretary of State had
rejected the applicant’s claims for asylum and protection on human right
grounds and certified the claims as clearly unfounded under section 94(2) of
the 2002 Act. As a result, the applicant had no in-country right of appeal and
he was served with a decision to remove him as an illegal immigrant. He made
two further submissions, but the Secretary of State maintained her
certification of the claims as clearly unfounded. The House of Lords held by a
majority (Lord Hope dissenting) that the Secretary of State had erred in
applying section 94(2) of the 2002 Act rather than rule 353 to the further
submissions. The words “any appeal relating to that claim is no longer pending”
in rule 353 should be interpreted in accordance with the definition of a
“pending” appeal in section 104 of the 2002 Act. If there was no appeal pending,
the qualifying words had no application. Furthermore, it made sense that the
rule should be disapplied during, and only during, the currency of an appeal
since if an appeal was pending further submissions could be made to the appeal
tribunal. As Lord Neuberger observed (at para 86), it would seem silly if rule
353 only applied after an appeal had been brought and concluded but did not
apply before an appeal was brought and could never apply in a case where no
appeal had been brought.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading"><u>BA (Nigeria)</u></p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para39">39.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Some nine months after the House of Lords delivered its decision in <i>ZT
(Kosovo)</i> on 4 February 2009, the Supreme Court delivered its decision in <i>BA
(Nigeria) </i>on 26 November 2009. Mr Fordham’s primary submission is that the <i>Onibiyo</i>
line of authority did not survive the decision of the Supreme Court in <i>BA
(Nigeria) </i>and that, accordingly, there is no longer any role for rule 353
of the Immigration Rules. <i>BA (Nigeria)</i> concerned two separate cases. BA,
who had previously been granted indefinite leave to remain, was served with a
decision that he would be deported on his release from prison on licence from a
sentence of imprisonment of ten years. He appealed on human rights grounds
against that decision and his appeal failed. He was served with a deportation
order. BA then made further submissions as to why he should not be deported.
The Secretary of State agreed to consider his reasons for seeking revocation of
the deportation order but declined to revoke it. Directions were then given for
his removal. The other case was that of PE who had entered the United Kingdom
clandestinely. His application for asylum was rejected by the Secretary of
State. It was decided that directions were to be given for his removal to Cameroon.
He did not appeal against that decision. Before it was put into effect,
however, he was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for having a forged
passport and using it to obtain work. The Secretary of State decided to make a
deportation order against him. PE appealed unsuccessfully against that decision
on asylum and human rights grounds. The deportation order was signed and served
on him, following which his representatives made written representations for
the decision to be reconsidered. In particular, it was claimed that he would be
persecuted in Cameroon on account of his homosexuality. The Secretary of State
declined to reconsider her decision; in her view the representations did not
amount to a fresh claim within rule 353. PE purported to appeal against that
decision but the tribunal held that it was not an appealable decision. Both BA
and PE applied for judicial review.</a></p><a name="para39">

</span>In each of these cases the refusal of the Secretary of State to revoke
the deportation order following further representations was accepted to be an
immigration decision within section 82(2)(k). It was common ground,
accordingly, that each applicant had a right of appeal under section 82(1). It
was also common ground that neither of the claims would have been certifiable
under section 94 or section 96 (although it appears that the Secretary of State
took this position solely because, so far as section 94 was concerned, it
applied only “where the appellant has made an asylum claim or a human rights
claim (or both)”). The issue was whether the right of appeal could be exercised
from within the United Kingdom. (See Lord Hope DPSC at para 14.) Section 92(1)
precluded an appeal under section 82(1) by a person while he is in the United
Kingdom, unless his appeal was of a kind to which section 92 applied. Section
92, by virtue of section 92(4)(a), applied to “an appeal against an immigration
decision if the appellant … has made an asylum claim, or a human rights claim,
while in the United Kingdom” so that in such a case there would be a right to
an in-country appeal. Lord Hope encapsulated the issue (at para 2):</a></p><a name="para40">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The question is whether the
expression ‘an asylum claim, or a human rights claim’, in section 92(4)(a) of
the 2002 Act includes any second or subsequent claim that the asylum seeker may
make, or only a second or subsequent claim which has been accepted as a ‘fresh
claim’ by the Secretary of State under rule 353 of the Statement of Changes in
Immigration Rules (1994) (HC 395).”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para40"></a><a name="para41">41.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Supreme Court (Baroness Hale JSC dissenting) held that it was not
open to the Secretary of State to rely on rule 353 and the <i>Onibiyo</i>
reasoning to deny an in-country right of appeal in those circumstances. As Lord
Neuberger MR observed in <i>ZA (Nigeria) </i>at para 52, the actual decision in
<i>BA (Nigeria)</i> was that rule 353 had no further part to play for the
purposes of section 92(4)(a) once there was an appeal against an immigration
decision. However, the reasoning by which the Supreme Court reached that
conclusion is open to different interpretations which were formulated by Lord
Neuberger in <i>ZA (Nigeria)</i> in the following terms (at para 51).</a></p><a name="para41">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Like the Administrative Court, I
have not found it entirely easy to resolve the issue of whether the Supreme
Court was saying (a) as the claimants contend, that rule 353 has no part to
play at all following the introduction of Part 5 of the 2002 Act, or (b) as the
Secretary of State argues, that rule 353 has no part to play where there has
been an appealable immigration decision and the only issue is whether the
appeal is of a kind to which section 92 applies. Ultimately, however, again
like the Administrative Court, I have come to the conclusion that the Secretary
of State’s more limited interpretation is to be preferred.”</p>

</span>In the present appeal, Mr Fordham has sought to persuade us that the
broader reading of <i>BA (Nigeria)</i> is correct and that the narrower reading
favoured by Lord Neuberger in <i>ZA (Nigeria)</i> is incorrect. Mr Fordham is
able to point to certain passages in the judgment of Lord Hope in <i>BA
(Nigeria)</i> (with which Lord Scott, Lord Rodger and Lord Brown agreed) which
certainly lend support to the view that the new scheme introduced by the 2002
Act has rendered the reasoning in <i>Onibiyo</i> and rule 353 redundant. I draw
attention, in particular, to the following passages.</a></p><a name="para42">

<p class="ParaLevel2">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lord Hope (at para 29), referring to section
94(2) and section 96, noted that the new system introduced by Part 5 of the
2002 Act contains a range of powers that enable the Secretary of State or an
immigration officer to deal with the problem of repeat claims. It was common
ground that the present cases were not certifiable under either of these two
sections. Why then, he asked rhetorically, should they be subjected to a
further requirement which is not mentioned anywhere in the 2002 Act. He
continued:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It can only be read into the Act
by, as Sedley LJ in the Court of Appeal put it, glossing the meaning of the
words ‘a … claim’ so as to exclude a further claim which has not been held
under rule 353 to be a fresh claim … The court had to do this in <i>Ex p
Onibiyo</i> … But there is no need to do this now. … It is not just that there
is no need now to read those words into the statute. As Mr Husain pointed out,
the two systems for excluding repeat claims are not compatible.” (at paras 29,
30)</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At para 31 Lord Hope observed:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The ground of appeal referred to
in section 84(1)(g) has been designed to honour the international obligations
of the United Kingdom. To exclude claims which the Secretary of State considers
not to be fresh claims from this ground of appeal, when claims which he
certifies as clearly unfounded are given the benefit of it, can serve no good
purpose. On the contrary, it risks undermining the beneficial objects of the
Refugee Convention which the court in <i>Ex p Onibiyo </i>…, under a
legislative system which had no equivalent to section 95, was careful to
avoid.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At para 33 Lord Hope observed:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“There is no doubt, as I indicated
in <i>ZT (Kosovo) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </i>…, para 33,
that rule 353 was drafted on the assumption that a claimant who made further
submissions would be at risk of being removed or required to leave immediately
if he does not have a ‘fresh claim’. That was indeed the case when this rule
was originally drafted, as there was no equivalent of section 92(4) of the 2002
Act. But Mr Husain’s analysis has persuaded me that the legislative scheme that
Parliament has now put in place does not have that effect. Its carefully
interlocking provisions, when read as a whole, set out the complete code for
dealing with repeat claims. Rule 353, as presently drafted, has no part to play
in the legislative scheme. As an expression of the will of Parliament, it must
take priority over the rules formulated by the executive. Rule 353A on the
other hand remains in place as necessary protection against premature removal
until the further submissions have been considered by the Secretary of State.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para42"></a><a name="para43">43.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Similarly, Lord Rodger (at para 37), rejecting the submission that the
expression “an asylum claim” in section 92(4)(a) should be given the same meaning
as Sir Thomas Bingham MR gave to the expression “a claim for asylum” in section
6 of the 1993 Act, noted that the contexts were significantly different since
the 2002 Act contains a new scheme for dealing with abusive claims.</a></p><a name="para43">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Given that new scheme, there is
no longer the same need to adopt the former interpretation and, indeed, the one
now adopted fits the new context better.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para43"></a><a name="para44">44.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Brown (at para 44) explained that he had reached his conclusion
only on the basis that:</a></p><a name="para44">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“the statutory solution to the
problem of abuse created by the making of repeat asylum claims lies not in
construing ‘an asylum claim’ in section 92(4)(a) of the Nationality,
Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 as the Court of Appeal in <i>R v Secretary of
State for the Home Department, Ex p Onibiyo</i> … construed ‘a claim for asylum’
in section 6 of the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993 but rather in the
Secretary of State issuing certificates where appropriate under sections 94 or
96 of the 2002 Act (no equivalent provisions having been available under the
1993 Act).”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para44"></a><a name="para45">45.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Nevertheless, there are to my mind major difficulties inherent in this
reading of <i>BA (Nigeria)</i>. Here I find myself in total agreement with the
reasoning of Lord Neuberger on this point in <i>ZA (Nigeria)</i> which I
gratefully acknowledge.</a></p><a name="para45">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para45"></a><a name="para46">46.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>First, in principle there is no conflict between <i>Onibiyo</i> and rule
353 on the one hand and the statutory scheme in Part 5 of the 2002 Act on the
other. I note that when <i>Onibiyo</i> was decided in 1996 there was in force a
system of certification under paragraph 5 of Schedule 2 to the 1993 Act which
established special appeal procedures for claims without foundation. With
respect to Lord Hope, I do not consider that there is any incompatibility
between what he described as “the two systems for excluding repeat claims”.
They operate at different stages of the response to a purported renewed claim. <i>BA
(Nigeria) </i>establishes that, as the statutory provisions then stood, where
the Secretary of State receives further submissions on which he makes an immigration
decision within section 82 there will, in the absence of certification, be an
in-country right of appeal. It decides that in those circumstances it is not
then open to the Secretary of State to rely on the <i>Onibiyo</i> reasoning or
rule 353 in order to contend that the submissions did not amount to a claim and
that, as a result, there is no need for a decision and no entitlement to a
statutory appeal. It is entirely understandable that in such a case there is no
room for the operation of rule 353. <i>Onibiyo</i> and rule 353, by contrast,
address a prior issue, namely whether there is a claim which requires a
decision at all.</a></p><a name="para46">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para46"></a><a name="para47">47.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Secondly, I do not consider that the effect of the machinery introduced
by Part 5 of the 2002 Act, in particular the powers of certification under
sections 94 and 96, is to render the <i>Onibiyo</i> reasoning and rule 353
redundant. As Lord Neuberger observed in <i>ZA (Nigeria)</i> (at para 24), the
issue should not be decided simply by seeing whether sections 94 and 96 can be
interpreted so as to cover every application falling within rule 353, as it is
equally valid to consider whether they can be construed consistently with rule
353 having an independent effect. In my view, rule 353 continues to perform a
useful role notwithstanding the machinery introduced by Part 5 of the 2002 Act.</a></p><a name="para47">

<p class="ParaLevel2">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 94 applies to claims which are clearly
unfounded, whether they are original claims or purported renewed claims. By
contrast, rule 353 applies only to supplemental submissions which purport to be
claims.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The effect of certification under section 94 is
to limit an appeal to an out of country appeal. Certification under section 96
has the effect that an appeal under section 82(1) may not be brought. The
effect of rule 353 is that no right of appeal ever arises.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As indicated above, where it applies rule 353
operates at a prior stage to section 94. In the case of a purported renewed
claim there is a legitimate preliminary issue as to whether it constitutes a
claim requiring a decision on the merits at all. Rule 353 addresses that issue.
Section 94, on the other hand, proceeds on the basis that there is a valid
claim which requires consideration on the merits and a decision. It creates a
machinery of certification of the claim as clearly unfounded so as to prevent an
in-country appeal.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2">(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that section 94 applies to both original
and purported renewed claims does not deprive rule 353 of its utility in
relation to the latter category. In appropriate cases, rule 353 relieves the
Secretary of State from taking a decision on the merits of the application and
refusing it. It operates by enabling him to reject the submissions as not
constituting a claim requiring decision. Section 94, however, comes into play
only when the Secretary of State has considered a claim on its merits and
refused it. At that stage, certification operates to block a right to an
in-country appeal which would otherwise arise.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Thus rule 353 can be operated as
a sort of gatekeeper by the Secretary of State to prevent further submissions
amounting to, or being treated as, a claim, thereby not getting into Part 5
territory at all.” (<i>ZA (Nigeria) </i>per Lord Neuberger MR at para 26)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:26.0pt;
margin-left:35.45pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">With
respect to Mr Fordham, it is not the case that this interposing function arose
only because of the additional requirement of an “immigration decision” in the
pre-2014 statutory list in section 82(1) of the 2002 Act. On the contrary, it
is founded on the need to identify what constitutes a claim for this purpose.</span></p>

<p class="ParaLevel2">(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 96(1) addresses a different aspect of renewed
claims from rule 353. Section 96(1) applies where a person seeks to rely on a
matter that could have been raised in an earlier appeal against an immigration
decision and the Secretary of State or the immigration officer considers that
there is no satisfactory reason for the failure to do so. It is, in a sense,
the converse of the situation addressed by rule 353.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2">(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part 5 as originally enacted included a
subsection 96(3) which provided:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A person may not rely on
any ground in an appeal under section 82(1) if the Secretary of State or an
immigration officer certifies that the ground was considered in another appeal
under that section brought by that person.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">This provision was much closer
to rule 353 than is section 96(1) as both rule 353 and section 96(3) address
similar situations. However, section 96(3) did not achieve its effect by
denying the existence of a claim requiring a decision on the merits, but by
requiring such a renewed claim to be treated as a fresh claim and enabling the
Secretary of State to block an appeal on the particular ground which had been
raised previously. In any event, section 96(3) is no longer in force, having
been repealed by section 30 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of
Claimants, etc) Act 2004 with effect from 1 October 2004.</p>

</span>Thirdly, there are features of the regulatory scheme which are difficult
to reconcile with an intention on the part of Parliament that provisions in
Part 5 of the 2002 Act should provide a comprehensive and exclusive code for
dealing with repeat claims and that rule 353 should no longer be effective.</a></p><a name="para48">

<p class="ParaLevel2">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the 2002 Act was enacted there was no

plainly legislated on the basis that rule 353 is still in force and section 53
of the 2009 Act would have been positively meaningless if rule 353 had no
further function.</span></p>

<p class="ParaLevel2">(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following the amendment of the 2002 Act by the
2014 Act, rule 353 was amended so as to ensure that it applies to human rights
claims and protection claims (HC 1025). Once again, this is inconsistent with
the suggestion that rule 353 had become ineffective.</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">These features strongly suggest that rule 353 continues
to perform an important function.</p>

</span>Fourthly, I am persuaded that the broad reading of <i>BA (Nigeria)</i>
for which the appellant contends is inconsistent with <i>ZT (Kosovo)</i> where
the House of Lords held (Lord Hope dissenting) that the Secretary of State had
erred in applying section 94(2) of the 2002 Act rather than rule 353 in
considering the applicant’s further submissions. By contrast, there is no
difficulty in reconciling the two decisions if the <i>ratio</i> <i>decidendi</i>
of <i>BA (Nigeria)</i> is merely that rule 353 has no part to play where there
is an appealable immigration decision. If the Supreme Court did decide in <i>BA
(Nigeria)</i> that rule 353 is entirely redundant following the introduction of
Part 5 of the 2002 Act, it must have intended to overrule or to depart from the
decision of the House of Lords some nine months earlier in <i>ZT (Kosovo)</i>.
However, <i>BA (Nigeria)</i> contains no express statement to that effect.
Moreover, while an earlier decision may be impliedly overruled, it is extremely
improbable that this was the intention here, for reasons summarised by Lord
Neuberger in <i>ZA (Nigeria)</i> as follows (at para 53):</a></p><a name="para49">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… I have great difficulty with
the notion that the later case relied on by the claimants overruled the earlier
case. (i) Both decisions relate to a much litigated issue, and the earlier
decision was given less than a year before the later decision; (ii) the point
at issue was directly addressed and decided in all five reasoned judgments in
the earlier decision, and even the reasoning of the dissenter would have to be
treated as overruled; (iii) the earlier decision is expressly referred to three
times in the leading judgment, and once in the only other reasoned judgment, in
the later decision without apparent disapproval, and both judgments were given
by judges involved in the earlier decision; (iv) the actual outcome in the
later decision can perfectly easily be reconciled with the earlier decision,
namely on the basis that the later decision is limited to further submissions
which have been treated as a fresh claim; (v) this more limited interpretation
of the later decision is consistent with the Court of Appeal’s reasoning and
conclusion in that case, which was specifically approved by the Supreme Court;
(vi) this more limited interpretation of the later decision is also consistent
with a recent statute, whereas the wider interpretation, which would involve
overruling the earlier decision, is not.”</p>

</span>For these reasons I agree with the Court of Appeal in <i>ZA (Nigeria)</i>
that what is said in <i>BA (Nigeria)</i> is limited to cases where there is an
appealable decision. As Lord Neuberger explained:</a></p><a name="para50">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Once there is such a decision,
the complete code contained in the legislative scheme applies and rule 353 has
no part to play. However, as decided in <i>ZT (Kosovo)</i> … , rule 353 still
has ‘a part to play’: the Secretary of State can decide that the further
submissions are not a ‘fresh claim’, in which case one does not enter the
territory governed by the ‘complete code’ of ‘the legislative scheme’.” (<i>ZA
(Nigeria)</i> at para 59)</p>

out at paras 19 to 23 above. Section 82 no longer restricts a right of appeal
to an appeal against an “immigration decision” as formerly listed in section
82(2). In particular, there is no longer any right of appeal in respect of a
decision to make a deportation order or a refusal to revoke such an order <i>per

refuse a protection claim or a human rights claim made by that person or has

treat his further submissions as amounting to a fresh claim for the purposes of
rule 353 amounted to a refusal of a human rights claim under section 82 as
amended. The appellant maintained that rule 353 is now subsumed within the
statutory provisions and that a right of appeal under section 82 as amended
arises in all refused human rights claims, subject only to certification under
sections 94 or 96. It was submitted that there is no longer a requirement for a
categorisation step because the statutory framework now provides all necessary
safeguards against repetitious or unmeritorious claims. In rejecting the
submission, the Upper Tribunal (UTJ Coker, UTJ Kebede) held (at paras 18, 19,
20) that <i>BA (Nigeria)</i> is not authority for the proposition that
submissions amount to a claim and that the response to those submissions is a
decision within the meaning of Part 5. Submissions that purport to be a human
rights claim do not without more trigger a right of appeal. There has to be an
intermediate categorisation in which rule 353 provides the mechanism to determine
whether they amount to a claim. If they do not, the decision is not a decision
to refuse a human rights claim.</p>

</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKUT/IAC/2016/283.html">[2016] UKUT 283 (IAC)</a> the applicant had made a claim for asylum which had been
rejected and his appeal had been dismissed. Further submissions on his behalf
were rejected by the Secretary of State who maintained the earlier decision
that he did not qualify for asylum and concluded that the further
representations were not a fresh claim. The applicant lodged a notice of appeal
with the First-tier Tribunal which rejected it because no notice of an
appealable decision had been issued. On a challenge to that decision by way of
judicial review it was submitted, without taking issue with the decision of the
Upper Tribunal in <i>Waqar</i>, that as a result of Parliament’s decision to
grant a right of appeal from a refusal of a protection claim the judge in the
First-tier Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide whether there had been a
decision to refuse a protection claim. The Upper Tribunal (Blake J and UTJ
Grubb) rejected the submission.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In our view, notwithstanding the
significant change in section 82 from a right of appeal against an immigration
decision on a protection ground to a right of appeal against a protection
decision itself, Parliament can be presumed to have legislated against the
background of satisfaction with the previous law as declared in <u>ZA (Nigeria)</u>.
There is no indication in the amendments made, that it was intended to transfer
responsibility for the categorisation decision of whether a claim is a fresh
claim to the FtT. Indeed, the general purpose of the 2014 amendments was to
reduce the appellate jurisdiction of the FtT.” (at para 14)</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">They further held that an assessment of whether a
protection claim is a fresh claim is not a question of jurisdictional fact but
a matter of assessment and evaluation for the Secretary of State subject to
supervision by judicial review. Furthermore, when the Secretary of State
concludes that the claim before her is not a fresh claim she does not refuse a
protection claim.</p>

appeal against a deportation order had been dismissed. He made further
submissions in support of a request to revoke the order which were rejected by
the Secretary of State who also concluded that they did not amount to a fresh
claim within rule 353. The First-tier Tribunal held that there was no
exercisable right of appeal. The issue in the judicial review which followed
was to what extent, if at all, the Secretary of State could utilise rule 353 to
preclude the applicant from appealing to the First-tier Tribunal under section
82. The applicant, first, relied on the judgment of Lord Hope in <i>BA
(Nigeria)</i> in support of the proposition that rule 353 had no part to play
following the introduction of Part 5 of the 2002 Act. Secondly, he submitted
that the effect of the 2014 amendments to the 2002 Act was that rule 353 no
longer applied to the categorisation issue as to whether submissions were a
“claim” within section 82 and was now relevant only to certification issues.
The Upper Tribunal (Dove J and Peter Lane UTJ) rejected both submissions. It was
bound by <i>ZA (Nigeria)</i> to reject the first submission. With regard to the
second submission it considered that despite the changes made by the 2014 Act
the concept of a “claim” remained central to the new section 82. It also noted
that if Parliament had intended to limit rule 353 to certification decisions,
it would have been amended to make that clear. In fact, the amendment to rule
353 made following the 2014 Act to ensure that it applies to human rights
claims and protection claims demonstrated that it was intended to have
continuing effect.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para57">57.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>These matters have been considered recently by the Court of Appeal
(Arden and Sales LJJ) in <i>Secretary of State for the Home Department v VM
(Jamaica)</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2017/225.html">[2017] EWCA Civ 225</a>; [2017] Imm AR 1237, a judgment delivered
shortly before that of the Court of Appeal in the present case. Sales LJ
described the relationship of section 82(1) and rule 353 in the clearest terms
(at para 28):</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Section 82(1) and paragraph 353
of the Immigration Rules operate in combination. If the Secretary of State
decides that new representations in relation to some earlier decision (whether
of her own or by the tribunal) which is now final and closed do not amount to a
fresh claim under paragraph 353 she will simply reject the representations as
matters which do not affect the position of the applicant within the regime of
immigration law. In that sort of case, on the assessment of the Secretary of
State the representations do not amount to a ‘claim’ by the applicant, so her
decision is not a decision ‘to refuse a human rights claim’ (or any other sort
of claim) within the scope of section 82(1). No right of appeal arises in
relation to her decision that the new representations do not amount to a fresh
claim. Such a decision can only be challenged by way of judicial review. On
this point I agree with the decision of the UT in <i>Waqar v Secretary of State
for the Home Department (Statutory Appeals/paragraph 353)</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKUT/IAC/2015/169.html">[2015] UKUT 169 (IAC)</a> at paras 19-20.”</p>

</span>The second principal submission on behalf of the appellant is that the
amendments made in 2014 to Part 5 of the 2002 Act have effected a fundamental
change in the operation of the statutory scheme with the result that, whatever
may have been the position after <i>BA (Nigeria)</i>, rule 353 no longer
applies and accordingly no longer performs a gatekeeper function.</a></p><a name="para58">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para58"></a><a name="para59">59.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>First, on behalf of the appellant, Mr Fordham points to the fact that
section 82, as amended, now confers a right of appeal where the Secretary of
State has decided to refuse “a human rights claim” (section 82(1)(b)). “Human
rights claim” is defined by section 113(1) for the purposes of Part 5 unless a
contrary intention appears. Mr Fordham submits that this is striking because
the question of the Part 5 meaning of “human rights claim” is the same question
that previously arose for decision in the Supreme Court in <i>BA (Nigeria)</i>
which established that those words, as they appear in Part 5 of the 2002 Act,
are to be interpreted without reference to rule 353. Thus, he submits, a second
or subsequent human rights claim is a “human rights claim” for the purpose of
those statutory provisions regardless of whether the Secretary of State accepts
or refuses to accept that the claim is a fresh claim within rule 353. I am
unable to accept this submission. In <i>BA (Nigeria)</i> the Supreme Court
considered that there was, in each of the cases, a “human rights claim” within
section 92(4)(a) and, therefore, an appeal would be an in-country right of
appeal, subject to the possibility of certification which did not arise in that
case. However, the reason there was an entitlement to appeal there was because
the human rights claims had resulted, in each case, in a refusal to revoke a
deportation order which was a qualifying immigration decision under section
82(2)(k). It was this which excluded the operation of rule 353. Consequently, the
present issue is not the same issue that previously arose for consideration in <i>BA
(Nigeria)</i>. The issue in the present case, as previously explained, is the
prior question of whether there is a claim at all. For the same reason, it is
not the case that rejection of Mr Fordham’s submission results in the same
words bearing different meanings in different sections within Part 5 of the
2002 Act.</a></p><a name="para59">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para59"></a><a name="para60">60.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Secondly, Mr Fordham relies on the fact that the 2014 amendments remove
the former requirement of an “immigration decision” to which the “human rights
claim” and its rejection needed to have a nexus. He submits that the effect of
the simplified scheme is that any submission that removal would breach a
relevant obligation will amount to a human rights or protection claim, the
rejection of which will give rise to a right of appeal. Once again, I am unable
to accept this submission. The appellant is not assisted by the fact that under
the amended section 82 there is no longer a requirement to establish an
“immigration decision” within the list previously set out in section 82(2). In
fact, the contrary is the case. A decision to refuse to revoke a deportation
order was formerly an “immigration decision” under section 82(2)(k) and
therefore gave rise to an in-country right of appeal, subject to the
possibility of certification, but this is no longer the case. The 2014
amendments limit immigration appeals to circumstances in which there has been a
refusal of a protection claim or a human rights claim, or where protection status
has been revoked. (For present purposes I will concentrate on human rights
claims.) However, the structure and operation of section 82 remain unchanged.
Under the amended section 82(1) a person may appeal to the tribunal where the
Secretary of State has decided to refuse a human rights claim made by him, but
this does not relieve that person of the burden of establishing that the
refusal was in response to a valid claim. The definitions in Part 5 do not
address this question and the answer will depend on the application of the <i>Onibiyo</i>
line of authority. <i>Onibiyo</i>, <i>Cakabay</i>, <i>ZA (Nigeria)</i> and <i>VM
(Jamaica) </i>establish that there will only be a human rights claim to be
determined if further submissions are considered to amount to a fresh claim.
Rule 353, in turn, is directed at the manner in which a court should approach
that prior question. Under the post-2014 provisions it remains the case that if
there is no claim, there is no appealable decision.</a></p><a name="para60">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para60"></a><a name="para61">61.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Thirdly, Mr Fordham makes a series of submissions relating to the
intention of Parliament in enacting the 2014 amendments. In his submission,
Parliament used straightforward language for the purposes of the section 82
statutory right of appeal. If, he submits, it had been the intention to
maintain the structure for which the Secretary of State contends, Parliament
would be expected to make that clear, but the contrary is the case. Parliament
did not introduce Sir Thomas Bingham’s “acid test” into the definition of
“asylum claim” in Part 5 of the 2002 Act. Parliament did not provide that
“claim” was to be construed in accordance with the Immigration Rules, as it did
in the case of “humanitarian protection” in section 82(2)(d) of the 2002 Act
introduced by amendment in 2014. It did not say that “claim” involved an act by
the Secretary of State, giving the Secretary of State a gatekeeper function as
to what constitutes a claim. It did not impose an exclusion by reference to the
Immigration Rules in any statutory provision which is in force. Here Mr Fordham
draws attention to the fact that section 12 of the Immigration, Asylum and
Nationality Act 2006 (“the 2006 Act”) has never been brought into force. It
provides that “human rights claim” “does not include a claim which, having
regard to a former claim, falls to be disregarded for the purposes of this Part
in accordance with immigration rules”. Parliament did not say that the Part 5
right of appeal is subject to exceptions or limitations specified in the
Immigration Rules. Rather section 82(3) states that the right of appeal under
subsection (1) “is subject to the exceptions and limitations specified in this
Part”. Mr Fordham submits that such clarification might have been expected in
the light of <i>BA (Nigeria)</i>.</a></p><a name="para61">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para61"></a><a name="para62">62.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The difficulty with these submissions is that they fail to take account
of the principle of informed interpretation and the judicial authorities on
Part 5 as they stood at the date of the 2014 amendments. Parliament is normally
presumed to legislate in the knowledge of and having regard to relevant
judicial decisions. (See, generally, <i>Bennion on Statutory Interpretation</i>,
7th ed, (2017) section 24.6.) In the present context, the Court of Appeal in <i>ZA
(Nigeria)</i> had provided an authoritative explanation of the effect of <i>BA
(Nigeria)</i>. As Sir James Eadie put it in his submissions, Parliament can
therefore be assumed to have legislated in the light of a consistent line of
authority which established that a purported human rights claim that did not
meet the threshold of a fresh claim under rule 353 was not a claim at all. Had
Parliament intended to depart from this approach, it would surely have made
express provision to that effect. On the contrary, there is nothing in the
amendments made in 2014 which supports the view that Parliament intended to
open the door so as to enable repeated claims raising human rights issues to
generate multiple appeals. (See, in this regard, <i>Hussein</i> per Dove J and
UTJ Lane at para 42.)</a></p><a name="para62">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para62"></a><a name="para63">63.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I should, for the sake of completeness, address two further matters
arising from Mr Fordham’s submissions in this regard. First, it would not be
appropriate to speculate as to why section 12(3) of the 2006 Act has not been
brought into force but, in any event, in seeking to ascertain the intention of
Parliament the court must have regard to the legislation as enacted. (See <i>ZA
(Nigeria)</i> per Lord Neuberger MR at para 57.) Secondly, the explanatory
notes to the 2006 Act state that the amendments to the definition of “human
rights claim” and “asylum claim” in section 113 of the 2002 Act were made to
“clarify that further submissions which follow the refusal of an asylum or
human rights claim but which do not amount to a fresh claim will not carry a
further right of appeal”.</a></p><a name="para63">

<p class="ParaHeading">Conclusion</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para63"></a><a name="para64">64.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For these reasons I consider that the Court of Appeal was correct to
conclude that “a human rights claim” in section 82(1)(b) of the 2002 Act as
amended means an original human rights claim or a fresh human rights claim
within rule 353. More generally, where a person has already had a protection
claim or a human rights claim refused and there is no pending appeal, further
submissions which rely on protection or human rights grounds must first be
accepted by the Secretary of State as a fresh claim in accordance with rule 353
of the Immigration Rules if a decision in response to those representations is
to attract a right of appeal under section 82 of the 2002 Act.</a></p><a name="para64">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para64"></a><a name="para65">65.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For these reasons I would dismiss the appeal.</a></p><a name="para65">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para65"></a><a name="para66">66.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Finally, I draw attention to two recent developments. First, in July
2018 Justice published a report on Immigration and Asylum Appeals by a Working
Party chaired by Professor Sir Ross Cranston which highlights the pressures
facing the current appeals system. Secondly, since the oral hearing on this
appeal the Law Commission has published a consultation paper on the Immigration
Rules which seeks to identify <span style="color:black">the underlying causes
of their complexity, and to identify principles under which they can be
redrafted to make them simpler and more accessible (Law Commission:
Simplification of the Immigration Rules; CP 242, 21 January 2019). The Law
Commission’s initiative is timely and welcome. As will be apparent from this
judgment, the structure of both primary and secondary legislation in this field
has reached such a degree of complexity that there is an urgent need to make
the law and procedure clear and comprehensible.</span></a></p><a name="para66">
