The claimants within the FII GLO are companies which belong to groups which include UK-resident companies and non-resident subsidiaries. The defendants are Her Majesty’s Commissioners for Revenue and Customs (“the Revenue”). The purpose of the FII GLO is to determine a number of common or related questions of law arising out of the tax treatment of dividends received by UK-resident companies from non-resident subsidiaries, as compared with the treatment of dividends paid and received within wholly UK-resident groups of companies. The provisions giving rise to those questions concern, first, the system of advance corporation tax (“ACT”) and, secondly, the taxation of dividend income from non-resident sources under section 18 (Schedule D, Case V) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (“ICTA”) (“the DV provisions”). The relevant provisions of ICTA have since been amended. ACT was abolished for distributions made on or after 5 April 1999, and the DV provisions were repealed for dividend income received on or after 1 April 2009. But the problems created by their existence in the past have not gone away.</a></p><a name="para3">

The test claimants’ case is that the differences between their tax treatment and that of wholly UK-resident groups of companies breached the provisions of article 43 (freedom of establishment) and article 56 (free movement of capital) of the EC Treaty and their predecessor articles. They seek the repayment of the tax so far as it was unlawful under EU law, dating back in some cases to the accession of the UK to the EU in January 1973 and the introduction of ACT in April of that year (expressions such as “the EU” and “EU law” will be used in this judgment, anachronistically but conveniently, to include earlier incarnations of what is now known as the EU). In the alternative, they seek an award of damages under the principles of EU law established in <i>Francovich v Italy</i> (Case C-479/93) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/1995/C47993.html">[1995] ECR I-3843</a>, given effect in our domestic law in <i>R v Secretary of State for Transport, Ex p Factortame (No 5)</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1999/44.html">[2000] 1 AC 524</a>.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para5">5.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The system of corporate taxation relating to dividends which underlies the FII Group Litigation has also given rise to litigation managed under a number of other GLOs, including the ACT GLO. Whereas the focus of the ACT Group Litigation is on the UK legislation which prevented UK-resident subsidiaries of foreign parents from making group income elections, thereby obliging them to pay ACT when paying dividends to their foreign parents, the focus of the FII Group Litigation is on UK-parented groups with foreign subsidiaries, and on the tax treatment of dividends coming into the UK from abroad. Although the present litigation is therefore concerned with factual situations which are different from those which have given rise to the ACT Group Litigation, some of the most important legal questions are common to both sets of proceedings. The ACT Group Litigation followed the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union, as the court is now known (“the Court of Justice”), in the <i>Hoechst</i> case (<i>Metallgesellschaft Ltd v Inland Revenue Comrs, Hoechst AG v Inland Revenue Comrs</i> (Joined Cases C-397/98 and C-410/98) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2001/C41098.html">[2001] ECR I-1727</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/EUECJ/2001/C41098.html">[2001] Ch 620</a>). The ACT Group Litigation includes the decision in <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i>.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para6">6.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A number of other sets of proceedings have also raised issues which arise in the FII Group Litigation. One is the Controlled Foreign Companies (“CFC”) and Dividend Group Litigation, which also concerns claims that the tax treatment of dividends paid by foreign subsidiaries to UK-resident companies was incompatible with EU law. The principal difference from the FII Group Litigation is that the CFC and Dividend Group Litigation includes claims concerned with “portfolio” holdings of less than 10% of the shares of the relevant companies. Another is the Foreign Income Dividends (“FID”) Group Litigation, which concerns claims by pension funds or life companies that the absence of a tax credit in respect of foreign income dividends, in contrast to domestic dividends, was contrary to EU law. Another is the Stamp Taxes Group Litigation, which concerns claims that stamp taxes on issues or transfers of chargeable securities to clearance or depositary services are contrary to EU law. Other relevant proceedings include the <i>Littlewoods</i> proceedings, which concern claims to restitution based on the payment of VAT which was paid under a mistaken understanding of the relevant EU law.</a></p><a name="para6">

Restitutionary claims for the recovery of money are normally subject under English law to a limitation period of six years from the date when the cause of action accrued, on the basis that they are founded on simple contract within the meaning of section 5 of the Limitation Act 1980 (“the 1980 Act”). <i>Francovich</i> claims to damages are subject to the same time limit, on the basis that they are founded on tort within the meaning of section 2 of that Act. Far more than six years had passed between the date when much of the tax was paid, and the right to its recovery therefore accrued, and the date when the claims were brought. As a result, a large element of the claims, together with interest on it over a period of decades, was potentially time-barred.</a></p><a name="para7"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para7"></a><a name="para8">8.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only way around that problem was to rely on section 32(1)(c) of the 1980 Act, which applies to an “action for relief from the consequences of a mistake”, and postpones the commencement of the limitation period “until the plaintiff has discovered the … mistake … or could with reasonable diligence have discovered it.” Section 32(1)(c) has therefore been central to all these proceedings. They have all been based on the propositions that (a) a restitutionary claim lies for the recovery of money, including tax, paid under a mistake of law, (b) such a claim falls within the ambit of section 32(1)(c), and (c) the effect of that provision is to postpone the commencement of the limitation period in respect of such a claim until the true state of the law is established by a judicial decision from which there lies no right of appeal.</a></p><a name="para8">

However, the colossal amounts of money at stake in these proceedings have made it worthwhile for every arguable point to be taken, not least points which might affect the applicable limitation period. The result has been a very protracted series of related proceedings. During the many years since these various proceedings were begun, the relevant principles of English law have been undergoing development, largely driven by those proceedings themselves. It may be helpful to note at this stage the principal milestones along the road, beginning with two decisions of the House of Lords which preceded the bringing of these claims, but set the scene for what followed.</a></p><a name="para9">

In 1998 the House of Lords held that a claim for restitution lay in respect of money paid under a mistake of law, and that such a claim fell within the scope of section 32(1)(c) of the 1980 Act: <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1998/38.html">[1999] 2 AC 349</a>. On 8 March 2001, in the ACT Group Litigation, the Court of Justice issued its judgment in <i>Hoechst</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/EUECJ/2001/C41098.html">[2001] Ch 620</a>, establishing the incompatibility with EU law of the UK tax treatment of dividends paid by UK-resident subsidiaries to foreign parents<i>. </i>In July 2003, at a later stage in the ACT Group Litigation, Park J gave judgment in<i> Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i>, holding that the principles established in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> applied to tax paid under a mistake of law, including tax paid in ignorance of the fact that the legislation under which it was charged was incompatible with EU law: <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2003/1779.html">[2003] EWHC 1779 (Ch)</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2003/1779.html">[2003] 4 All ER 645</a>. In accordance with <i>Kleinwort Benson</i>, he also<i> </i>held that the limitation period applicable to such claims was that laid down by section 32(1) of the 1980 Act, namely six years from the date on which the mistake was or could with reasonable diligence have been discovered. That date, he held, was the date on which the Court of Justice gave judgment in <i>Hoechst</i>, establishing the incompatibility of the legislation in question with EU law<i>. </i>On 8 September 2003 the Government announced proposed legislation to exclude the application of section 32(1)(c) in respect of all mistake claims made on or after that date which related to an Inland Revenue taxation matter. Legislation to that effect was enacted in July 2004, in the form of section 320 of the Finance Act 2004 (“FA 2004”). In February 2005 the Court of Appeal reversed Park J’s decision in<i> Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i>: <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2005/78.html">[2005] EWCA Civ 78</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2005/78.html">[2006] Ch 243</a>.</p>

It also decided that the fact that the taxpayer might have a concurrent ground of action under the <i>Woolwich</i> principle, which was subject to a limitation period running from the date of the payment, did not prevent it from pursuing its claim on the ground of mistake. The consequence was that claims in the ACT Group Litigation could be brought for the restitution of tax paid as far back as 1973, provided that the claim had been issued prior to the deadline of 8 September 2003 imposed by section 320 of the FA 2004.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para12">12.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following the decision of the House of Lords in<i> Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i>, the Government applied to the Court of Justice for the reopening of the hearing of the first reference in the FII Group Litigation so that it could argue for a temporal restriction on the effect of the Court of Justice’s judgment, which had not yet been handed down. On 6 December 2006 the Court of Justice rejected the Government’s application: Order (Case C-446/04) EU:C:2006:761. On the same day, the Government announced proposed legislation excluding the application of section 32(1)(c) of the 1980 Act in respect of mistake claims made before 8 September 2003 and relating to an Inland Revenue matter. A few days later, in the first reference in the FII Group Litigation, the Court of Justice held that the UK tax treatment of dividends paid by foreign subsidiaries to UK resident parents was incompatible with EU law: <i>Test Claimants in the FII Group Litigation v Inland Revenue Comrs</i> (Case C-446/04) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2006/C44604.html">[2006] ECR I-11753</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2006/C44604.html">[2012] 2 AC 436</a> (“<i>FII (CJEU) 1</i>”).</p>

Taken together with<i> Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i>, this meant that interest could be compounded for a period stretching back to 1973. The day after judgment was delivered in <i>Sempra Metals</i>, the legislation announced in December 2006 was enacted as section 107 of the Finance Act 2007 (“FA 2007”).</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para14">14.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2012, in the FII Group Litigation, this court held that a <i>Woolwich</i> claim could lie in the absence of a demand (ACT being self-assessed), but that, in order for a claim to fall within the ambit of section 32(1)(c) of the 1980 Act, a mistake must constitute an essential element of the cause of action, and not merely form part of the context: <i>Test Claimants in the FII Group Litigation v Revenue and Customs Comrs (formerly Inland Revenue Comrs)</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2012/19.html">[2012] UKSC 19</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2012/19.html">[2012] 2 AC 337</a> (“<i>FII (SC) 1</i>”). The consequence was that section 32(1)(c) did not apply to the <i>Woolwich</i> ground of restitution. The taxpayer could however seek recovery of tax paid in ignorance of the fact that the legislation under which it was charged was incompatible with EU law, on the basis that it had been paid under a mistake. The case was argued and decided on the assumption that the decisions in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> and <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i> were correct. The court also held that section 107 of the FA 2007 was incompatible with EU law. The court referred to the Court of Justice the question whether section 320 of the FA 2004 was also incompatible with EU law in so far as it had retrospective effect. In 2013 the Court of Justice held that it was: <i>Test Claimants in the FII Group Litigation v Revenue and Customs Comrs (formerly Inland Revenue Comrs)</i> (Case C-362/12) <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2013/C36212.html">[2014] AC 1161</a> (“<i>FII (CJEU) 3</i>”).</p>

In more recent times, however, they enjoyed greater success. In 2017, in a test case concerned with the restitution of VAT charged incompatibly with EU law, this court reined in the increasingly expansive approach to restitutionary claims which had followed the adoption of the theory of unjust enrichment in <i>Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1988/12.html">[1991] 2 AC 548</a> and <i>Banque Financière de la Cité v Parc (Battersea) Ltd</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1998/7.html">[1999] 1 AC 221</a>: see <i>Investment Trust Companies v Revenue and Customs Comrs</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2017/29.html">[2017] UKSC 29</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2017/29.html">[2018] AC 275</a>. Later that year, in the <i>Littlewoods</i> proceedings, this court held that common law claims to restitution of VAT, together with any right to compound interest based on <i>Sempra Metals</i>, and<i> </i>the limitation regime imposed by the 1980 Act, had been effectively excluded by the statutory provisions governing the recovery of VAT: <i>Littlewoods Ltd v Revenue and Customs Comrs</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2017/70.html">[2017] UKSC 70</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2017/70.html">[2018] AC 869</a>.

The Revenue were also granted permission to appeal on the question whether the decision in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i>, so far as relating to limitation, was correct.

At para 391, the judge said:</a></p><a name="para33"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“[I]t is the evidence of the claimants’ own witnesses that they paid all of the tax in dispute on the footing that they believed it to be lawfully due, and had no reason to suspect the contrary before June 2000 at the earliest. So, for example, Mr Anthony Cohn, who was a Tax Manager with BAT Holdings, said in his first witness statement dated 13 May 2004:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:43.45pt;margin-bottom: 26.0pt;margin-left:108.0pt">‘The first time we considered that the denial of [FII] treatment of foreign dividends might be a breach of EC law was when we discussed internally the <i>Verkooijen</i> judgment shortly after it was published on 6 June 2000. Following this, we spent a considerable amount of time considering our options and waiting to see how EC law would develop. Following discussions with our tax advisers, PricewaterhouseCoopers and our solicitors, Dorsey &amp; Whitney in the spring and early summer of 2003, we decided to issue the claim.’”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">Mr Hardman, who was the head of taxation at BAT Industries, confirmed the accuracy of that evidence. The judge said that he saw no reason to doubt it. He found that “nobody within the BAT group questioned the lawfulness of the relevant UK legislation at any time before June 2000” (when the <i>Verkooijen</i> judgment was delivered), and that accordingly “[a]ll the disputed tax which was paid up to that date was paid in the firm belief that it was lawfully due” (para 393).</p>

In that regard, the judge noted the Report of the Committee of Independent Experts on Company Taxation (the Ruding Committee), established by the European Commission in 1990 to evaluate the need for greater harmonisation of tax. In its Report, published in 1992, the Committee noted the adverse impact on overseas investment caused by discriminatory taxation of dividends from profits earned in another member state. There was, however, no suggestion that the discrimination was contrary to EU law. The same was true of the first draft of a paper by the Adam Smith Institute entitled “An Act Against Trade - UK Tax Prejudice Against Trading Abroad: The Problem of Surplus ACT and its Solution”, which was sent to Mr Etherington, the Head of Tax for the BAT Group, in 1989 by the Director of the Institute. Reference was also made to a number of published articles on the subject by tax lawyers. The last of the articles, published in 1998, was the only one to raise the question whether the difference in treatment constituted a violation of EU law (Lodin, “The Imputation Systems and Cross-Border Dividends - the need for new solutions”, EC Tax Review, 1998, p 229). The author concluded that there was very little guidance to be found in earlier decisions of the Court of Justice, and that the outcome of any challenge was difficult to predict. The judge commented that that assessment reflected the uncertainty acknowledged by the Court of Justice in the present proceedings, “which continued at least until the decision in <i>Verkooijen</i> in June 2000” (para 391). He concluded that, prior to that date, “there was admittedly discrimination between the way in which UK tax law treated domestic dividends and foreign dividends, with domestic dividends receiving the more favourable treatment, but whether this form of discrimination involved a breach of articles 43 and 56 remained unclear until the decision in <i>Verkooijen</i>” (

The consequence would be that the leading case of <i>Cartledge v E Jopling &amp; Sons Ltd</i> [1963] AC 758 would be seen to have missed the point, and the limits and rationale of sections 11 and 14A of the 1980 Act (which extend the limitation period for actions of damages for personal injuries, and other actions of damages for negligence, respectively, until the facts constituting the cause of action are known) would have to be revisited.</p>

That date was within the relevant six-year period, whether that period began on 8 March 2001, as the Revenue argued, on 25 October 2006 (the date of the judgment in<i> Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i>), as the judge was inclined to think, or on 12 December 2006, as the claimants argued.

But, he said, that position necessarily followed from the courts’ jurisprudence. By parity of reasoning with the decision of the House of Lords in<i> Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/49.html">[2007] 1 AC 558</a>, he considered that it was strongly arguable that it was only when that judgment was delivered, on 25 October 2006, that time began to run against the BAT claimants. That judgment was pertinent, in his view, because it was the first time an appellate court had determined that a restitutionary claim lay for the recovery of tax on the ground that it had been paid under a mistake of law. Although Park J had decided the same point three years earlier, it was only the decision of the House of Lords which achieved finality on the issue. However, in the light of the majority judgments in <i>FII (SC) 1</i> [2012] 2 AC 33, particularly that of Lord Walker, he concluded that the date when the claimants discovered (or could with reasonable diligence have discovered) their mistake was 8 March 2001, when the Court of Justice delivered its judgment in <i>Hoechst</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/EUECJ/2001/C41098.html">[2001] Ch 620</a>.</p>

Both parties had, however, recognised the significance of the issue for other claims (which had been stayed before being pleaded out), and had agreed that it should be included in the list of issues to be decided at the trial. The judge rejected the complaint, noting that the point was included in the agreed list of issues, and observing that the pleaded position as between the test claimants and the Revenue was not relevant to this issue, since both parties agreed that it made no difference so far as they were concerned.</a></p><a name="para49">

As they noted, however, other claimants had not commenced proceedings until much later, and the Revenue had made it plain that, although pleadings had not been required in the cases of those claimants, it would be raising a limitation defence in them.

An authoritative determination of a related point by a final court in earlier proceedings would only start time to run, in their view, if it necessarily meant that the same conclusion would follow in the instant proceedings. The provisions in issue in <i>Hoechst</i> were not the same as those in issue in the FII GLO, and it was not contended that the decision in <i>Hoechst</i> necessarily meant that the latter provisions also infringed EU law. On that basis, the court concluded that the limitation period began to run for the test claimants only on the date when judgment was delivered in <i>FII (CJEU) 1</i>: that is to say, 12 December 2006, three and a half years after they had issued their claims.</p>

The discovery of new factual matter which could not have been found out by reasonable diligence for use in the earlier proceedings does not, according to the law of England, permit the latter to be re-opened. … Cause of action estoppel extends also to points which might have been but were not raised and decided in the earlier proceedings for the purpose of establishing or negativing the existence of a cause of action.”</p> 
</a><p class="ParaNoNumber"><a name="para61">Lord Keith quoted from the judgment of Sir James Wigram V-C in <i>Henderson v Henderson</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1843/917.html">(1843) 3 Hare 100</a>, 114-115:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In trying this question, I believe I state the rule of the court correctly, when I say, that where a given matter becomes the subject of litigation in, and adjudication by, a court of competent jurisdiction, the court requires the parties to that litigation to bring forward their whole case, and will not (except under special circumstances) permit the same parties to open the same subject of litigation in respect of matter which might have been brought forward as part of the subject in contest, but which was not brought forward, only because they have, from negligence, inadvertence, or even accident, omitted part of their case. The plea of res judicata applies, except in special cases, not only to points upon which the court was actually required by the parties to form an opinion and pronounce a judgment, but to every point which properly belonged to the subject of litigation, and which the parties, exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">Lord Keith ([1991] 2 AC 93) observed that this passage has frequently been treated as settled law and referred to the advice of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in two cases: <i>Hoystead v Commissioner of Taxation</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKPC/1925/1925_107.html">[1926] AC 155</a> and<i> Yat Tung Investment Co Ltd v Dao Heng Bank Ltd</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKPC/1975/1975_6.html">[1975] AC 581</a>. He stated:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It will be seen that this passage appears to have opened the door towards the possibility that cause of action estoppel may not apply in its full rigour where the earlier decision did not in terms decide, because they were not raised, <i>points which might have been vital to the existence or non-existence of a cause of action</i>.” (Emphasis added)</p>

The claimants’ complaint in short is that the Revenue had conceded both in their pleadings and in counsel’s submissions that section 32(1)(c) applied to mistakes of law and that BAT (and by implication other claimants which had raised proceedings within six years after 8 March 2001) faced no limitation defence. Those concessions relate to the defence of limitation. The effect of limitation is to render an otherwise valid claim unenforceable to the extent that the claim relates to periods beyond the period of limitation. The concessions had and have no bearing on the existence or non-existence of the cause of action which is a claim for restitution based on the payment of tax which was paid under a mistaken understanding of the relevant law. The Revenue therefore are not barred from their challenge by cause of action estoppel.</a></p><a name="para63">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“There are many causes of action which can only be established by proving that two or more conditions are fulfilled. Such causes of action involve as many separate issues between the parties as there are conditions to be fulfilled by the plaintiff in order to establish his cause of action; and there may be cases where the fulfilment of an identical condition is a requirement common to two or more different causes of action. If in litigation upon one such cause of action any of such separate issues as to whether a particular condition has been fulfilled is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, either upon evidence or upon admission by a party to the litigation, neither party can, in subsequent litigation between one another upon any cause of action which depends upon the fulfilment of the identical condition, assert that the condition was fulfilled if the court has in the first litigation determined that it was not, or deny that it was fulfilled if the court in the first litigation determined that it was.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">He referred to the passage in Diplock LJ’s judgment in <i>Thoday</i> which we have quoted above and, by reference to Diplock LJ’s judgment in <i>Fidelitas Shipping</i> (above), observed that issue estoppel had been extended to cover the case where in subsequent proceedings it is sought to raise a point which might have been but was not raised in the earlier proceedings ([1991] 2 AC 93, p 106).</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para67"></a><a name="para68">68.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lord Sumption in <i>Virgin Atlantic Airways</i> (above), para 21, explained Lord Keith’s judgment in <i>Arnold</i> (above) in relation to issue estoppel. In the case of that estoppel it was in principle possible to challenge a previous decision on an issue not only by taking a new point which could not reasonably have been taken in the earlier proceedings but also (in contrast to cause of action estoppel) “to reargue in materially altered circumstances an old point which had previously been rejected”. In para 22 he stated that <i>Arnold</i> was authority for the following proposition:</a></p><a name="para68"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Except in special circumstances where this would cause injustice, issue estoppel bars the raising in subsequent proceedings of points which (i) were not raised in the earlier proceedings or (ii) were raised but unsuccessfully.

The answer to this challenge lies in the terms of the GLO and the way in which the proceedings developed. The question of limitation was raised in Issue P in the GLO (“From what date does the limitation period commence?”) and the BAT claim was the test claim in relation to that issue: para 20 above. Issue P was not argued or determined in Henderson J’s first judgment (<i>FII (HC) 1</i> 
<span class="searchpubref"></span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2008/2893.html">[2009] STC 254</a>) or in the appeals which arose out of that judgment. The only question relating to a limitation defence which was decided in the first trial was Issue Q, which concerned the effect of section 320 of the FA 2004 and section 107 of the FA 2007: paras 29 and 35 above. This is unsurprising, as in the first phase of the litigation the Revenue’s only limitation defence to BAT’s mistake of law claims was its reliance on those statutory provisions to exclude the application of section 32(1)(c). In the period leading up to the second trial before Henderson J the BAT claimants asserted in their revised pleadings that the mistake claims were not time barred, and the Revenue admitted those assertions: para 44 above. Notwithstanding that admission in relation to the BAT claimants, the Revenue wished to argue that the relevant date under section 32(1)(c) was 8 March 2001 because that date would support a limitation defence in relation to some of the other claims. As a result, the parties agreed that Issue 28 be decided at the second trial: para 45 above. It would not have been possible for the Revenue to argue at first instance or in the Court of Appeal that either <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> or <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i> was wrongly decided. But until June 2016 the Revenue gave no indication and made no reservation that they might seek to advance such an argument if the case were to return to the Supreme Court. With the benefit of hindsight, that is unquestionably unfortunate. But it does not give rise to an issue estoppel in circumstances where Issue P had to be determined in the second phase of the proceedings and the argument which the Revenue now wish to advance could be raised only in the Supreme Court.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para70">70.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The claimants advance a closely related argument that this court has no jurisdiction to address the challenge which the Revenue now seek to mount. This is because Henderson J in his second judgment (<i>FII (HC) 2</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2014/4302.html">[2015] STC 1471</a>) made the declaration (Declaration 24) which we have set out in para 50 above. That declaration answered Issue 28 by stating two things. First, in Declaration 24A it stated that the date at which the BAT claimants could have discovered their mistake was 8 March 2001. Secondly, in Declaration 24B it stated:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It is common ground that on any view the BAT claimants started their mistake claims within the extended limitation period. As a result, all of the mistake claims of the BAT claimants dating back to 1973 are in time.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">There was no appeal against Declaration 24B. The BAT claimants now argue that by failing to appeal that declaration, the Revenue cannot raise the arguments which they wish to raise against them and the other claimants whose claims were issued within six years of 8 March 2001 because this court has no jurisdiction to consider a challenge to a court order which has not been appealed.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para71">71.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We reject this argument. The failure to appeal the declaration in question does not exclude the jurisdiction of this court. The declaration is not a judicial determination but records an agreed position at that time. Such an order is not readily the subject of an appeal. The issue to which the declaration of the common position gives rise is whether the Revenue should be allowed to depart from that common position by withdrawing their concession at this late stage in the proceedings. That is a matter which we address in paras 83-100 below.</a></p><a name="para71"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para71"></a><a name="para72">72.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The claimants’ alternative argument is that the Revenue, by seeking to extend Issue 28 into an argument that <i>Kleinwort Benson </i>and<i> </i><i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i> were wrongly decided, are guilty of an abuse of process. The principle of abuse of process was first formulated by Wigram V-C in <i>Henderson v Henderson</i> (above) and more recently was analysed by the House of Lords in <i>Johnson v Gore Wood &amp; Co</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2000/65.html">[2002] 2 AC 1</a>. In that case Lord Bingham (at p 31B-E) stated:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The bringing of a claim or the raising of a defence in later proceedings may, without more, amount to abuse if the court is satisfied (the onus being on the party alleging abuse) that the claim or defence should have been raised in the earlier proceedings if it was to be raised at all. … It is, however, wrong to hold that because a matter could have been raised in earlier proceedings it should have been, so as to render the raising of it in later proceedings necessarily abusive. That is to adopt too dogmatic an approach to what should in my opinion be a broad, merits-based judgment which takes account of the public and private interests involved and also takes account of all the facts of the case, focusing attention on the crucial question whether, in all the circumstances, a party is misusing or abusing the process of the court by seeking to raise before it the issue which could have been raised before.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">Lord Bingham then rejected the submission that the rule in <i>Henderson v Henderson</i> did not apply when an action had been settled by compromise. He stated, pp 32-33:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“An important purpose of the rule is to protect a defendant against the harassment necessarily involved in repeated actions concerning the same subject matter. A second action is not the less harassing because the defendant has been driven or thought it prudent to settle the first; often, that outcome would make a second action the more harassing.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">Lord Goff of Chieveley, Lord Cooke of Thorndon and Lord Hutton agreed in terms with Lord Bingham’s analysis. Lord Millett’s speech is consistent with Lord Bingham’s analysis. He described the doctrine of res judicata as a rule of substantive law and contrasted that with the <i>Henderson v Henderson</i> doctrine which he described as “a procedural rule based on the need to protect the process of the court from abuse and the defendant from oppression” (<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2000/65.html">[2002] 2 AC 1</a>, p 59D-E).</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Res judicata is a rule of substantive law, while abuse of process is a concept which informs the exercise of the court’s procedural powers. In my view, they are distinct although overlapping legal principles with the common underlying purpose of limiting abusive and duplicative litigation.”</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para75">75.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the concept of abuse of process informs the exercise of the court’s procedural powers, it is not a question of the exercise by the court of a discretion: <i>Aldi Stores Ltd v WSP Group plc</i> [2017] EWCA Civ 1260; </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2007/1260.html">[2008] 1 WLR 748</a>, para 16 per Thomas LJ, para 38 per Longmore LJ. If the court, on making the broad, merits-based judgment of which Lord Bingham spoke, concludes that a claim, a defence, or an amendment of a claim or of a defence involves an abuse of process or oppression of the opposing party, it must exclude that claim, defence or amendment. A finding of abuse of process operates as a bar. Thus, as Lord Wilberforce stated in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in <i>Brisbane City Council v Attorney General for Queensland</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKPC/1978/1978_11.html">[1979] AC 411</a>, 425, the doctrine</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“ought only to be applied when the facts are such as to amount to an abuse: otherwise there is a danger of a party being shut out from bringing forward a genuine subject of litigation.”</p>

It is not sufficient to establish abuse of process for a party to show that a challenge could have been raised in a prior litigation or at an earlier stage in the same proceedings. It must be shown both that the challenge should have been raised on that earlier occasion and that the later raising of the challenge is abusive.</a></p><a name="para76">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para77"></a><a name="para78">78.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the FII Group Litigation has involved novel and developing legal claims raising legal issues of unparalleled complexity, causing the claimants and the Revenue to amend their pleadings in the light of developments of both EU law and domestic law. Henderson J in <i>FII (HC) 2</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2014/4302.html">[2015] STC 1471</a>,<i> </i>para 468) correctly spoke of “a complex and evolving legal landscape”. The claims were and are located at the interface of two developing systems of law: see paras 9-15 above. In English law the right to claim restitution for money paid under a mistake of law was first recognised only in 1998 and the courts, including this court, have been dealing with the ramifications of that decision since then. This is the second occasion on which the FII claims have reached this court and the claims have been materially affected by the judgment of the House of Lords in <i>Sempra Metals</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2007/34.html">[2008] 1 AC 561</a> and more recently by the judgments of this court in <i>Littlewoods</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2017/70.html">[2018] AC 869</a> and <i>Prudential</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2018/39.html">[2019] AC 929</a>. On the European plane, the Court of Justice first recognised the incompatibility of the UK corporation tax legislation with EU law in the ACT Group Litigation in <i>Hoechst</i> in 2001, and the FII claims have since then generated no less than three judgments in references to the Court of Justice in 2006, 2012 and 2013. The claimants in the FII Group Litigation, in the ACT Group litigation, and in similar actions seeking the recovery of tax paid under a mistake of law, have been pursuing their claims at the frontier of legal developments. This in part explains the complexity of the legal proceedings, and why legal questions which are of central importance to those claims have only recently been decided or have not yet been determined. The question whether there has been an abuse of process involves a broad merits-based judgment against this very unusual background.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para79">79.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly, the FII Group Litigation has been the subject of case management by the court, which has determined the order in which the questions of legal principle which the parties had identified have been addressed. In the first phase of the litigation 20 issues were sent to trial for determination by Henderson J. As Mr Margolin QC forcefully submitted, it was intended at that stage of the litigation that the first trial before Henderson J would determine all GLO issues relating to the test claims, including liability for restitution, except in so far as the issues concerned causation or quantification of the claims. It is also clear that at that stage the Revenue did not dispute that section 32(1)(c) would have applied to the mistake of law claims but for Parliament’s intervention by enacting section 320 of the FA 2004 and section 107 of the FA 2007 to exclude the operation of that section in relation to mistake claims relating to Inland Revenue taxation matters. But Issue P (“From what date does the limitation period commence?”) was not determined in the first phase of the litigation, because, as the parties then presented their cases, it made no difference to the outcome of the BAT claims. The question raised by Issue P remained to be addressed in a later phase of the litigation.</a></p><a name="para79">

Those provisions would have established in domestic law the Revenue’s limitation defence that all claims accruing more than six years before the date of issue of the relevant claim forms were barred by the 1980 Act, but the provisions were held to be incompatible with EU law in so far as they had retrospective effect. Had the Revenue succeeded in establishing the legal enforceability of those statutory responses to the legal developments, they would not have needed to mount a challenge to <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> and<i> Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i>. In the context of these actions in a developing area of law, we are satisfied that the Revenue’s failure to raise the wider questions relating to section 32(1)(c), while unfortunate, involved no culpability.</a></p><a name="para80"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para80"></a><a name="para81">81.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourthly, it is not disputed that until the first phase of the FII Group Litigation reached this court in 2012, the Revenue could not have raised a challenge to the decisions in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> and <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i> as only this court could review those judgments. The Revenue did not do so. Indeed, in response to a question from this court at that hearing, their counsel disavowed any intention to do so in those proceedings. But, at that time, the Revenue’s defence based on the statutory provisions enacted in 2004 and 2007 was still a live issue and Issue P had not been addressed. With the benefit of hindsight, it would have been better if the issue which the Revenue seek to raise in this hearing had been raised before this court in 2012, not least because the BAT claimants estimate that the limitation defence, if successful, would exclude a very large proportion of the value of their claims. But we do not think that it can be said that in the circumstances which prevailed in 2012 the Revenue should have raised the wider issue then. In the context of a very complex group litigation raising many novel questions of law in which the court had left Issue P for a later phase, the Revenue did not act abusively in not mounting the wider challenge then.</a></p><a name="para81">

The claimants argue with no little force that the Revenue in the second phase of the FII Group Litigation never stated that they wished to reserve the right to mount a broader attack in their limitation defence, which included a challenge to the<i> Kleinwort Benson </i>and<i> </i><i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i> decisions. On the contrary, the Revenue admitted in the pleadings in the BAT test case that BAT’s mistake claims were not time barred: para 44 above. Issue 28 in the second phase, which we have set out in para 45 above, is sufficiently broad to support one of the arguments which the Revenue have advanced in this court, namely that a taxpayer could with reasonable diligence have discovered a mistake of law at the date when the tax was mistakenly paid. But in the context of the Revenue’s admissions, which are reflected in Henderson J’s statement of the common position of the parties in Declaration 24B (para 50 above), the agreed focus of that issue was on the Revenue’s argument that 8 March 2001, which is the date on which the CJEU handed down the <i>Hoechst</i> judgment (</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/EUECJ/2001/C41098.html">[2001] Ch 620</a>), was the relevant date under section 32(1)(c), as Henderson J held in Declaration 24A.</p>

The Court of Appeal allowed the application. Nourse LJ, who delivered the judgment of the court, stated the rule of procedure which operates as a norm, by quoting from the judgment of Sir George Jessel MR in <i>Ex p Firth, In re Cowburn</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpCh/1882/13.html">(1882) 19 Ch D 419</a>, 429:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“the rule is that, if a point was not taken before the tribunal which hears the evidence, and evidence could have been adduced which by any possibility would prevent the point from succeeding, it cannot be taken afterwards. You are bound to take the point in the first instance, so as to enable the other party to give evidence.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">Nourse LJ stated that although the court has a discretion to refuse an application to raise on appeal a pure question of law which had not been raised at first instance, the normal practice was to allow the legal point to be taken where the court could be confident that the other party (i) had had an opportunity of meeting it, (ii) had not acted to his detriment by reason of the earlier omission to take the point and (iii) could be adequately compensated in costs: p 611C-F per Nourse LJ.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It is not in dispute that to withdraw a concession or take a point not argued in the lower court requires the leave of this court. In general the court expects each party to advance his whole case at the trial. In the interests of fairness to the other party this court should be slow to allow new points, which were available to be taken at the trial but were not taken, to be advanced for the first time in this court. That consideration is the weightier if further evidence might have been adduced at the trial, had the point been taken then, or if the decision on the point requires an evaluation of all the evidence and could be affected by the impression which the trial judge receives from seeing and hearing the witnesses. Indeed it is hard to see how, if those circumstances obtained, this court, having regard to the overriding objective of dealing with cases justly, could allow that new point to be taken.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">That summary, and particularly the reference to the difficulty of allowing a new point to be taken if further evidence would have been adduced at the trial, reflects longstanding practice: see, for example, <i>The Tasmania</i> (1890) 15 App Cas 223, 225 per Lord Herschell; <i>Ex p Firth, In re Cowburn</i> (above) per Sir George Jessel MR. As May LJ also made clear in his concurring judgment in <i>Jones</i> (para 52), the court has established a general procedural principle in the interests of efficiency, expediency and cost and in the interest of substantial justice in the particular case. There is no absolute bar against the raising of a new point of law even if a ruling on a new point of law necessitates the leading of further evidence, but, as the case law reveals, the court will act with great caution.</p>

Haddon-Cave LJ, who gave the judgment of the court, summarised the relevant principles in these terms:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, an appellate court will be cautious about allowing a new point to be raised on appeal that was not raised before the first instance court.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, an appellate court will not, generally, permit a new point to be raised on appeal if that point is such that either (a) it would necessitate new evidence or (b) had it been run below, it would have resulted in the trial being conducted differently with regards to the evidence at the trial (<i>Mullarkey v Broad</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2009/2.html">[2009] EWCA Civ 2</a>, paras 30 and 49).</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, even where the point might be considered a ‘pure point of law’, the appellate court will only allow it to be raised if three criteria are satisfied: (a) the other party has had adequate time to deal with the point; (b) the other party has not acted to his detriment on the faith of the earlier omission to raise it; and (c) the other party can be adequately protected in costs (<i>R (Humphreys) v Parking and Traffic Appeals Service</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2017/24.html">[2017] EWCA Civ 24</a>; [2017] PTR 22, para 29).”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">Haddon-Cave LJ’s second principle reflects the judgment of the Court of Appeal in <i>Jones</i> (above), paras 38 and 52, and his third principle is a paraphrase of what Nourse LJ stated in <i>Pittalis v Grant</i> (above) p 611.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“26.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These authorities show that there is no general rule that a case needs to be ‘exceptional’ before a new point will be allowed to be taken on appeal. Whilst an appellate court will always be cautious before allowing a new point to be taken, the decision whether it is just to permit the new point will depend upon an analysis of all the relevant factors. These will include, in particular, the nature of the proceedings which have taken place in the lower court, the nature of the new point, and any prejudice that would be caused to the opposing party if the new point is allowed to be taken.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">The court then spoke of a spectrum of cases. At one end, where there had been a full trial involving live evidence and the new point might have changed the course of the evidence or required further factual enquiry, there was likely to be significant prejudice to the opposing party and the policy arguments in favour of finality would be likely to carry great weight. At the other end, where the point to be taken was a pure point of law which could be argued on the facts as found by the judge, the appeal court was far more likely to permit the point to be taken, provided that the other party had had time to meet the new argument and had not suffered any irremediable prejudice in the meantime (paras 27 and 28).</p>

But the claimants argue that they have acted to their detriment and will suffer serious prejudice if the Revenue were to be allowed to widen Issue 28 into a challenge to the authority of <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> and <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i> and were to succeed in that challenge.

Secondly, they submit that there was a clear demarcation in the phases between liability and quantification and the question of limitation properly belonged to the first phase. Thirdly, the claimants would suffer enormous prejudice if the Revenue’s new case on limitation were to succeed, because the test claimants had expended very substantial resources in the past six years in litigating legal issues relating to the quantification of their claims in the second phase of the Group Litigation and also in challenging the “windfall tax” imposed by the F(No 2)A 2015. Counsel estimated that the claimants had incurred costs of about £9.8m, net of recovery through awards of costs, on the FII Group Litigation and the “windfall tax” challenge. Fourthly, if the Revenue were to succeed, this might necessitate a retrial of questions of quantification. The test claimants also assert that they have been prejudiced because this court in its judgments in <i>Littlewoods</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2017/70.html">[2018] AC 869</a> and <i>Prudential</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2018/39.html">[2019] AC 929</a>, which have a materially adverse effect on the quantification of their claims by excluding compound interest on those claims, was influenced<i> </i>by the disruption to public finances which the application of section 32(1)(c) to claims for the repayment of tax would entail.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para93">93.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We consider this challenge to be the most difficult to determine of the claimants’ preliminary challenges to the scope of this appeal. With hindsight, there is no doubt that it would have been better if the Revenue at the start of the second phase of the FII Group Litigation had reserved their right to mount the challenge which they seek to make in this court. It is important that there be discipline in the conduct of actions which are the subject of Group Litigation Orders and it is important that there be finality in the determination of issues raised in such actions. An appellate court, in the interests of justice, will normally seek strenuously to avoid an outcome which results in the parties, who have already gone to trial on the quantification of a claim, having to amend their pleadings and to adduce further evidence to apply its ruling on a new issue of law to the facts of their case. In a normal litigation, the need for a re-trial would be a strong and normally determinative pointer against allowing a party to withdraw a concession which had influenced the way in which a litigation had been conducted.</a></p><a name="para93">

The court is being asked to exercise a discretion not in an individual case but in the context of a group litigation order, a procedural phenomenon which did not exist when Lord Herschell wrote his speech in <i>The Tasmania</i> (1890) 15 App Cas 223. One must also have regard to the nature and subject matter of this group litigation and the manner in which it has been conducted. It is not suggested that the BAT claimants have not had time to deal with the legal challenge. We do not accept that, as the FII Group Litigation progressed, there was a complete demarcation between liability and quantum in the first and second phases: the BAT claimants accept that in the second phase, 19 of the 29 issues related to quantification. The others did not. Issue P, which became Issue 28, remained to be resolved and Issue 17 (namely whether the tax credits given to shareholders for ACT prevented the Revenue from being enriched) raised an issue of principle which could have had a material effect on the quantification of the claims.</a></p><a name="para94">

In the context of the FII Group Litigation, the starting date of the six-year limitation period was of material importance to the claimants who were prejudiced by Henderson J’s determination. Any one of those claimants could have applied for permission to appeal that declaration under CPR Part 19, rule 19.12(2). It is important to bear in mind the context of this litigation in which this court is asked to make rulings on issues of legal principle which will affect directly or indirectly other claimants besides the BAT claimants, both within and outside the particular GLO. In that context, the loss of the opportunity for the BAT claimants to secure a procedural advantage to close off the issue so far as it related to their claims and those of the other 18 claimants who were not prejudiced by Henderson J’s determination by not appealing against Declaration 24A is a consideration which carries only limited weight.</a></p><a name="para96"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para96"></a><a name="para97">97.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is possible that the BAT claimants’ approach to the sequencing of the issues in Phase 2 of the litigation, and in particular the quantification of their claims, would have been different. They might have wished the challenge to <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> and <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i> to be resolved before they expended time and money on quantification. But the claimants in the FII GLO would still have substantial claims, which the Revenue estimate to be between £80m and £130m, if the limitation challenge which the Revenue now seek to pursue were to succeed; and they needed to complete the litigation to establish those claims. Further, the BAT claimants and the other claimants were prepared to incur the costs in relation to quantification when there was no final determination of issues such as Issue 17 and when the question whether there was an entitlement to compound interest, which was determined adversely to their interest by this court in <i>Littlewoods</i> and <i>Prudential</i>, had yet to be conclusively resolved. It is therefore mere speculation on the information before this court for us to say what the claimants might have done if the Revenue had reserved their position on <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> and<i> Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i>. Insofar as the BAT claimants are able to persuade the court that they have suffered prejudice by incurring costs which they would not have incurred but for the admission that there was no time bar defence in relation to the BAT claimants and (by implication) the 18 other claimants who commenced proceedings before 8 March 2007, it may be possible to provide a remedy by revising the orders for costs which have been made in the proceedings or by making a further order for costs.</a></p><a name="para97">

That legislation was enacted before several decisions which have materially affected the value of the claimants’ claims had been determined. It predated this court’s judgments in <i>Littlewoods</i> and <i>Prudential</i>, which excluded claims for compound interest as a component of a claim for restitution. We cannot know whether Parliament would have acted differently in 2015 if the Revenue had reserved a right to challenge the <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> and <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i> decisions before this court at a future date.</a></p><a name="para98">

The nature of the claims, depending as they do on a developing area of law, means that it is important that this court address the legal questions which the Revenue wish to raise. The size of the claims and their impact on the public purse are also relevant considerations, as it would be wrong to uphold such claims if they are based on an incorrect understanding of the law. As we have said, even if the Revenue’s challenge to the application of section 32(1)(c) succeeds, the claimants will have claims of substantial value. The legal question is also of great importance to other claimants outside the FII Group Litigation, including claimants in the litigations to which we have referred in paras 5-6 above, who also have claims of high value.</a></p><a name="para99">

For the reasons which we have set out in paras 94-100 above (other than the effect of the determination on claimants outside the FII Group Litigation) and in particular that, if we were to hold that either <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> or <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i> was wrongly decided in relation to the interpretation of section 32(1)(c) of the 1980 Act, those claims would to that extent be based on an incorrect understanding of the law, we are not persuaded that the interests of justice require this court to make such orders.</a></p><a name="para101">

But the mistake was invariably one of fact, rather than law. In particular, it had been established for almost 200 years that no claim lay at common law for the recovery of money paid under a mistake of law: see, for example, <i>Bilbie v Lumley</i> (1802) 2 East 469.

The most important for present purposes was the Limitation Act 1623 (21 Jac 1, c 16), as amended by the Administration of Justice Act 1705 (4 &amp; 5 Anne c 16) and the Mercantile Law Amendment Act 1856 (19 &amp; 20 Vict, c 97) (“the 1623 Act”). It imposed time limits of 20 years on the bringing of real actions and six years, running from the accrual of the cause of action, on the bringing of certain personal actions, including trespass, trover, replevin, actions of account, action on the case and actions of debt. It is apparent from the names of the forms of action to which the statute applied, and from the fact that they were referred to as “actions”, that the only proceedings barred were actions at law.</a></p><a name="para105">

In such cases, the cause of action accrued on the date of the payment: <i>Baker v Courage &amp; Co Ltd</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpKQB/1909/173.html">[1910] 1 KB 56</a>.

It is also necessary to bear in mind that cases which involved a mistake also often involved other factors which formed the justification for equitable relief, such as fraud, misrepresentation or abuse of a fiduciary position. For present purposes, in the light of the decision in <i>FII (SC) 1</i>, it is also necessary to distinguish between cases where mistake was an essential element of the claim for relief, and cases where it was not.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Mistake may be on a matter either of law or of fact, and it is generally said that whereas relief can be obtained against mistake of fact, no relief can be given against mistake of law. Neither part of this proposition can, however, be accepted without considerable qualification, for not every mistake of fact is the subject of relief, and, on the other hand, relief is sometimes granted even against mistakes of law.”</p>

First, mistake was accepted as being a ground in some circumstances for refusing specific performance of a contract. Secondly, mistake could in some circumstances justify the exercise of an equitable jurisdiction to grant rescission of a contract (it is unnecessary to consider in this appeal whether such a jurisdiction survived the decision in <i>Bell v Lever Bros Ltd</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1931/2.html">[1932] AC 161</a>: a question considered in <i>Great Peace Shipping Ltd v Tsavliris Salvage (International) Ltd</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2002/1407.html">[2002] EWCA Civ 1407</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2002/1407.html">[2003] QB 679</a>). It is relevant to note that in a leading case of common mistake where equity intervened, a distinction was drawn between ignorance of the general law, which could not justify rescission, and a mistake as to private rights of ownership, which could, but was categorised as a mistake of fact: <i>Cooper v Phibbs</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpHL/1867/10.html">(1867) LR 2 HL 149</a>, 170 (where the plaintiff contracted to purchase property from the defendant which, unknown to either of them, the plaintiff already owned in equity). Thirdly, equity could provide relief where a written contract failed to express correctly the parties’ antecedent agreement, by providing the remedy of rectification. Fourthly, although it was a general rule in equity, as at common law, that money paid under a mistake of law could not be recovered, there were said to be certain exceptions.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para110">110.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The general rule was stated in Snell’s discussion of mistake at pp 439-440:</a></p><a name="para110"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… money paid under a mistake of law cannot be recovered, this being perhaps the only type of relief where it can be regarded as absolutely clearly established by way of general rule that ignorantia legis non excusat.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">The authorities cited in support of that statement included <i>Rogers v Ingham</i> (1876) 3 Ch D 351, which was a case of alleged overpayment by an executor of one legatee at the expense of the other, as the result of an error in the construction of a will. The allegedly underpaid legatee sought to recover the money from the recipient. As is explained at para 116 below, such cases generally fall within the scope of a principle relating to the administration of estates which enables recovery to be obtained, regardless of whether there has been a mistake or not. However, the case fell outside the scope of that principle, because the payment in question had been authorised by the legatee who later sought to challenge it<i>. </i>Consequently, the only basis for recovery was that the payment had been made under a mistake of law. It was held that no claim lay either in equity or in law for recovery on that basis. James LJ, “whose every word on a question of equitable principle is weighty” (<i>Ministry of Justice v Simpson</i> [1951] AC 251, 272), stated at pp 355-356:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“I have no doubt that there are some cases which have been relied on, in which this court has not adhered strictly to the rule that a mistake in law is not always incapable of being remedied in this court; but relief has never been given in the case of a simple money demand by one person against another, there being between those two persons no fiduciary relation whatever, and no equity to supervene by reason of the conduct of either of the parties.”</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para110"></a><a name="para111">111.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Snell mentioned a number of supposed exceptions to the general rule. As Snell noted at p 440, the first supposed exception, where the mistake was as to foreign law, was merely apparent, since foreign law was treated as a matter of fact. The second supposed exception was where money was paid to an officer of the court, such as a trustee in bankruptcy, under a mistake of law. It was held that the court could prevent its officer from taking advantage of the mistake: see, for example,<i> Ex p James, In re Condon</i> (1874) LR 9 Ch App 609 and <i>Ex p Simmonds, In re Carnac</i> (1885) 16 QBD 308. In these cases, however, the grant of relief was not based on mistake, but on the court’s jurisdiction to enforce high ethical standards on the part of its officers.</a></p><a name="para111">

Referring to <i>Ex p James</i>, he said at p 869:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In that case the money had been paid under such a mistake of law that it could not be recovered by any judicial process whatsoever - whether in law or equity. When James LJ says [in <i>Ex p James</i> at p 614] that the trustee [in bankruptcy] has in his hands money which in equity belongs to somebody else, he is not referring to an equity which is capable of forensic enforcement in a suit or action, but he is referring to a moral principle which he describes when he says that the Court of Bankruptcy ought to be as honest as other people. In <i>Ex p Simmonds</i> Lord Esher states exactly the same principle [at p 312].”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">Buckley LJ said at p 873 that James LJ had referred to equity in <i>Ex p James</i> “in a popular sense, and not in the sense of money which in a court of equity would belong to someone else”. More recent authorities are to the same effect: see, for example, <i>Lehman Bros Australia Ltd v MacNamara</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2020/321.html">[2020] EWCA Civ 321</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2020/321.html">[2020] 3 WLR 147</a>.</p>

The authorities cited by Snell (<i>British Workman’s and General Insurance Co v Cunliffe</i> (1902) 18 TLR 425, <i>Harse v Pearl Life Assurance Co</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpKQB/1904/35.html">[1904] 1 KB 558</a> and <i>Phillips v Royal London Mutual Assurance Co</i> (1911) 105 LT 136) were concerned with claims for the return of premiums, brought by persons who had entered into contracts of insurance which were illegal and void (for want of an insurable interest) as a result of misrepresentations made by or on behalf of the insurance company. Where the misrepresentation was innocent, the money was irrecoverable. Where the misrepresentations were fraudulent, relief was granted, but on the basis of fraud, not mistake: see <i>Harse v Pearl Life Assurance Co</i> at p 563, where Sir Richard Collins MR indicated that relief might also be granted in cases of duress or oppression, or where the defendant stood in a fiduciary relationship towards the plaintiff.</p>

However, Snell provides no example of a money claim for relief from the consequences of a mistake of law, where the occurrence of the mistake was an essential element of the claim. The judgments in cases such as <i>Rogers v Ingham</i> and <i>In re Tyler, Ex p The Official Receiver</i> indicate that a money claim could not be brought on that basis.</a></p><a name="para114">

There were by the 1930s a number of established types of claim in equity which fell into the latter category, in addition to those already mentioned. One was a claim for an account, based on a duty to account arising from the relationship between the parties, but where the claim might have been prompted by the discovery of a mistake. Another example, although not a claim at all, was the correction of errors of account between trustees and beneficiaries: the courts would allow a trustee or personal representative to deduct sums overpaid under a mistake of law from future instalments due to the overpaid beneficiary. On the other hand, there does not appear to be any reported case where a trustee or personal representative recovered money paid under a mistake of law from the recipient, and there are dicta to the effect that such a claim must fail because of the general rule barring such recovery.</a></p><a name="para115">

The remedy available to the person to whom the money was legally due lay in the first instance against the executor, but he could also recover from the recipient any amount which he was unable to recover from the executor. Such a claim was not, however based on mistake: it was, as the Court of Appeal said in <i>In re Diplock</i> [1948] Ch 465 (“<i>In re Diplock</i>”), p 502, “an equitable claim independent of a mistake of fact or of any mistake”. It was based, rather, on the fact that the payment had been made by the executor to a person who was not entitled to it, in breach of the rights of the person to whom it was legally due, as Lord Davey explained in <i>Harrison v Kirk</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpAC/1903/51.html">[1904] AC 1</a>, 7.</p>

In so far as the Court of Chancery applied statutes of limitation, it did so by analogy, as explained below. From 1833 onwards, however, a number of statutes were enacted which imposed limitation periods on the bringing of particular types of suit in equity. For example, the Real Property Limitation Acts of 1833 and 1874 introduced limitation periods in respect of equitable proceedings to recover interests in land, and the Trustee Act 1888 established a limitation period for certain claims against trustees. Many types of equitable proceedings remained subject to no limitation period: for example, there was no provision imposing a time limit on proceedings to rescind transactions induced by undue influence or innocent misrepresentation, and no time limit within which proceedings for rectification must be brought. The statutes did not modify the equitable doctrines of laches and acquiescence.</a></p><a name="para117">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Where a Court of Equity frames its remedy upon the basis of the Common Law, and supplements the Common Law by extending the remedy to parties who cannot have an action at Common Law, there the Court of Equity acts in analogy to the statute; that is, it adopts the statute as the rule of procedure regulating the remedy it affords.”</p>

Accordingly, where the plaintiff’s claim in equity was founded on the fraud of the defendant, time did not begin to run against the plaintiff until he discovered the fraud or had a reasonable opportunity of discovering it.</a></p><a name="para119">

The point is illustrated by the judgment of Alderson B in <i>Denys v Shuckburgh</i> (1840) 4 Y &amp; C Ex 42, where the profits of a mine had for many years been distributed between the parties under a mistake as to their respective shares. When the mistake was discovered, the plaintiff filed a bill for an account, and the question arose whether more than six years’ profits could be recovered in equity. The plaintiff relied on Alderson B’s earlier judgment in <i>Brooksbank v Smith</i> (1836) 2 Y &amp; C Ex 58, where the court applied the 1623 Act by analogy but held that time did not run until the mistake was discovered, since it was only then that laches commenced. In <i>Denys v Shuckburgh</i>, on the other hand, Alderson B explained at p 53 that the position was different where the mistake could reasonably have been discovered earlier than it was:</a></p><a name="para121"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“But here, it seems to me that the plaintiff had the means, with proper diligence, of removing the misapprehension of fact under which I think he did labour … and a court of equity, unless the mistake be clear, and the party be without blame or neglect in not having discovered it earlier, ought, in the exercise of a sound discretion, to adopt the rule given by the statute law as its guide.”</p>

Knight Bruce LJ observed in <i>Stafford v Stafford</i> (1857) 1 De G &amp; J 193, 202 that “[g]enerally, when the facts are known from which a right arises, the right is presumed to be known”. Similar observations were made by Sir Richard Collins MR in <i>Molloy v Mutual Reserve Life Insurance Co</i> (1906) 94 LT 756, 761, in a judgment which is discussed at paras 204-208 below.</a></p><a name="para122">

The Committee reported in 1936 (Fifth Interim Report, on Statutes of Limitation, Cmd 5334), and its Report formed the background to the 1939 Act. The passages in the Report which are relevant for present purposes begin with the Committee’s explanation of the limitation of claims for equitable remedies, at paragraph 13:</a></p><a name="para123"> 
</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para123">“Equitable claims are in some cases directly governed by a statute of limitations, such as claims to land or rent charges. In other cases, such as specific performance or rescission of contracts on the ground of innocent misrepresentation, or setting aside gifts on the ground of undue influence, no period applies, but the plaintiff must act promptly and may be disqualified by laches. In other cases, where a remedy in equity corresponds to a similar remedy in law, equity follows the analogy of the statute which applies to the corresponding common law remedy (<i>Knox v Gye</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpHL/1872/16.html">(1872) LR 5 HL 656</a>), except that in applying equitable remedies to cases of fraud or mistake, the period of limitation is not reckoned until the fraud or mistake is or could, with reasonable diligence, have been discovered.”</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para124">124.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The concluding words in that passage described what the Committee later referred to as “the equitable rule”. As will be explained, it was the Committee’s recommendation to extend that rule to common law claims which resulted in the enactment of section 26 of the 1939 Act, effectively re-enacted as section 32 of the 1980 Act.</a></p><a name="para124">

Exceptions to that general rule included section 26 of the Real Property Limitation Act 1833, and “the equitable doctrine that a plaintiff is not to be affected by the lapse of time where his ignorance is due to the fraud of the defendant, and he has had no reasonable opportunity of discovering such fraud before bringing his action”. It also noted that, following the Judicature Act 1873, there were inconsistent decisions as to whether the equitable doctrine applied to actions in which a court of law would previously have had exclusive jurisdiction. The Committee considered that the position should be clarified so as to prevent defendants from relying on a lapse of time which was due to their fraudulent conduct. It also considered that exception created by the equitable rule should be extended so as to apply not only where a cause of action was founded on a concealed fraud, but also where a cause of action unconnected with fraud was fraudulently concealed from the plaintiff or someone through whom he claimed.</a></p><a name="para125">

</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para126">“A somewhat similar position arises in cases where relief is sought from the consequences of mistake, eg, when money is paid on property transferred under a mistake. The equitable rule is that the time should only run under the Statutes of Limitation from the time at which the mistake was, or could with reasonable diligence have been, discovered. At present this rule does not apply in cases which formerly fell within the exclusive cognisance of a court of law (<i>Baker v Courage</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpKQB/1909/173.html">[1910] 1 KB 56</a>). It only applies to cases which were formerly only actionable in a court of equity, or were within the concurrent jurisdiction of the two systems (<i>In re Mason</i> [1928] Ch 385, and [1929] 1 Ch 1; <i>In re Blake</i> [1932] 1 Ch, para 54). It was held in <i>Baker v Courage</i> (<i>supra</i>) that the Judicature Acts had not altered the common law rule.</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">This position appears to us as unsatisfactory as the position with regard to the effect of concealed fraud, and accordingly we recommend that in all cases when relief is sought from the consequences of a mistake, the equitable rule should prevail and time should only run from the moment when the mistake was discovered, or could with reasonable diligence have been discovered. We desire to make it clear, however, that the mere fact that a plaintiff is ignorant of his rights is not to be a ground for the extension of time. Our recommendation only extends to cases when there is a right to relief from the consequences of a mistake.

It was, as we understand it, reaffirming the principle stated in <i>Stafford v Stafford</i> and <i>Molloy v Mutual Reserve Life Insurance Co</i> (para 122 above) that, whereas allowance could be made for a mistake where it formed one of the ingredients of a cause of action, allowance could not be made, where the ingredients of a cause of action were known, for ignorance that those circumstances gave rise to a cause of action.</a></p><a name="para127">

The recommendation in respect of mistake addressed only one situation: where there was an “action for relief in respect of mistake”. In the light of the authorities as they stood at the time of the Report, this court concluded in <i>FII (SC) 1</i> [2012] 2 AC 33 that, as Lord Walker stated at para 59, “in the cases where the period was or might have been extended the mistake seems to have been an essential ingredient in the cause of action”.</p>

Section 26(c), which applied where “the action is for relief from the consequences of a mistake”, was therefore confined to actions meeting that description for which a period of limitation was prescribed by the Act. It had to be construed in the light of section 2(7), and therefore extended to claims for equitable relief for which a period prescribed in section 2 applied by analogy, in the same way as the earlier statutes of limitation (repealed by section 34) were previously applied.</a></p><a name="para132">

Equivalent claims in equity (eg where the plaintiff was not the person who made the payment under a mistake) fell within the ambit of section 2(7). However, section 26(c) was not understood to apply to actions for the recovery of money on the ground that it had been paid under a mistake of law, since no action of that description, whether in law or in equity, was recognised until long after the 1939 Act had been repealed.</a></p><a name="para133">

The first was <i>In re Diplock</i>. The proceedings were brought after<i> </i>executors distributed the residue of an estate in accordance with a provision in the will directing them to hold it in trust and divide it between such charitable or benevolent objects as they might think fit, without further specification. The next of kin challenged the validity of the trust, and it was held by the House of Lords to be void for uncertainty. More than six years (but less than 12 years) after the distributions had been made, the next of kin sought a declaration that the recipients of the money were liable to refund it to them. The claims were made on two bases. The first was a claim in personam based on the right of an unpaid beneficiary to recover money wrongly paid to a stranger to the estate. The second was a claim in rem, based on tracing the trust assets into the hands of the defendants. It is unnecessary to consider the latter aspect.</a></p><a name="para134">

On that basis, he held that no claim was available, either at law or in equity, since the mistake was one of law: <i>In re Diplock</i> [1947] Ch 716. The judge’s decision on that point was reversed on appeal: [1948] Ch 465. The Court of Appeal correctly held that an equitable claim lay against a recipient who was paid more than he was entitled to receive under a will, regardless of whether the overpayment was made under a mistake, either of fact or of law. As discussed in para 116 above, the court explained that the basis of equitable relief was not mistake, but the receipt of a share or interest in the estate to which the recipient was not entitled, at the expense of the person entitled to it. The primary claim lay however against the executors, and the equitable cause of action was therefore for recoupment of such amounts as were irrecoverable from them.</a></p><a name="para135">

Since section 20 laid down a 12-year period, it followed that the claims were not time-barred. However, the court went on to consider, obiter, the position if, contrary to their view, the claims fell within the scope of section 2(7). On that hypothesis, the court considered that section 26(c) would be relevant, on the basis that the claims sought relief from the consequences of a mistake. This obiter dictum preceded the line of authority, culminating in the decision in <i>FII (SC) 1</i>, which entailed that a claim such as that in <i>In re Diplock</i>, for which a mistake was not an essential ingredient of the cause of action, did not fall within the scope of section 26(c) of the 1939 Act or section 32(1)(c) of the 1980 Act.</a></p><a name="para136">

In a speech with which the other members of the Appellate Committee expressed agreement, Lord Simonds emphasised at p 265 “that the particular branch of the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery with which we are concerned relates to the administration of assets of a deceased person”. Lord Simonds next cited the dictum of Lord Davey in <i>Harrison v Kirk</i> which was mentioned in para 116 above, and stated at p 266:</a></p><a name="para137"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The importance of this statement is manifold.

As he said at p 270, “a legatee does not plead his own mistake or his own ignorance but, having exhausted his remedy against the executor who has made the wrongful payment, seeks to recover money from him who has been wrongfully paid”. In relation to limitation, Lord Simonds agreed with the Court of Appeal that the claims were governed by section 20 of the 1939 Act. He added at p 277 that it was unnecessary to say anything about section 26 by way of approval or disapproval of what fell from the Court of Appeal. He observed that it was a section which presented many problems.</a></p><a name="para138">

The plaintiff brought a claim for an account and payment of money due under a contract over a period of 13 years. The defendant argued that as more than six years had passed since the initial payments were due, it followed that the claim was to that extent time-barred, under section 2(2)(a) and (7) of the 1939 Act. In response, the plaintiff relied on section 26(c), arguing that she had not known that the money that had been paid to her was less than was due under the contract, and was therefore seeking relief from the consequences of a mistake.</a></p><a name="para139">

As he noted, section 26 dealt differently with fraud and mistake. In relation to fraud, provision was made for two situations: first, where “(a) the action is based upon … fraud”, and secondly, where “(b) the right of action is concealed by … fraud”. It followed that, in cases falling within (b), the action need not be based upon fraud. In relation to mistake, on the other hand, provision was made for only one situation: where “(c) the action is for relief from the consequences of a mistake”. In the judge’s view, that wording was “carefully chosen to indicate a class of action where a mistake has been made which has had certain consequences and the plaintiff seeks to be relieved from those consequences” (p 418). No provision was made for the situation where the right of action was concealed by a mistake. In the instant case, the plaintiff’s claim was to recover money due to her under a contract. The fact that she had been unaware of the right of action by reason of a mistake was insufficient to bring her within the ambit of section 26(c). The judge expressed the opinion at p 419 that “[p]robably provision (c) applies only where the mistake is an essential ingredient of the cause of action”. He added (ibid) that it was no doubt “intended to be a narrow provision, because any wider provision would have opened too wide a door of escape from the general principle of limitation”. That reasoning, subsequently approved in <i>FII (SC) 1</i>, entailed that section 26(c) could not apply to a claim of the kind considered in <i>In re Diplock</i>, since such a claim was not based on mistake, as explained in paras 116 and 137-138 above.</a></p><a name="para140">

The bank then recovered, in a first set of proceedings, such sums as had been paid within the six years preceding the issue of its writ, on the ground that there had been a failure of consideration. In a second set of proceedings, the bank sought to recover the sums which had been paid more than six years previously, by relying on section 32(1)(c) of the 1980 Act to postpone the commencement of the limitation period. A preliminary issue arose as to (1) whether the bank had a cause of action based on mistake, and (2) if so, whether the bank could rely on section 32(1)(c).</p>

For the same reason, the leapfrog procedure was employed to bypass the Court of Appeal. Before the House of Lords, the bank sought first to establish that there was a cause of action to recover money paid under a mistake of law, and that its claim could be brought on that basis, on the footing that the payments had been made under the mistaken belief that the contracts were legally valid. In response, the local authorities did not attempt to defend the rule that money paid under a mistake of law was irrecoverable, but argued that recovery should not lie where a payment was made in accordance with a settled understanding of the law which was later changed by a judicial decision. The better course, it was argued, was to leave the law to be altered by Parliament, particularly in view of the problems arising in relation to the law of limitation. Since the Government had accepted the Law Commission’s recommendations on the issue, it would be wrong for the courts to pre-empt legislative reform. In reply, the bank accepted (as was noted at pp 362 and 391) that a payment made on the basis of a settled understanding of the law would not be made under a mistake, even if the law was later changed by a judicial decision, but argued that the law on the issue in question had not been settled prior to the House of Lords’ decision in <i>Hazell</i>.</a></p><a name="para144">

Lord Goff, in his final speech before his retirement, focused on the retrospective effect of judicial decisions. He accepted that the question whether a payment was made under a mistake was determined as at the time when the payment was made (<i>Baker v Courage</i> at p 66), and observed that “when the judges state what the law is, their decisions … have a retrospective effect” (p 378). It was because of that retrospective effect, he asserted, that it was “plain” (p 379) that a previous understanding of the law which was overturned by a judicial decision was mistaken as at the time when the payment was made. The cause of action for the recovery of money paid under such a mistake of law therefore accrued on the date when the payment was made (p 386). That was so even though Lord Goff disavowed the declaratory theory of judicial decision-making, with the consequence that the previous understanding might be regarded as having been correct as the law stood at the time of the payment: a situation which Lord Hoffmann described as a “deemed” mistake. It is unnecessary for present purposes to consider the merits of that reasoning. It was disputed by Lord Browne-Wilkinson and Lord Lloyd of Berwick, and has been criticised by a number of academic commentators (and approved by others), but is not challenged in these proceedings.</a></p><a name="para145">

In each of those events, the court’s decision had a retrospective effect: that was “an inevitable attribute of judicial decision-making” (p 379). In each event, the effect of the court’s decision was to falsify the belief or assumption which had caused the claimant to make the payment, and that was sufficient to create a restitutionary claim based on mistake.</a></p><a name="para146">

In that regard, counsel for the bank relied on the obiter dicta of the Court of Appeal in <i>In re Diplock</i>, discussed at paras 136-138 above, and argued that, even if such a claim would not have been recognised at the time when the provision was enacted, it should be construed in accordance with the “always speaking” principle of statutory interpretation (referring to <i>R v Ireland</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1997/34.html">[1998] AC 147</a>). On that basis, counsel argued that section 32(1)(c) extended to mistakes of law once the law recognised such mistakes as giving rise to a right of action. In response, counsel for the local authorities argued that section 32(1) should be construed as at the moment of its enactment, when it could only have applied to mistakes of fact. Furthermore, the language of section 32(1) was not apt to apply to mistakes of law, since the law could rarely be said to be objectively ascertainable, so as to be capable of being “discovered” with reasonable diligence.</p>

The statutory concept of “discoverability” was not discussed.

</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para149">“In my opinion, however, this verbal argument founders on the fact that the pre-existing equitable rule applied to all mistakes, whether they were mistakes of fact or mistakes of law: see eg <i>Earl Beauchamp v Winn</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpHL/1873/8.html">(1873) LR 6 HL 223</a>, 232-235 and the dicta from<i> In re Diplock</i> to which I have already referred [ie at pp 515-516].”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">By “the pre-existing equitable rule”, Lord Goff meant the rule stated in paragraph 23 of the Report of the Law Reform Commission, which he had mentioned in his speech at p 388. Paragraph 23 was cited at para 126 above. As was explained at paras 118-124 above, the rule was of limited scope, and applied where a remedy in equity corresponded to a similar remedy in law, and the statutes of limitation were applied by analogy. Contrary to Lord Goff’s observation, the rule did not apply to all mistakes, whether of fact or law. In particular, it did not apply to claims for the recovery of money on the ground that it had been paid under a mistake of law, since no such claim appears to have been recognised in equity any more than at law: see paras 110-116 above.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para150">150.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first of the authorities which Lord Goff cited, <i>Earl Beauchamp v Winn</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpHL/1873/8.html">(1873) LR 6 HL 223</a>, was a similar case to <i>Cooper v Phibbs</i>, mentioned in para 109 above. It concerned a bill seeking the equitable rescission of a contract for the exchange of property, on the ground of common mistake as to the parties’ respective rights to the properties in question. The principal issues were whether there had been a common mistake, and if so, whether relief was barred either by the impossibility of restitutio in integrum or on the ground that the appellant could readily have discovered the true position before entering into the agreement, having the relevant title deeds in his possession but having failed to read them.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para151">151.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The passage in the speech of Lord Chelmsford which Lord Goff cited was concerned with three matters. The first, as Lord Chelmsford put it at p 233, was the principle “that where a party is put upon inquiry, and by reasonable diligence he might have obtained knowledge of a fact of which he remained in ignorance, Equity would not relieve him”. The second, as it was put at p 234, was “the objection, that the mistake (if any) was one of law, and that the rule ‘Ignorantia juris neminem excusat’ applies”. In that regard, Lord Chelmsford followed <i>Cooper v Phibbs</i> in distinguishing between “ignorance of a well-known rule of law” and ignorance of the true construction of a deed. The third issue was the equitable doctrine of acquiescence. In the event, after these objections had been considered and rejected, there was held to have been no mistake. There was no discussion of the statutes of limitation, or of the equitable rule mentioned by the Law Reform Committee, or of the question whether it might have any application to mistakes of law.</a></p><a name="para151">

As was explained in para 136 above, that dictum proceeded on the hypothesis that personal claims against the wrongful recipient of property during the administration of an estate fell within the scope of section 2(7) of the 1939 Act rather than section 20. The Court of Appeal had already rejected that hypothesis, and the House of Lords also rejected it, on appeal, in <i>Ministry of Health v Simpson</i>, as explained at para 138 above. Furthermore, since the right of action with which <i>In re Diplock</i> was concerned was not based on a mistake, as explained in paras 116 and 137-138 above, it followed from the decision in <i>Phillips-Higgins v Harper</i> [1954] 1 QB 411, later endorsed in <i>FII (SC) 1</i> [2012] 2 AC 33, that it could not fall within the ambit of section 26(c) of the 1939 Act, or section 32(1)(c) of the 1980 Act: see paras 41 and 140 above.</a></p><a name="para152">

As the decision in <i>Kleinwort v Benson</i> itself illustrates, p<span style="font-family:&quot;TimesNewRomanPSMT&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">oints of law present a problem for a test of “discoverability”, if discovery requires the ascertainment of the truth. On the assumption that it did, the local authorities argued in </span><i>Kleinwort Benson</i> <span style="font-family: &quot;TimesNewRomanPSMT&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">that the test of discoverability could not be applied to mistakes of law, and that they therefore fell outside the scope of section 32(1).

It will be necessary to consider at a later point whether the underlying assumption, that the test of discoverability requires the ascertainment of the truth, is well-founded.</span></a></p><a name="para153">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“I recognise that the effect of section 32(1)(c) is that the cause of action in a case such as the present may be extended for an indefinite period of time. I realise that this consequence may not have been fully appreciated at the time when this provision was enacted, and further that the recognition of the right at common law to recover money on the ground that it was paid under a mistake of law may call for legislative reform to provide for some time limit to the right of recovery in such cases. The Law Commission may think it desirable, as a result of the decision in the present case, to give consideration to this question; indeed they may think it wise to do so as a matter of some urgency.”</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para154"><span style="font-family:&quot;TimesNewRomanPSMT&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"></span></a><a name="para155">155.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With great respect to an eminent judge, that statement suggests that some important matters were insufficiently considered. The fundamental purpose of limitation statutes is to set a time limit for the bringing of claims. As the Law Reform Committee stated at paragraph 7 of its Report, “the purpose of the statutes [of limitation] goes further than the prevention of dilatoriness; they aim at putting a certain end to litigation and at preventing the resurrection of old claims, whether there has been delay or not”. Lord Goff’s statement accepts that the result of the majority’s decision as to the effect of section 32(1)(c) is “that the cause of action in a case such as the present may be extended for an indefinite period of time”. That is also a possibility in the case of mistakes of fact, but it may be argued that the risk is potentially higher, and the consequences potentially more serious, in the case of a mistake of law arising retrospectively as a result of a judicial decision. Lord Goff’s statement that “this consequence may not have been fully appreciated at the time when this provision was enacted” lays the responsibility at Parliament’s door. But the question which the Appellate Committee should itself have considered was whether the result of its decision would be consistent with Parliament’s intention in enacting the 1980 Act. It is the duty of the court, in accordance with ordinary principles of statutory construction, to favour an interpretation of legislation which gives effect to its purpose rather than defeating it. <span style="font-family:&quot;TimesNewRomanPSMT&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Lord Goff did not, however, undertake any analysis of section 32(1), and made no attempt to give it a purposive interpretation. It will be necessary to return to this issue, after section 32(1) has been examined in the light of the decision in <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i> </span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/49.html">[2007] 1 AC 558</a><span style="font-family:&quot;TimesNewRomanPSMT&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">.</span></p>

In Lord Hoffmann’s view, there was no basis in principle for drawing such a distinction.</a></p><a name="para156"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para156"></a><a name="para157">157.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In relation to limitation, Lord Hoffmann stated at p 401:</a></p><a name="para157"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“I accept that allowing recovery for mistake of law without qualification, even taking into account the defence of change of position, may be thought to tilt the balance too far against the public interest in the security of transactions. The most obvious problem is the Limitation Act, which as presently drafted is inadequate to deal with the problem of retrospective changes in law by judicial decision. But I think that any measures to redress the balance must be a matter for the legislature. This may suggest that your Lordships should leave the whole question of the abrogation of the mistake of law rule to the legislature, so that the change in the law and the necessary qualifications can be introduced at the same time. There is obviously a strong argument for doing so, but I do not think that it should prevail over the desirability of giving in this case what your Lordships consider to be a just and principled decision.”</p> 
</a><p class="ParaNoNumber"><a name="para157">Like Lord Goff, Lord Hoffmann therefore construed section 32(1) as applying to claims for the recovery of money paid under a mistake of law, despite considering that the Act was “inadequate” to deal with the resulting problems. If that was indeed the position, then the correct conclusion to draw, consistently with the Appellate Committee’s constitutional duty to give effect to Acts of Parliament, purposively construed, was that section 32(1) did not apply to such claims. As Lord Hoffmann himself observed in <i>Johnson v Unisys Ltd</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2001/13.html">[2001] UKHL 13</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2001/13.html">[2003] AC 518</a>, para 37:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“[J]udges, in developing the law, must have regard to the policies expressed by Parliament in legislation … The development of the common law by the judges plays a subsidiary role. Their traditional function is to adapt and modernise the common law. But such developments must be consistent with legislative policy as expressed in statutes. The courts may proceed in harmony with Parliament but there should be no discord.”</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para158">158.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lord Hope of Craighead also rejected the possibility of distinguishing between different kinds of mistake of law for the purposes of the law of restitution, because of the difficulty of establishing a clear and principled approach. He identified a number of situations in which there might be said to be a mistake of law. The mistake might be caused by a failure to take advice, by omitting to examine the available information, or by misunderstanding the information which had been obtained. Or it might be due to a failure to predict correctly how the court would determine issues which were unresolved at the time of the payment, or to foresee that there was an issue which would have to be resolved by the court. Within the latter categories, there might be cases where the court overturned an established line of authority, and cases where there was no previous decision on the point. He concluded, at p 411, that it was preferable to avoid being drawn into a discussion as to whether a particular decision changed the law or was merely declaratory, since “[i]t would not be possible to lay down any hard and fast rules on this point”.</a></p><a name="para158">

More questionably, he added that the origin of the section, in paragraph 23 of the Report of the Law Revision Committee, suggested that the absence of restriction was intentional. No other member of the Appellate Committee supported that reading of the Report, and we can find no indication of such an intention in paragraph 23 or elsewhere: see in particular para 126 above.</a></p><a name="para159">

He continued, at p 417:</a></p><a name="para160"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:29.3pt;margin-bottom:26.0pt; margin-left:72.0pt">“But the distinction between mistake of fact and mistake of law as a ground for recovery is not absolute. Relief is available where the mistake of law relates to private rights: <i>Earl Beauchamp v Winn</i>, LR 6 HL 223. Private agreements made under a mistake of law may be set aside, and relief will be given in respect of payments made under such agreements. Other examples may be given where a cause of action for relief will be available although the mistake was one of law. In <i>R v Tower Hamlets London Borough Council, Ex p Chetnik Developments Ltd</i> [1988] AC 858, 874H-877C Lord Bridge of Harwich referred to a substantial line of authority showing circumstances in which the court would not permit the mistake of law rule to be invoked. These include payments made under an error of law to or by a trustee in bankruptcy as an officer of the court: <i>Ex p James, In re Condon</i> (1874) LR 9 Ch App 609. It is hard to see why in those cases the equitable rule which allows for the postponement of the limitation period should not apply, to the effect that time will not run until the claimant knew of the mistake or ought with reasonable diligence to have known of it. If the postponement can apply in these examples of mistake of law, I think that it ought to apply to mistakes of law generally.”</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para160"></a><a name="para161">161.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The authorities cited in that passage might be regarded as illustrating the fine distinctions sometimes drawn between mistakes of fact and of law, but they did not dissolve the distinction. They were not, in particular, concerned with claims for the recovery of money on the basis that it had been paid under a mistake of law. Nor were they concerned with limitation. For the reasons explained at paras 150-151 above, <i>Earl Beauchamp v Winn</i> does not in our opinion offer any guidance in relation to the application of section 32(1)(c) of the 1980 Act to claims of the kind with which <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> was concerned. Cases concerned with the recovery of payments made under an error of law to a trustee in bankruptcy as an officer of the court, such as <i>Ex p James</i>, also appear to us to have no bearing on the point. As was explained in paras 111-112 above, claims to recovery in cases of that kind were not based on mistake, and did not question that both the legal and the equitable title had passed. The case of <i>R v Tower Hamlets London Borough Council, Ex p Chetnik Developments Ltd</i> [1988] AC 858 also appears to us to offer no assistance, except in explaining the principle underlying the line of authority including <i>Ex p James</i>. It was a case in public law, concerned with the exercise of a statutory discretion to repay rates which had been paid in the absence of any liability to pay.</a></p><a name="para161">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The objection may be made that time may run on for a very long time before a mistake of law could have been discovered with reasonable diligence, especially where a judicial decision is needed to establish the mistake. It may also be said that in some cases a mistake of law may have affected a very large number of transactions, and that the potential for uncertainty is very great. But I do not think that any concerns which may exist on this ground provide a sound reason for declining to give effect to the section according to its terms. The defence of change of position will be available, and difficulties of proof are likely to increase with the passage of time. I think that the risk of widespread injustice remains to be demonstrated.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">It will be necessary to return to the points made in that passage. Like Lord Goff, Lord Hope considered (p 418) that any need for further restriction of the limitation period was best considered by the Law Commission, evincing a level of optimism about the Government’s willingness to implement Law Commission recommendations which has not been borne out by experience.</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para162"></a><a name="para163">163.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By contrast, Lord Browne-Wilkinson considered that, if the law recognised claims for the recovery of money paid under a mistake of law, including claims arising retrospectively as the result of a judicial decision, then the disruption of legal certainty resulting from the application of section 32(1)(c) would be so great that the Appellate Committee ought not to develop the law so as to recognise such claims. He observed at p 364 that “[o]n every occasion in which a higher court changed the law by judicial decision, all those who had made payments on the basis that the old law was correct (however long ago such payments were made) would have six years in which to bring a claim to recover money paid under a mistake of law”. Since all the members of the Appellate Committee accepted that this position could not be cured save by primary legislation altering the relevant limitation period, he concluded that “the correct course would be for the House to indicate that an alteration in the law is desirable but leave it to the Law Commission and Parliament to produce a satisfactory statutory change in the law which, at one and the same time, both introduces the new cause of action and also properly regulates the limitation period applicable to it”. Similar views were expressed by Lord Lloyd of Berwick (p 398).</a></p><a name="para163">

It will be necessary to return at a later point in this judgment to the question as to whether, on a proper understanding of section 32(1), the decision was correct. First, however, it is necessary to consider the construction of section 32(1), which was one of the matters examined in <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i>.</a></p><a name="para164"> 
<p class="ParaHeading">Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</p> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para164"></a><a name="para165">165.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The case of <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i> concerned legislation under which, where a company paid a dividend, it was liable to pay ACT, calculated as a proportion of the dividend, which could later be set off against its liability to pay mainstream corporation tax on its profits. The Revenue thereby obtained early payment of the tax and, in cases where the ACT exceeded the mainstream corporation tax, the payment of tax which would not otherwise have been due. Where, however, the dividend was paid to a parent company, and both the company paying the dividend and its parent were resident in the UK, a group income election could be made. The result of such an election was that the subsidiary did not pay ACT, but instead paid the appropriate amount of mainstream corporation tax when it became due. Deutsche Morgan Grenfell<i> </i>(“DMG”) was a UK subsidiary of a German parent and was therefore unable to make an election. As a result, it paid tax, in the form of ACT, earlier than it would have done if an election had been possible. In <i>Hoechst</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/EUECJ/2001/C41098.html">[2001] Ch 620</a>, the Court of Justice held that the legislation was incompatible with EU law in so far as it denied to the subsidiaries of non-UK resident parents the ability to make a group income election. That decision endorsed the opinion of the Advocate General, promulgated six months earlier.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para166">166.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A month after the Advocate General’s opinion was promulgated, and five months before the decision of the Court of Justice, DMG<i> </i>began proceedings to recover “compensation” for its early payment of the tax. Its claim was based on the proposition that it paid the tax when it did under a mistake of law, and was therefore entitled to restitution in accordance with the principle established in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i>: a principle which, it argued, applied to payments of tax as it did to other payments, notwithstanding the availability of a right to recover undue tax under the <i>Woolwich</i> principle. On the other hand, the Revenue argued that the reasoning in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> did not apply to payments of tax, and that the only common law cause of action to recover tax was that based on the decision in <i>Woolwich</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1992/TC_65_265.html">[1993] AC 70</a>. It is unnecessary for us to consider the Appellate Committee’s decision on those questions, which is not in issue in the present appeal. DMG also argued that the mistake was not discoverable until the decision in <i>Hoechst</i> (although it had begun its action before then)<i>, </i>and that section 32(1) of the 1980 Act postponed the commencement of the limitation period until then. In reply, the Revenue argued that the mistake was discovered when DMG<i> </i>learned in 1995, six years before the decision in <i>Hoechst</i>, that the relevant provisions were the subject of serious legal challenge in the <i>Hoechst</i> proceedings and might not be lawful.</p>

In considering the application of section 32(1)(c), Lord Hoffmann stated at para 31 that the “reasonable diligence” proviso depended upon the true state of affairs being there to be discovered:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In this case, however, the true state of affairs was not discoverable until the Court of Justice pronounced its judgment. One might make guesses or predictions, especially after the opinion of the Advocate General. This gave DMG sufficient confidence to issue proceedings. But they could not have discovered the truth because the truth did not yet exist. In my opinion, therefore, the mistake was not reasonably discoverable until after the judgment had been delivered.”</p>

One is that a mistake of law is a “mistake” within the meaning of section 32(1)(c), as had been held in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i>, and therefore falls within the ambit of the discoverability test. It will be necessary to return to that point. Lord Hoffmann’s statement also assumes that “discovery”, within the meaning of section 32(1), means the ascertainment of the truth, and that, as a consequence of the abandonment of the declaratory theory, judicial decisions which establish a point of law thereby bring the truth into existence for the first time. It will be necessary to examine those assumptions in the context of the dissenting speech of Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood.</a></p><a name="para168">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It is plain, as the judge recognised, that if DMG had submitted a claim for group income relief under section 247(1) the revenue would have pointed to the clear terms of the statute and rejected it. It has never been suggested that they would have conceded in a question with DMG the point which they were resisting so strongly in their litigation with Hoechst … The issue, which was one of law, was not capable of being resolved except by litigation.

It will be necessary to return to Lord Brown’s speech.

We shall then consider <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1998/38.html">[1999] 2 AC 349</a>.

It is best to consider that issue, in the light of the contrasting views of the majority and of Lord Brown, before attempting to answer the question whether such mistakes do fall within the scope of the provision, purposively construed.</p> 
<p class="ParaHeading" style="margin-left:36.0pt">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A logical paradox</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para173">173.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A paradox results from the approach adopted in <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i>, most clearly articulated by Lord Hoffmann: a claimant can be unable to discover the existence of his cause of action even after he has brought his claim: he cannot discover it until his claim succeeds. The paradox is well illustrated by the Court of Appeal’s decision in <i>FII (CA) 2</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2016/1180.html">[2017] STC 696</a>, based on the application of <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i>. As was explained in para 54 above, the court held that the decision in <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i> established that “in the case of a point of law which is being actively disputed in current litigation the true position is only discoverable, for the purpose of section 32(1)(c) of the 1980 Act, when the point has been authoritatively determined by a final court”. On that basis, the court concluded that time began to run for the test claimants only on the date when judgment was delivered in <i>FII (CJEU) 1</i>, three and a half years after they had issued their claims. The paradox is particularly striking because the test claimants were successful before the Court of Justice. Its decision confirmed that they had been correct when they issued their claim form in 2003, asserting that they had paid tax under a mistake of law. It was the Revenue who were mistaken. That result illustrates the illogicality inherent in the reasoning in<i> Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i>: the test claimants were able to identify correctly a mistake of law for the purpose of pleading a cause of action, while supposedly being unable to discover it for the purpose of the limitation period applicable to that cause of action.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para174">174.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That illogicality results from a specific difference between Lord Hoffmann’s approach to the accrual of a cause of action based on mistake, on the one hand, and his approach to the limitation period applicable to that cause of action, on the other hand. Where a payment has been made at time T1 on the basis of the law as it stood at that time, and the law is subsequently changed (as Lord Hoffmann would describe it) by a judicial decision taken at time T2, Lord Hoffmann says that the effect of the decision at T2 is that the law at T1 retrospectively becomes what it was decided to be at T2. The consequence is that the payment at T1 is retrospectively deemed to have been made under a mistake. A cause of action is therefore retrospectively deemed to have accrued at T1. However, when it comes to limitation, a different approach is adopted. The change in the law which is said to have been brought about by the decision at T2 is treated as occurring at T2, and therefore as being discoverable only at that time. Thus the mistake of law which, for the purpose of the accrual of a cause of action, is deemed to have occurred at T1, is simultaneously deemed not to have occurred at TI, but at T2, for the purpose of the law governing the discoverability of the mistake. It is because T2 occurs after the claim has been brought, and at the point when it is finally decided, that the paradox arises, that the mistake which forms the basis of the claim is not discoverable unless and until the claim succeeds. It is for the same reason that there arises the equally paradoxical result, that a limitation period applicable to the commencement of proceedings cannot begin to run until the proceedings have been completed. “Paradoxical” is indeed a generous term. One might say more candidly that this approach has consequences which are illogical and which frustrate the purpose of the legislation.</a></p><a name="para174"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para174"></a><a name="para175">175.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One possible response, arguably consistent with the abandonment of the declaratory theory, would be to argue that a “deemed” mistake is in reality no mistake at all. That is not, however, being argued in the present case. In any event, any attempt to draw a clear and principled distinction between “deemed” and actual mistakes faces real difficulties. As Lord Hope, in particular, indicated in his speech in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1998/38.html">[1999] 2 AC 349</a>, determining whether a particular decision changed the law or was merely declaratory would be a difficult exercise, not merely evidentially, but at a much deeper level. For example, when the House of Lords held in <i>Murphy v Brentwood District Council</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1991/2.html">[1991] 1 AC 398</a> that the case of <i>Anns v Merton London Borough Council</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1977/4.html">[1978] AC 728</a> had been “wrongly decided” (per Lord Keith of Kinkel at p 472), was the law changed, or was there a non-fictional sense in which the law at the time of <i>Anns</i> was other than the House of Lords had then declared it to be? Ultimately, the drawing of a line between “deemed” and actual mistakes, and even the question whether such a distinction can be drawn, depends on a theory of the nature of judicial decision-making, and indeed of the nature of law. The resultant scope for argument as to where the line should be drawn in any particular case would undermine one of the basic objectives of limitation statutes, namely to produce certainty as to the time limit for the bringing of a claim.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para176">176.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, the issue raised by Lord Hoffmann’s reasoning is not confined to “deemed” mistakes, or conditional on his rejection of the declaratory theory. Judges cannot avoid having to decide at T2 what the law was at T1, and if their decision does not reflect how the law was understood by the claimant at T1, then it will ordinarily be uncontroversial to say that the claimant was mistaken at T1. The consequence, following the decision on the law of restitution in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i>, is that a cause of action accrued at T1 if a payment was made then on the basis of the mistaken understanding, regardless of the date of T2. On the limitation side of the analysis, on the other hand, the concept of discoverability is designed to protect claimants who could not reasonably be expected to know of the existence of the circumstances giving rise to their cause of action until sometime after it accrued. It must therefore be concerned with discoverability in reality, at a date which may be later than T1. It does not, however, follow that the “discoverability” of a mistake of law, within the meaning of section 32(1), must necessarily be tied to the date of a judicial decision, ie T2. The problems identified in para 174 above suggest that tying “discoverability” to the date of a judicial decision is a mistake. It will be necessary to return to that point in the context of Lord Brown’s dissenting speech in <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/49.html">[2007] 1 AC 558</a>.</p> 
<p class="ParaHeading" style="margin-left:36.0pt">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Judicial decisions and the development of the law</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para177">177.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That thought is reinforced by other considerations. Section 32(1) applies where the claimant does not know and cannot reasonably be expected to discover a mistake which forms an essential ingredient of his cause of action. Its effect is that the limitation period commences not on the date when the cause of action accrues, but on the date when the claimant discovers, or could with reasonable diligence discover, the mistake in question. The result of that postponement of the commencement date of the limitation period is to postpone the deadline for the bringing of a claim, so that the time during which the claimant was disadvantaged by the mistake does not count against him. Lord Hoffmann’s approach, whereby the limitation period does not begin until the truth has been established by a final judicial decision, does not merely extend the limitation period to the extent necessary to overcome the disadvantage arising from the mistake, but has the remarkable consequence of excusing the claimant from the necessity of bringing a claim until he can be certain that it will succeed: indeed, until it has in fact succeeded. This places the claimant in a case based on a mistake of law in a uniquely privileged position, since other claimants are required to bring their claims at a time when they have no such guarantee: the limitation period runs alike for claims which fail as for claims which succeed.</a></p><a name="para177"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para177"></a><a name="para178">178.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the limitation period can begin to run at a time when a claim is uncertain of success, then, in addition to the logical problem discussed earlier, there is also a lack of realism in treating the date of a judicial decision authoritatively establishing the true state of the law as the earliest date when the claimant discovers, or could with reasonable diligence discover, the mistake in question. In the first place, the courts do not act on their own initiative, but only when their jurisdiction is invoked: normally, by the issuing of a claim. A point of law could often have been decided earlier, if a claim had been brought at an earlier time. Secondly, thinking about the law evolves over time. Developments in judicial thinking, in particular, do not take place in a vacuum. Judgments are the culmination of an evolution of opinion within a wider legal community, to which practitioners, universities, legal journals and the judiciary all contribute. And it is not only judges who are influenced by that evolving body of opinion. Claimants and their advisers respond to the same developments in their understanding of the state of the law, and their decisions as to whether or not worthwhile claims may exist. It is therefore possible to investigate how legal thinking on a particular question (for example, in the present case, whether the UK tax treatment of dividends received by UK-resident companies from non-resident subsidiaries was compatible with EU law) developed over time, and to ascertain, by means of evidence, the time by which a reasonably diligent person in the position of the claimant (such as, in the present case, a UK-based multi-national company) could have known of a previous mistake of law, to the extent of knowing that there was a real possibility that such a mistake had been made, and that a worthwhile claim could therefore be made on that basis. This line of thought suggests that the focus of attention under section 32(1) of the 1980 Act should not be on judicial decisions, but on the claimant’s ability to discover that he had a worthwhile claim.</a></p><a name="para178">

If section 32(1) is interpreted in accordance with <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> as applying to mistakes of law, and if those mistakes of law are not considered to be “discoverable” within the meaning of the provision until after a final judgment has been delivered, as was held in <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/49.html">[2007] 1 AC 558</a>, then the object of the limitation statute is defeated. That object is to set a time limit for the bringing of claims. That object is frustrated if the limitation period does not begin to run until the proceedings have been completed. It is true that the limitation period so set will not be completely pointless in a situation where other people have identical claims which are not being pursued in the same proceedings, since time will begin to run for the bringing of those other claims. But in more usual situations, where an individual claim is brought, or where multiple claims are brought together in a group litigation (as in <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i> itself, which was a test case in the ACT Group Litigation), this approach to limitation defeats Parliament’s purpose in enacting limitation periods. It is therefore a result which Parliament cannot have intended when it enacted the 1980 Act.</p>

He stated at para 165:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“I would hold that as soon as a paying party recognises that a worthwhile claim arises that he should not after all have made the payment and accordingly is entitled to recover it (or, as here, to compensation for the loss of its use), he has ‘discovered’ the mistake within the meaning of section 32; and, by the same token, I would hold that if he makes any further payments thereafter, they are not to be regarded as payments made under a mistake of law.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">Lord Brown thus challenged the fundamental assumption underlying the approach adopted by the majority in<i> Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i>: that “discovery”, within the meaning of section 32(1), means the ascertainment of the truth, and that a mistake of law is therefore only discoverable when the point of law in question has been authoritatively decided by a final court. On the approach which he adopted, a mistake is discovered when the claimant recognises that a worthwhile claim arises.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para181">181.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lord Brown noted that DMG<i> </i>had continued to make payments of ACT after July 1995, when they learned that Hoechst had issued proceedings, and that they had issued their own claim five months prior to the decision of the Court of Justice in <i>Hoechst</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/EUECJ/2001/C41098.html">[2001] Ch 620</a>. Referring to Lord Hope’s statement that, when DMG<i> </i>paid the ACT, “it was not then obvious that the payments might not be due”, Lord Brown commented at para 172 that he had some difficulty with that conclusion:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Surely, when DMG learned in July 1995 that there was a serious legal challenge to the legality of the ACT regime, it must then have been obvious to them that these payments might not after all be due. Of course they could not be sure and of course nothing short of a final judgment from the European Court of Justice would have persuaded the revenue to accept any claim by DMG here for group income relief. But it does not seem to me to follow that DMG paid under a mistake of law.”</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Once a plaintiff recognises that he has a worthwhile case on the facts to pursue a claim in fraud or to extend the limitation period for a particular claim because of the defendant’s deliberate concealment of a fact relevant to his cause of action, time surely then starts to run against him under section 32: he could not successfully argue that time starts running only when the court eventually comes to reject the defendant’s denial of wrongdoing and to find fraud (or, as the case may be, deliberate concealment) established.”</p>

The first which might be mentioned is the judgment of Arden LJ, with which Aldous and Robert Walker LJJ agreed, in <i>Biggs v Sottnicks</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2002/272.html">[2002] EWCA Civ 272</a>. In deciding when the appellants “could with reasonable diligence have discovered” a fraud, for the purposes of section 32(1) of the 1980 Act, her Ladyship treated the relevant date as “the correct date when the appellants’ solicitors had sufficient information in their hands for the purposes of this deceit claim” (para 62), that is to say, the date when “the appellants were in a position to plead their own case” (para 64). A similar approach was adopted in <i>Law Society v Sephton &amp; Co</i> [2004] EWHC 544 (Ch); [2004] PNLR 27, para 44, where the court proceeded on the basis of the parties’ agreement that a claimant did not discover a fraud until he had material sufficient to enable him properly to plead it.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para184">184.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reference should also be made to the judgment of Lord Hoffmann NPJ, with which the other members of the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal agreed, in <i>Peconic Industrial Development Ltd v Lau Kwok Fai</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="https://www.hklii.org/en/cases/hkcfa/2009/16">[2009] HKCFA 16</a>; [2009] WTLR 999. The case raised the question, under a legislative provision in the same terms as section 32(1) of the 1980 Act, whether the claimants could with reasonable diligence have discovered a fraud committed more than six years before proceedings were issued. Lord Hoffmann stated at para 56:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In any case, it is not necessary that [the claimants] should have known facts which put [the fraudster’s] participation in the fraud beyond all reasonable doubt. The purpose of the inquiry into whether [the claimants] could with reasonable diligence have discovered his fraud is to establish when they could reasonably have been expected to commence proceedings. For that purpose, they needed only to know facts which amounted to a prima facie case.”</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para185">185.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The approach adopted in those cases differs from that proposed by Lord Brown only in its focus on the date when the claimant (or his lawyers) had sufficient material properly to plead a claim in fraud. Lord Brown put the matter differently in paras 165 and 167 of his judgment in <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/49.html">[2007] 1 AC 558</a><i>, </i>when he treated the mistake as being discovered as soon as the claimant recognises that “a worthwhile claim arises”, or that “he has a worthwhile case … to pursue a claim”. It will be necessary to return to this point. As will be explained, Lord Brown’s approach is consistent with that adopted authoritatively in analogous contexts where fraud was not in issue, and is also in accordance with principle.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para186">186.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What is more important for present purposes, however, is that the approach adopted in these cases of fraud, like that proposed by Lord Brown for cases of mistake, treats the relevant date, for the purposes of the commencement of the limitation period, not as the date when the claimant knows or can establish the truth, but as the date when he can recognise that a worthwhile claim arises, in Lord Brown’s formulation, or can plead a statement of claim, in the formulation preferred in the fraud cases.</a></p><a name="para186">

That approach is applied, for example, to actions for damages in respect of torts causing personal injuries, by section 11 of the 1980 Act. Under section 11(4), read together with section 14(1), the limitation period generally runs from the date on which the cause of action accrued, or, if later, the date on which the person injured had knowledge that the injury was significant and was attributable to the act or omission relied on, and knowledge of the identity of the defendant. For these purposes, knowledge is defined as including “knowledge which he might reasonably have been expected to acquire” (section 14(3)). The language of these provisions differs from section 32(1) in that they refer to having knowledge, rather than discovering. But that is on its face an insubstantial difference, since discovery ordinarily refers to the acquisition of knowledge. And sections 11, 14 and 32 have the same rationale, namely that the limitation period should only run from the time when the claimant knows or could reasonably have known of the existence of his cause of action. Sections 11 and 14 are explicitly concerned with knowledge of the facts forming the cause of action, and not with their legal consequences. But the same is true of section 32(1), even in its application to mistakes of law. As is explained below, the relevant fact that has to be discovered, in that context, is the fact that the claimant made a mistake, that being an essential ingredient of his cause of action. A claimant’s ignorance of the legal consequences of the facts forming his cause of action is not something with which section 32(1) is concerned, as Lord Walker made clear in <i>FII (SC) 1</i> [2012] 2 AC 33, para 63<i> </i>(para 41 above). That is consistent with the intention of the Law Revision Committee, as was explained at para 127 above.</a></p><a name="para187">

The court held, by a majority, that knowledge did not mean knowing for certain and beyond possibility of contradiction, but that mere suspicion was not enough; that in order to amount to knowledge a belief had to be held with sufficient confidence to justify embarking on the preliminaries to issuing proceedings; and that it was, therefore, a legal impossibility for a claimant to lack knowledge for the purposes of section 14(1) at a time after he had issued his claim.</p>

Lord Wilson stated at para 6 that it was “heretical” that a claimant could escape the requirement to assert his cause of action for personal injuries within three years of its accrual “by establishing that, even after his claim was brought, he remained in a state of ignorance entirely inconsistent with it”. Lord Walker said at para 67 that he did not see how a claimant who had issued a claim form could be heard to suggest that he did not, when it was issued, have the requisite knowledge for the purposes of the 1980 Act. Lord Brown said at para 71 that “once a claimant issues his claim, it is no longer open to him to say that he still lacks the knowledge necessary … to set time running”. Lord Mance agreed, observing at para 84 that a claimant bringing proceedings necessarily asserts that he or she has a properly arguable claim.</a></p><a name="para189">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Lord Donaldson of Lymington MR gave valuable guidance in <i>Halford v Brookes</i> [1991] 1 WLR 428, 443. He noted that knowledge does not mean knowing for certain and beyond the possibility of contradiction. It means knowing with sufficient confidence to justify embarking on the preliminaries to the issue of a writ, such as submitting a claim to the proposed defendant, taking advice and collecting evidence: ‘Suspicion, particularly if it is vague and unsupported, will indeed not be enough, but reasonable belief will normally suffice.’ In other words, the claimant must know enough for it to be reasonable to begin to investigate further.”</p>

The relevant time is when the claimant knows “with sufficient confidence to justify embarking on the preliminaries to the issue of a writ”, rather than the point in time when he could plead a statement of claim. This is not the occasion on which to review the formulation used in the fraud cases, which reflects the special standards applicable to the pleading of fraud. The formulation used in <i>Halford v Brookes</i>, <i>Haward v Fawcetts</i> and <i>AB v Ministry of Defence</i> is, however, consistent with the way in which the point was expressed by Lord Brown in <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i> (para 180 above) and by Lord Walker in <i>FII (SC) 1</i> [2012] 2 AC 33 (para 48 above).</a></p><a name="para191">

The limitation period normally begins to run on the date when the cause of action accrues. It is not postponed until the claimant has consulted a solicitor, carried out investigations, and is in a position to plead a statement of claim. For example, a pedestrian who is knocked down and injured by a car while using a zebra crossing has a cause of action against the driver, which accrues on the date of the accident. It will take time before he can issue a claim: he will need to consult solicitors, and counsel may have to be instructed to draft the claim. There may be many matters which have to be investigated, and that may take time. And it may be that his claim will fail in the end, if, for example, it is found that he suddenly ran into the path of the car, or that the driver had a heart attack and lost control of the vehicle. Nevertheless, the limitation period begins to run on the date of the accident. It is not postponed until he has completed his investigations, or until he knows that his claim is guaranteed to succeed.</a></p><a name="para192">

That purpose is achieved, where the ingredients of the cause of action include his having made a mistake of law, if time runs from the point in time when he knows, or could with reasonable diligence know, that he made such a mistake “with sufficient confidence to justify embarking on the preliminaries to the issue of a writ, such as submitting a claim to the proposed defendant, taking advice and collecting evidence”; or, as Lord Brown put it in <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/49.html">[2007] 1 AC 558</a>, he discovers or could with reasonable diligence discover his mistake in the sense of recognising that a worthwhile claim arises.

It is also true that sections 14 and 14A explicitly provide that knowledge “that any acts or omissions did or did not, as a matter of law, involve negligence”, is irrelevant. They are, however, concerned with the same problem as section 32(1), namely that a cause of action can accrue before the claimant comes to know of it, and they address that problem in a similar way, by postponing the commencement of the limitation period until the claimant knew, actually or constructively, the facts on which the cause of action is based. The close connection between sections 11, 14, 14A and 32 of the 1980 Act was made clear by Lord Walker’s reasoning in <i>FII (SC) 1</i>, para 63 (para 41 above).</p>

The former line of authority proceeds on the basis that the commencement of the limitation period is postponed until the claimant knows, actually or constructively, the essential facts on which the cause of action is based, “with sufficient confidence to justify embarking on the preliminaries to the issue of a writ, such as submitting a claim to the proposed defendant, taking advice and collecting evidence”. The dissenting judgment of Lord Brown in <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i> is consistent with that approach: time does not begin to run until the claimant knows, actually or constructively, that he made a mistake (that being an essential ingredient of the cause of action), to the standard that “a worthwhile claim arises”. The latter line of authority, on the other hand, proceeds on the basis that the limitation period does not run until a court has authoritatively established that the claimant’s assertion that he made a mistake of law is true. Mistakes of law are thus treated differently from mistakes of fact, and the difficult and much criticised distinction between the two remains of crucial importance.</a></p><a name="para195">

It is in the nature of litigation that facts and law are commonly disputed. It is the function of courts to resolve those disputes. Until the court has done so, the parties can, at best, have only a reasonable belief that their assertions are correct. If a limitation period is to serve its purpose, in fixing a time within which claims must be brought, it can therefore only be concerned with beliefs, and not with the truth established by judicial decisions, whether in the proceedings in question, or in other proceedings. That is reflected in Lord Donaldson’s statement in <i>Halford v Brookes</i> [1991] 1 WLR 428, endorsed by Lord Nicholls in <i>Haward v Fawcetts</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/9.html">[2006] 1 WLR 682</a> (para 190 above) and by Lord Wilson in <i>AB v Ministry of Defence</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2012/9.html">[2013] 1 AC 78</a>, para 11<i>, </i>that “reasonable belief will normally suffice”.</p>

The Income Tax Act 1918 (and later tax statutes) contained a provision enabling additional assessments to be issued where it was “discovered” that profits chargeable to tax had been omitted from an initial assessment. In <i>Earl Beatty v Inland Revenue Comrs</i> [1953] 1 WLR 1090, the assessments under appeal were made under that provision, at a time when the Commissioners had a strong suspicion that there had been an undeclared transfer of assets by the appellant or his wife. It subsequently transpired that there had indeed been undeclared transfers, not by the appellant or his wife, but by his brother acting on his behalf. The assessments were challenged on the ground that they were not based on a “discovery” within the meaning of the legislation, since a suspicion, especially if inaccurate, did not amount to a discovery. The argument was rejected, the judge observing at p 1095:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“I think that the discovery need not be a complete and detailed or accurate discovery and that when the Commissioners find out, or think that they have found out, the existence of an omission or other error it is not necessary for them to have probed the matter to its depths or to define precisely the ground upon which they have made the assessments.”</p>

It is a formal statement of a claim made by the Commissioners and forms the basis of an inquiry into the facts in the event that it is challenged. In those circumstances, the test of “discovery” could not sensibly require that the truth had already been established. The same is true in the present context.</a></p><a name="para198">

The 1980 Act proceeds on the basis that a cause of action has accrued, without concerning itself with the question whether or not the action is well-founded. Section 32(1)(a) applies where “the action is based upon the fraud of the defendant”, and section 32(1)(c) applies where “the action is for relief from the consequences of a mistake”. If the action runs its full course, it may transpire that there was no fraud or mistake, indeed no cause of action at all. But where, at the stage of an inquiry into the defendant’s plea that the action is time-barred, the claimant relies on section 32(1)(a) or (c), the question is not whether there was in reality any fraud or mistake: that will not be established unless and until the court issues a judgment on the merits of the case. The question under section 32(1)(a) and (c) of the 1980 Act is whether, upon the assumption that there was fraud or mistake, as identified by the claimant in the way in which he pleads his case, it was discovered or could with reasonable diligence have been discovered at such a time as would render the claim time-barred.</a></p><a name="para199">

There is in reality no paradox, because at the stage of an inquiry into limitation the existence of the cause of action, and therefore the truth of the facts relied on by the claimant to establish it, is not the relevant issue. Put in general terms, the question is not whether the claimant could have established his cause of action more than six years (or whatever other limitation period might be relevant) before he issued his claim, but whether he could have commenced proceedings more than six years before he issued his claim. The existence of the constituents of the cause of action - such as fraud or mistake - as verified facts is not the issue.</a></p><a name="para201">

The situation may indeed seem bizarre until one remembers that, at the stage of an inquiry under section 11, the exercise requires the existence of the fact to be assumed. Were the action to continue, the defendant might well deny it; but he does not do so at that stage.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">It is for that reason that, contrary to the views seemingly held by Lord Hope and Lord Walker in <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/49.html">[2007] 1 AC 558</a> (paras 169 and 170 above), the fact that the defendant disputes an element of the cause of action does not mean that the commencement of the limitation period is postponed until that dispute has been resolved.</p>

Authoritative guidance on that topic was given by Millett LJ in <i>Paragon Finance plc v DB Thakerar &amp; Co</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1998/1249.html">[1999] 1 All ER 400</a>, 418:</p>

In this context the length of the applicable period of limitation is irrelevant. In the course of argument May LJ observed that reasonable diligence must be measured against some standard, but that the six-year limitation period did not provide the relevant standard. He suggested that the test was how a person carrying on a business of the relevant kind would act if he had adequate but not unlimited staff and resources and were motivated by a reasonable but not excessive sense of urgency.

In that regard, the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Molloy v Mutual Reserve Life Insurance Co</i> (1906) 94 LT 756 is particularly helpful. The plaintiff took out a life assurance policy after being told by the insurer’s agent that, under the policy, the premiums would remain at a fixed rate. When the insurer later increased the premiums, the plaintiff brought proceedings in the County Court to recover the overpayments. The County Court held, however, that the insurer was entitled under the policy to charge the increased premiums. Several years later, another policy holder brought similar proceedings in the High Court, in which he succeeded. That decision was overturned on appeal, but the Court of Appeal, and ultimately the House of Lords, held that the contract should be rescinded, and the premiums returned, on the ground of fraudulent misrepresentation. The plaintiff (in the <i>Molloy</i> case) was by then out of time to bring a common law claim for the return of his premiums, but instead brought proceedings in equity for rescission, an account of the premiums paid (as a consequence of the setting aside of the contract), and payment of the amount found due on the account. Since the claim to an account was subject by analogy to the statutory limitation period, the plaintiff sought to rely on the equitable principle allowing for its extension in a case of fraud, and argued that he had been unable to discover that he had a cause of action prior to the decision of the House of Lords.</a></p><a name="para204">

First, he pointed out that the plaintiff had known the facts which were essential to his cause of action long before the House of Lords gave its decision. The limitation period ran from the time when the plaintiff discovered the facts essential to his cause of action. It was immaterial that he did not understand their legal significance, or that it was only the decision of the House of Lords as to the construction of the policy that put that element of the cause of action beyond dispute:</a></p><a name="para206"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“First of all, it rather assumes that the point of time at which the Statute of Limitations is to run is not the time at which the plaintiff ascertains the facts, but the time when he put the true legal construction upon them. Now, I dispute that. I do not think that the policy of the Statute of Limitations is that it is not to begin to run until a person has satisfied himself as to the exact legal inferences to be drawn from a number of facts which he has perfectly ascertained. The policy of the Statute of Limitations is based on the old maxim, Expedit reipublica ut sit finis litium. Therefore the object of it was really to put an end to actions after a lapse of time. … [T]he plaintiff knew the facts, and, even although he was not able from his education and attainments to draw the proper legal inferences from them, the Statute of Limitations was not prevented from running …”</p>

The fact that he has made a mistake needs to be discoverable (in the relevant sense) with reasonable diligence, but he does not need to know that he is consequently entitled to bring a claim. As the Law Revision Committee stated, “the mere fact that a plaintiff is ignorant of his rights is not to be a ground for the extension of time” (para 126 above). That is why, on the facts of <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1998/38.html">[1999] 2 AC 349</a>, the relevant matter which needed to be discoverable was that the swaps contracts were ultra vires, as had been established in <i>Hazell</i>, and not that a cause of action lay for payments made under a mistake of law, as was established in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> itself.

To recap:</a></p><a name="para209"> 
<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">(1)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As was explained, the suggested test of discoverability is that a mistake of law is discoverable when the claimant knows, or could with reasonable diligence know, that he made such a mistake “with sufficient confidence to justify embarking on the preliminaries to the issue of a writ, such as submitting a claim to the proposed defendant, taking advice and collecting evidence”; or, as Lord Brown put it in <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i>, he discovers or could with reasonable diligence discover his mistake in the sense of recognising that a worthwhile claim arises. We do not believe that there is any difference of substance between these formulations, each of which is helpful and casts light on the other.</p>

The question is not whether the claimant <i>should</i> have discovered the mistake sooner, but whether he <i>could</i> with reasonable diligence have done so. The burden of proof is on the claimant. He must establish on the balance of probabilities that he <i>could not</i> have discovered the mistake without exceptional measures which he could not reasonably have been expected to take.</p>

For example, in cases where the claimant has made a payment on the basis of a mistaken understanding of the law which has resulted from ignorance, the mistake will normally have been discoverable immediately, by seeking legal advice. Section 32(1) only has effect where a mistake could not have been discovered at the time of the payment with the exercise of reasonable diligence. On the other hand, where the payment was made in reliance on a precedent that was subsequently overruled, or an understanding of the law that was later altered by a judicial decision, the question will be whether the claim was brought within the prescribed period beginning on the date when it was discoverable by the exercise of reasonable diligence that the basis of the payment was legally questionable, so as to give rise to a worthwhile claim to restitution. Depending on the circumstances, it may be difficult to identify a specific date, but doubtful cases can be resolved by bearing in mind that the burden of proof lies on the claimant to prove that his claim was brought within the prescribed limitation period.</a></p><a name="para210">

The focus of that evidence is likely to be upon developments in legal understanding within the relevant category of claimants and their advisers, as explained in para 178 above. Thus, in the circumstances of the present case, Lord Walker referred in <i>FII (SC) 1</i> [2012] 2 AC 33 (para 48 above) to there being a reasonable prospect that the limitation period could be deferred until the time when “a well advised multi-national group based in the UK would have had good grounds for supposing that it had a valid claim to recover ACT levied contrary to EU law”. This point is considered in greater detail in para 255 below.

In our opinion, that is the effect of the pre-1939 authorities, notwithstanding the contrary views expressed in <i>Kleinwort v Benson</i> and discussed at paras 149-152 and 159-161 above. Although there were some recognised forms of equitable relief from the consequences of mistakes of law, such as rectification, they were not subject to statutory limitation either directly or by analogy prior to 1939; and that position was preserved by the 1939 and 1980 Acts: see paras 117-118, 123, 129, 131 and 142 above.</a></p><a name="para216">

That somewhat vague expression is commonly used in connection with statutory terms which change in their connotations over time, such as “family” (<i>Fitzpatrick v Sterling Housing Association</i> Ltd </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1999/42.html">[2001] 1 AC 27</a>). The case of <i>R v Ireland</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1997/34.html">[1998] AC 147</a>, cited by counsel in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i>, was of a similar kind. The question was whether the words “bodily harm”, in the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, should be interpreted in the light of contemporary knowledge as applying to psychiatric injury. The “always speaking” principle is also invoked where the question arises whether a statutory expression should be interpreted as including a novel invention or activity which does not naturally fall within its meaning, and was not envisaged at the time of its enactment, but which may nevertheless fall within the scope of its original intention. Examples of the latter kind of case include <i>Victor Chandler International Ltd v Customs and Excise Comrs</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2000/299.html">[2000] 1 WLR 1296</a>, which concerned the question whether a teletext fell within the scope of the statutory term “document”, and <i>R (Quintavalle) v Secretary of State for Health</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2003/13.html">[2003] UKHL 13</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2003/13.html">[2003] 2 AC 687</a>, which concerned the question whether an embryo created by the novel technique of cloning, rather than by the traditional method of fertilisation, fell within the scope of the statutory expression “embryo where fertilisation is complete”. Another well-known example is the case of <i>Royal College of Nursing of the United Kingdom v Department of Health and Social Security</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1980/10.html">[1981] AC 800</a>, where the question was whether the statutory expression “a pregnancy … terminated by a registered medical practitioner” should be interpreted as including a novel technique of termination which was carried out by a nurse acting on the instructions of a medical practitioner.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para219">219.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The question in the present case is not of precisely the same kind. The cause of action recognised in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> undoubtedly falls within the scope of the language used in section 32(1)(c), if that language is given its ordinary meaning. A mistake of law was understood to be a “mistake” in 1939, and in 1980, just as much as it is today. Nevertheless, the decision taken in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> to recognise a cause of action for the recovery of money paid under a mistake of law could not have been foreseen in 1939 or 1980. The question therefore arises whether section 32(1)(c) applies to those unforeseen circumstances: a question which ultimately boils down to the same issue as arises when considering the “always speaking” principle, and indeed in all cases concerned with statutory interpretation: what is the construction of the provision which best gives effect to the policy of the statute as enacted?</a></p><a name="para219"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para219"></a><a name="para220">220.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A number of points can be made in support of a construction which would accommodate mistakes of law. First, and most importantly, the purpose of section 32(1)(c) is to postpone the commencement of the limitation period in respect of a claim for relief from the consequences of a mistake where, as a result of the mistake, the claimant could not reasonably have known of the circumstances giving rise to his cause of action at the time when it accrued. The effect of section 32(1)(c) is that the time when the claimant could not reasonably have known about those circumstances does not count towards the limitation period. Those were also the rationale and effect of the equitable rule applicable prior to 1939, and of the recommendation made in the Report of the Law Reform Committee. The equitable rule did not apply where the claimant had been aware of all the relevant circumstances at the time when his cause of action accrued and had merely been ignorant that those circumstances gave rise to a cause of action: see para 122 above. That aspect was also reflected in the Committee’s Report: see paras 126 and 127 above.</a></p><a name="para220"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para220"></a><a name="para221">221.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As we have explained, when section 32(1) was enacted, it could only have applied to claims in respect of mistakes of fact, since those were the only mistakes which gave rise to an “action … for relief from the consequences of a mistake”. However, the law subsequently developed in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> so as to allow claims to be brought for relief from the consequences of mistakes of law. That development has to be addressed in the law of limitation in a way which is consistent with the legislative policy of the 1980 Act and avoids discord in the law, as Lord Hoffmann explained in <i>Johnson v Unisys</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2001/13.html">[2003] AC 518</a> (para 157 above). In principle, it is consistent with the purpose of section 32(1)(c) for it to apply to claims brought on that basis. The rationale of section 32(1) - to postpone the commencement of the limitation period in respect of a claim for relief from the consequences of a mistake where, as a result of the mistake, the claimant could not reasonably have known of the circumstances giving rise to his cause of action at the time when it accrued - applies with equal force to a mistake of law as to a mistake of fact. To construe the provision in a sense which excluded such claims would not be consistent with Parliament’s intention to relieve claimants from the necessity of complying with the time bar which would apply in the absence of section 32(1), at a time when they could not reasonably be expected to do so. Nor would such a construction reflect the ordinary meaning of the language which Parliament used: a mistake of law is, and always was, a “mistake” in the ordinary sense of the word.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para222">222.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For similar reasons, it would not be consistent with the intention of Parliament to exclude “deemed” mistakes from the ambit of section 32(1)(c), even assuming (contrary to the conclusion reached at paras 175-176 above) that a principled and workable distinction could be drawn between “deemed” and “actual” mistakes. There would, in the first place, be no warrant in the language of the provision for drawing such a distinction; and the court cannot effectively amend the legislation under the guise of interpretation. Furthermore, to draw such a distinction would undermine the purpose of the provision: a provision which, as explained earlier, has its origins in equity. The person who has made a “deemed” mistake is no less deserving of an extension of the time permitted for bringing a claim, until he could have discovered his mistake, than a person who has made a mistake in circumstances where, on any view, the law has remained unchanged. In the latter situation, the person could at least have discovered his mistake at the time if he had consulted a lawyer.</a></p><a name="para222">

The question arose in an Australian case in relation to section 27(c) of the Limitation of Actions Act (Vic), which is materially identical to section 26(c) of the 1939 Act and section 32(1)(c) of the 1980 Act. In the case of <i>Paciocco v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd</i> [2014] FCA 35; (2014) 309 ALR 249, Gordon J held at para 365 that the concept of a mistake, within the meaning of section 27(c), included a mistake of law. On appeal, the Full Court expressed their agreement with that conclusion, obiter: [2015] FCAFC 50; (2015) 236 FCR 199, paras 192, 396 and 398. In particular, Besanko J considered the question whether the provision should be construed as what is sometimes termed a “fixed time” provision, which must be construed in the sense in which it would have been applied at the time of its enactment, or as a provision which is “always speaking” and can be given an ambulatory construction. He concluded that the latter view was to be preferred. On a further appeal to the High Court of Australia, only Nettle J considered the point, again obiter, and agreed with the views expressed in the courts below: [2016] HCA 28; (2016) 90 ALJR 835, para 374.</a></p><a name="para223">

That can be seen, for example, in the Hong Kong case of <i>Ho Kin Man v Comr of Police</i> [2012] HKCFI 1064; [2013] 1 HKC 13, and in a number of decisions of the Supreme Court of India, including <i>Assistant Engineer (D1) Ajmer Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd v Rahamatullah Khan Alias Rahamjulla</i> [2020] INSC 188.</a></p><a name="para224">

As we have explained, the reasoning in <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i> would indeed have that effect, since the mistake of law was, according to that reasoning, undiscoverable until it had been established by an authoritative judicial decision, which might not occur until the proceedings in question had been completed: a result which defeats the object of limitation. That is not, however, the effect of section 32(1)(c) if it is construed in accordance with the test proposed in <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/49.html">[2007] 1 AC 558</a> by Lord Brown, and consistently with the approach established in <i>Haward v Fawcetts</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/9.html">[2006] 1 WLR 682</a>, <i>AB v Ministry of Defence </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2012/9.html">[2013] 1 AC 78</a> and <i>Paragon Finance plc v DB Thakerar &amp; Co</i>.</p>

In that regard, it is relevant to note that mistakes of law differ from mistakes of fact in that the facts are fixed at the relevant point in time, even if they may remain undiscovered until much later, whereas the law can be altered from time to time by judicial decisions. For these reasons, it can be argued with force that to apply section 32(1)(c) to mistakes of law undermines the basic purpose of limitation statutes, namely “putting a certain end to litigation and … preventing the resurrection of old claims”, as the Law Reform Committee stated at paragraph 7 of its Report.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para228">228.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A number of points can be made in response. First, section 32(1)(c), like the equitable rule which preceded it, necessarily qualifies the certainty otherwise provided by limitation periods. It means that the 1980 Act does not pursue an unqualified goal of barring stale claims: its pursuit of that objective is tempered by an acceptance that it would be unfair for time to run against a claimant before he could reasonably be aware of the circumstances giving rise to his right of action. Even as it applies to mistakes of fact, section 32(1)(c) (like sections 14 and 14A) has the consequence that the cause of action may be extended for an indefinite period of time. The point can be illustrated by the facts of <i>In re Baronetcy of Pringle of Stichill</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKPC/2016/16.html">[2016] UKPC 16</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKPC/2016/16.html">[2016] 1 WLR 2870</a>, where DNA evidence established in 2016 that a person born in 1903 had wrongly succeeded to a title in 1919, with the effect of impugning the title inherited by successive generations of his descendants. The position would have been the same if he had been born centuries earlier.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para229">229.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly, the uncertainty which is liable to result from the application of section 32(1)(c) to mistakes of law should not be exaggerated. In most cases where a mistake of law is made, the application of section 32(1)(c) will not produce disruptive consequences. That is because the mistake will normally have been discoverable at the time of the transaction in question by the exercise of reasonable diligence, by obtaining legal advice. The commencement of the limitation period will not, therefore, be postponed. Cases where advice as to the correct state of the law was not reasonably available at the time of the transaction, and where a right to restitution might in principle be available, are likely to be unusual. One example is the class of cases where the mistake of law is the retrospective result of a judicial decision which upsets an established rule of law on the basis of which payments have been made: what Lord Hoffmann described as a “deemed” mistake. Cases of that kind should, however, be highly unusual, as courts do not often overturn established rules of law, and in considering whether to do so they attach particular importance to the security of settled transactions. The present proceedings, and the other proceedings mentioned in paras 5 and 6 above, are not however concerned with deemed mistakes but with actual mistakes arising from a unique set of circumstances: the UK’s entry into the EU, with supranational laws which had to be given priority over domestic statutes, resulting in the gradual application of the EU principles of freedom of establishment and free movement of capital in the field of taxation, and the eventual realisation that UK tax legislation might be incompatible with those principles. Such circumstances are of a wholly exceptional nature.</a></p><a name="para229">

Furthermore, it is reasonable, 22 years after the decision in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1998/38.html">[1999] 2 AC 349</a>, to note that Parliament has evinced no concern about its consequences, except in relation to tax. Recommendations for reform were made by the Law Commission in a Report published almost 20 years ago (Limitation of Actions (2001) (Law Com No 270), HC 23), and were accepted in principle by the Government in 2002 (Hansard, HL Deb, 16 July 2002, col 127 WA), but in 2009 the Government announced that reform of the law of limitation would not after all be taken forward (Hansard, HC Deb, 19 November 2009, col 13 WS).</p>

In relation to tax levied before that date, Parliament acted to mitigate the impact on public revenues in the F(No 2)A 2015 (para 56 above). That impact was further reduced, dramatically, by the decision in <i>Prudential</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2018/39.html">[2019] AC 929</a>, and will be reduced further if this court departs from <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i> and adopts instead the interpretation of section 32(1) which was explained in para 209 above.</p>

Were such claims to be made after a long lapse of time, the defence of change of position might well be available, as it has been held to be in the present proceedings (<i>FII (CA) 1</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2010/103.html">[2010] STC 1251</a>), albeit not made out on the facts because of the absence of a clear relationship between tax receipts and public expenditure (<i>FII (CA) 2</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2016/1180.html">[2017] STC 696</a>).</p>

In those cases, however, what was being rejected was an attempt to extend section 32(1)(c) to cases where mistake was not an essential ingredient of the cause of action, but where the claimant had merely been ignorant that he had a cause of action: an extension which is not being suggested in this judgment, and which would be inconsistent with the Law Reform Committee’s intention that “the mere fact that a plaintiff is ignorant of his rights is not to be a ground for the extension of time” (para 126 above).</a></p><a name="para233">

That is because, in such cases, ignorance that he made a mistake renders the claimant unaware of one of the facts giving rise to his cause of action, just as a claimant who is ignorant that he made a mistake of fact is unaware of one of the facts giving rise to a cause of action based on a mistake of fact. In neither case is the limitation period postponed merely because the claimant is ignorant of his rights. Were matters otherwise, <i>FII (SC) 1</i> could hardly have been decided as it was, since the claim based on <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> would then have been struck at just as much as the claim based on <i>Woolwich</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1992/TC_65_265.html">[1993] AC 70</a>.</p>

The principle is well illustrated by Knight Bruce LJ’s statement in <i>Stafford v Stafford</i> (1857) 1 De G &amp; J 193, 202 that “[g]enerally, when the facts are known from which a right arises, the right is presumed to be known”, and by Sir Richard Collins MR’s judgment in <i>Molloy</i> 94 LT 756 (para 206 above). As we have explained, the reforms recommended by the Law Revision Committee were not intended to impinge upon that principle. The principle is reflected in the terms of sections 14(1)(d) and 14A(9) of the 1980 Act, which specifically provide that knowledge that the relevant acts or omissions involved negligence or other breaches of duty is irrelevant. Although Parliament did not set out a corresponding provision in section 32(1), the same principle nevertheless permeates section 32(1) just as much as it does the remainder of the 1980 Act. It might be argued, on that basis, that mistakes of law fall outside the ambit of section 32(1)(c).</a></p><a name="para235">

Those are the relevant facts, as discussed in para 207 above. Once those facts are or could with reasonable diligence be discovered, the limitation period begins to run. It is not postponed because the claimant, with actual or constructive knowledge of those facts, is ignorant that they give rise to an entitlement to restitution.</a></p><a name="para236">

Nor, recalling Sir Richard Collins MR’s judgment in <i>Molloy</i>, is there any inconsistency with his statement that:</a></p><a name="para237"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“I do not think that the policy of the Statute of Limitations is that it is not to begin to run until a person has satisfied himself as to the exact legal inferences to be drawn from a number of facts which he has perfectly ascertained.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">Nor is there any contradiction of the Law Revision Committee’s statement that “the mere fact that a plaintiff is ignorant of his rights is not to be a ground for the extension of time”. The limitation period is not postponed until the claimant has discovered his rights. It is postponed until he has discovered (or could with reasonable diligence have discovered) that he made a payment at some point in the past because of a mistaken understanding of the law as it then stood.</p>

The first point to be made in response is that Parliament cannot have had the Practice Statement in mind in 1939. Nor can it bear on the interpretation of a 1939 provision which is re-enacted in a consolidation statute in 1980, since no change in meaning is taken to have been intended. The Practice Statement has to be operated within a framework established by statute, including the 1939 and 1980 Acts, rather than the Practice Statement affording guidance as to how those statutes should be interpreted.</a></p><a name="para238">

The decisions in <i>Kleinwort Benson </i>and <i>Sempra Metals</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2007/34.html">[2008] 1 AC 561</a> were exceptional in their readiness to overturn centuries of authority, as the House of Lords enthusiastically adopted the theory of unjust enrichment. Those decisions were criticised by this court in <i>Prudential</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2018/39.html">[2019] AC 929</a> at para 63 because of their disregard of the need for judicial development of the law to be justifiable by reference to existing legal principles. Normally, as was stated in a recent judgment of this court, “[i]n order to preserve legal certainty, judicial developments of the common law must … be based on established principles, building on them incrementally rather than making the more dramatic changes which are the prerogative of the legislature”: <i>R (Elgizouli) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2020/10.html">[2020] UKSC 10</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2020/10.html">[2020] 2 WLR 857</a>, para 170. Considering the Practice Statement in particular, it states specifically that the court “will bear in mind the danger of disturbing retrospectively the basis on which contracts, settlements of property, and fiscal arrangements have been entered into”. This court, like the House of Lords before it, has followed that practice.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para240">240.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thirdly, the potential problem which concerned the minority in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> is significantly alleviated if the approach to discoverability which was adopted in <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i> is departed from, as suggested above. For example, Lord Browne-Wilkinson posited at p 358 a case where the law was established by a decision of the Court of Appeal in 1930. In 1990 the claimant made a payment which was only due if the Court of Appeal decision was good law. In 1997 the House of Lords overruled the decision of the Court of Appeal. Lord Browne-Wilkinson commented at p 359:</a></p><a name="para240"> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“[A]t that date [the date of the payment] there could be no question of any mistake. It would not have been possible to issue a writ claiming restitution on the grounds of mistake of law until the 1997 decision had overruled the 1930 Court of Appeal decision. Therefore a payment which, when made, and for several years thereafter, was entirely valid and irrecoverable would subsequently become recoverable. This result would be subversive of the great public interest in the security of receipts and the closure of transactions.”</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber">Applying the approach to discoverability discussed above, however, it does not follow from the fact that the Court of Appeal decision was overruled in 1997 that it was only then that a writ could have been issued claiming restitution. The proceedings before the House of Lords, in which the decision of the Court of Appeal was challenged, must themselves have been commenced by issuing a writ some years earlier. Why could Lord Browne-Wilkinson’s hypothetical claimant not have done the same? It does not follow from the fact that the House of Lords reached its decision in 1997 that the hypothetical claimant could not have discovered his mistake before then.</p>

The circumstances which led to the rejection of that defence in the present case - the absence of any demonstrable connection between the tax paid and public expenditure - were unusual.

To construe the provision in a sense which excluded such claims would not be consistent with Parliament’s intention to relieve claimants from the necessity of complying with the time bar which would apply in the absence of section 32(1), at a time when they could not reasonably be expected to do so (para 221 above).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">(9)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A number of points can be made in answer to that argument:</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel3" style="margin-left:70.9pt;text-indent:0cm">(i)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 32(1)(c) necessarily qualifies the certainty otherwise provided by limitation periods, in recognition of the unfairness of allowing time to run against a claimant before he could reasonably be aware of the circumstances giving rise to his right of action (para 228 above).</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel3" style="margin-left:70.9pt;text-indent:0cm">(ii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, in most cases where a mistake of law is made, the application of section 32(1)(c) will not produce disruptive consequences. The correct state of the law is normally ascertainable at the time of a transaction. Cases where it is not, and where a right to restitution might in principle be available, are likely to be unusual. In particular, cases where the courts upset an established rule of law with retrospective effect, so as to affect settled transactions, should be highly unusual. The present proceedings arise from a unique set of circumstances (para 229 above).</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel3" style="margin-left:70.9pt;text-indent:0cm">(iii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The policy consequences have not prompted legislation, except in relation to tax. On the contrary, the Government has declined to implement reforms recommended by the Law Commission (para 230 above).</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel3" style="margin-left:70.9pt;text-indent:0cm">(iv)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In relation to tax, the consequences of <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> have been addressed by Parliament, and have also been mitigated by subsequent judicial decisions. They will be mitigated further if this court departs from <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i> (para 231 above).</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel3" style="margin-left:70.9pt;text-indent:0cm">(v)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Other than in relation to tax, the decision in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> has not resulted in a surge of stale claims. Were such claims to be made, a defence of change of position might well be available (para 232 above).</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">(10)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It can also be argued that section 32(1)(c) should be restrictively construed, consistently with dicta in <i>Phillips-Higgins</i> and <i>FII (SC) 1</i>. However, those cases were concerned with attempts to extend section 32(1)(c) to cases where mistake was not an essential ingredient of the cause of action, but where the claimant had merely been ignorant that he had a cause of action. Claims for the restitution of money paid under a mistake of law do not fall into that category. On the contrary, such a claim was regarded as unobjectionable in <i>FII (SC) 1</i> (para 233-234 above).</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">(11)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It can also be argued that to apply section 32(1)(c) to claims for restitution of money paid under a mistake of law contravenes the principle that ignorance of the law is not a ground for the extension of the limitation period. However, that is a mistaken view. The commencement of the limitation period is postponed while the claimant is unaware of the fact that he had a defective understanding of the law at the time when he made the payment. It is not postponed because he is ignorant that, in those circumstances, he has a right to restitution (paras 234-237 above).</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">(12)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It can also be argued that to treat mistakes of law as falling within the scope of section 32(1)(c) would undermine this court’s ability to reverse decisions of the Court of Appeal or to depart from its own decisions. The force of that argument appears to us to be diminished, however, when regard is had (a) to the importance which this court attaches in any event to legal certainty and to the security of settled transactions, (b) to the significance of adopting the approach to “discoverability” discussed above, and (c) to the importance of the defence of change of position (paras 239-241 above).</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">(13)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The claimant seeking restitution of money paid under a mistake of law does not, therefore, come within the scope of section 32(1) because he is unaware of his rights. He comes within it where, and during the period that, he is unaware that his understanding of the law at some point in the past was defective (the mistake in question being one which forms an essential element of a cause of action). He ceases to come within it at the point when he knows, or could with reasonable diligence know, that he made such a mistake “with sufficient confidence to justify embarking on the preliminaries to the issue of a writ, such as submitting a claim to the proposed defendant, taking advice and collecting evidence”; or, as Lord Brown put it in <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i>, he discovers or could with reasonable diligence discover his mistake in the sense of recognising that a worthwhile claim arises.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para243">243.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, although there is undeniable force in the argument that section 32(1)(c) should be construed as being confined to mistakes of fact, the balance of the arguments in our view favours giving the language of section 32(1)(c) its ordinary meaning, so that it is applicable also to actions for relief from the consequences of a mistake of law. That approach to the construction of the provision best gives effect to Parliament’s intention to relieve claimants from the necessity of complying with a time limit at a time when they cannot reasonably be expected to do so, and does not have unacceptable consequences for the legal certainty which the 1980 Act is primarily designed to protect. That is only so, however, if the court departs from the reasoning in <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/49.html">[2007] 1 AC 558</a>, since that reasoning would defeat Parliament’s intention. On that basis, we consider that this court should adhere to the decision in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i>, so far as relating to limitation<i>.</i></p> 
<p class="ParaHeading">The Practice Statement of 26 July 1966</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para244">244.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We must also give due weight to the importance of maintaining legal certainty by the preservation of precedent. The use of precedent, as the 1966 Practice Statement acknowledges, is an indispensable foundation upon which judges decide what the law is and apply the law in individual cases. It is, in Lord Goff’s words in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> (p 379), “the cement of legal principle” providing stability to the common law. As is well known, this court has held that the Practice Statement has effect as much as it did before the Appellate Committee in the House of Lords: <i>Austin v Southwark London Borough Council</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2010/28.html">[2010] UKSC 28</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2010/28.html">[2011] 1 AC 355</a>, para 25 per Lord Hope.

It is not a sufficient basis for this court to reverse a previous decision which it or the House of Lords has made that this court considers that a previous decision was wrong.

Some situations, such as a fundamental change in circumstances, or where a decision has resulted in unforeseen serious injustice, have been recognised as permitting a departure from precedent: <i>Rees v Darlington Memorial NHS Trust</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2003/52.html">[2003] UKHL 52</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2003/52.html">[2004] 1 AC 309</a>, para 31 per Lord Steyn.

By applying section 32(1)(c) of the 1980 Act to such claims it created the potential that a cause of action may be extended for an indefinite period of time and thereby undermine security of transactions, as each of the majority, Lord Goff, Lord Hoffmann and Lord Hope, expressly recognised (paras 154, 157 and 162 above). The minority, Lord Browne-Wilkinson and Lord Lloyd, saw this potential as a basis for leaving the proposed change of law to Parliament (para 163 above). But there has been little evidence of any surge of claims for restitution of money paid under mistakes of law. The most significant claims have been in the field of taxation, such as the various group litigations which we have mentioned in paras 5 and 6 above. Those challenges have exposed the Exchequer to claims which go back many years and involve very large sums of money. But Parliament has intervened, as we have explained, by enacting section 320 of the FA 2004 which, while ineffective to undermine claims under EU law retrospectively, has protected public revenues prospectively with effect from 8 September 2003 (paras 10 and 14 above). There is therefore no apparent danger of similarly large claims arising in future in the field of taxation which have the potential to disrupt the fiscal planning of the executive.</a></p><a name="para248">

The considerations stated there and those in para 248 above suggest to us that preserving the authority of <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> would not be contrary to principle or give rise to serious uncertainty in the law. Upholding <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> would be unlikely to give rise to serious injustice in individual cases in the future, and it would not impede the proper development of the law.</a></p><a name="para249">

Several matters are of particular relevance to the application of the Practice Statement. The decision defeats the purpose of limitation, and in so doing appears to be contrary to the intention of Parliament in enacting the 1939 and 1980 Acts. It creates incoherence in interpretation both within section 32(1) and between that section and analogous provisions of the 1980 Act. It creates the legal paradox to which we have referred (paras 173-174 above). It also perpetuates the problem of distinguishing between matters of fact and matters of law, a result which, as we have discussed, is contrary to the intended effect of <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1998/38.html">[1999] 2 AC 349</a>. In so doing, it impedes the coherent development of the law.</p>

Such claims may be made on the basis that payments have been made under a mistake of law, because the claims for restitution, which that decision supported and which led to those payments, were, on a proper understanding of the law, already subject to a limitation defence on the interpretation of section 32(1)(c) which we favour. That would be unfortunate. But we would not expect the number of claims to be significant for two reasons. First, there has not been a surge of claims for restitution of money paid under mistakes of law, following the <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> decision, outside the tax litigation to which we have referred. Secondly, the recipients of such payments made in restitution may have a defence of change of position if the payer, such as the Revenue, were to seek to recover them. We are not persuaded that the possibility of such claims should deter us from departing from <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i> in relation to discoverability if that is the only way in which to promote coherence in the law of limitation.</a></p><a name="para251">

There was then some prospect that Parliament would consider a reform of the law of limitation of actions. As we have explained (para 230 above), the Government initially accepted the Law Commission’s recommendations to reform the law of limitation and proposed to legislate, but by 2009 it had announced that it would not take forward those reforms. There is therefore now no prospect that Parliament will enact a legislative solution to remove the anomalies which the <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i> judgment has created.</p>

As was explained at para 54 above, the decision of the Court of Appeal on Issue 28 was based on the application of the approach established in <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i>. For the reasons we have explained, that approach cannot be upheld, and the appeal on Issue 28 must therefore be allowed.</p>

That depends on an examination of the evidence. As we have explained, EU law, in relation to tax regimes which discriminated between companies based in one member state and companies based in another, developed through a series of judgments of the Court of Justice, including <i>Verkooijen</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2000/C3598.html">[2000] ECR I-4071</a> (2000), <i>Lenz</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2004/C31502.html">[2004] ECR I-7063</a> (2004) and <i>Manninen</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/EUECJ/2004/C31902.html">[2005] Ch 236</a> (2004), discussed at paras 24 and 33-34 above,<i> Hoechst</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/EUECJ/2001/C41098.html">[2001] Ch 620</a> (2006) and <i>FII (CJEU) 1</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2006/C44604.html">[2012] 2 AC 436</a> (2006). Each of those judgments was itself the result of a claim made some years earlier. In <i>Hoechst</i>, for example, the claim was filed in 1995, 11 years before the judgment of the Court of Justice. DMG was aware of the claim almost immediately, and it was for that reason that, in<i> Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i>, Lord Brown considered that time began running for DMG in July 1995. But the date when the claimant became aware of another claim, and appreciated its potential implications for its own situation, is not conclusive, if a claimant acting with reasonable diligence could have discovered that it had a worthwhile claim at an earlier time. Equally, the answer to the question arising under section 32(1) does not depend upon the characteristics of the particular claimant: whether, for example, it was inclined to await further developments, and to allow other taxpayers to make the running. The standard is “could”, as Millett LJ emphasised in <i>Paragon Finance</i> (para 203 above). And the test is objective, as Millett LJ explained in the same passage of his judgment, and as Lord Walker made clear in <i>FII (SC) 1</i> [2012] 2 AC 33, when he referred (para 48 above) to the time when “a well advised multi-national group based in the UK would have had good grounds for supposing that it had a valid claim to recover ACT levied contrary to EU law”.</p>

First, we are convinced that the House of Lords was plainly wrong in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> to interpret section 32(1)(c) as extending to mistakes of law. Secondly, we do not consider that the large inroads upon the overall purpose of the Limitation Act in undermining legal certainty in relation to settled transactions, recognised by all their lordships in that case, are sufficiently addressed by the limited departure from <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Group plc v Inland Revenue Comrs</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/49.html">[2006] UKHL 49</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/49.html">[2007] 1 AC 558</a> which the majority propose. The outcome will, we fear, place a serious brake upon judicial modernisation of the common law which we are sure Parliament cannot have intended. This issue has to be confronted in this court, because the hopes of their lordships in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> that Parliament would legislate to deal with the problem have not been fulfilled. Thirdly, we have serious reservations about whether the test proposed by the majority, based upon Lord Brown’s dissenting speech in<i> Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i>, will prove to be workable in practice. It is not in our view plausible to infer that Parliament intended that section 32(1)(c) should be read as being subject to such a test.</p>

In summary, statute set out periods of limitation for claims arising at common law while generally equity applied the doctrines of laches (which included reference to statutory limitation periods in relation to equitable claims which were analogous to claims at law) and acquiescence. For the purposes of those doctrines, in certain circumstances time did not run where a claimant was labouring under a mistake until the mistake was discovered, or could with reasonable diligence have been discovered. A claim would arise at common law where money was paid to another by reason of a mistake of fact by way of an action for money had and received, which had historically been vindicated using the old form of action known as indebitatus assumpsit. The time limit for bringing such a claim was six years from the date of the payment: <i>Baker v Courage &amp; Co Ltd</i> </span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpKQB/1909/173.html">[1910] 1 KB 56</a>.

By 1939 this was a well-established rule of law. On the other hand, equity never provided relief in relation to money paid away by reason of a simple mistake, whether of law or fact, without more. Equity granted relief to vindicate certain underlying property rights, or rights arising under a trust or in relation to the execution of a will. Mistake, including in some cases a mistake of law, was just a relevant factor to be taken into account in deciding whether equity would intervene to vindicate those rights in a particular case.</span></p>

This recommendation was followed in section 26(a) and (b) of the 1939 Act (re-enacted as section 32(1)(a) and (b) of the 1980 Act), reflecting the two ways in which fraud could operate, respectively: see <i>FII (SC) 1</i>, paras 179-180 (Lord Sumption).

This recommendation was carried into the 1939 Act at section 26(c). As explained in <i>FII (SC) 1</i>, at </span><span lang="EN-US">paras 42-63 (Lord Walker) and paras 177-185 (Lord Sumption),</span><span lang="EN-US"> the LR Committee’s recommendation was limited to cases where the mistake itself gave rise to a cause of action. Given the established state of the law in 1936, this meant that the recommendation was confined to cases where a payment was made by reason of a mistake of fact. As Pearson J said in the leading case on the ambit of section 26(c), “No doubt it was intended to be a narrow provision, because any wider provision would have opened too wide a door of escape from the general principle of limitation” (<i>Phillips-Higgins v Harper</i> [1954] 1 QB 411, 419, cited with approval by Lord Sumption in <i>FII (SC) 1</i>, para 183). The LR Committee did not recommend any change in the substantive law regarding claims at common law based on mistake and did not make any recommendation which addressed the very different policy issues which would arise in respect of a claim to recover a payment based on a mistake of law. That such a claim might be recognised was something entirely outside its contemplation. Further, the LR Committee was at pains to state that “the mere fact that a plaintiff is ignorant of his rights is not to be a ground for the extension of time.</span><span lang="EN-US"> Our recommendation only extends to cases when there is a right to relief from the consequences of a mistake.</span><span lang="EN-US">” A mistake of law occurs where a claimant is ignorant of his rights. The only right to relief from the consequences of a mistake which was in the contemplation of the LR Committee was where there was a mistake of fact. It was fundamental to the approach of the LR Committee that it regarded the need to protect past payments from claims for repayment many years later by persons alleging ignorance of their rights as being satisfied by the absence of any cause of action, either in law or in equity, for repayment on the ground of mistake of law. In terms of the policy issues which arise, we consider that no sensible distinction can realistically be drawn between ignorance of the right to restitution on the ground of mistake of law and ignorance of the underlying rights which constitutes the mistake of law on which that right depends: cf para 220 above. Accordingly, with respect, we do not agree that cases of mistake of fact and cases of mistake of law can be equiparated (see para 236 above) so far as concerns the policy and effect of either the equitable rule or the recommendation of the LR Committee.</span></a></p><a name="para265">

In neither the 1939 Act nor the 1980 Act, when section 26(c) was re-enacted as section 32(1)(c), did Parliament attempt to address the distinct policy issues regarding limitation which arise when a claim is recognised for recovery of money paid under a mistake of law, as happened in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1998/38.html">[1999] 2 AC 349</a>.</p>

The Appellate Committee in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> held that it did, but proceeded on a mistaken understanding as to the state of the law prior to the enactment of the 1939 Act: paras 148-163 above. The only substantive reasoning in support of construing section 32(1)(c) as extending to claims for recovery of money paid under a mistake of law was by Lord Goff and Lord Hope. It is a remarkable feature of the case that the reasoning of all members of the Appellate Committee implicitly recognised that the effect of reading section 32(1)(c) as including claims for recovery based on mistake of law as well as mistake of fact would dramatically undermine the intention of Parliament in the 1939 Act and the 1980 Act to set out clear and readily applicable periods of limitation.</span></a></p><a name="para267">

As we understand it, Lord Reed and Lord Hodge agree that this is the fundamental issue raised by the decision in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> regarding the application of section 32(1)(c): see paras 155 and 157 above. The issue of how broadly one should construe the language of the statutory provision to cover new matters arising after its enactment necessarily involves consideration of what inferences can be drawn from the language used and the circumstances of the enactment as to Parliament’s policy intention in promulgating the provision. If the inference can be drawn that Parliament’s policy intention was broad and the new matters are aligned with that broad intention and are covered by it, a court will be justified in concluding that the provision applies; conversely, if there is not sufficient congruence between the policy issues raised by the new matters and Parliament’s intention as expressed when it enacted the provision, the provision does not apply. Since the case law on the “always speaking” doctrine addresses this question, we will make reference to it.</span> In our view, the question to be posed is whether the phrase using the term “mistake” in section 26(c) of the 1939 Act (and re-enacted in section 32(1)(c) of the 1980 Act), where in the legal context in 1939 and 1980 the word could only refer to a mistake of fact, should in the light of the change in legal doctrine made in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> now be taken to include also a mistake of law.</a></p><a name="para269">

They may also be held to do so if there can be detected a clear purpose in the legislation which can only be fulfilled if the extension is made.

The courts should be less willing to extend expressed meanings if it is clear that the Act in question was designed to be restrictive or circumscribed in its operation rather than liberal or permissive. They will be much less willing to do so where the subject matter is different in kind or dimension from that for which the legislation was passed. In any event there is one course which the courts cannot take, under the law of this country; they cannot fill gaps; they cannot by asking the question ‘What would Parliament have done in this current case - not being one in contemplation - if the facts had been before it?’ attempt themselves to supply the answer, if the answer is not to be found in the terms of the Act itself.”</span></p>

First, as a matter of general policy, in the interests of predictability, certainty and security of transactions, it re-enacted the previous six-year time limit for actions at common law for the recovery of money paid under a mistake. This was a continuation of the established policy of the Statute of Limitations of 1623 to promote finality, certainty and security of receipt of money, as emphasised by Sir Richard Collins MR in<i> </i></span></a><i><a name="_Hlk36933502">Molloy v Mutual Reserve Life Insurance Co</a></i><span lang="EN-US"> (1906) 94 LT 756, 761 (see para 206 above)</span><span lang="EN-US">. </span>It also <span lang="EN-US">represents the principal policy to which effect was given in the 1939 Act, in light of which any derogation falls to be interpreted on a restrictive basis: see paras 263-266 above.</span><span lang="EN-US"> It </span><span lang="EN-US">was in line with the general policy of the 1939 Act to enact and regulate limitation periods on a comprehensive and coherent basis.

In other words, the court considered that the policy of the 1939 Act to introduce certainty in relation to limitation was so strong that such claims were to be treated as falling within the scope of this provision.</p>

The restriction of that common law action to recovery of money paid under a mistake of fact was well established in 1939; there was no equivalent claim in equity; and there was no call at the time for the ambit of the common law action to be expanded to cover recovery of money paid under a mistake of law. Even in equity, the courts were at pains to emphasise the difference between the sort of error of law which might be relevant to a claim for equitable relief (ie error of law as to private rights, where the analogy with mistake of fact was very close: see <i>Cooper v Phibbs</i> </span><span lang="EN-US"></span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpHL/1867/10.html">(1867) LR 2 HL 149</a>, 170 per Lord Westbury<span lang="EN-US">; <i>Earl Beauchamp v Winn</i> </span><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpHL/1873/8.html">(1873) LR 6 HL 223</a>, 234 per Lord Chelmsford<span lang="EN-US">; and <i>Ministry of Health v Simpson</i> [1951] AC 251, 268-270), and error regarding general law.

The speeches in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> itself make the difference plain.

By contrast, mistake of fact is something fixed in time by reference to the facts which really were in existence at the time when the cause of action arose.

It is clear that this particular provision was designed to be restrictive and circumscribed in its operation rather than liberal or permissive, and much more circumscribed than the equitable doctrine of laches, which did not depend upon the claim in equity being founded upon mistake, in the sense of it being an integral part of the cause of action. Further, the language in section 26(c) of the 1939 Act and section 32(1)(c) of the 1980 Act of a mistake being “discovered”, or “discovered with reasonable diligence”, in the context of a common law claim, is not apt to cover a mistake of law of a general kind, to which the common law claim now extends, pursuant to <i>Kleinwort Benson</i>. That is also true in relation to mistake of law in equity, where the emphasis was always on the analogy between mistake as to private rights and mistake of fact.

This had the effect that their reasoning in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> regarding the interpretation of section 26(c) in relation to the new claim to recover money paid under a mistake of law was flawed, because they did not properly understand the limited object which Parliament sought to achieve in 1939 in enacting that provision: see para 272 above. <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> provides no other basis for applying section 26(c) of the 1939 Act and then section 32(1)(c) of the 1980 Act to mistakes of law. This flaw was compounded by their failure to appreciate that the major degree of uncertainty in the law which would be introduced by interpreting section 32(1)(c) of the 1980 Act and its predecessor section 26(c) of the 1939 Act as covering the new type of claim, which all members of the Appellate Committee identified would be the consequence, showed that such an interpretation was completely at odds with the policy and intent of both statutes.

He took that view even though he thought that would be a desirable reform of substantive law. As he said, the consequence would be that “[o]n every occasion in which a higher court changed the law by judicial decision, all those who had made payments on the basis that the old law was correct (however long ago such payments were made) would have six years in which to bring a claim to recover money paid under a mistake of law”; as a result, in his judgment “the correct course would be for the House to indicate that an alteration in the law is desirable but leave it to the Law Commission and Parliament to produce a satisfactory statutory change in the law which, at one and the same time, both introduces the new cause of action and also properly regulates the limitation period applicable to it”.</span></p>

Lord Lloyd of Berwick agreed with him. He emphasised the “intense uncertainty” which would follow from the conclusion of the majority in the case to change the substantive law, with transactions unsettled and liable to be reopened, a consequence which he viewed “with alarm”: </span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1998/38.html">[1999] 2 AC 349</a>, 397-398. In our view, however, the logical conclusion should have been that the change in the substantive law was of such a character as fell outside the policy and intent of the 1939 Act and the 1980 Act and outside the meaning of section 26(c) and section 32(1)(c) respectively, on a purposive, always speaking, construction.</p>

But if, as we think, that test cannot plausibly be said to be part of the meaning which Parliament intended section 32(1)(c) to have, we fear that their challenge is misplaced. Indeed, it is in our view revealing that such an interpretation of section 32(1)(c) did not occur to any member of the Appellate Committee, who were addressing the meaning of the provision for the first time and without any preconceptions. In any event, it does not seem to us that their proposed reading of section 32(1)(c) does adequately deal with the points made by Lord Browne-Wilkinson and Lord Lloyd. Clearly, there may be many cases where there is a long period of time, far exceeding the usual six year limitation period, between a payment being made on the basis of some settled common law rule and some later development in legal opinion which calls that rule into question to the threshold standard of discoverability which Lord Reed and Lord Hodge endorse. We consider that Lord Browne-Wilkinson’s point remains a good one. In our view, to apply section 32(1)(c) to payments made under mistake of law would give rise to levels of uncertainty which conflict with the policy objective stated by the LR Committee (see paragraph 7 of its Report) and the underlying policy of the 1939 Act and the 1980 Act as limitation statutes, and could not have been regarded by Parliament as acceptable.</span></a></p><a name="para278">

In our view, if that had been done, he would have been constrained to accept that the points he himself made showed that to treat that provision as applicable would clearly undermine the policy of the 1980 Act, with the result that section 32(1)(c) could not bear the interpretation he sought to place on it. As he said, the dramatic consequences produced by a combination of the recognition of the new cause of action in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> and an extended interpretation of section 32(1)(c) had not been appreciated at the time of the enactment (indeed, they were completely outside what was in Parliament’s contemplation when it passed both the 1939 Act and the 1980 Act), and were of such a profound character as to “call for legislative reform to provide for some time limit”, as opposed to (in practice) a wholly indefinite limit.

It clearly fell outside the policy of the Act in relation to that provision, which was addressed specifically to claims for recovery of payments made under mistake of fact. Construing the provision as referring only to such claims, and not claims for recovery of money paid under mistake of law, would serve to maintain a proper balance of the public interest in the security of transactions, which would be assured after a limitation period of six years from the date of payment.</span></a></p><a name="para281">

In our view, Lord Hope’s own account indicates why his interpretation of section 32(1)(c) is contrary to the policy of the 1980 Act, read as a whole and also specifically in relation to the provision itself. As he acknowledged, his interpretation of the provision creates very long periods before limitation could apply (and, of course, since there will be new judicial decisions in future, any of which might effect a relevant change in the law, any limitation period which appears to be closed could always be reopened to run again). The potential for uncertainty thereby created was indeed “very great”. The conclusion from this ought to be that mistake of law as a ground of recovery of money paid, in an action at common law, was never contemplated by Parliament to be capable of falling within section 32(1)(c) and that a purposive interpretation of that provision, in its statutory context, means that it cannot be construed in that way. The comparison with the position in Scotland underlines this point, for it is difficult to see why Parliament would have wished to produce such a radical difference of limitation outcome in the two jurisdictions in relation to a cause of action of a character which is equally viable and capable of vindication on both sides of the border (unlike purely equitable claims in English law).</span></a></p><a name="para283">

It can readily be seen that the language of discovery is apt in the context of a limitation statute when speaking of discovery of a mistake of fact. It is far more difficult to square it with a deemed mistake of law produced by the retrospective effect of a later judicial decision.

Since no one in that case raised the issue of whether the House of Lords in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> was right to construe section 32(1)(c) as applying to payments under a mistake of law, the members of the Appellate Committee all proceeded on the footing that it did so apply. The question therefore was when such a mistake, as produced by the retrospective effect of a court decision delivered after the payment was made, could be regarded as being capable of discovery for the purposes of the section. The majority view in <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i> was that the mistake could only be discovered when the later court decision was made. Lord Brown dissented, saying that the possibility of a mistake (ie the possibility of the reversal of the rule of law on the basis of which the claimant made a payment) would be capable of being identified before the reversal by the later court decision actually occurred and it was from when it could be discovered that the prospect of this occurring was sufficiently developed that the limitation period would run. Upon reconsideration of this point, Lord Reed and Lord Hodge prefer the solution proposed by Lord Brown. They conclude that this reflects the proper interpretation of section 32(1)(c) on a purposive approach in line with Parliament’s intention in enacting section 26(c) of the 1939 Act. That is to say, section 32(1)(c) does apply to claims for recovery of payments made under a mistake of law, but on the basis that where the mistake arises from the retrospective effect of a later court decision the mistake is to be taken to have been capable of discovery when the prospect that the law would be changed was sufficiently well developed. In this way, Lord Reed and Lord Hodge seek to develop a new argument, not set out in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i>, why the word “mistake” in the critical phrase in section 26(c) of the 1939 Act and section 32(1)(c) of the 1980 Act should be interpreted to cover claims based on mistake of law as well those based on mistake of fact, albeit that was the only type of claim to which these provisions were directed when enacted.</span></p>

Further, it seems to us, with respect, that the argument presented in support of this interpretation (see para 236(3) above) is excessively linguistic. The ordinary meaning of words, to which Lord Reed and Lord Hodge make appeal, is an inadequate tool for this process of construction, when the words in question cannot possibly have had the meaning now contended for when enacted. Instead, as set out above, the focus should be on purposive construction of the provision, arrived at in light of consideration of the policy of the limitation statutes in which it appeared and the object Parliament sought to pursue in enacting the particular provision in that context.</span></a></p><a name="para287">

It did not reflect any legislative policy adopted by or attributable to Parliament relating to the Limitation Acts. When Parliament enacted section 26(c) of the 1939 Act and section 32(1)(c) of the 1980 Act it addressed the law as it stood at the time, in which the only cases in which recovery was possible was where the payment had been made on the basis of a mistake of fact. Parliament has never addressed the distinct and difficult policy issues which arise in the context of these provisions when one moves from recovery in the case of mistake of fact to recovery in the case of mistake of law, and in our view it is not possible to assume that its policy in enacting those provisions covered the latter type of case.</span></p>

Particularly in the field of the common law, the scope for the law to be changed by judicial decision increases as time goes by and the law is perceived as no longer reflecting social values or legal policy, a gradual head of steam builds up among judges and commentators calling for it to be changed and then the courts eventually respond. </span></a><a name="_Hlk50990704">No purposive interpretation of section 26(c) of the 1939 Act and section 32(1)(c) of the 1980 Act or application of the “always speaking” doctrine could lead to the conclusion that Parliament intended, by a new provision in a Limitation Act, to open up such stale claims</a>.</p>

It was not a case about a common law claim in mistake nor about the interpretation of section 32(1)(c). We would make three points about this example. (i) The case arose in unusual circumstances and is one of the most extreme forms of mistake of fact case one can imagine. The more usual type of mistake of fact case is one where the mistake is liable to emerge after a much shorter period, by contrast with what happens in relation to mistake of law: para 290 above. (ii) It seems to us that the reasoning of Lord Hodge for the Board of the Privy Council in this case tends to demonstrate that Parliament cannot have intended section 32(1)(c) to apply in the case of mistakes of law. It involved a very late challenge to entitlement to the honour of a baronetcy in which the modern discovery of DNA and the use of DNA testing to determine parentage had the effect of unsettling the operation of various rules of law which previously would have made such a challenge very difficult indeed after the baronetcy had been held by an individual for a very long period. The particular form of claim was not one to which any limitation period had been enacted by Parliament, either in English law (para 39) or Scots law (paras 50-61). The policy concern at potential disruption of property transactions in other cases was so obvious that the Board felt that it should call attention to the lacuna in the limitation statutes (para 85). Yet the reasoning of Lord Reed and Lord Hodge in the present case would have the effect of exacerbating this problem by extending the application of section 32(1)(c) to cover mistakes of law. (iii) Most importantly, if one imagined a relevant common law claim arising from facts similar to those in the <i>Stichill Baronetcy</i> case, although it would be an unusual case it would fall squarely within the meaning which Parliament intended section 32(1)(c) to have, as involving a mistake of fact. But the question in the current case is different. It is whether a mistake of law, which has arisen only because of a change in the law long after a relevant payment was made, falls within the intention of Parliament in the legislation it enacted, even though Parliament could never have contemplated that it did. In our view, for the reasons we have given, it is not possible to draw such an inference. The unusual circumstances of the <i>Stichill Baronetcy</i> case were such as to unsettle only one transaction, the inheritance of the baronetcy, and one small set of people were interested in that question. But the extension of section 32(1)(c) to cover payments made under mistake of law will tend to unsettle whole classes of transactions, such as were governed by rules of law of general application.</p>

As was pointed out by Lord Browne-Wilkinson and Lord Lloyd in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> </span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1998/38.html">[1999] 2 AC 349</a><i> </i><span lang="EN-US">(at pp 363-364 and 393-394, respectively), it extends from situations in which rules of the common law are derived from practice and the understanding of lawyers skilled in the field, through decisions of lower courts being overturned by superior courts (a very common feature of the legal system), to this court deciding in comparatively rare cases to re-open and overturn previous decisions of itself or the House of Lords. </span>The law is often settled by a decision of the Court of Appeal, or even at first instance, as was thought to have happened in relation to floating charges in <a name="para1"><i>Siebe Gorman &amp; Co Ltd v Barclays Bank Ltd</i> [1979] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 142</a>: see <i>In re Spectrum Plus Ltd (in liquidation)</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2005/41.html">[2005] 2 AC 680</a>, paras 1-17 per Lord Nicholls. If this court (or the Court of Appeal, in the case of a first instance decision) concludes that the earlier decision is wrong, then it will overrule it, and with retrospective effect, with little scope for considering the risks to the security of settled transactions. In <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> the House of Lords departed from law which had been settled by a lower court in <i>Bilbie v Lumley</i>. Again, it seems to us that neither a<span lang="EN-US"> purposive interpretation of the relevant provisions nor the application of the “always speaking” doctrine could lead to the conclusion that Parliament intended that such uncertainty and potential for undermining the security of transactions should be introduced into the law across such a wide range of cases, least of all in a Limitation Act, the general object of which is to achieve the opposite effect: see para 271 above. The extent of the contradiction between the uncertainty created by alterations in the law made by the courts and the policy of the Limitation Acts was already great in 1939, since common law rules established by professional practice or decisions of courts up to and including the Court of Appeal could always be changed. The extent of the contradiction has been greatly increased with the 1966 Practice Statement </span>(<i>Practice Statement (Judicial Precedent)</i> [1966] 1 WLR 1234)<span lang="EN-US">, which has the effect that even rules established by the House of Lords or the Supreme Court can now be changed with retrospective effect. Therefore, in our view, the reasons why section 26(c) of the 1939 Act and section 32(1)(c) of the 1980 Act cannot be construed as applying to mistakes of law have become even stronger than they were in 1939.</span></p>

We respectfully doubt that. The court has to infer what should be regarded as the true intention of Parliament in enacting section 26(c) of the 1939 Act (and then re-enacting that provision in section 32(1)(c) of the 1980 Act) as to whether it should apply in new circumstances which Parliament did not have in its contemplation in 1939. To do that, the court has to take account of the entire impact of the new circumstances on the policy underlying Parliament’s choice to enact section 26(c) in the terms it did. It seems to us that the major transformation of the legal landscape produced by the 1966 Practice Statement and the major change in doctrine in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> both have to be brought into consideration to address that question.</span></a></p><a name="para294">

So far as that defence is concerned, we do not consider that it provides an adequate answer to the policy objections to treating section 32(1)(c) as covering mistake of law. We cannot see how the merits of an alleged change of position could be examined over intervening decades or centuries. Moreover, many public authority defendants, including the Revenue, may be unlikely in practice to be able to rely on it. The majority in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> likewise referred to the new defence of change of position as a possible answer to, or at least amelioration of, the problems of injustice and uncertainty to which their interpretation of section 32(1)(c) gave rise. However, experience, including claims in the field of tax as affected by EU law for recovery of payments made under mistakes of law dating back to 1973, has shown that this hope has not been realised.</span></a></p><a name="para295">

Thus it would be unconscionable for claimants to have time running against them when, either because they were labouring under a fraud or, because of a mistake as to the facts, they were unaware of their cause of action. The occasional claimant thus disadvantaged could rely upon the exceptional extension of the running of time. But if section 32 is applied to extend time where there has been a retrospective judicial change in the law, then every potential claimant is benefitted by the exception. By definition every potential claimant was suffering from the same deemed mistake when making the relevant payment. In the make-believe world view necessitated by the need to give retrospective effect to judicial law-making, no one knew what the law then really was on the point in issue. It seems to us that to extend the application of these provisions to this class of case goes well beyond the narrow equitable principle which was intended to apply. As we have noted, the equitable principle grew from the idea of the unconscionability of a defendant relying on his own fraud and was given a modest extension to cover individual cases of mistake of fact. By contrast, a claim based on a deemed mistake which has arisen only because of a retrospective change in the law and which affects all cases within the purview of the rule of law which is overruled lies very far indeed from any concept which could be grounded in the equitable principle which the LR Committee identified and which Parliament intended to apply to common law claims.</span></a></p><a name="para296">

Plainly, there may be a very long period when a rule of law is taken to be established by professional practice or judicial decisions before the threshold of discoverability proposed by Lord Brown to suggest it might be wrong is crossed. Accordingly, even though Lord Brown’s approach ameliorates to some degree the conflict between section 32(1)(c) and the basic object of the Limitation Acts which arises when that provision is taken to apply to mistakes of law, it does so only to a very limited and inadequate extent.</span></p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-US"><a name="para298">298.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></a></span><a name="para298"><span lang="EN-US">There are several additional reasons which reinforce our view that it is not plausible to identify Lord Brown’s interpretation of section 32(1)(c) as representing the intention of Parliament in any genuine sense, including the extended sense to which the “always speaking” doctrine refers:</span></a></p><a name="para298"> 
</a><p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt"><a name="para298"><span lang="EN-US">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The meaning which Parliament intended section 26(c) of the 1939 Act and then section 32(1)(c) of the 1980 Act to bear is clear from consideration of the context in which they were enacted. Having identified that the House of Lords in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> </span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1998/38.html">[1999] 2 AC 349</a><i> </i><span lang="EN-US">erred in departing from that meaning, it seems to us that the proper course is to correct the error by reinstating the meaning Parliament intended. In our opinion it is not appropriate for this court to devise a half-way house position which falls short of fidelity to Parliament’s intention, and which only nibbles at the edge of the problems of unlocking very stale claims to which the mistaken interpretation gives rise;</span></p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 32(1)(c) is an exception to the general object of the Limitation Act, and as such should be given a restrictive construction;</span></p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The test of discoverability proposed by Lord Brown is itself very uncertain, in a way that the test for discoverability of whether there has been a mistake as a matter of fact is not. </span>The identification of a point in time, earlier than when the relevant claim was actually launched, when such a claim became worth pursuing requires a deeply speculative process of hypothetical fact-finding. I<span lang="EN-US">t is not plausible to suppose that Parliament intended to adopt this as the criterion to be applied in a Limitation Act, ie in a statute which has the object of producing certainty by application of simple rules which also offer the prospect of resolution of disputes without the need for litigation. In any given case it may be very difficult to say whether Lord Brown’s threshold of discoverability has been crossed or not. The application of his test will often require a wide-ranging investigation at trial of something as inherently vague and intangible as the state of professional opinion as it changes year by year over what may be a very long period. It is unclear whether expert evidence would be of much assistance for such a speculative investigation into legal history. Moreover, the more one focuses on what was reasonable to expect of one claimant or particular type of claimant, as distinct from the general understanding of the legal profession, the greater the range of cases in which the court will have to produce speculative and uncertain judgments as to whether the relevant threshold of discoverability has been passed. Again, therefore, this tends to undermine the principle of certainty which Parliament and the LR Committee intended should be upheld;</span></p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US">(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the discussions in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i>, <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i> and <i>FII (SC) 1</i> demonstrate, the concept of “discoverability” becomes very strained when applied in relation to mistake of law produced by the retrospective application of a later judicial decision which changes the law. It has to be taken to a very rarefied and abstract level to adapt it to apply in such a case. It is an odd kind of discoverability when the thing being discovered, or revealing the supposed mistake, has not yet happened when the relevant payment is made. It is not plausible to suppose that Parliament intended the Limitation Act to operate on this basis. The analogy with mistake of fact is not at all persuasive: see para 274(i) above. In the case of an alleged mistake of fact, the fact either has or has not occurred; its occurrence does not depend upon retrospective effects of judicial acts in the future;</span></p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US">(v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is no comfort that in those cases where the law has not changed section 32(1)(c) is unlikely to cause limitation difficulties, because the true law will usually have been reasonably discoverable by taking legal advice. This just indicates that the reality is that there is only practical scope for section 32(1)(c) to have an effect when the law is changed retrospectively by judicial decision, so Parliament’s intention as to its meaning and effect should properly be tested by reference to that class of case;</span></p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US">(vi)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The interpretation of section 32(1)(c) proposed by Lord Brown produces arbitrary and unfair distinctions which we do not consider Parliament can have intended to be drawn. </span>Claimants who are by a retrospective change in the law enabled for the first time to make a claim in contract or in tort get no benefit at all from the provision. They must bring their claim within the primary limitation period running from the date when they first had a cause of action. This is because their claim will not be based upon mistake of law, as an essential element in the cause of action, which is all that section 32(1)(c) applies to. Nonetheless a deemed mistake of law occurring in this way may well be the reason why they did not claim sooner.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-US"><a name="para299">299.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></a></span><a name="para299"><span lang="EN-US">Our conclusion regarding the proper interpretation of section 32(1)(c) would open the door to a departure from <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> </span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1998/38.html">[1999] 2 AC 349</a> <span lang="EN-US">on that issue under the 1966 Practice Statement. In our view, it would be appropriate for the Practice Statement to be applied to restore the proper interpretation of section 32(1)(c) which we consider Parliament intended, as set out above. We express our views shortly, as we are in a minority so far as concerns reversing <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> by construing “mistake” in section 32(1)(c) to mean only a mistake of fact, in accordance with the law as it stood in 1939 and 1980.</span></p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-US"><a name="para300">300.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></a></span><a name="para300"><span lang="EN-US">In our judgment,</span> for the reasons we have set out, the decision in <i>Kleinwort Benson </i>that section 32(1)(c) applies to mistakes of law was wrong for reasons of much greater solidity and significance than a mere intellectual difference of opinion. The reasoning in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> is in our respectful view gravely undermined by an underlying view of the equitable antecedents to what is now section 32(1) which cannot be squared with previous authority and by an apparent failure to weigh in the balance how serious a departure from the overall policy of the 1980 Act is involved in a conclusion that section 32(1)(c) does apply to claims based upon a mistake of law. Furthermore the readiness of the House of Lords in both <i>Kleinwort Benson </i>and<i> Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i> to acknowledge common law claims based on mistake of law where settled law had been changed with retrospective effect, and that section 32(1)(c) applied to such claims, was heavily based upon a hope that Parliament would remedy the unsatisfactory consequences, a hope which has now clearly been shown to have been misplaced, save to a limited degree in relation to tax.</a></p><a name="para300">

As the Practice Statement says, in deciding whether it is right to depart from a previous decision of the House of Lords (or, now, this court) the court “will bear in mind the danger of disturbing retrospectively the basis on which contracts, settlements of property and fiscal arrangements have been entered into …”. The greater the degree of such disruption, the less will it be regarded as acceptable for the court to change the law for the future. It is possible that some past transactions might be unsettled by changing the interpretation of section 32(1)(c) adopted in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i>; however, for the reasons we have explained, the application of section 32(1)(c) to cases of mistake of law will unsettle past transactions and will generate such uncertainty to a very much greater degree. Changes in the law produced by higher courts reversing decisions of lower courts or correcting professional practice are commonplace. The period of time before such a decision is produced, and in which parties will have entered transactions on the basis of the previous understanding of the law, may be very long.</span></a></p><a name="para301"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para301"></a><a name="para302">302.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, this open-ended prospect of unravelling past transactions without limit of time is likely to act as a very serious and chilling constraint upon any departure from an earlier decision by the House of Lords or this court under the 1966 Practice Statement. The older the decision from which departure is being considered, the greater the peril to settled transactions, and the greater the difficulty which this court will face in assessing whether that peril is sufficient to prohibit an otherwise worthwhile change. The speeches of Lord Browne-Wilkinson and Lord Lloyd in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1998/38.html">[1999] 2 AC 349</a> illustrate this point. Absent their concerns about the absence of an effective limitation cut-off, they would both have wished to support the substantive change in the law of unjust enrichment produced by the majority. The new circumstances in which the proper interpretation of section 32(1)(c) falls to be assessed as a statutory provision which is “always speaking” include not just the change in the law in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> but the change in the practice of the House of Lords effected by the 1966 Practice Statement. Parliament cannot have intended that section 32(1)(c) should have the practical effect of acting as a serious impediment to desirable judicial modernisation of the common law pursuant to the 1966 Practice Statement.</p> 
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para303">303.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, it is our view that correction of the wrong turn taken in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> regarding the true interpretation of section 32(1)(c) is justified pursuant to the Practice Statement. It would tend to reduce, rather than promote, insecurity of transactions across time. It would also secure the ability of this court to review and amend substantive legal doctrine in the interests of promoting doctrinal coherence and keeping the law broadly in line with changing social expectations and values.</a></p><a name="para303"> 
</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para303"><span lang="EN-US"></span></a><a name="para304">304.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang="EN-US">Finally, since our view regarding the proper interpretation of section 32(1)(c) is not accepted by Lord Reed and Lord Hodge and the majority in the court, we address the position which arises under the Practice Statement if their interpretation of section 32(1)(c) prevails, as it does. On their interpretation, there is still considerable scope for uncertainty in the law to arise and unsettle transactions dating far back in time. Their interpretation, following Lord Brown’s approach in <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i> </span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/49.html">[2007] 1 AC 558</a><span lang="EN-US">, is also productive of a degree of uncertainty because of the test of discoverability of a mistake which they say should apply. To that extent, therefore, it seems to us that the argument for applying the Practice Statement in relation to both <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> and <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i> is weakened. Nonetheless, we consider that their interpretative approach better reflects the legislative purpose in the context of the Limitation Act of securing a degree of certainty in relation to past transactions than does that of the majority in <i>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</i> </span><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/49.html">[2007] 1 AC 558</a> <span lang="EN-US">and the approach which the Appellate Committee in <i>Kleinwort Benson</i> assumed would apply. Therefore, on the footing that the interpretation of section 32(1)(c) preferred by Lord Reed and Lord Hodge must be accepted, we agree that it is appropriate to apply the Practice Statement in relation to those decisions and in favour of now adopting their interpretation.</span></p> </div>
