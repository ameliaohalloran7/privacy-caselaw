</span>This case is about the employment status of district judges, but it
could apply to the holder of any judicial office. The issue is whether a district
judge qualifies as a “worker” or a “person in Crown employment” for the purpose
of the protection given to whistle-blowers under Part IVA of the Employment
Rights Act 1996 (“the 1996 Act”). If a district judge does not on the face of
it qualify for whistle-blower protection, the further question is whether this
is discrimination against her in the enjoyment of her right to freedom of
expression under the European Convention on Human Rights. And if it is, what is
the remedy?</a></p><a name="para1">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The appellant was appointed a district
judge by the then Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, with effect from
6 February 2006. Under section 6 of the County Courts Act 1984, as it then
stood, district judges were appointed by the Lord Chancellor. As it now stands,
they are appointed by Her Majesty the Queen on the recommendation of the Lord
Chancellor. In October 2005, the appellant had been sent a letter offering her
appointment which talked in terms of her accepting that offer. The letter
itself contained several stipulations as to the duration of her appointment,
her salary, her pension on retirement, and other matters. Enclosed with the
letter was a memorandum entitled “District Judges - Memorandum on conditions of
employment and terms of service”. This was a detailed document, which included
terms as to sitting days, sick pay, maternity, paternity and adoption leave,
training, the prohibition of legal practice, relations with the press and
media, outside activities, and much more. The memorandum made it clear that the
salary was taxed under Schedule E to the Income Tax Act and that the judge was
an employed earner for the purpose of national insurance contributions.
Although described as a “life-time” appointment, a judge is required to vacate
office on her 70th birthday (unless extended) and can resign before that date.
The appellant’s Instrument of Appointment, signed by the Lord Chancellor on 27
January 2006, simply talked in terms of his approving her to sit at each of the
county courts on the Wales and Chester circuit.</span></a></p><a name="para4">

Crewe County Court and in 2009 transferred to the Warrington County Court. In 2010,
the Cheshire courts were transferred to the Northern Circuit and major cost
cutting reforms were announced. In 2011, the Runcorn County Court was closed
and the business transferred to Warrington, as were some tribunal sittings. The
appellant raised a number of concerns relating to the cuts, in particular about
the lack of appropriate and secure court room accommodation, the severely
increased workload placed upon the district judges, and administrative
failures. She raised these with the local leadership judges and senior managers
in Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service and eventually in a formal
grievance.</span></a></p><a name="para5">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">She claims that her complaints
fell within the definition of “qualifying disclosures” under section 43B of the
1996 Act, in particular as tending to show a failure to comply with legal
obligations, that miscarriages of justice were likely, or that the health and
safety of any individual had been, is being or is likely to be endangered. The
disclosures were made to an employer or other responsible person within the
meaning of section 43C of the 1996 Act and thus they were “protected
disclosures” within the meaning of section 43A.</span></a></p><a name="para6">

Act, a worker has the right “not to be subjected to any detriment by any act,
or any deliberate failure to act, by his employer done on the ground that the
worker has made a protected disclosure”. The appellant claims that she was
subjected to a number of detriments as a result of her complaints: a
significant delay in investigating her grievance; being seriously bullied,
ignored and undermined by her fellow judges and court staff; being informed
that her workload and concerns were simply a “personal working style choice”;
and inadequate steps to support her in returning to work; she also claims that
a severe degradation in her health, resulting in psychiatric injury and a
disability under the Equality Act 2010, was such a detriment. The appellant was
signed off work due to stress from the end of January 2013 but has recently
returned.</span></a></p><a name="para7">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In February 2015 the appellant
made a two-part claim in the Employment Tribunal. Both parts of her claim
depended upon her being a “worker” within the meaning of section 230(3) of the
1996 Act (or having the same protection as such a worker). One part of her claim
was for disability discrimination under the Equality Act 2010, as a result of
failure to make reasonable adjustments to cater for her disability. This claim
is derived from European Union law. It is therefore accepted that, as a result
of the decision of this court in <i>O’Brien v Ministry of Justice (formerly
Department for Constitutional Affairs) </i></span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2013/6.html">[2013] UKSC 6</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2013/6.html">[2013] 1 WLR 522</a>, in
the light of the guidance given by the Court of Justice of the European Union
in ((Case C-393/10) <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2012/C39310.html">[2012] ICR 955</a>), a judge is a “worker” for the purpose of
European Union law and national law has to be interpreted in conformity with
that. That case concerned discrimination against part-time workers, but the
same result was reached by the Court of Appeal for Northern Ireland in <i>Perceval-Price
v Department of Economic Development </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/nie/cases/NICA/2000/9.html">[2000] IRLR 380</a>, that tribunal judges
were “workers” for the purpose of discrimination on grounds of sex. Hence the
disability discrimination claim will continue in any event.</p>

</span></a></span><a name="para9"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The other part of her claim was
under the “whistle-blowing” provisions in Part IVA of the 1996 Act, inserted by
the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998. These provisions are not derived from
European Union law and accordingly the definition of “worker” does not have to
be read so as to conform to the requirements of EU law. This means that a judge
may have a different status in employment law, depending upon whether or not
the employment right in question is derived from EU law.</span></a></p><a name="para9">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In relation to the whistle-blowing
claim, the Ministry of Justice objected that the appellant was not a “worker”
as defined by section 230(3)(b) of the 1996 Act. At a preliminary hearing, the
Employment Tribunal judge held that she was not a worker, that accordingly she
had no protection against infringement of her right to freedom of expression
under article 10 of the ECHR, but that it was not possible to read or give
effect to section 230(3)(b) so as to give her that protection. The Employment
Appeal Tribunal also held that she was not a worker, but found that there were
adequate safeguards in place to protect freedom of speech for judges and there
was therefore no need to read section 230(3)(b) so as to bring a judge within
it, but that in any event it was not possible to do so: </span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKEAT/2016/0087_16_3110.html">[2017] ICR 404</a>. The
Court of Appeal also held that the appellant was not a “worker”. The appellant
was permitted also to raise for the first time the argument that denying her
whistle-blowing protection was discrimination in the enjoyment of her right to
freedom of expression and thus contrary to article 14 of the ECHR read with
article 10. But she failed in that too: <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2017/2220.html">[2018] ICR 827</a>.</p>

appellant continues to argue that she is a “worker” within the meaning of
section 230(3)(b) of the 1996 Act. She also raises for the first time a new
argument, that she is in “Crown employment” within the meaning of section 191
of the 1996 Act. If she fails in each of those, she continues to argue that her
exclusion from whistle-blowing protection is a breach, either of her rights
under article 10 or under article 14 read with article 10 of the ECHR and that
either section 230(3)(b) or section 191 of the 1996 Act should be read and
given effect so as to bring her within that protection.</span></a></p><a name="para11">

<p class="ParaHeading">Is a judge a “worker”?</p>

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">It is not in dispute that a judge
undertakes personally to perform work or services and that the recipient of
that work or services is not a client or customer of the judge. The issue is
whether that work or services is performed pursuant to a contract with the
recipient of that work or services or pursuant to some different legal
arrangement. Nor is it in dispute that judges hold a statutory office. In broad
terms, an office has been defined (by Lord Atkin in <i>McMillan v Guest </i>[1942]
AC 561, 564) as a “subsisting, permanent, substantive position which had an
existence independent of the person who filled it, and which went on and was
filled in succession by successive holders”. Office-holders do not necessarily
hold office pursuant to any kind of contract. As Lord Hoffmann explained in <i>Percy
v Board of National Mission of the Church of Scotland </i></span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2005/73.html">[2005] UKHL 73</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2005/73.html">[2006] 2 AC 28</a>, para 54:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The distinction in law between an
employee, who enters into a contract with an employer, and an office-holder,
who has no employer but holds his position subject to rules dealing with such
matters as his duties, the terms of his office, the circumstances in which he
may be removed and his entitlement to remuneration, is well established and
understood. One of the oldest offices known to law is that of constable. It is
notorious that a constable has no employer. It required special provision in
[section 17 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975] to bring the office of
constable within the terms of the Act and to deem the chief constable to be his
employer. But there are many other examples of offices; public, ecclesiastical
and private.”</p>

</span></a></span><a name="para13"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">However, it is also well
established that an office-holder may hold that office under a contract with
the person or body for whom he undertakes to perform work or services. The
obvious example is a director of a company, who may hold that office
concurrently with a service contract. <i>Percy</i> itself was another example.
Ms Percy was an ordained minister of the Church of Scotland who was appointed
associate minister to a particular parish. This was undoubtedly an
ecclesiastical office, but the House of Lords held, by a majority, that she
also had a contract personally to execute work, thus enabling her to bring a
claim for sex discrimination against the Board of Mission which had appointed
her.</span></a></p><a name="para13">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">It might be thought that there is
a distinction between private or ecclesiastical offices, on the one hand, and
public or statutory offices, on the other, and that the former may be held
concurrently with a contract whereas the latter may not. After all, before the
introduction of modern protection from unfair dismissal, public and statutory
office-holders might be better protected than others, under the line of cases
beginning with <i>Ridge v Baldwin </i></span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1963/2.html">[1964] AC 40</a>. However, in <i>Miles v
Wakefield Metropolitan District Council </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1987/15.html">[1987] AC 539</a>, which concerned the
statutory office of superintendent registrar of births, deaths and marriages,
Lord Oliver of Aylmerton, at p 567, questioned “whether the mere fact that the
plaintiff was appointed to his office under the provisions of the [Registration
Service Act 1953] necessarily precludes the existence of a parallel contract
between him and the council for the carrying out of his statutory duties”.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As this court held in <i>Preston (formerly Moore) v President of the
Methodist Conference </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2013/29.html">[2013] 2 AC 163</a>, whether an office-holder holds office
under a legally binding contract depends upon the intentions of the parties: “The
mere fact that the arrangement includes the payment of a stipend, the provision
of accommodation and recognised duties to be performed by the minister, does
not without more resolve the issue. The question is whether the parties
intended these benefits and burdens of the ministry to be the subject of a
legally binding agreement between them” (Lord Sumption, para 26). Earlier, when
commenting on the <i>Percy</i> case, he had explained that “The primary
considerations are the manner in which the minister was engaged, and the
character of the rules governing his or her service. But, as with all exercises
in contractual construction, these documents and any other admissible evidence
of the parties’ intentions fall to be construed against their factual
background” (para 10). Part of the background in that case was the spiritual
purpose of the functions of a minister of religion, although it had been
established in <i>Percy</i> that there was no presumption against the
contractual character of their service. In <i>Preston</i>, there was no
difference between the majority, led by Lord Sumption, and me, the sole
dissenter, as to the nature of the exercise upon which we were engaged: we
differed only in our interpretation of the facts.</p>

</span></a></span><a name="para16"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">It is clear, therefore, what the
question is: did the parties intend to enter into a contractual relationship,
defined at least in part by their agreement, or some other legal relationship,
defined by the terms of the statutory office of district judge? In answering
this question, it is necessary to look at the manner in which the judge was
engaged, the source and character of the rules governing her service, and the
overall context, but this is not an exhaustive list.</span></a></p><a name="para16">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In looking at the manner in which
the judge was engaged, it could be said that there was classic offer and
acceptance: there was a letter offering appointment, upon the terms and
conditions set out in the letter and accompanying memorandum, which the
appellant was invited to accept and did accept. However, the manner of
appointment is laid down in statute: under section 6 of the County Courts Act
1984, district judges are now appointed by Her Majesty on the recommendation of
the Lord Chancellor; but under the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, the whole
process of selection is in the hands of the Judicial Appointments Commission,
applying the criteria laid down in that Act. Furthermore, there was nothing in
the letter offering appointment or in the accompanying memorandum which was
expressed in contractual terms: indeed, some provisions were expressed in terms
of what the Lord Chancellor expected or regarded as essential rather than as
contractually binding obligations.</span></a></p><a name="para17">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In looking at the content of the
relationship, it could be said that the terms and conditions contained some
provisions, for example, those relating to maternity and paternity and adoption
leave, which are not derived from statute. It could also be said that
deployment decisions, as in any other employment, may be the subject of some
negotiation between the individual judge and the leadership judges in her area;
but ultimately the Lord Chief Justice is responsible for the deployment of judges.
The essential components of the relationship are derived from statute and are
not a matter of choice or negotiation between the parties. Under section 6(5)
of the 1984 Act, a district judge is to be paid such salary as the Lord
Chancellor may determine with the concurrence of the Treasury, but this cannot
later be reduced; nor, of course, can it be increased by individual
negotiation, as opposed to later determination of what the remuneration for
that office is to be. Judicial pensions are also governed by statute and are
not a matter of individual negotiation. Under section 11 of the 1984 Act, district
judges must leave office on reaching the age of 70 (with the possibility of
extension thereafter); otherwise they hold office during good behaviour and may
only be removed for misbehaviour or inability to perform the duties of the
office by the Lord Chancellor with the concurrence of the Lord Chief Justice;
disciplinary proceedings against them are governed by the Judicial Discipline
(Prescribed Procedures) Regulations 2014 (SI 2014/1919).</span></a></p><a name="para18">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">It is also noteworthy that the
appellant had difficulty in identifying her employer. These proceedings were
brought against the Ministry of Justice. However, the appellant was in fact
appointed by the then Lord Chancellor, while later district judges are
appointed by Her Majesty the Queen. Responsibility for the judiciary is in fact
divided between the Lord Chancellor, as a Minister of the Crown, and the Lord
Chief Justice, as Head of the Judiciary. Many of the matters of which the
appellant complained related to deployment and workload and many of her
complaints were directed towards the local leadership judges, although some
were directed to senior officials in Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals
Service. This fragmentation of responsibility has both statutory and
constitutional foundations and highlights how different is the position of a judge
from that of a worker employed under a contract with a particular employer.</span></a></p><a name="para19">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Finally, and related to that,
there is the constitutional context. Fundamental to the constitution of the
United Kingdom is the separation of powers: the judiciary is a branch of
government separate from and independent of both Parliament and the executive.
While by itself this would not preclude the formation of a contract between a
Minister of the Crown and a member of the judiciary, it is a factor which tells
against the contention that either of them intended to enter into a contractual
relationship.</span></a></p><a name="para20">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Taken together, all of these
factors point against the existence of a contractual relationship between a judge
and the executive or any member of it. Still less do they suggest a contractual
relationship between the judge and the Lord Chief Justice.</span></a></p><a name="para21">

</span>Section 191(1) of the 1996 Act provides that </a></p><a name="para22">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Subject to section 192 and 193,
the provisions of this Act to which this section applies shall have effect in
relation to Crown employment and persons in Crown employment as they have
effect in relation to other employment and other employees or workers.”</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:26.0pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Included among the provisions to which the section
applies, in section 191(2)(aa), is Part IVA. There is a debate about whether
including judges within “Crown employment” would bring with it all the listed
protections given to employees and workers or only those given to “limb (b)”
workers. Fortunately, it is not necessary for us to resolve that debate in
order to decide this case.</span></p>

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Section 191(3) provides that “In
this Act, ‘Crown employment’ means employment under or for the purposes of a
government department or any officer or body exercising on behalf of the Crown
functions conferred by a statutory provision”. Clearly, “employment” in this
section cannot mean “employment under a contract” because it would then add
nothing to the definition in section 230(3). The predecessor to section 191 was
inserted into the Industrial Relations Act 1971 because historically Crown
servants had not been seen to be employed under contracts of service and had
not been able to complain of wrongful dismissal. The object was to enable them
to complain of unfair dismissal and enjoy the other employment rights listed in
section 191(2). Thus, argues the appellant, section 191 is apt to give her the
protection of Part IVA even if she is not employed under a contract.</span></a></p><a name="para23">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The definition in section 191(3)
has two limbs: employment under or for the purposes of a government department;
and employment under or for the purposes of an officer or body exercising on
behalf of the Crown functions conferred by a statutory provision. For the
reasons given earlier, it is impossible to regard the judiciary as employed
under or for the purposes of the Ministry of Justice. They are not civil
servants or the equivalent of civil servants. They do not work for the ministry.
It is slightly more plausible to regard them as working under or for the purposes
of the Lord Chief Justice, who since the 2005 Act has had statutory
responsibilities in relation to the judiciary: under section 7 of that Act, he
is responsible for the maintenance of appropriate arrangements for the welfare,
training and guidance of the judiciary of England and Wales (within the
resources provided by the Lord Chancellor) and for their deployment and the
allocation of work within the courts. As already noted, he also shares some
responsibility for appointments, discipline and removal with the Lord
Chancellor. But it is difficult to think that, by conferring these functions
upon the Lord Chief Justice, the 2005 Act brought about such a fundamental
change in the application of section 191. Judges do not work “under and for the
purposes of” those functions of the Lord Chief Justice but for the
administration of justice in the courts of England and Wales in accordance with
their oaths of office. <i>Mutatis mutandis</i>, the same reasoning would apply
to the identical definition of crown employment in article 236(3) of the
Employment Rights (Northern Ireland) Order 1996.</span></a></p><a name="para24">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">It is perhaps worth noting that
section 83(2) and (9) of the Equality Act 2010, passed since the 2005 Act,
defines “employment” as covering “Crown employment” as defined in section 191
of the 1996 Act. But it also makes express provision, in sections 50 and 51,
prohibiting discrimination in relation to, among other things, appointment to
public offices. These are defined to include officers appointed by or on the
recommendation of a member of the executive (such as the Lord Chancellor) or by
the Lord Chief Justice or Senior President of Tribunals. Thus judicial office-holders
are clearly protected by these provisions, which would have been quite
unnecessary had they already been protected as persons in Crown employment.
Sections 50 and 51 do not apply in Northern Ireland, but this does not affect
the force of this point.</span></a></p><a name="para25">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The appellant first argued that
the failure to extend the 1996 Act’s protection against whistle-blowing to
judicial officers was a violation of her right to freedom of expression under
article 10 of the ECHR. It is indeed possible to see that imposing certain
detriments upon her as a result of her public interest disclosures would be an
interference with her freedom of expression. It is not enough to say that
judges are well protected against dismissal and other disciplinary action if
they speak their minds. They are not so well protected against the sort of
detriments which are complained about in this case - bullying, victimisation
and failure to take seriously the complaints which she was making.</span></a></p><a name="para26">

</span>Be that as it may, however, there is a remedy for breach of the
Convention rights, by way of an action under section 7(1) of the Human Rights
Act 1998, which can result in an award of damages, if this is necessary to
afford just satisfaction for the wrong done. But this would not have the effect
of extending the specific protection of Part IVA of the 1996 Act to judicial or
indeed other non-contractual office-holders. It would not enable the appellant
to pursue the claim which she has made in the Employment Tribunal.</a></p><a name="para27">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellant also complains that the failure to extend the protection
of Part IVA to judicial office-holders is a violation of her rights under
article 14 of the ECHR read with article 10. Article 14, it will be recalled,
reads:</a></p><a name="para28">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The enjoyment of the rights and
freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination
on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other
opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority,
property, birth or other status.”</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:26.0pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">This gives rise to four well-known questions: (i) do
the facts fall within the ambit of one of the Convention rights; (ii) has the
applicant been treated less favourably than others in an analogous situation;
(iii) is the reason for that less favourable treatment one of the listed
grounds or some “other status”; and (iv) is that difference without reasonable
justification - put the other way round, is it a proportionate means of
achieving a legitimate aim?</span></p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para28"></a><a name="para29">29.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The answer to question (i) is clearly “yes”. Indeed, not only do the
facts fall within the ambit of the right to freedom of expression protected by
article 10; unusually there may well have been a breach of that article in this
case; but that is not required.</a></p><a name="para29">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The answer to question (ii) is
also clearly “yes”. The applicant, and others like her, have been denied the
protection which is available to other employees and workers who make responsible
public interest disclosures within the requirements of Part IVA of the 1996
Act. She is denied protection from “any detriment”, which is much wider than
protection from dismissal or other disciplinary sanctions. She is denied the
possibility of bringing proceedings before the Employment Tribunal, with all
the advantages those have for applicants. She is denied the right to seek
compensation for injury to feelings as well as injury to her health. This is
undoubtedly less favourable treatment than that afforded to others in the
workplace - employees and “limb (b)” workers - who wish to make responsible
public interest disclosures.</span></a></p><a name="para30">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">It is no answer to this to say
that, by definition, judicial office-holders are not in an analogous situation
to employees and “limb (b)” workers. That is to confuse the difference in
treatment with the ground or reason for it. What matters is that the judicial
office-holder has been treated less favourably than others <i>in relation to
the exercise or enjoyment of the Convention right in question</i>, the right to
freedom of expression. She is not as well protected in the exercise of that
right as are others who wish to exercise it.</span></a></p><a name="para31">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The answer to question (iii) is
also clearly “yes”. An occupational classification is clearly capable of being
a “status” within the meaning of article 14. Indeed, it is the very
classification of the judge as a non-contractual office-holder that takes her
out of the whistle-blowing protection which is enjoyed by employees and those
who have contracted personally to execute work under limb (b) of section
230(3). The constitutional position of a judge reinforces the view that this is
indeed a recognisable status.</span></a></p><a name="para32">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The answer to question (iv) is
also, in my view, clearly “yes”. The respondent argues that this is a case in
which the courts should allow a broad margin of discretion to the choices made
by Parliament, for two main reasons: first because this is an area of social
policy in which the courts should respect the decisions of the democratically
elected legislature unless they are “manifestly without reasonable foundation”;
and second, because the status in question is not one of the particularly
suspect grounds of discrimination, such as race or sex or sexual orientation,
and the less favourable treatment is correspondingly easier to justify.</span></a></p><a name="para33">

this argument. The first is that, while it is well-established that the courts

problem is that in this case there is no evidence at all that either the
executive or Parliament addressed their minds to the exclusion of the judiciary
from the protection of Part IVA. While there is evidence of consideration given
to whether certain excluded groups should be included (such as police
officers), there is no evidence that the position of judges has ever been
considered. There is no “considered opinion” to which to defer.</p>

problem, which is that no legitimate aim has been put forward for this
exclusion. It has not been explained, for example, how denying the judiciary
this protection could enhance judicial independence. Of course, members of the
judiciary must take care, in making any public pronouncements, to guard against
being seen to descend into the political arena. But responsible public interest
disclosures of the sort which are protected under Part IVA do not run that
risk. Indeed, the object of the protection was to give workers the confidence
to raise malpractice within their organisation rather than placing them in a
position where they feel driven to raise concerns externally. It is just as
important that members of the judiciary have that confidence. They are just as
vulnerable to certain types of detriment as are others in the workplace. To
give the judiciary such protection might be thought to enhance their
independence by reducing the risk that they might be tempted to “go public”
with their concerns, because of the fear that there was no other avenue
available to them, and thus unwillingly be drawn into what might be seen as a
political debate.</span></a></p><a name="para36">

section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998 was the primary remedy. Section 3(1)
reads: “So far as it is possible to do so, primary legislation … must be read
and given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights”. In <i>Ghaidan

beyond the normal canons of literal and purposive statutory construction.
Philip Sales QC, for the Government, argued (at p 563) that section 3(1)

3(1), citing <i>Litster </i>as well as <i>Pickstone v Freemans Plc</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1988/2.html">[1989] AC 66</a>. Lord Nicholls referred to the “unusual and far-reaching character” of
the obligation (para 30). He also emphasised that it did not depend critically
on the particular form of words used, as opposed to the concept (para 31). Lord
Rodger, too, said that to attach decisive importance to the precise adjustments
required to the language of the particular provision would reduce the exercise
to a game (para 123). The limits were that it was not possible to “go against
the grain” of the legislation in question (para 121) or to interpret it
inconsistently with some fundamental feature of the legislation (Lord Nicholls,
at para 33, echoing <i>In re S (Minors) (Care Order: Implementation of Care
Plan) </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2002/10.html">[2002] UKHL 10</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2002/10.html">[2002] 2 AC 291</a>).</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There are two provisions which might be candidates for such
interpretation. Most obvious is section 230(3)(b), which, it will be recalled,
relevantly defines a “worker” as:</a></p><a name="para40">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“an individual who has entered
into or works under (or where the employment has ceased, worked under) … (b)
any other contract, whether express or implied and (if it is express) whether
oral or in writing, whereby the individual undertakes to do or perform
personally any work or services for another party to the contract whose status
is not by virtue of the contract that of a client or customer of any profession
or business undertaking carried on by the individual.”</p>

</a><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:26.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para40"><span style="font-size:

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Not surprisingly, the appellant
points out that the courts have found it possible to interpret this definition
so as to include judicial office-holders when required to do so by European
Union law. In <i>O’Brien v Ministry of Justice (formerly Department for
Constitutional Affairs)</i>, </span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2013/6.html">[2013] UKSC 6</a>;<i> </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2013/6.html">[2013] 1 WLR 522</a>, the
question was whether part-time judges were entitled to the protection against
discrimination given to part-time workers by the Part-Time Workers Directive
(Council Directive 97/81/EC) transposed into UK law by the Part-Time Workers
(Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2000 (SI 2000/1551). The
definition of “worker” in regulation 1(2) was identical to that in section
230(3) of the 1996 Act. Having determined that judges were “workers” for the
purpose of European Union law, this court had no difficulty in holding that the
Regulations applied to them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:26.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm"><span style="font-size:

</span></a></span><a name="para42"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The respondent argues that to do
this would “cut across a fundamental feature” or “go against the grain” of the
1996 Act. But it is hard to see why that should be so. To interpret section
230(3)(b) so as to include judicial office-holders would not afford them all
the rights afforded to “workers” under the 1996 Act, but only those rights
afforded to “limb (b)” workers, most of which are inapplicable to judges. But
in any event, the interpretation in this case would only relate to an exclusion
which is incompatible with the Convention rights - otherwise the section 3(1)
power and duty does not apply. And the inclusion of judicial office-holders
within the Equality Act 2010, as well as within EU derived employment rights,
shows that affording judges some of the rights of other workers does not offend
against any fundamental constitutional principle. It is noteworthy that the
Court of Appeal, in para 90, was inclined to think that:</span></a></p><a name="para42">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“having regard to the strength of
the interpretative obligation under section 3 of the 1998 Act it would be
possible to read section 230(3) down so that it extended to an ‘employment
relationship’ of the kind found to exist in <i>O’Brien</i>. It does not seem
that the definition of a worker by reference to the existence of a contract, so
as to exclude a ‘mere’ office-holder, is a fundamental feature of the
legislation.”</p>

</a><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:26.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para42"><span style="font-size:

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">I agree. It would not be difficult
to include within limb (b) an individual who works or worked by virtue of
appointment to an office whereby the office-holder undertakes to do or perform
personally any work or services otherwise than for persons who are clients or
customers of a profession or business carried on by the office-holder. The
legislation contemplates disclosure to an employer or others responsible for
the conduct in question, which in this case would be the leadership judges or
the HMCTS or the Ministry of Justice, depending upon the nature of the conduct.
It also prohibits both the employer and fellow employees from subjecting the
whistle-blower to any detriment, which again would have to embrace fellow judges
and those in a position to inflict such detriments. None of this would go
against the grain of the legislation. When considering whether the disclosures
had been made in the public interest, it would of course be relevant to
consider whether there were other more appropriate ways of trying to resolve the
situation. This would include the judicial grievance procedures policies
(currently, policy no 1 relates to grievances between judicial office-holders
and policy no 3 relates to grievances between judicial officer-holders and
HMCTS staff); however, the appellant did invoke the grievance procedure and the
investigating judge, Tomlinson LJ, commented that it was not a suitable means
of dealing with the sort of systemic failures which were being alleged.</span></a></p><a name="para43">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Bearing in mind, therefore, the
parallel seen in <i>Ghaidan v Godin-Mendoza</i> between section 3(1) and
conforming interpretation in EU law, its strictures against attaching decisive
importance to the precise adjustment needed to the language of the provisions,
and the ease with which this court interpreted identical language to include
judges as limb (b) workers in <i>O’Brien</i>, I can reach no other conclusion
than that the Employment Rights Act should be read and given effect so as to
extend its whistle-blowing protection to the holders of judicial office.</span></a></p><a name="para44">

</a><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:26.0pt;

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The relevant provisions of the
Employment Rights Act extend to both England and Wales and Scotland (section
244) but not Northern Ireland. However, the equivalent provisions of the
Employment Rights (Northern Ireland) Order 1996 (as amended by the Public
Interest Disclosure (Northern Ireland) Order 1998) are to the same effect:
article 3(3) defines “worker” in the same times as section 230(3); articles
67A, 67B, 67C define protected disclosures, qualifying disclosures and those to
whom such disclosures may be made in the same way as in Part IVA of the 1996
Act; and articles 70B and 71(1A) provide that a maker of a protected disclosure
shall not be subjected to any detriment for doing so and for complaints to an
employment tribunal. Those provisions, too, should be read and given effect so
as to extend the protection given to whistle-blowers to the holders of judicial
office.</span></a></p><a name="para45">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para45"></a><a name="para46">46.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I would therefore allow this appeal and remit the case to the Employment
Tribunal on the basis that the appellant is entitled to claim the protection of
Part IVA of the 1996 Act.</a></p><a name="para46">
