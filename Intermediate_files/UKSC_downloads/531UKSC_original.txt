<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Under section 1 of the Abortion Act 1967 (“the 1967 Act”) a medical
termination of pregnancy is lawful in four specified circumstances, of which
the first is, in essence, that the pregnancy has not exceeded 24 weeks and that
its continuation would involve risk, greater than if the pregnancy were
terminated, of injury to the physical or mental health of the woman. By section
7(3), the 1967 Act extends to England, Wales and Scotland but not to Northern
Ireland. In Northern Ireland a termination of pregnancy is lawful when its
continuation would threaten the woman’s life or when it would probably affect
her physical or mental health but only if the effect would be serious and, in
particular, permanent or long-term: <i>Family Planning Association of Northern
Ireland v Minister for Health and Social Services and Public Safety</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/nie/cases/NICA/2004/37.html">[2004] NICA 37</a>, para 12, Sheil LJ. The consequence of the requirement that the
probable adverse effect should at least be long-term is that abortion in
Northern Ireland is lawful only in far narrower circumstances than in the rest
of the UK. A challenge to the failure of the law in Northern Ireland to make
abortion lawful even in cases of fatal foetal abnormality and of pregnancies
caused by sexual crime has been upheld in the High Court of Northern Ireland
and is subject to appeal: <i>In re Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission’s Application
for Judicial Review</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/nie/cases/NIHC/QB/2015/96.html">[2015] NIQB 96</a>, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/nie/cases/NIHC/QB/2015/96.html">[2016] 2 FCR 418</a>. But, irrespective of
the ultimate outcome of those proceedings, the far narrower availability of
lawful abortion in Northern Ireland than elsewhere in the UK seems likely to
continue. The criminal law relating to abortion in Northern Ireland is a
“transferred matter” within the meaning of section 4(1) of the Northern Ireland
Act 1998 and so, subject to section 6, its amendment or otherwise falls within
the legislative competence of the Northern Ireland Assembly rather than of
Parliament in Westminster.</p>

</span>The result of the narrower availability of abortion in Northern Ireland

</span>Unable (unless in an emergency) to obtain an abortion free of charge
under the English NHS, these women attend private, fee-paying clinics in
England approved by the respondent under the 1967 Act.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(b)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Official statistics, based on records kept by the clinics, suggest that
about 1,000 of them secure abortions in England each year.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(c)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>But the statistics are likely to understate their number because some of
the women are believed to hide the fact that they are usually resident in
Northern Ireland.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(d)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The clinics charge about £600 for terminating a pregnancy of less than
14 weeks and up to £2,000 in the event that it is further advanced.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(e)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Additionally the women need to pay for their travel to and from England
and, usually, an overnight stay.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(f)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Vulnerable and frightened, they often ask a friend or family member to
accompany them, albeit, of course, at yet further cost.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(g)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For most of the women, the total cost represents a vast sum of money
which they do not have.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(h)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The charity known as Abortion Support Network, being the fifth
intervener in these proceedings, sometimes makes a contribution towards the
women’s costs.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(i)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Even if so, the women usually need to borrow the balance.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(j)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The stigma which in Northern Ireland surrounds unwanted pregnancy and
its termination can inhibit the women from explaining the reason for their need
to borrow.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(k)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The effect of any delay in raising the funds is that the pregnancy
continues, that its termination usually becomes more complex as well as more
costly and that its psychological consequences usually become more profound.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(l)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If, within the time frame set by the 1967 Act, they cannot raise the
funds to secure a lawful abortion in England, the women have to choose either
to undergo a self-administered or back-street abortion in Northern Ireland, by
which they endanger their health and expose themselves to criminal prosecution
and a likely sentence of imprisonment, or to proceed to give birth to a child
for whom they may be ill-equipped to care.</p>

</span>Although this court must acknowledge respect for the ethical “pro-life”
convictions which inform the law in relation to abortions in Northern Ireland
(together, of course, with equal respect for the contrary “pro-choice” convictions),
it remains easy to understand why the plight of women who find themselves in
unwanted pregnancy there is deeply unenviable.</a></p><a name="para6">

</span>The two appellants, A and B, are cases in point. In 2012 A, then aged
15, became pregnant. B is her mother. At all material times they have resided
in Northern Ireland. With B’s support A decided to seek the termination of her
pregnancy. It was conducted in October 2012 at the Marie Stopes International
Clinic in Manchester. B had accompanied A there. The total cost was about £900,
of which £400 was contributed by Abortion Support Network and £500 was borrowed
from friends. Adding significantly to the emotional strain on both A and B of
discovering A’s pregnancy and of enabling her to decide whether to secure its
termination in England were the embarrassment, difficulty and uncertainty
attendant on the urgent need to raise the necessary funds.</a></p><a name="para7">

</span>On 1 April 2013 there was a change in the legislative structure of the
NHS in England. The present appeal, in which the claim is of a breach in 2012
of a duty owed to the appellants, therefore relates to the previous structure.
The respondent makes a helpful concession: it is, as I will explain in para 13,
that in 2012 he had a power which, if exercised, would (so the court may
assume) have enabled UK citizens usually resident in Northern Ireland to
undergo abortions under the NHS in England free of charge. But it is a power
which he did not exercise; so the question is whether his failure to do so was
unlawful.</a></p><a name="para8">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Section 1(1) of the National Health Service Act 2006 (“the 2006 Act”)
was not materially affected by the change in 2013. In its current version it
provides that the respondent must continue to promote in England a
comprehensive health service designed to secure improvement “(a) in the
physical and mental health of the people of England, and (b) in the prevention,
diagnosis and treatment of physical and mental illness”. In my view correctly,
King J<span style="color:red"> </span>described the provision as creating a
target duty: the express focus of both parts of it is improvement. It
identifies the general objectives by reference to which the respondent must
exercise his functions under the Act. Such is made clear in subsection (2) of
the same section, when, referring back to subsection (1), it provides that “for
that purpose” he must (in the previous version of subsection (2)) provide
services in accordance with the Act and (in the current version of it) exercise
his functions so as to secure that they are so provided.</a></p><a name="para9">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Section 1(1) of the 2006 Act refers not to the people in England but to
the people of England. In <i>R (A) v Secretary of State for Health </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2009/225.html">[2009] EWCA Civ 225</a>, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2009/225.html">[2010] 1 WLR 279</a>, Ward LJ suggested at para 55 that the reference
is therefore to people who are “part and parcel of the fabric of the place”. I
agree and suggest, more simply, that it is to the people who live in England.
Other legislation imposes an analogous target duty on the health authorities in
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Thus section 2(1)(a) of the Health and Social Care (Reform) Act (Northern Ireland) 2009 requires the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland to promote a system of health care designed to secure improvement in the physical and mental health of “people in Northern Ireland”. The general scheme is therefore that the health
service for the people who live in Northern Ireland is to be provided for them
there by the Northern Irish authority.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para11">11.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The original version of section 3(1) of the 2006 Act provided:</a></p><a name="para11">

<p class="MsoQuote">“The Secretary of State must provide throughout England, to
such extent as he considers necessary to meet all reasonable requirements -</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">…</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:36.0pt;margin-bottom:0cm;

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; such other services …

health service …”</p>

</a><p class="ParaNoNumber"><a name="para11">The provision of abortion services fell within either (c)
or (d), indeed probably within (c). But the respondent’s duty was to provide
them “to such extent as he considers necessary to meet all reasonable
requirements”. When addressing the same words in the predecessor to section
3(1), the Court of Appeal, in <i>R v North and East Devon Health Authority</i>,
<i>Ex p Coughlan</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1999/1871.html">[2001] QB 213</a>, observed at para 24 that the respondent
therefore had no duty to provide services “if he does not consider they are
reasonably required or necessary to meet a reasonable requirement”. Although in
my view the appellants are right to question whether the existence of a
reasonable requirement was left to the determination of the respondent, his
evaluation undoubtedly governed the extent to which it was necessary to meet
it; so a broad area of the duty cast upon him by section 3(1) was left to be
marked out by the exercise of his own judgement.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para12">12.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In 2002, however, the respondent’s functions under what became section
3(1) of the 2006 Act were made exercisable on his behalf by primary care trusts
(“the trusts”): see regulation 3(2) of the National Health Service (Functions
of Strategic Health Authorities and Primary Care Trusts and Administration
Arrangements) (England) Regulations (SI 2002/2375), (“the Functions
Regulations”). Regulation 3(7) was important because it defined the categories
of persons for whose benefit a trust should exercise the functions. In summary
the categories were as follows:</a></p><a name="para12">

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(a)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

trust;</p>

</span>persons resident outside the UK who were present in its area (albeit
that other regulations required a trust to charge such persons for services);</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(d)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>persons suffering serious mental illness who were resident in other
parts of the UK and who were present in its area; and</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(e)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>all persons present in its area but only for the provision to them of
emergency and analogous services, treatment for certain infectious diseases and
“any other services which the [respondent] may direct”.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Although, therefore, a woman present in England but usually resident in
Northern Ireland did not, save in the case of an emergency or if suffering
serious mental illness, qualify for the provision by the trusts of abortion
services in England, it was open to the respondent to make a direction under
regulation 3(7) and section 7(1) of the 2006 Act that the function under
section 3(1) of providing abortion services should be exercised by the trusts
for the benefit of all persons present in their area who were citizens and
residents of the UK. As I have already indicated, the case proceeds on the
convenient if questionable assumption that, had the respondent done so, then,
notwithstanding the broad area of judgement then exercisable by the trusts
under section 3(1) and notwithstanding the target set under section 1(1) to
secure improvement in the health of the people of England, they would have
resolved to provide such services to UK citizens usually resident in Northern
Ireland - including, therefore, to A.</a></p><a name="para13">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para13"></a><a name="para14">14.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The change on 1 April 2013 in the legislative structure of the NHS in
England was wrought by the Health and Social Care Act 2012 (“the 2012 Act”).
One of its purposes was to reduce the respondent’s role, even when only
nominal, in the front-line provision of services. It abolished the trusts. It
revoked the Functions Regulations. It provided for the establishment of
clinical commissioning groups (“the groups”). And it amended section 3(1) of
the 2006 Act so that the provision of the services there identified, including,
as before, medical services and services for the care of pregnant women, is now
required to be arranged by a group. But the duty, which is qualified in terms
much as before, is to make such arrangements only “to such extent as it
considers necessary to meet the reasonable requirements of the persons for whom
it has responsibility”.</a></p><a name="para14">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para14"></a><a name="para15">15.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For whom, then, does a group have responsibility for this purpose? The
answer lies in a new subsection, numbered (1A), introduced into section 3 by
the 2012 Act: in principle (and apart from provision in emergencies, etc) it
has responsibility for persons provided with primary medical services by a
member of the group (ie persons registered, whether temporarily or otherwise,
with a GP in the group) and for persons usually resident in the group’s area if
not registered with a GP in another group. At first sight, therefore, the
perceived solution for the pregnant woman usually resident in Northern Ireland
might be to come to England and to cause herself to be registered temporarily
with a GP here. As it happens, that particular solution is precluded by
regulation 2(2) of the National Health Service (Clinical Commissioning Groups -
Disapplication of Responsibility) Regulations 2013 (SI 2013/350), which
excludes persons usually resident in Northern Ireland (and in Scotland and
Wales) from those to whom a group owes duties under section 3(1) and (1A). In
addition to its duties, however, a group also has a power in relation to those
for whom, under section 3(1A), it has responsibility. The power is conferred by
a new section, numbered 3A, introduced into the 2006 Act by the 2012 Act: it is
to arrange for the provision to them of such services as it considers
appropriate for securing improvement in their physical and mental health. So
the woman usually resident in Northern Ireland but temporarily registered with
a GP in England would qualify for any such services; and there is no such
exclusion of her from qualification for the exercise of the group’s power as
precludes her qualification for the discharge of the group’s duties.</a></p><a name="para15">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Just as in 2012, in relation to the case before the court, the
respondent had power to make a direction which (so we are to assume) would have
enabled UK citizens usually resident in Northern Ireland to undergo abortions
in England free of charge under the NHS, so today the groups therefore appear
also to have power to enable them to do so. Were it to have been unlawful for
the respondent in that respect to have failed to exercise the power which he
had prior to 1 April 2013, it would seem hard to understand why it has been
otherwise than unlawful for the groups in that respect to have failed to
exercise the power which they have had since that date.</a></p><a name="para16">

</span>The appellants argue that the respondent’s failure to provide for A, as

law and because it was in breach of their human rights.</a></p><a name="para17">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is already apparent that, strictly speaking, the challenge is to a
failure on the part of the respondent to have exercised a power, namely the
power to make the direction identified in para 13 above. The appellants contend
that, when he decided not to exercise the power, he took an irrelevant
consideration into account and he accepts that, if he did so, his decision was
unlawful. They also argue that his decision was more broadly irrational. But
they go further. They submit that, in the light of its context, the
respondent’s power to make the direction became a duty to do so. For, so their
argument runs, the context was section 3(1) of the 2006 Act, which imposed on
the respondent the duty identified in para 11 above. The respondent does not
argue that, just because by 2012 the exercise of his functions under section
3(1) had been delegated to the trusts, the subsection had become irrelevant to
the exercise of his power to make the direction. But, in my view correctly, he
points to two features which significantly diminish the ability of the
appellants to rely on the duty in the subsection:</a></p><a name="para18">

</span>in discharging the duty, his target had to be to improve the health of
the people who lived in England: see para 10.</p>

</span>A was usually resident in part of the UK and thus, in principle, she was
a UK tax-payer and a contributor to the funding of the UK-wide NHS;</p>

was correct) that they had a reasonable requirement for it;</p>

</span>Like the judges in the courts below, I would reject the appellants’ submissions
set out above. Parliament’s scheme is that separate authorities in each of the
four countries united within the kingdom should provide free health services to
those usually resident there. The respondent was entitled to make a decision in
line with this scheme for local decision-making and in accordance with the
target reflective of it which was imposed on him by statute. But the respondent
has taken his argument a stage further. In response to the letter before action
sent on behalf of the appellants, he stated that it was</a></p><a name="para20">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:70.9pt">“the policy of the Government …
that, in general, the NHS should not fund services for residents of Northern
Ireland which the Northern Ireland Assembly has deliberately decided not to

Ireland.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1">This is the consideration which the appellants submit to
have been irrelevant. It was, so they argue, the assembly’s decision which
created the need and it could hardly also represent a reason for refusing to
meet it. I disagree. The respondent was entitled to afford respect to the
democratic decision of the people of Northern Ireland; was entitled to have in
mind the undeniable ability of Northern Irish women lawfully to travel to
England and to purchase private abortion services there; and was entitled to
decide not further to alter the consequences of the democratic decision by
making such services available to them free of charge under the public scheme
in England for which he was responsible.</p>

</span>The appellants argue that the respondent’s decision not to exercise the
power to make the direction identified in para 13 above was unlawful because it
violated article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights (“the
Convention”) taken in conjunction with article 8 of it. Paragraph 1 of article
8 provides for a right, qualified in para 2, to respect for private and family
life. Article 14 provides that the right shall be secured without
discrimination “on any ground such as … national … origin … or other status”.
The appellants assert that enjoyment of their right to respect for their
private and family life (more particularly perhaps for private life in the case
of A and for family life in the case of B) was not secured without discrimination
on the ground of status. But B’s asserted right is parasitic on that of A so,
in what follows, it will be convenient to refer only to the latter.</a></p><a name="para21">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The respondent now accepts that a decision whether to provide abortion
services to a group of women free of charge falls within the scope of their
rights under article 8 to respect for their private life. It is indeed a
decision which may profoundly erode their autonomy in relation to about the
most intimate area of their private life. In <i>A, B and C v Ireland </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2010/2032.html">(2011) 53 EHRR 13</a> the three applicants were residents and citizens of Ireland. The
Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights (“the ECtHR”) rejected the
complaints of A and B that the Irish prohibition against their undergoing
abortions there, even when in the interests of their health, had infringed
their rights under article 8; but it upheld the complaint of C that Ireland had
infringed her right under the article by having failed to enable her to
ascertain whether, in her particular medical circumstances, she had a right to
undergo an abortion there. At an early stage of its judgment, the Grand Chamber
had said:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:70.9pt">“214.&nbsp;&nbsp; While article 8 cannot …
be interpreted as conferring a right to abortion, the court finds that the
prohibition in Ireland of abortion where sought for reasons of health and/or well-being
about which the first and second applicants complained, and the third
applicant’s alleged inability to establish her qualification for a lawful
abortion in Ireland, come within the scope of their right to respect for their
private lives and accordingly article 8.”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is no criticism of the appellants to record that the ground of the
alleged discrimination has been formulated in different ways. For the relevant
concepts are difficult. It is clear that, at the centre of their argument, is a
complaint based on usual residence. As I will try to explain, the complaint is
that, by his decision, the respondent has treated women usually resident in
Northern Ireland either differently from women usually resident in England or
similarly to women usually resident outside the UK; and the context which makes
such treatment significant and which allegedly creates indirect discrimination
is that women usually resident in Northern Ireland have no general entitlement
to undergo abortions there.</a></p><a name="para23">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A person’s place of residence is, curiously, not one of the grounds of
discrimination specified in article 14. But does it fall within the portmanteau
of “other status”? In <i>Carson v United Kingdom </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2010/338.html">(2010) 51 EHRR 13</a> the
applicants, who were entitled to the UK state retirement pension but resident
outside the UK, complained about a rule which precluded index-linking of the
pension when paid to overseas residents. They claimed that it violated article
14 taken in conjunction with article 1 of Protocol 1 to the Convention. The
Grand Chamber concluded at para 71 “that place of residence constitutes an
aspect of personal status for the purposes of article 14” but, in the event, it
proceeded to reject the applications.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para25">25.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>How, then, can the respondent argue that usual residence in Northern
Ireland does not constitute a status which can ground a complaint of
discrimination in breach of article 14? He relies on the earlier decision of
the ECtHR in <i>Magee v UK </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2000/216.html">(2001) 31 EHRR 35</a>. The applicant, who had been
arrested in Northern Ireland and denied access to a solicitor for over 48
hours, complained of a violation by the UK of article 14 taken in conjunction
with article 6. He alleged that, had he been arrested in England and Wales, he
would have been granted access to a solicitor at once. The court rejected the
complaint; it held at para 50 that the basis for the alleged difference of
treatment was that, at the time of his arrest, the applicant had been present
in Northern Ireland rather than in England and Wales and that, in that such a
basis was not related to any personal characteristic, it was not a ground
falling within article 14. In the <i>Carson </i>case, at para 70, the court
distinguished the <i>Magee</i> case in that same way. The respondent presents
the complaint of the appellants as relating to a difference of treatment of
women resident in Northern Ireland but only when present in England. But the
respondent’s presentation itself reveals the personal characteristic at the
heart of the complaint - namely residence in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para26">26.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The complaint of the appellants is indeed therefore of a difference of
treatment on a ground of status within article 14. But, in my view wisely, they
now seek to attach a qualification to the status of usual residence in Northern
Ireland. Were the complaint to remain broadly that the respondent visited a
significant difference of treatment upon women resident not in England but in
Northern Ireland in which they have no general entitlement to undergo an abortion,
it would logically extend to women resident not in Northern Ireland but in
other countries, in particular Ireland, in which they too have no general
entitlement to undergo an abortion. Thus, no doubt in order that their claim
should not be unnecessarily ambitious, the appellants now seek to qualify the
status of those alleged to have been unlawfully disadvantaged by a difference
of treatment. The suggested status is therefore defined as “women who are UK
citizens, present in England and usually resident in Northern Ireland”.</a></p><a name="para26">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para26"></a><a name="para27">27.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The above qualification presents no problem for the appellants. Usual
residence is recognised as falling within “other status” for the purpose of
article 14. National origin is there specified as also a status for that
purpose. A status for the purpose of article 14 can have more than one
component; see, for example, the decision of the ECtHR in 2012 in <i>BS v Spain
</i>(Application No 47159/08) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/ECHR/2012/1904.html">[2012] ECHR 1904</a>, in which (a) a woman who was (b) black and (c) a
prostitute established a ground of discrimination contrary to article 14 by
reference to the interaction of all three factors: see paras 52 and 62 of the
judgment.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para28">28.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>What, then, is the group with which the appellants seek to compare the
allegedly disadvantaged group as now defined? They give alternative answers.
And they give them by reference to alternative presentations of the nature of
the respondent’s decision.</a></p><a name="para28">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para28"></a><a name="para29">29.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The obvious presentation of the nature of the respondent’s decision is
that (save exceptionally) abortion services were to be made available free of
charge under the NHS in England only to those usually resident in England. On
this basis the comparator group suggested by the appellants is women present in
England and usually resident in England. Here the claim is that the allegedly
disadvantaged group should have been treated in the <i>same</i> way. The
Convention does not require a state to make abortion services generally
available, still less to make them free of charge, but, once it decides to make
them available, whether free of charge or otherwise, the state must devise a
framework for access to them which accords with Convention obligations: <i>RR v
Poland</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2011/828.html">(2011) 53 EHRR 31</a>, para 187.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para30">30.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>But, in the alternative, the appellants turn the nature of the
respondent’s decision inside out. The alternative presentation of it is that
(save exceptionally) abortion services were <i>not </i>to be made available
under the NHS in England to those <i>not </i>usually resident in England. On
this basis the comparator group suggested by the appellants is all other women
present in England but not usually resident in England. Here the claim is that
the allegedly disadvantaged group should have been treated in a <i>different</i>
way from that in which the comparator group was treated. For, so the argument
proceeds, the situation of “women who are UK citizens, present in England and
usually resident in Northern Ireland” is significantly different from that of
all other women present in England but not usually resident in England, even if
the latter are usually resident in countries where abortion services are not
generally available. The appellants contend that the legitimacy of this
alternative answer is established by the decision of the Grand Chamber in <i>Thlimmenos
v Greece </i>(2000) 31 EHRR 15. There the applicant, a Jehovah’s Witness, had
refused to enlist in the army for religious reasons and had therefore been
convicted of a felony. The effect of a Greek decree was that a person convicted
of a felony could not be admitted as a chartered accountant. The Grand Chamber
upheld his complaint that, in failing to differentiate between felonies
committed for religious reasons and felonies committed for other reasons,
Greece had violated article 14 taken in conjunction with article 9 (the right
to freedom of religion). It observed at para 44 that a violation occurred not
only “when States treat differently persons in analogous situations without
providing an objective and reasonable justification” but also “when States
without an objective and reasonable justification fail to treat differently
persons whose situations are significantly different”.</a></p><a name="para30">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para30"></a><a name="para31">31.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I do not see how the appellants’ alternative presentation, based on the <i>Thlimmenos</i>
case, adds anything to their first and obvious presentation - apart from an
extra level of unwelcome complexity. The respondent cannot deny that he treated
women usually resident in England differently from women who, although UK
citizens, were usually resident in Northern Ireland. But the difference of
treatment does not amount to discrimination, and thus is not in breach of article
14, if it was justified.</a></p><a name="para31">

<p class="ParaHeading"><span style="font-style:normal">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Justification</u></span></p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para31"></a><a name="para32">32.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If he is to establish justification, the respondent has to persuade the
court to give an affirmative answer to the four well-known questions posed, for
example, by Baroness Hale of Richmond in <i>R (Tigere) v Secretary of State for
Business, Innovation and Skills</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/57.html">[2015] UKSC 57</a>, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/57.html">[2015] 1 WLR 3820</a>, at para
33. In my view an affirmative answer clearly falls to be given to the first
three of them: for the aim of the respondent’s decision in relation to women
who were UK citizens but usually resident in Northern Ireland, to which the
decision was rationally connected, was to stay loyal to a legitimate scheme for
health services to be devolved in the interests of securing local provision to
residents in each of our four countries. Nor, with that aim, could he have
reached any decision less intrusive upon the rights of such women to respect
for their personal life. The issue surrounds the fourth question: did his
decision strike a fair balance between their rights and the interests of the UK
community as a whole?</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para33">33.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The respondent’s own conclusion that his decision struck a fair balance
should, so he contends, be adopted unless it was “manifestly without reasonable
foundation”. A central issue, so he says, is economic - should the women have
to pay for the abortion services which are available to them in England? - and,
although he does not contend that it would be impossible for the NHS in England
to fund the provision to them of such services free of charge, he points out
that the funding of other services would in that event be diminished. So,
according to him, the central issue raises a second issue which relates to the
allocation of resources. He proceeds to cite the decision of the Grand Chamber
in <i>Stec v United Kingdom</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2006/1162.html">(2006) 43 EHRR 47</a>, at para 52, that, in
relation to “general measures of economic or social strategy”, the Strasbourg
court will generally respect the policy choice of national authorities unless
it is “manifestly without reasonable foundation”. But it is now clear that,
while this criterion may sometimes be apt to the process of answering the first
question, and perhaps also the second and third questions, it is irrelevant to
the question of fair balance, which, while free to attach weight to the fact that
the measure is the product of legislative choice, the court must answer for
itself: see <i>In re Recovery of Medical Costs for Asbestos Diseases (Wales)
Bill </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/3.html">[2015] UKSC 3</a>, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/3.html">[2015] AC 1016</a>, para 46, Lord Mance.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellants correctly submit that, in interpreting Convention rights,
the ECtHR now frequently refers to the text of international conventions and
even to the recommendations of committees set up to oversee observance of them
by the parties to them. They and the interveners urge the court to assess the
fairness (or, as they submit, the unfairness) of the respondent’s decision in
its application to women who were UK citizens but usually resident in Northern
Ireland through the prism of such material. They therefore rely on article
12(2) of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
Discrimination against Women (1979) (“CEDAW”), which requires the UK, as one of
the parties to it, to “ensure to women appropriate services in connection with
pregnancy …, granting free services where necessary …” They also rely on CEDAW General
Recommendation No 24, issued on 5 February 1999 by the committee set up by that
Convention, in which, by way of elaboration on article 12, it recommended at
para 31(c) that “[w]hen possible, legislation criminalizing abortion should be
amended, in order to withdraw punitive measures imposed on women who undergo
abortion”. And they further rely on General Comment No 22 (2016) of the UN
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, in which at para 28 parties
to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, including
the UK, are required to “liberalize restrictive abortion laws” and to “guarantee
women and girls access to safe abortion services”.</a></p><a name="para34">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para34"></a><a name="para35">35.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>These three quotations represent the high point of the mass of such
material now pressed upon the court. The conventions and the covenant to which
the UK is a party carefully stop short of calling upon national authorities to
make abortion services generally available. Some of the committees go further
down that path. But, as a matter of international law, the authority of their
recommendations is slight: see <i>Jones v Ministry of Interior of the Kingdom
of Saudi Arabia</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/26.html">[2006] UKHL 26</a>, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/26.html">[2007] 1 AC 270</a>, para 23, Lord Bingham of
Cornhill. At its highest one can say only that there is a trend in some of the
international material to which the current law in Northern Ireland runs
counter. The trend adds background colour to the inquiry into fair balance
under the Convention. In my view, however, the appellants need material of a
far more vivid hue to put into the balance against the respondent’s resolve to
stay loyal to the overall scheme for separate provision of free health services
within each of our four countries and to the democratic decision reached in
Northern Ireland in relation to abortion services. In my view the balance
struck by his decision was fair.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading"><b><span style="font-style:normal">G:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>CONCLUSION</u></span></b></p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On any view the dissenting judgments of Lord Kerr and Lady Hale command
considerable respect. Lord Kerr concludes that it was the duty of the Secretary
of State (and is the duty of the groups) to provide for a UK citizen present
but not usually resident in England the same medical services, free of charge,
under the NHS as he provided (and as they provide) for those usually resident
in England. Lady Hale agrees with him but also stresses that a requirement for
abortion services represents a special case. It is, however, easy to think of
other people suffering a grave medical condition who could mount an equally
convincing special case. Lady Hale also suggests that the duty of the NHS in
England to provide abortion services extends even to foreign citizens present
in England; but its entitlement to charge such citizens, which Lady Hale
recognises, might not negate the effect of the suggested extension on the
functioning of the service. Irrespective, however, of its precise extent, the
duty proposed to be cast upon the respondent by Lord Kerr and Lady Hale would,
in my view, precipitate both a substantial level of health tourism into England
from within the UK and from abroad and a near collapse of the edifice of
devolved health services. In the end, for the reasons given above, I find
myself unable to agree either that sections 1 and 3 of the 2006 Act or that the
human rights of UK citizens generate the suggested duty. I would dismiss the
appeal.</a></p><a name="para36">

UK. An example is the case of <i>P v United Kingdom </i>(Application No
13473/87), given 11 July 1988, unreported, where the Commission stated:</a></p><a name="para41">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“... in many, if not all, of the
contracting states, different legal jurisdictions exist in different
geographical areas within the state (eg cantons, communes, Länder, etc) ... the
mere existence of variations between such jurisdictions within a state does not
constitute discrimination within the meaning of article 14 of the Convention.”</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:26.0pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Similar observations were made in <i>Times Newspapers

that the laws of a jurisdiction within a state could not violate article 14:

such as “association with a national minority”. All that was being said was
that differences between the laws in different jurisdictions were not in
themselves discriminatory. Thus in </span><i><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Nelson

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The Court considered differential
treatment arising from differences between the law of Northern Ireland on the
one hand, and England and Wales on the other hand, in the case of <i>Magee v
United Kingdom</i> </span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2000/216.html">31 EHRR 35</a><i>, </i>discussed by Lord Wilson at para 25.

26.0pt;margin-left:72.0pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">“...
in the constituent parts of the United Kingdom there is not always a uniform
approach to legislation in particular areas. Whether or not an individual can
assert a right derived from legislation may accordingly depend on the
geographical reach of the legislation at issue and the individual’s location at
the time. For the Court, in so far as there exists a difference in treatment of
detained suspects under the [Northern Irish legislation] and the legislation of
England and Wales on the matters referred to by the applicant, that difference
is not to be explained in terms of personal characteristics, such as national
origin or association with a national minority, but on the geographical
location where the individual is arrested and detained. This permits
legislation to take account of regional differences and characteristics of an
objective and reasonable nature. In the present case, such a difference does
not amount to discriminatory treatment within the meaning of article 14 of the
Convention.”</span></p>

</span></a></span><a name="para44"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">It is not entirely clear from that
passage whether the Court meant that differences in treatment based on the
jurisdiction to whose laws a person was subject by reason of his geographical
location were not based on the person’s “status”, within the meaning of article
14, or whether it meant that such differences required to be, and were in that
case, objectively justified. The former interpretation is in my view to be
preferred, for three reasons. First, the Court’s general approach at that time
to issues of “status”, within the meaning of article 14, was based on “personal
characteristics” (I say “at that time”, because in later cases the Court has
tended to refer instead to “identifiable characteristics”, in response to
arguments that personal characteristics are necessarily immutable and
inherent); and a person’s geographical location cannot readily be regarded as a
personal characteristic. Secondly, there are strong constitutional arguments
against treating differences in the laws of different jurisdictions internal to
a state as necessarily requiring justification, as was recognised by Judge
Matscher in <i>Dudgeon </i>and by the Commission in the cases mentioned
earlier. This has also been accepted by the Court of Justice of the European
Union: <i>R (Horvath) v Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs </i>(Case C-428/07) </span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2009/C42807.html">[2009] ECR I-6355</a> (“where the constitutional system
of a member state provides that devolved administrations are to have
legislative competence, the mere adoption by those administrations of different
... standards ... does not constitute discrimination contrary to Community
law”: para 58). Thirdly, and most importantly, that is how <i>Magee </i>was
interpreted by the Grand Chamber in <i>Carson v United Kingdom</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2010/338.html">51 EHRR 13</a><i>,

</span></a></span><a name="para45"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The case of <i>Carson v United
Kingdom </i>was concerned with UK legislation which differentiated between
residents of the UK and residents of other countries. One of the issues in the
case, as identified in the heading to paras 66-71, was whether “country of
residence” was an “other status”, within the meaning of article 14. The court
held that it was. It stated at paras 70-71:</span></a></p><a name="para45">

</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para45">“70.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Grand Chamber ... has
established in its case law that only differences in treatment based on a
personal characteristic (or ‘status’) by which persons or groups of persons are
distinguishable from each other are capable of amounting to discrimination
within the meaning of article 14 ... It further recalls that the words ‘other
status’ (and a fortiori the French equivalent <i>toute autre situation</i>)
have been given a wide meaning so as to include, in certain circumstances, a
distinction drawn on the basis of a place of residence. Thus, in previous cases
the Court has examined under article 14 the legitimacy of alleged
discrimination based, inter alia, on domicile abroad and registration as a
resident. In addition, the Commission examined complaints about discrepancies
in the law applying in different areas of a single contracting state (see <i>Lindsay
v United Kingdom </i>and <i>Gudmundsson v Iceland</i>). It is true that
regional differences of treatment, resulting from the application of different
legislation depending on the geographical location of an applicant, have been
held not to be explained in terms of personal characteristics (see, for
example, <i>Magee v United Kingdom</i>, para 50). However, as also pointed out
by Stanley Burnton J [<i>R (Carson) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions</i>
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2002/978.html">[2002] EWHC 978 (Admin)</a>], these cases are not comparable to the present case,
which involves the different application of the same pensions legislation to
persons depending on their residence and presence abroad.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">71.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, the Court
considers that place of residence constitutes an aspect of personal status for
the purposes of article 14.”</p>

</span></a></span><a name="para46"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">No question arose in <i>Carson </i>as
to whether a person’s residence or non-residence in a constituent part of a
country with a federal or devolved constitution was an “other status”. It is
also true that the Grand Chamber, in distinguishing the <i>Magee </i>line of
cases, referred to the fact that those cases were concerned with “regional
differences of treatment”, as opposed to “residence and presence abroad”. On
the other hand, the contrast drawn by the Court in the last two sentences of
para 70 was between a difference in treatment resulting from the application of
different legislation, according to where the person in question was located,
and a difference in treatment resulting from the application of a single piece
of legislation which differentiated between people according to where they
resided.</span></a></p><a name="para46">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Differential treatment of the
latter kind can be equally present whether the legislation in question is
national or sub-national in origin, and whether the residence test relates to
residence within the country in question or within a constituent part of it. A
law which treats the residents of a place differently from non-residents
therefore differentiates on the basis of personal status, within the meaning of
article 14, whether the law in question has been passed by the Parliament of
the United Kingdom and applies to the whole of the UK, or has been passed by
the devolved legislature of one part of the UK and applies only in that part;
and whether the differentiation is between residents and non-residents of the
UK, or between residents and non-residents of a part of the UK. The same must
be equally true of an administrative arrangement.</span></a></p><a name="para47">

confirmed by the unqualified language of para 71: “place of residence constitutes
an aspect of personal status for the purposes of article 14”: a phrase which
has been repeated in later judgments (see, for example, <i>Pichkur v Ukraine </i>(Application
No 10441/06), given 7 November 2013, para 47).</span></a></p><a name="para48">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The fact that the differential
treatment of residents and non-residents of a particular part of the UK falls
within the scope of article 14, whether it arises by virtue of national or
devolved legislation or by virtue of administrative arrangements, does not of
course by any means entail that such treatment is in violation of the article.
But it does mean that the difference in treatment requires to be justified.</span></a></p><a name="para49">

</span>A woman from Northern Ireland (NI) visiting England who suffers an acute
attack of appendicitis will have, if it proves necessary, her appendix removed
in a National Health Service hospital, without charge. The same woman, if she
travels to England in order to obtain an abortion, must pay for that procedure.
How can this be right? The answer is that it cannot be, and is not, right.</a></p><a name="para50">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It might be suggested that the two situations are not analogous because
when the notional woman needs an appendectomy and happens to be in England, she
is not exercising a choice in obtaining that treatment, whereas the same woman
travelling to England for an abortion does so out of choice. In fact, of
course, a woman who travels to England to obtain an abortion has, in the clear
majority of cases, no true choice. She must travel away from her home and the
support of her family and friends to obtain treatment of the most traumatic
type in unfamiliar surroundings. If she wishes to obtain an abortion, she must
travel to England. That is because, as Lord Wilson has explained, the
circumstances in which that procedure may be carried out in NI are far narrower
than in England. It is beyond question that a woman from NI who seeks an
abortion in England may travel there lawfully and may lawfully obtain an
abortion, provided she fulfils the conditions stipulated by the Abortion Act
1967. But she cannot obtain that treatment on the NHS. England is in practice
the only place where a woman from NI can obtain an abortion. But, unlike an
Englishwoman who likewise will only seek an abortion in England, the woman from
NI must pay.</a></p><a name="para51">

</span>Para 5 of Lord Wilson’s judgment provides an admirably comprehensive
account of the relevant factual background to this appeal. In that para Lord
Wilson described the circumstances in which women from NI come regularly to
England to secure abortions. He has recognised the plight into which many of
these vulnerable women are cast by the decision of the Secretary of State for
Health that treatment for their condition is not to be available on the NHS.</a></p><a name="para52">

</span>The only matters beyond those referred to by Lord Wilson which, I
believe, should be taken into account are: (i) it is an accepted fact that
15-16% of abortions carried out in England for non-resident women are for women
normally resident in NI. Official statistics suggest that around 1,000
abortions are carried out in England on NI women; (ii) even if one accepts the
figure of 1,000 per annum, which, for the reasons given by Lord Wilson, is
likely to be a significant underestimation, it is a considerable percentage of
child bearing women in NI with a population of 1.8m and an annual birth rate
there of some 24,000. In England and Wales, the number of abortions was 184,000
for a population of 56.1m.</a></p><a name="para53">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Three primary issues arise concerning the correct interpretation of the
principal provisions relevant to this appeal (sections 1 and 3 of the Act). The
first is whether the phrase, “the people of England” introduces a demographic
restriction which applies to section 1(1) of the Act generally. The second
issue is, if the phrase in section 1 partakes of such a restriction, does it
affect the geographical reach of section 3. The third issue is whether the section
1 duty is properly to be characterised as a target duty, and, if so, what
significance should attach to that term.</a></p><a name="para54">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para54"></a><a name="para55">55.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Before turning to the provisions, it is to be noted that the cross
headings to Part I of the Act (in which both sections 1 and 3 are contained)
are: “Promotion and Provision of the Health Service in England” and “The
Secretary of State and the Health Service in England”. Of course, the use to
which cross headings may be put as an aid to interpretation is limited. But it
is of some interest that the opening words describing the nature of the
succeeding provisions do not refer to any demographic restriction.</a></p><a name="para55">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para55"></a><a name="para56">56.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It might be considered that confining the Secretary of State’s duty to
one which required him to provide services to the people of England only would
not reflect political and practical reality. The “people of England” is an
amorphous phrase, capable, at least theoretically, of many meanings. As Lord
Wilson observed, Ward LJ in <i>R (A) v Secretary of State for Health</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2009/225.html">[2010] 1 WLR 279</a>, para 55 suggested that it meant people who are “part and parcel of
the fabric of the place”. With respect, I find that interpretation may pose
more questions than it answers, for who are to be regarded as constituting part
of the fabric of a place? While not disagreeing with Ward LJ’s formulation,
Lord Wilson suggested what it meant was “the people who live in England”. But,
how is that to be defined? England attracts many people to her shores. Some
wish to live here permanently but may have no legal right to do so, or even to
have entered the country. Are they people of England while they live here?
Others may be short or long term visitors. Imagine the case of a woman from NI
who has come to visit relatives in England, intending to stay for six months.
Is she a person of England during those months? She is certainly living here.
And what if she fell pregnant half way through her stay? Would she have to pay
for an abortion because she did not normally live in England? These
considerations indicate how difficult it is to fix on a restricted meaning for
the phrase, “people of England”.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

separate aims of section 1(1) and of the true nature of the objective to which
the phrase “people of England” has been applied.</a></p><a name="para57">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The primary obligation imposed on the Secretary of State is to continue
to promote <i>in</i> England a comprehensive health service. The comprehensive
health service was to secure improvement in two separate areas. The first of
these was the physical and mental health of the people of England. The second
(and distinct from the first) was the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of
illness. That second purpose did not have a qualification that it should apply
to the people of England only. This is important because it clearly indicates
that the Secretary of State’s duty was not fulfilled merely by bringing about
an improvement in the health of the people of England. The duty also included
the requirement to promote a comprehensive health service which would not only
achieve that objective but would also advance the prevention etc of illness.</a></p><a name="para59">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para59"></a><a name="para60">60.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Where subsection (2) provides that the Secretary of State must “for that
purpose” secure the provision of services in accordance with the Act, this does
not refer exclusively to the improvement of the health of the people of
England. “For that purpose” must be taken to refer to all the objectives
identified in subsection (1). These were (i) the continued promotion of a
comprehensive health service; (ii) the improvement of the health of the people
of England; and (iii) the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness. The
duty under subsection (2) to secure the provision of services in accordance
with the Act must reflect these separate objectives.</a></p><a name="para60">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It can be readily understood why the two objectives of the comprehensive
health service were identified in separate sub-paragraphs of section 1(1). It
is understandable that the aspiration that a health service should<i> improve
the health of the nation</i> can be expressed as applying to the people of
England. After all, the Secretary of State does not have a responsibility to
improve the health of other nations. When it comes to providing health services
generally, however, a much wider constellation of issues arises. The diagnosis
and treatment of illness, although it of course contributes to improving the
health of the nation, involves more than fulfilling that objective. The
treatment of individual patients, while it may contribute incidentally to an
improvement in the health of people generally, requires the provision of
adequate medical services, irrespective of the part that they may play in
improving overall standards of health.</a></p><a name="para61">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>When, therefore, one comes to section 3 of the Act, the Secretary of
State’s duty to provide the services listed there is impelled, at least in
part, by considerations other than improving the health of the people of
England generally. The principally relevant parts of section 3 of the 2006 Act,
as originally enacted, are set out in para 11 of Lord Wilson’s judgment and I
need not repeat them here. The duty is to provide the listed services
“throughout England”. As Lord Wilson has pointed out, the Secretary of State’s
duty was to provide them “to such extent as he considers necessary to meet all
reasonable requirements” but the critical question was how were those
reasonable requirements to be defined.</a></p><a name="para62">

</span>In para 18(b) of his judgment Lord Wilson accepted the respondent’s
argument that in discharging the duty, the Secretary of State’s target had to
be to improve the health of the people who lived in England. For reasons that
have been foreshadowed in earlier passages of this judgment and on which I will
expand presently, I do not accept that argument.</a></p><a name="para63">

reservations about the correctness of the opinion expressed by the Court of
Appeal, in <i>R v North and East Devon Health Authority</i>, <i>Ex p Coughlan</i>
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1999/1871.html">[2001] QB 213</a>, to the effect that the Secretary of State had no duty to provide
services if <i>he</i> considered they were not reasonably required or necessary
to meet a reasonable requirement. The Secretary of State surely does not enjoy
a blanket immunity from challenge to his determination of what were the
reasonable requirements in any given situation. True it is that his evaluation
of what those requirements demanded will weigh heavily in any challenge to his
decision but if that decision can be shown to be legally flawed by reason, for
instance, of its irrationality or of the failure of the Secretary of State to
take account of a plainly relevant consideration, the mere fact that he is
charged with the statutory responsibility of reaching a decision on the
question of reasonable requirements, does not render that decision invulnerable
to challenge. The outcome of this appeal does not depend on this type of
challenge. The primary issue here is whether the Secretary of State properly
conceived the nature of his statutory obligation under section 3 of the 2006
Act.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para65">65.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In my opinion, the Secretary of State was not obliged to view the
discharge of his duty under section 3 through the lens of whether the services
provided would improve the health of the people of England. To the contrary,
the provision of those services was primarily concerned with the second objective
in section 1(1)(b), namely, the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness.
Implementation of that condition was unconstrained by the need to gear it to
improvement of the health of the people of England. The conclusion that the
focus was on fulfilling the second objective is reinforced by considering the
type of services which the section requires the Secretary of State to provide,
as well as the prefatory injunction that he provide the services throughout
England<i> </i>as opposed to for the people of England<i>.</i></a></p><a name="para65">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para65"></a><a name="para66">66.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The services stipulated in sub-paras (e) and (f) of section 3(1) plainly
relate to the objective of section 1(1)(b). They are “(e) such other services
or facilities for the prevention of illness, the care of persons suffering from
illness and the after-care of persons who have suffered from illness as he
considers are appropriate as part of the health service”, and “(f) such other
services or facilities as are required for the diagnosis and treatment of
illness”. The Secretary of State’s obligation, therefore, was to ask himself “what
are the reasonable requirements in the provision of those services throughout
England”; not “what are the reasonable requirements of the people of England
for these services”.</a></p><a name="para66">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para66"></a><a name="para67">67.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Secretary of State was therefore wrong to conclude that the
discharge of his duties under section 3 was dominated by the “people of England”
question. Of course, his primary obligation, so far as concerned the
improvement of the health of the nation, was to “the people of England”,
however that phrase is to be construed. But it did not provide a fetter on his
consideration of how his statutory duty should be fulfilled. To the contrary,
the discharge of his duties under section 3 should have been regarded by him as
requiring a far wider consideration.</a></p><a name="para67">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In England, an abortion can only lawfully be provided under section 1 of
the Abortion Act 1967 to avert a risk of physical or mental injury to the
mother, the unborn child or any existing children in the family. As Laws LJ
explained in <i>ProLife Alliance v British Broadcasting Association</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2002/297.html">[2002] 3 WLR 1080</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2002/297.html">[2002] EWCA Civ 297</a> at para 6:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The great majority [of abortions]
are performed on the third of the five permitted grounds under the Abortion Act
1967 as amended: that is that the continuance of the pregnancy would involve
risk, greater than if the pregnancy were terminated, of injury to the physical
or mental health of the pregnant woman. There is some evidence that many
doctors maintain that the continuance of a pregnancy is always more dangerous
to the physical welfare of a woman than having an abortion, a state of affairs
which is said to allow a situation of <i>de facto</i> abortion on demand to
prevail.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para69">69.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Thus, while pregnancy is not, of course, itself an illness, allowing an
unwanted pregnancy to continue to term carries a risk of physical or mental
injury. There can therefore be no question but that Englishwomen who seek an
abortion in England are being treated “for the prevention … of illness” under
sections 1(1)(b) and 3 of the 2006 Act. Women from NI provided with abortion
services in England are likewise being treated under these provisions. The
single difference is that women from NI cannot avail of section 1(3), whereas
women from England can.</a></p><a name="para69">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para69"></a><a name="para70">70.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It was argued for the respondent that differences in standards in
treatment for all manner of illnesses and conditions differed in the different
parts of the United Kingdom but that citizens of one part were not entitled to
demand provision of what they might regard as superior services in a part of
the kingdom in which they did not live. It was suggested that this was in
keeping with individual schemes for health services being provided to residents
in each of the four countries of the United Kingdom. But abortion services such
as A required are <i>not provided at all </i>in Northern Ireland. This is not
an instance of her seeking what she regarded as a better level of service in
England. It was a case of her being obliged to come to the only medical service
of which she could avail. The decision of the Secretary of State to refuse to
allow NI women to obtain abortion services on the NHS in England was one taken
in the knowledge that she could not obtain those services elsewhere.</a></p><a name="para70">

<p class="ParaHeading">The power of the Secretary of State to direct that
abortion services on the NHS should be available to women from Northern Ireland
and his reasons for not exercising it</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para70"></a><a name="para71">71.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As Lord Wilson has observed (in para 8 of his judgment), it was accepted
that the Secretary of State had the power to enable UK citizens usually
resident in Northern Ireland to undergo abortions under the NHS in England free
of charge. I agree with all that he has said in paras 12-16 of his judgment
about the continuing availability of that power. Indeed, all of this was a
matter of concession by the Secretary of State.</a></p><a name="para71">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para71"></a><a name="para72">72.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Given that the Secretary of State had that power, one must concentrate
on his reasons for deciding not to have recourse to it. His decision not to do
so was based on two considerations. The first was that whatever course he took
should be consonant with his target to improve the health of the people of
England. If that factor loomed over the decision, it seems almost inevitable
that his conclusion would have to be not to allow women from NI to have
abortions on the NHS. It is difficult to see how a decision to allow them to
have abortions in England free of charge could be reconciled with an overriding
obligation to promote the health service in order to improve the physical and
mental health of the people of England. The very existence of a power to permit
NI women to have abortions on the NHS seems inconsistent with such an
obligation. Whatever of that, for the reasons that I have given, I believe that
the Secretary of State was wrong to consider that his statutory duty was so
confined.</a></p><a name="para72">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para72"></a><a name="para73">73.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The second reason proffered by the Secretary of State was that it was
the policy of the government that the NHS should not fund services for NI
residents which “the Northern Ireland Assembly has deliberately decided not to
legislate to provide, and which would be unlawful if provided in Northern
Ireland” - see the letter referred to in para 20 of Lord Wilson’s judgment.
This view was reached against the background that the Secretary of State’s
primary obligation was to provide health services for the people of England.
Notwithstanding my conclusion that this should not have been the framework
within which the decision was taken, it is right that I should examine it as a
possible defence even in what I consider was the correct legal context, namely,
that the Secretary of State was under a duty to provide medical services
throughout England unconstrained by the requirement that these be devoted to
the people of England.</a></p><a name="para73">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para73"></a><a name="para74">74.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Wilson has said that the Secretary of State was entitled to afford
respect to the democratic decision of the people of Northern Ireland (para 20).
I agree. Indeed I would go further. He was bound to show such respect. But
respect for what? The Northern Ireland Assembly had decided that abortion in
that jurisdiction should not be provided on the same basis as in England. But
it has expressed no view about the ability of women from NI to travel to
England to obtain abortions. Assembly members, indeed all informed persons in
the entire population of Northern Ireland, are plainly aware of the fact that
many women from NI travel every year to England to obtain abortions and have
done so for many years. The need for respect on the part of the Secretary of State,
on behalf of the British government, did not extend to denying Northern Irish
women the means of obtaining abortions in England. It was entirely right that
this should be so. Why should affording Northern Irish women abortions on the
NHS constitute a lack of respect, when countenancing and permitting such
abortions does not?</a></p><a name="para74">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para74"></a><a name="para75">75.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Wilson’s answer is that the Secretary of State was entitled to
decide not to alter further the consequences of the democratic decision by
making such services available to them free of charge. With regret, I cannot
agree. If, as must be presumed to be the case, the NI Assembly regarded with
equanimity the fact that many women from NI travelled each year to England to
obtain abortions, I cannot see how allowing these abortions to take place on
the NHS would involve a further alteration to the democratic decision of the
Assembly.</a></p><a name="para75">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para75"></a><a name="para76">76.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, I question whether providing NHS funding for abortions for women
from NI involves <i>any </i>alteration to the democratic decision. Both the
Assembly and the British government were aware that it was perfectly legal for
them to travel to England to obtain abortions. Once in England, provided they
satisfied the criteria of the Abortion Act 1967, it was perfectly legal for
them to obtain abortions. The NI Assembly had no function or say in the
exercise of the women’s unalterable legal entitlement to obtain abortions in
those circumstances. The democratic decision-making in NI simply does not
impinge on the exercise by NI women of their rights in England.</a></p><a name="para76">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para76"></a><a name="para77">77.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>By making it more difficult for women from NI to obtain abortions in
England, the Secretary of State was not affording respect to the wishes of the
electorate in Northern Ireland or the decision of NI Assembly. Unless, that is,
it is considered that affording respect warrants the creation of problems for
vulnerable women to exercise their right in a part of the UK solely because
they come from a part of the kingdom where they are unable to exercise the
right. That seems to me to partake of double standards. Women throughout the
UK, apart from NI, are entitled to abortion services under the Abortion Act
1967 and the British government must be taken to approve of, or at least assent
to, that position. On that account, they must be taken to disapprove of, or at
least dissent from, the denial of that right to women from another part of the
UK. Why then should they feel constrained, under the guise of affording respect
to the NI Assembly’s wishes, to make it more difficult for NI women to
exercise, in England, rights to which they are undeniably entitled?</a></p><a name="para77">

<p class="ParaHeading">A target duty?</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para77"></a><a name="para78">78.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Secretary of State argued that the duties owed under sections 1 and
3 of the 2006 Act were “target” duties and, on that account, they were
unenforceable on the application of an individual. In support of that argument,
reliance was placed firstly on the decision in <i>R (Justice for Health Ltd) v
Secretary of State for Health</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2016/2338.html">[2016] Med LR 599</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2016/2338.html">[2016] EWHC 2338 (Admin)</a>,
para 89 where Green J said that target duties:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... do not specify a
particular or precisely defined end result as opposed to a broad aim or object
and (b) their mandatory nature is diluted by the fact that they do not compel
the achievement of that end result instead requiring the Secretary of State
only to factor those objectives into consideration.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para79">79.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>These observations were made in relation to sections 1A-1G of the 2006
Act, as amended. Those provisions relate to specific duties of the Secretary of
State, relevant to: terms and conditions of employment of those working in the
NHS; the quality of services of those who avail of it; the planning and
delivery of education and training of the professionals employed in the NHS;
and reporting to Parliament. These are a quite different series of duties from
those involved in the present appeal. In any event, Green J did not suggest
that the failure of the Secretary of State to discharge any of the duties could
not be the subject of judicial review by someone affected by the failure. The
case provides no support for the respondent’s principal contention that target
duties cannot be enforced by an individual.</a></p><a name="para79">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Next Mr Coppel QC for the Secretary of State relied on a passage from
the speech of Lord Hope of Craighead in <i>R </i>(<i>G) v Barnet London Borough
Council</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2003/57.html">[2003] UKHL 57</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2003/57.html">[2004] 2 AC 208</a> at para 91 where, in relation to
the target duty the target duty in section 17(1) of the Children Act 1989, he
said:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“I think that the correct analysis
of section 17(1) is that it sets out duties of a general character which are
intended to be for the benefit of children in need in the local social services
authority’s area in general. ... [In] <i>R v Barnet London Borough Council</i>,
<i>Ex p B</i> [1994] ELR 357 ... Auld J … observed … that the duties under Part
III of the [Children Act] 1989 … fell into two groups, those which are general
and those which are particular, and that the general duties are concerned with
the provision of services overall and not to be governed by individual
circumstances.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">…</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">As Mr Goudie for the defendants
accepted, members of that section of the public [affected by the local
authority’s decision] have a sufficient interest to enforce those general
duties by judicial review. But they are not particular duties owed to each
member of that section of the public of the kind described by Lord Clyde in <i>R

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This citation, so far from supporting the respondent’s central thesis on
the matter of target duties, seems to me to be entirely destructive of it. A
and B do not suggest that their individual cases required the attention of the
Secretary of State or that they were owed any obligation personal to them. But
they were certainly affected by the Secretary of State’s decision in relation
to the availability of abortion services to NI women. And, on that account they
were entitled to enforce the Secretary of State’s general duties by way of
judicial review.</a></p><a name="para81">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In relation to the section 3 duty in particular, Mr Coppel relied on the
decision in <i>R (Condliff) v North Staffordshire Primary Care Trust </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2011/910.html">[2012] PTSR 460</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2011/910.html">[2011] EWCA Civ 910</a>. In that case the claimant, a morbidly obese man,
made a funding request to the trust for gastric surgery. This was refused
because he did not meet the trust’s policy of offering funding to people who
had a body mass index which exceeded a certain level. The claimant sought
judicial review of the trust's decision on the ground, inter alia, that it had
breached his right to respect for his private and family life under article 8
of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental
Freedoms (ECHR). The application was dismissed, the Court of Appeal holding
that article 8 of ECHR did not give rise to a positive duty on a statutory
health care provider to consider non-clinical, social or welfare considerations
wider than the comparative medical conditions and medical needs of different
patients when deciding on the allocation of funding for medical treatment. At
para 4 Toulson LJ said of section 3 of the 2006 Act, “this is a public law duty
and not a direct duty owed to individual patients”. He did <i>not </i>say,
however, that an individual, affected by a decision was not entitled to
challenge the legal validity of the policy. Mr Condliff had challenged the
failure of the trust to depart from its policy because of his individual
circumstances. This is not the species of challenge made by A and B. They
challenge the policy, not a refusal to make an exception in their case. The <i>Condliff
</i>decision is not germane to their circumstances. In my judgment, the
arguments of the Secretary of State in relation to target duties must fail. I
would therefore allow the appeal.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">The human rights challenge</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para83">83.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I fully agree with Lord Wilson, for the reasons that he gives, that the
appellants’ complaint plainly comes within the ambit of article 8 of ECHR. I
also agree with his conclusion, stated in para 31 of his judgment, that “the
respondent cannot deny that he treated women usually resident in England
differently from women who, although UK citizens, were usually resident in
Northern Ireland”. But I cannot agree with his decision that that difference in
treatment is justified.</a></p><a name="para83">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para83"></a><a name="para84">84.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Wilson has said (in para 32) that the legitimate aim of the
Secretary of State, in deciding not to permit women from NI to have abortions
on the NHS in England, was to “stay loyal to a legitimate scheme for health
services to be devolved in the interests of securing local provision to
residents in each of our four countries”. For the reasons that I have earlier
given, I do not consider that there was any call on his loyalty to apply such
an interdiction. Properly understood, section 1 of the 2006 Act imposed twin
but distinct duties on the Secretary of State. Simply stated these were (i) to
promote a health service that would bring about an improvement in the health of
the citizens of the country for which he had responsibility, <i>viz </i>England;
and (ii) to provide medical services that would lead to better diagnosis and
treatment of illness <i>in</i> England. Permitting women who come from NI to
have their abortions on the NHS involves no compromise on the scheme of having
each of our four countries being responsible for local provision of medical
services. Allowing NI women to have abortions on the NHS in England does not
impinge on the NI Assembly’s continuing responsibility for the provision of
medical services in Northern Ireland.</a></p><a name="para84">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para84"></a><a name="para85">85.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The important point on which to focus is that the responsibility is one
which is discharged on a geographical basis. The English Secretary of State is
responsible for providing proper medical services in England. The Northern
Irish Minister for Health is responsible for providing such services in NI. If
an Englishwoman is treated in NI on the NHS for a condition suffered during a
visit to that country, no interference with the scheme for the four countries
arises. Likewise, no interference would arise if NI women who are in England
were permitted to have abortions on the NHS. If the avowed aim is that
articulated by Lord Wilson, therefore, I cannot accept that this is legitimate.
It cannot feature in any assessment of justification for the differential
treatment.</a></p><a name="para85">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Two other conceivable aims should be mentioned as possible candidates for
being a legitimate aim. The first is the decision that the NHS should not fund
services for NI residents which the Assembly has decided not to legislate to
provide, and which would be unlawful if provided in Northern Ireland. For the
reasons given earlier, I do not consider that this can possibly qualify as a
legitimate aim. The second is cost. This has never been put forward as a
legitimate aim, although it did feature as a matter which the Secretary of
State claimed should be taken into account as part of the balancing exercise,
the fourth in the now well-established four stage evaluation of claimed
justification for interference with a Convention right - see <i>R (Aguilar
Quila) v Secretary of State for the Home Department (AIRE Centre intervening)</i>
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2011/45.html">[2012] 1 AC 621</a>, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2011/45.html">[2011] UKSC 45</a>; <i>Bank Mellat v HM Treasury (No 2)</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2013/39.html">[2014] AC 700</a>, <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2013/39.html">[2013] UKSC 39</a>; and <i>R (Tigere) v Secretary of State for Business,

possible relevance to a balancing exercise it simply cannot be considered as a
legitimate aim. Indeed, Mr Coppel, during oral argument, said on behalf of the
Secretary of State, “It has never been our position that the reason abortion
[for women from NI] is not provided on the NHS is that it would be too costly.”</p>

</span>If no legitimate aim exists for the interference with the appellants’
article 8 rights, when read with article 14, the entire edifice of
justification crumbles. It is therefore unnecessary for me to address the other
three stages identified in <i>Aguilar Quila </i>and the other cases referred to
in the preceding paragraph. I should like to say something about the issue
dealt with by Lord Reed in his judgment concurring with Lord Wilson.</a></p><a name="para87">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para87"><span class="sb8d990e2">88.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Although academic in the present case (for reasons that I will
give presently) the issue discussed by Lord Reed is an important and difficult
one. Lord Reed has formulated the issue in this way: “whether laws or
administrative practices adopted within one of the constituent parts of the UK,
which differentiate between UK citizens according to whether they are or are
not residents of that part, fall within the scope of article 14 of the European
Convention on Human Rights.” As he has pointed out, although the issue was on,
at least, the periphery of some cases considered by the European Court of Human
Rights or the European Commission on Human Rights in Strasbourg, it has not
often been directly dealt with. It was canvassed on the applicant’s behalf in <span class="sb8d990e2"><i>Dudgeon v United Kingdom </i></span><span class="sb8d990e2">(1981)<i>
</i></span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/1981/5.html">4 EHRR 149</a> and raised in <i>Nelson v United Kingdom </i>(1986) 49 DR 170 <span class="sb8d990e2">as Lord Reed has said. The issue occupied centre
stage in <i>Magee v United Kingdom</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2000/216.html">(2001) 31 EHRR 35</a>, discussed by Lord
Wilson at para 25 and more fully addressed by Lord Reed in paras 43 and 44 of
his judgment.</span></p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span class="sb8d990e2">89.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span class="sb8d990e2">Lord Reed has referred to the important
statement of principle in the dissenting opinion of Judge Matscher in <i>Dudgeon</i>
where he stated in forthright terms that differences in legislation in
different states in a federation could never amount to discrimination, and the
question of justification for such differences simply did not arise. Judge
Matscher did not address the question of whether Mr Dudgeon could have claimed
“other status”, I suspect because he would have regarded the question as
otiose.</span></p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span class="sb8d990e2">90.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span class="sb8d990e2">In <i>Magee </i>the principal reason that
the applicant failed in his article 14 claim was that he had been arrested and
detained under statutory provisions and a regime of detention that was unique
to Northern Ireland among the jurisdictions of the United Kingdom and that his
claim that he had received differential treatment from <i>that which he would
have received </i>had he been arrested in any other part of the UK was not
viable. However, the decision was expressed by the court (and I agree with Lord
Reed that it is not entirely clear on which precise basis they reached their
conclusion), the claim was bound to fail on the fundamental basis articulated
by Judge Matscher in <i>Dudgeon. </i>Individual jurisdictions within a federal
system are entitled to devise their own laws. They are not required to
subscribe to a common model. In effect, Mr Magee’s claim, in order to succeed,
would have had to assert that laws could not be enacted in Northern Ireland
which had less favourable effect on those detained than did the relevant laws
in other parts of the UK.</span></p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para91">91.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span class="sb8d990e2">The appellants’ case is fundamentally different.
They do not assert that the law in Northern Ireland should correspond with that
in England. They claim that when women from Northern Ireland are <i>in </i>England,
they are entitled to be treated in the same way as Englishwomen in the
provision of abortion services. To analogise with the position in <i>Magee, </i>if
the applicant in that case had been arrested in England, he would have been
entitled to the same detention regime as would have been afforded Englishmen
arrested for the same offences. The appellants derive their status as women <i>from</i>
NI who have been treated differentially from women <i>in</i> England. I
therefore consider that they are entitled to succeed on their human rights
claim also.</span></a></p><a name="para91">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I too would have allowed this appeal, for the reasons given by Lord
Kerr. In particular, I agree with him that the aim in section 1(1)(b) of the
National Health Service Act 2006 is not limited to the prevention, diagnosis
and treatment of illness in the “people of England” (whatever that may mean).
It is only the aim in section 1(1)(a), the improvement of those people’s
physical and mental health, which is so limited. I also agree that the relevant
services listed in section 3(1), specifically, “(a) hospital accommodation, (b)
other accommodation for the purpose of any service provided under this Act, (c)
medical, dental, ophthalmic, nursing and ambulance services” are designed, or
principally designed, to meet the aim of treating illness in section 1(1)(b)
rather than health promotion in section 1(1)(a). The question, therefore, is
whether a policy of not providing the medical service of terminating
pregnancies under the Abortion Act 1967 to women who live in Northern Ireland
is consistent with the duty to provide (or secure the provision of) such
services as are “necessary to meet all reasonable requirements”.</a></p><a name="para92">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In considering what is reasonably required, regard must be had to some
of the fundamental values underlying our legal system, values which were
stressed in the helpful intervention on behalf of the Alliance for Choice,
British Pregnancy Advisory Service, Birthrights, Family Planning Association
and Abortion Support Network. These include autonomy and equality, both of
which are aspects of an even more fundamental value, which is respect for human
dignity. The right of pregnant women to exercise autonomy in relation to
treatment and care has been hard won but it has been won. In <i>St George’s
Healthcare NHS Trust v S </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1998/1349.html">[1999] Fam 26</a>, 50 Judge LJ, giving the judgment of
the court, said this:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In our judgment while pregnancy
increases the personal responsibilities of a woman it does not diminish her
entitlement to decide whether or not to undergo medical treatment. Although
human, and protected by the law in a number of different ways set out in the
judgment in <i>In re MB (An</i> <i>Adult: Medical Treatment) </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1997/3093.html">[1997] 2 FCR 541</a>, an unborn child is not a separate person from its [sic] mother. Its need
for medical assistance does not prevail over her rights. She is entitled not to
be forced to submit to an invasion of her body against her will, whether her
own life or that of her unborn child depends on it. Her right is not reduced or
diminished merely because her decision to exercise it may appear morally repugnant.
The declaration in this case involved the removal of the baby from within the
body of her mother under physical compulsion. Unless lawfully justified this
constituted an infringement of the mother’s autonomy. Of themselves the
perceived needs of the foetus did not provide the necessary justification.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para94">94.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>That case was concerned with autonomy in the negative sense, the right
to refuse medical treatment, even though it would save the baby’s life. The
more recent case of <i>Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board (General Medical
Council intervening) </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/11.html">[2015] UKSC 11</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/11.html">[2015] AC 1430</a>, is concerned with the
positive right to choose what treatment to have. The court emphasised that “an
adult person of sound mind is entitled to decide which, if any, of the
available forms of treatment to undergo” (para 87) and therefore to be provided
with the information necessary to enable her to make that choice, a choice in
which she is entitled to be guided by her own values and preferences (para
115). Of course, there are sometimes countervailing considerations which
constrain her choices. Abortion is only available in Great Britain if both the
substantive and the procedural requirements of the Abortion Act 1967 are
complied with. But if they are, it is the woman’s choice whether or not to have
that abortion. It is a reasonable requirement to provide her with a service,
wherever she comes from. The NHS can charge women from abroad to whom they
provide abortion services. But they cannot charge women from the United
Kingdom, however great their need.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para95">95.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This is to deny pregnant women from Northern Ireland the same right to
choose what is done with their bodies as is enjoyed by all other pregnant
citizens of the United Kingdom. It is inconsistent with the principle of equal
treatment which underlies so much of our law. This is not to say that the law
in Northern Ireland has to be the same as the law in the rest of the United
Kingdom. That is not what this case is about. But it is to say that a woman
from Northern Ireland who is in Great Britain ought not to be denied, as a
matter of policy, the same rights as other women here enjoy.</a></p><a name="para95">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para95"></a><a name="para96">96.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Nor is it to say that the NHS must always provide exactly the same
services throughout the United Kingdom. There are often difficult choices to be
made which will depend upon many factors, some of which will be local to the
place where the services are provided. But pregnancy is a special case. As Lord
Bingham of Cornhill explained in <i>Rees v Darlington Memorial Hospital NHS
Trust </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2003/52.html">[2003] UKHL 52</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2003/52.html">[2004] 1 AC 309</a>, at p 317, having a child that she
did not want to have denies a woman the opportunity “to live her life in the
way that she wished and planned” (I tried to explain the full extent of the
denial of her autonomy in <i>Parkinson v St James and Seacroft University
Hospital NHS Trust </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2001/530.html">[2001] EWCA Civ 530</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2001/530.html">[2002] QB 266</a>). Many women will
nevertheless choose to continue the pregnancy and take care of the child. But a
lawful abortion restores her autonomy and respects her dignity.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para97">97.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is for those reasons that I also agree that the policy is
incompatible with the Convention rights of women from Northern Ireland. The
protection of dignity and autonomy is a core value underlying the rights
guaranteed by article 8. The difference in treatment by the NHS in England
between women from England and women from Northern Ireland cannot be justified
by respect for the democratic decisions made in Northern Ireland as to what
will be provided by the NHS there. In fact, the reason why abortion is only
available on a very limited basis in Northern Ireland is not that the NHS has
chosen to provide different services there. It is that the criminal law of
Northern Ireland remains as it was in England before the Abortion Act 1967 was
passed. The NHS there could not provide abortion on a wider basis there even if
it wanted to do so. There is no question of trying to change the criminal law
of Northern Ireland. But that law does not prohibit women from travelling to
England to have an abortion which is perfectly lawful here. It cannot constitute
a good reason for a policy of denying them health services which are lawful
here.</a></p><a name="para97">
