The first concerns the correct approach to article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (“the Convention”) in deportation cases consequent upon criminal offending by those who entered and lawfully settled in the United Kingdom as children; the second concerns the approach to the test of “very significant obstacles to integration” in the receiving state in such cases.</p> 
<p class="ParaHeading">Background</p> 
</a><a name="para2">
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">2.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant is a national of Iran and was born on 4 October 1995. He arrived in the United Kingdom with his mother on 24 February 2005 having been given leave to enter and indefinite leave to remain under the family reunion policy on 7 February 2005. He does not have any family ties with Iran but speaks Farsi with his mother. The appellant’s mother has a friend in Iran whom she has visited on more than one occasion. The appellant has an established private and family life in the United Kingdom which would be interfered with by his deportation. He has a particularly strong bond with his mother and his deportation would be a source of considerable distress to her. He has lived with her all his life. He has had a difficult upbringing because of his father’s violent conduct which he has experienced and witnessed.</p> 
</a><a name="para3">
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">3.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On 8 December 2009 he was convicted of three counts of attempted robbery and sentenced to a 12-month referral order. The appellant was one of a group of young people who attempted to rob others on two consecutive nights at Mortlake Station. On 8 November 2011 he was convicted of possession of an offensive weapon and sentenced to a six-month referral order. That related to possession of a knuckle duster which the appellant said he was carrying for his personal protection.</p> 
</a><a name="para4">
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">4.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On 14 March 2013, aged 17, he was convicted of six counts of robbery, three counts of attempted robbery and one count of handling stolen property. On 11 April 2013 he was sentenced to three years’ detention in a Young Offender Institution. All the robberies were committed at night between 28 December 2012 and 8 January 2013 around Barnes Pond and the Common. The appellant deliberately chose this area to target “young posh people”.</p> 
</a><a name="para5">
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">5.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to the Sentencing Remarks, […] the victims were aged between 15 and 18 years and the offences were committed at knifepoint. One 16-year-old girl collapsed causing her friends to think she was having a heart attack and the last victim was held around the neck with a threat to slit his throat. The mobile phones and other items stolen were sold so that the appellant could fund his addiction to cannabis. The appellant was apprehended as a result of a police operation consequent upon this spate of violent robberies.</p> 
</a><a name="para6">
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">6.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In light of his most recent convictions the Secretary of State deemed it to be conducive to the public good to make a deportation order and the appellant was so advised on 15 November 2013. The letter containing reasons for the decision set out the history of offending and the length of the most recent sentence. The Youth Offending Team noted that the latest offence was part of an emerging pattern of offending relating to acquisitive crime, threats of violence and weapons. At the time of the commission of the offence the appellant posed a high risk of serious harm. Having spent a significant period of time in custody his risk of serious harm was considered medium. The risk was heavily linked to lifestyle, peer group and drug use.</p> 
</a><a name="para7">
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">7.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Secretary of State accepted that the appellant had established some degree of private life in the United Kingdom and that he had family ties there. Removal to Iran would cause a degree of interference with private and family life but in light of the seriousness of the case this was not deemed sufficient to constitute a breach of article 8 of the Convention. Family and private life could be maintained through modern forms of communication although there would be some short-term hardship in returning to Iran. The appellant could re-establish a private life in Iran on his return.</p> 
</a><a name="para8">
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">8.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The pre-sentence report dated 9 April 2013 considered that the appellant was an academically capable young man who could articulate himself in an appropriate manner. He had completed some GCSE qualifications. The Secretary of State concluded that those skills and qualifications could be used to gain employment in Iran and provide the appellant with an income. There were no insurmountable obstacles to re-establishing private life there; nor did the interference caused by the appellant’s return outweigh the public interest in deporting him.</p> 
</a><a name="para9">
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">9.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 imposed a duty on the Secretary of State to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in the United Kingdom. As the appellant had only recently become 18 years of age it was accepted that his best interests were a primary consideration in making the decision but the Home Office considered that there were other factors which outweighed them. There were no exceptional circumstances to prevent his lawful removal and his removal was in accordance with the Immigration Rules.</p>

The Rules are not law but they give effect to the policy of the Secretary of State who has been entrusted by Parliament with responsibility for immigration control and is accountable to Parliament for the discharge of those responsibilities. The Immigration Act 1971 (“the 1971 Act”) requires that they should be laid before Parliament and they may be the subject of debate. They can be disapproved under the negative resolution procedure.

As explained by Lord Reed in <i>Hesham Ali</i> at para 14, Parliamentary and public concern about failures to deport large numbers of foreign citizens who had committed serious offences in the UK led to the passing of the UK Borders Act 2007 which provided in section 32(4) that, for the purpose of section 3(5)(a) of the 1971 Act, the deportation of a foreign criminal is conducive to the public good. This provision did not apply in the case of an offender who was under 18 at the time of the commission of the offence. In those cases the Secretary of State had to make a case-specific assessment. A foreign criminal included a person who was not a British citizen and had been convicted of an offence resulting in a sentence of imprisonment of at least 12 months.</p>

The 2012 Rules were intended to promote consistency, predictability and transparency in decision-making where issues under article 8 arose and reflected the Government’s and Parliament’s view of how, as a matter of public policy, the balance should be struck between the right to respect for private and family life and the public interest in public safety by protecting the public from foreign criminals.</p>

Where a person was liable to deportation the presumption was that the public interest required deportation. A deportation order would not, however, be made if the person’s removal pursuant to the order would be contrary to the UK’s obligations under the Convention.

That section amended the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (“the 2002 Act”) by inserting section 117C which was entitled “Article 8: additional considerations in cases involving foreign criminals”. This new provision stated that the deportation of foreign criminals was in the public interest, that the more serious the offence committed by the foreign criminal the greater the public interest in deportation and that in the case of a foreign criminal who had not been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years or more the public interest required his deportation unless one of two exceptions applied.</p>

There is an established European Court of Human Rights (“ECtHR”) Grand Chamber jurisprudence dealing with cases of deportation as a result of criminal offending by a settled migrant. It is common cause that the Convention does not guarantee the right of an alien to enter or to reside in a particular country and that contracting states have the power to expel an alien convicted of criminal offences.

That margin can be exercised by Parliament or the executive through legislation or Rules or contained in judicial decisions but is subject to European supervision.

He was granted an unlimited settlement permit in 1999 aged 15. Between late 1998 and early 2000 he committed multiple aggravated burglaries and on one occasion kicked and bruised another boy. His offending was linked to his drug addiction and in September 1999 a condition was imposed on his suspended sentence that he undergo drug therapy. He failed to undergo the drug therapy and committed further offences as a result of which he was sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment and his suspended sentence of 13 months was put into operation. He was ordered to be excluded from Austria in January 2001 and was eventually removed to Bulgaria in December 2003.</p>

When the interference with article 8 rights pursued as a legitimate aim the prevention of disorder or crime those criteria ultimately were designed to help evaluate the extent to which the subject could be expected to cause disorder or to engage in criminal activities (<i>Maslov</i> at para 70). In cases involving the expulsion of young adults who had not yet founded a family of their own the Grand Chamber identified the relevant criteria at para 71 as:</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the nature and seriousness of the offence committed by the applicant;</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the length of the applicant’s stay in the country from which he or she is to be expelled;</p> 
<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the time elapsed since the offence was committed and the applicant’s conduct during that period; and</p>

Similarly at para 73 when assessing the length of an offender’s stay in the country from which he was to be expelled and the solidity of the social, cultural and family ties within the host country, it made a difference whether the person concerned had already come to the country during his childhood or youth or whether he only came as an adult. The rationale behind making the duration of a person’s stay in the host country one of the elements to be taken into account lay in the assumption that the longer a person had been residing in a particular country the stronger his or her ties with that country were and the weaker the ties with the country of his nationality would be. That applied particularly to those who spent most if not all of their childhood in the host country, were brought up there and received their education there (see <i>Üner</i> at para 58).</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In short, the court considers that for a settled migrant who has lawfully spent all or the major part of his or her childhood and youth in the host country, very serious reasons are required to justify expulsion. This is all the more so where the person concerned committed the offences underlying the expulsion measure as a juvenile.”</p>

It found that the age of the offender was a decisive feature. There was only one violent offence which consisted of pushing, kicking and bruising another juvenile. The conclusion was that the offences could be regarded as acts of juvenile delinquency. Where expulsion measures against a juvenile offender were concerned the obligation to take the best interests of the child into account included an obligation to facilitate his or her reintegration. That was not achieved by severing family and social ties through expulsion which was a last resort in the case of a juvenile offender. The court recognised, however, that very serious violent offences can justify expulsion even if they were committed by a minor.</p>

He committed no further offences after January 2000. It was relevant to take into account the entire period up to December 2003 when he was expelled in looking at the time which had elapsed after the commission of the offences. He spent the formative years of his childhood and youth in Austria. He spoke German and all his principal social, cultural and family ties were in Austria. He did not speak Bulgarian and had no close ties with that country. Taking all of those factors into account the court concluded that the imposition of an exclusion order was disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.</p>

Between the ages of 15 and 18 he committed a range of criminal offences involving violence, public disorder, acquisitive crime and drug use. This culminated in a conviction shortly after his 18th birthday for violent disorder when he engaged with others in a serious random assault. He showed no remorse. His mother lived in Turkey and there was ample evidence of social, cultural and family ties there. The First-tier Tribunal dismissed his appeal against deportation. Leave to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was refused noting that he had a long history of offending and remained a continuing risk of harm to others.</p>

Irrespective of other factors involved unless the state could show that there were “very serious reasons” for deporting a settled migrant who had lawfully spent all the major part of his childhood and youth in the host country his article 8 rights would prevail.

Giving the judgment of the court Sir Stanley Burnton considered first, that the words “In short” at the beginning of para 75 of <i>Maslov</i> meant that what followed was a summary of the effect of the jurisprudence discussed in the preceding paragraphs. Secondly, the ultimate conclusion at paras 100 and 101 of the <i>Maslov</i> judgment summarised the outcome of each of the criteria set out at para 22 above. That summary offered no support for the view that para 75 imposed a separate test. Thirdly, the circumstances of settled migrants may vary enormously and it would be irrational to apply a single test in relation to the level of offending in each case. Fourthly, frequent and continuing repetition of offences that are not individually serious may amount to serious offending and justify expulsion.</p>

In considering the approach to the applicant’s length of stay in the UK the court accepted that he had been there since the age of three and had spent virtually the whole of his childhood in the country. The court relied upon <i>Maslov</i> to conclude that very serious reasons would be required to outweigh that factor and justify his expulsion. The court then turned to examine the solidity of his ties to the host and destination countries. In summary having balanced the criteria the court concluded that deportation was not disproportionate in the circumstances of that case.</p>

The child-focussed considerations were taken into account in the application of those criteria. There is no dispute between the parties that age is relevant to the application of those criteria and the cases both at domestic and European level support that approach. The court’s decision was based on a conventional balancing exercise having carefully assessed the four <i>Üner</i> criteria identified in <i>Maslov</i>.</p>

The applicant travelled with his family to the United Kingdom from Pakistan in 1978 when he was seven and was granted indefinite leave to remain. His mother and siblings were naturalised British citizens and his six children were all born in the UK. Between 1992 and 2001 he was convicted of numerous criminal offences for which he was sentenced to custodial and non-custodial sentences which culminated in a conviction for robbery in 2001 for which he was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. He was deported to Pakistan in 2010.</p>

The court referred to <i>Maslov</i> in the context of the weight to be given to the length of time in the host country. Its conclusion was, however, based on an assessment of the conventional balancing exercise in article 8 cases:</p> 
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“His private and family life in the United Kingdom were not such as to outweigh the risk he presented of future offending and harm to the public and his deportation was therefore proportionate to the legitimate aim of preventing crime.” (para 41)</p>

This was an admissibility decision in relation to a Somali national who came to the UK aged seven and thereafter committed multiple criminal offences both as a juvenile and as an adult. The court identified the <i>Üner</i> criteria. It noted the importance of age by reference to para 75 of <i>Maslov</i>. Having evaluated the relevant factors the court again carried out the conventional balancing exercise and found the complaint manifestly ill-founded and inadmissible.</p>

The analysis in <i>JO (Uganda)</i>, <i>MW (Democratic Republic of Congo)</i> and <i>Akpinar</i> correctly identifies that paragraph as containing a summary of the implications of the preceding paragraphs the effect of which is to recognise that the weight that should be given to those criteria will depend upon the circumstances.

The respondent was given leave to appeal on the basis that the tribunal had applied the criteria under the 2012 Rules rather than those under the 2014 Rules.

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The requirement for ‘European supervision’ does not mean that in determining whether an impugned measure struck a fair balance between the relevant interests, it is necessarily the court’s task to conduct the article 8 proportionality assessment afresh. On the contrary, in article 8 cases the court has generally understood the margin of appreciation to mean that, where the independent and impartial domestic courts have carefully examined the facts, applying the relevant human rights standards consistently with the Convention and its case law, and adequately balanced the applicant’s personal interests against the more general public interest in the case, it is not for it to substitute its own assessment of the merits (including, in particular, its own assessment of the factual details of proportionality) for that of the competent national authorities. The only exception to this is where there are shown to be strong reasons for doing so (see <i>Ndidi v United Kingdom</i>, Application No 41215/14,  <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/ECHR/2017/781.html">[2017] ECHR 781</a>, para 76 …).”</p>

It carried out its assessment of the decision to deport in accordance with the statutory criteria set out in the 2002 Act and the terms of the 2014 Rules. The statute and Rules provided that the public interest required his deportation unless the relevant exception applied or there were very compelling reasons to prevent his deportation. The first step was the consideration of the nature and seriousness of the offences. These were knifepoint robberies at night of victims aged between 15 and 18 years. The offences were pre-planned against vulnerable young victims who were likely to have goods of value. There was a background of previous offences by the appellant of attempted robberies and possession of an offensive weapon. Even though the offender was a youth he was sentenced to three years’ detention. He would have received a much longer sentence if he was an adult.</p>

The Upper Tribunal noted that the entirety of the applicant’s offending occurred between the ages of 14 and 17 and that the most recent conviction was his first custodial sentence. These were, however, plainly very serious, violent offences which distinguished this case from <i>Maslov</i>.</p>

Consideration was given to the factors impacting upon the risks in this case. The appellant was very close to his mother but her influence had been unable to prevent him engaging over a period of years in acquisitive and violent crime. He had been traumatised by the violence of his father but had benefitted from treatment in respect of that. At the time of his detection he was assessed as posing a high risk of serious harm. The pre-sentence report indicated that he still posed a medium risk of serious harm and that risk was linked to lifestyle, peer group and drug use. The rehabilitative measures provided in the custodial environment had achieved some reduction in risk but the underlying causes continued to give material concern about serious harm. At the time of that assessment he was an adult.</p>

It then considered whether there were very significant obstacles to the appellant’s integration into Iran. That test is set in those terms because it only arises in cases where there will already have been a finding that the offender has engaged in significant offending thereby raising serious concerns about the public interest in the prevention of crime.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In my view, the concept of a foreign criminal’s ‘integration’ into the country to which it is proposed that he be deported, as set out in section 117C(4)(c) and paragraph 399A, is a broad one. It is not confined to the mere ability to find a job or to sustain life while living in the other country. It is not appropriate to treat the statutory language as subject to some gloss and it will usually be sufficient for a court or tribunal simply to direct itself in the terms that Parliament has chosen to use. The idea of ‘integration’ calls for a broad evaluative judgment to be made as to whether the individual will be enough of an insider in terms of understanding how life in the society in that other country is carried on and a capacity to participate in it, so as to have a reasonable opportunity to be accepted there, to be able to operate on a day-to-day basis in that society and to build up within a reasonable time a variety of human relationships to give substance to the individual's private or family life.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">56.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The tribunal assessed the obstacles to integration by essentially adopting a balance sheet approach. The appellant had not been in Iran since he was nine years old. He had become used to life in the United Kingdom and the relative freedoms that he enjoyed as a young person in this country were unlikely to be as readily available in Iran. The tribunal accepted that he did not read or write Farsi. He was not aware of any relatives in Iran and there was nothing to indicate that his mother has any contact with any such relatives. He would have difficulties in obtaining employment and/or further education or training because of the length of his absence from Iran and the lack of ability to read or write.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">57.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the other hand this was not a case of an individual returning to a country with which he had no familiarity. The appellant spoke Farsi conversing with his mother. The pre-sentence report indicated that he presented as an academically capable young man who was able to articulate himself in an appropriate manner. He obviously had ambitions and was interested in becoming a mechanic. All of that suggested that he would be able to adapt to life in Iran because of his intelligence and his ability to speak the language.</p> 
</a><a name="para58">
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">58.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition the appellant was not utterly isolated from Iranian culture in terms of knowing nothing about it and not having the ability to adapt to it. He had always lived with his mother who had connections in Iran which was where she was born, brought up and lived as an adult. His mother visited Iran in 2008 and 2012 staying for about two weeks each time. She had a friend there whom she visited and with whom she kept in touch.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">59.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The tribunal accepted that the mother’s ties to Iran were not the appellant’s ties but it considered that the fact that the appellant’s mother had visited Iran, retained a connection with the country and had a close friend there was relevant. Those were factors which could reasonably be said to afford the appellant some assistance in terms of integration. He could remain in contact with his mother. He had at least one point of contact in the country to which reference could be made by or on behalf of the appellant. It was unrealistic to suppose that his mother’s friend would provide no assistance or support at all bearing in mind her close friendship with the appellant’s mother.</p>

I accept that there was no direct evidence to indicate the nature of the support that the friend could provide but I consider that the tribunal was properly able to infer that the friend was a point of contact. There is nothing to suggest that the tribunal overstated the contribution that the mother’s friend could make.</p>

That showed a certain robustness of character. That had to be read alongside the evidence from the psychologist about the treatment that he received in light of the witnessing and experiencing of domestic violence.</p>

It went on to consider how he might integrate in terms of culture and the support he was likely to get from his mother who had visited Iran relatively recently. Applying the test set out in <i>Kamara</i> there was ample material to justify the conclusion of the tribunal that the obstacles to the appellant’s integration into Iran were not very significant. It follows that this basis for the appeal fails.</p> 
</a><a name="para63">
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">63.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As indicated in the preceding paragraphs the tribunal had given adequate consideration to the length of the appellant’s stay in the United Kingdom and the solidity of social, cultural and family ties with the UK and Iran. In considering the time elapsed since the offence was committed and his conduct during that period the tribunal examined in particular the extent to which his risk of further offending had been affected by the rehabilitative efforts he had undergone in prison. The position remained that he presented as a medium risk of serious harm and his offending was heavily linked to his lifestyle, peer group and drug use. Despite the efforts to reintegrate the appellant he remained a danger to the public.</p> 
<p class="ParaHeading">Conclusion</p>

Given the seriousness of the offending and the continuing risk of serious harm resulting from criminal offending it did not consider that the deportation of the appellant was disproportionate or that there were very compelling reasons to prevent it. It gave relevant and sufficient reasons for its conclusion. There was substantial material to support its view that the interference with the private and family life of the appellant was outweighed by the public interest in the prevention of crime. I would, therefore, dismiss the appeal.</p>

A decision to deport should reflect circumstances as they are at the time of deportation (see <i>Maslov</i> at para 93). Section 5(2) of the Immigration Act 1971 and the Immigration Rules provide a mechanism for the revocation of a deportation order. It will be for the appellant to consider whether there has been a material change of circumstances upon which to found a fresh claim.</p> </a></div><a name="para65">
