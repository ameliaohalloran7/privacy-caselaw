<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I can take the underlying facts from the agreed statement of facts and
issues. The appellants are employed as teachers at the respondent’s sixth form
college. They have brought this action and pursued this appeal supported by
their union, the NASUWT. Their contracts of employment incorporate terms
relating to working time from a collective agreement entitled <i>Conditions of
Service Handbook for Teaching Staff in Sixth Form Colleges.</i> It is known as
the Red Book. When sixth form teachers whose contracts of employment
incorporate the Red Book go on strike their employer can withhold their pay. The
issue in these proceedings and in this appeal is how much the employer can
deduct for each day of strike action.</a></p><a name="para1">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On 30 November 2011 the appellants participated in a full day of lawful
strike action. On or about 31 January 2012, the respondent made deductions from
their pay at the rate of 1/260 of their annual pay. The figure of 260 was
arrived at by taking 365 days, less weekends, that is by taking the total
number of weekdays in the calendar year. The appellants say that the
appropriate deduction was 1/365 of their annual pay, pursuant to section 2 of
the Apportionment Act 1870 (“the Act”). The contracts of employment in
secondary education, that is at schools rather than sixth form colleges,
include an express term contained in the relevant agreement, which is known as
the Burgundy Book, that when teachers are on strike their employers are
entitled to deduct salary at the rate of 1/365 of their annual pay.</a></p><a name="para2">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Act is entitled “An Act for the better apportionment of rents and
other periodical payments”. Section 2 is entitled “Rents, <span style="font-size:11.5pt">&amp;c to </span><span style="font-size:12.5pt">accrue

</span>On 24 April 2013, the appellants commenced proceedings in the Birmingham
County Court alleging that the respondent was in breach of contract and
claiming monies owed pursuant to section 2 of the Act to the extent that the
deductions from their pay exceeded 1/365 of their annual wage entitlement in
respect of each strike day. On 17 June 2013, between the issue of proceedings
and the trial of this action Jay J handed down judgment in the High Court in <i>Amey
v Peter Symonds College </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2013/2788.html">[2013] EWHC 2788 (QB)</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2013/2788.html">[2014] IRLR 206</a>, which
determined the same issue in favour of the defendant, which was another sixth
form college, by reference to the same generic contractual terms and on the
basis of very similar, if not identical, facts. Jay J held that while “accruing
from day to day” in section 2 must be construed as referring to calendar days,
section 7 applied to disapply section 2 because the claimant’s contract
necessarily implied that his pay was tied to his directed time work. [For the
definition of “directed time” see paras 14 and 16 below.] The claimant, who was
not a member of NASUWT, did not appeal to the Court of Appeal.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para6">6.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The respondent in the present case applied for summary judgment on the
basis that the County Court would be bound by the <i>Amey </i>judgment. The
appellants agreed that that was so but resisted summary judgment on the basis
that they wanted to seek determination of the point of principle by the Court
of Appeal and could only do so if a “final” determination were entered in
favour of the respondent, from which it could apply to the Court of Appeal for
permission to appeal pursuant to CPR Part 52 and Practice Direction 52A. As a
result, the parties agreed a consent order which was approved by DDJ Viney and
referred to in para 2 of the consent order dated 27 February 2014. Pursuant to
that order the respondent withdrew its application for summary judgment and,
the parties having agreed the material facts, the appellants consented to final
judgment being entered in favour of the respondent on the basis that the <i>Amey
</i>judgment was binding, but without prejudice to the appellants’ right to
argue on appeal that <i>Amey </i>was wrongly decided and/or that their case
should be decided differently on the basis of the agreed facts.</a></p><a name="para6">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On 1 July 2014 HHJ McKenna gave the appellants permission to appeal
directly to the Court of Appeal pursuant to CPR Part 52.14, in circumstances in
which Aikens LJ had indicated that the Court of Appeal was minded to accept
jurisdiction to hear the proposed appeal on that basis because it raised an
important point of principle. The appeal was heard by Elias, Tomlinson and
Sales LJJ on 19 March 2015. By a judgment handed down on 14 May 2015 given by
Elias LJ, with which Tomlinson and Sales LJJ agreed, the Court of Appeal
dismissed the appeal </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2015/455.html">[2015] ICR 1143</a>. The Court of Appeal refused permission to
appeal to this Court but permission was granted by Lady Hale, Lord Wilson and

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The central question in this appeal is how much the respondent as the
appellants’ employer can withhold from their pay for each day of strike action.
In order to answer that question, a number of further questions potentially
arise in order to decide whether the Act applies to the facts of this case. As
stated in the statement of facts and issues (albeit in a different order), they
are (a) whether the appellants’ contracts of employment provide expressly or by
necessary implication for their salary to be paid to them pro rata in respect
of divisible obligations to perform work on each day of directed time so that
the Act has no application to this case; (b) what is meant by “accruing from
day to day” in section 2 of the Act; and (c) what is the correct construction of
section 7 of the Act.</a></p><a name="para8">

<p class="ParaHeading">Discussion</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para8"></a><a name="para9">9.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Question (a) seems to me to reflect a new point which the respondent
sought to raise in this appeal which was not taken in the courts below. As
formulated (so far as I can see correctly) by the appellants, the argument that
the Act does not apply in this case has three steps as follows. (1) The Act was
made to address mischiefs which arise in the context of periodic payments which
are entire indivisible payments. (2) The contracts in this case provide
impliedly for the appellants to be paid periodically in respect only of the work
they do in directed time. (3) Therefore the periodic payments were impliedly
divisible.</a></p><a name="para9">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para9"></a><a name="para10">10.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellant objected to the new point being taken for the first time
in this Court. We heard argument on the point without ruling on the objection. Having
heard argument and considered the point I would hold that it fails. Although
the point was not argued in the Court of Appeal, that point or a very similar
one was considered in the judgment of Elias LJ between paras 23 and 32. In
particular he considered the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Item
Software (UK) Ltd v Fassihi </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2004/1244.html">[2004] EWCA Civ 1244</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2004/1244.html">[2005] ICR 450</a>, where an
employee who was also a director of a company was paid a salary monthly in
arrears. His contract was terminated on 26 June for misconduct. One of the
issues was whether he was entitled to his salary for the period during which he
worked in June before termination. The Court of Appeal accepted that at common
law the employee could not recover anything because his salary did not accrue
until the end of the month, but held that the Act applied. It held, as Elias LJ
put it in para 31 in this case, that since, by virtue of the Act, salary
accrued day by day the employee was entitled to his salary until his dismissal,
even where it was for misconduct. Holman J, with whose judgment Arden LJ
expressly agreed, said that since the Act is a remedial Act, and since the
common law rule works an injustice, the Act should not be restrictively
interpreted. Elias LJ concluded that “this would suggest that [the Act] will
now be readily applied to all employment contracts where the common law
principles pertaining to entire contracts and substantial performance would op<span style="font-size:11.5pt">erate”. </span><span style="font-size:12.5pt">Elias LJ
further concluded in para 32 that it followed that the Act </span>does, <span style="font-size:12.5pt">in principle, apply to the contracts of these
teachers. As he put it, their pay is </span>deemed <span style="font-size:12.5pt">to
</span>accrue daily. He added that t<span style="font-size:12.5pt">hat </span>was
also <span style="font-size:12.5pt">the view of </span>Scott J in<span style="font-size:12.5pt"> </span><i>Sim </i><i>v Rotherham Metropolitan Borough
Council </i>[1986] ICR 897<span style="font-size:12.5pt">, although the </span>point
<span style="font-size:12.5pt">was not </span>directly <span style="font-size:
12.5pt">argued </span>in that <span style="font-size:12.5pt">case (see further
para 22 below). Elias LJ also noted that none of the parties </span>sought <span style="font-size:12.5pt">to </span>contend <span style="font-size:12.5pt">otherwise
in the Court of Appeal.</span></p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para11">11.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Thus the first of the three steps in para 9 above was satisfied because the
Act was indeed intended to address mischiefs which arise in the context of
periodic payments which are entire indivisible payments. However, for the
reasons given below, steps (2) and (3), namely that the contracts in this case
provide impliedly for the appellants to be paid periodically in respect only of
the work they do in directed time and that it follows that the periodic
payments were impliedly divisible, were not satisfied. For these reasons I
would reject the new point sought to be advanced for the first time in this
Court. I would accordingly answer question (a) in the negative. I do not think
that the contracts of employment provide expressly or by necessary implication
for their salaries to be paid to staff pro rata in respect of divisible obligations
to perform work on each day of directed time.</a></p><a name="para11">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To my mind the correct approach to this case depends essentially upon
the application of section 2 of the Act to the contracts of employment, all of
which are upon more or less the same terms. I return below to the meaning and
effect of section 7 of the Act, which in my opinion does not apply to the facts
of this case.</a></p><a name="para12">

duties to be carried out under the reasonable direction of the Principal. Clause

</span>The Red Book contains a provision almost identical to clause 2.1 above,
except that it is para 20 and is entitled “<b>Standard Working Time”</b>, which
is thus the same as “directed time”. Paragraph 21 provides for<b> “Evening

</span>In addition, para 18 provides for payment for additional days of
directed time, which were remunerated in addition to salary, as for example by
an additional payment at a daily rate of 1/195 of the “rate for the job”. There
is also para 26, which provides that no teacher may be required to work on a Sunday,

</span>Appendix 4 includes a number of further activities involved in the work
of a teacher, which it is not necessary to particularise in any detail. The
topics are educational methods, discipline, health and safety, staff meetings,

</span>The appellants regularly performed their undirected duties outside of the
normal term-time hours, ie during weekends, evenings and/or days of annual
leave, because there was insufficient time to perform all of those duties
during such of the normal term-time hours as were not allocated to directed
time. The statement of facts and issues refers to material relevant to each of
the appellants as follows. Mr Hartley says that the volume of work was so great
that he was required to work every weekend of the year on both Saturdays and
Sundays, typically spending two to three hours carrying out undirected time
duties during a weekend. The nature of the job meant that he had no choice but
regularly to perform work in undirected time outside of the normal college day,
in the evenings, at weekends and during the holidays. Mr Panko had over 11
hours’ remission time (ie time during directed hours allocated to reflect his
additional responsibilities) but was unable to complete all of his work in that
time and regularly carried out work during evenings, weekends and holidays. Mr
Monk was similarly unable to complete all of his work during his remission and
non-contact time. If he did not do evening and weekend work he would not be
able to deliver lessons because he would not have the material, schedules and
tasks prepared. He estimates that he would do work on “somewhere between 25 and
52 weekends a year”. The amount depends on his priorities and his state of
health.</a></p><a name="para20">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The parties agree that the amount of undirected time duties broadly
correlates with the amount of directed time duties in that the more directed
time, in particular teaching time, the more undirected time is likely to be
required.</a></p><a name="para21">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Some assistance in this type of case can I think be found in the
judgment of Scott J in <i>Sim </i>at 928G-929C, which is relied upon by the
appellants as follows:</a></p><a name="para22">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In considering the scope of a
teacher’s professional obligations as a teacher, it is convenient to start with
those matters that are common ground. It is accepted that the teachers have an
obligation to teach their classes in accordance with the timetable from time to
time in force. It is accepted that they have obligations properly to prepare
for their classes and to mark the schoolwork done by their pupils either in
class or as homework. It is accepted that these latter obligations may require
work to be done outside normal school hours. To put the point another way, a
teacher could not excuse a failure to be properly prepared for a class or a
failure to mark schoolwork within a reasonable time after it had been done by
pointing out, correct though the observation might be, that he or she had not
had time within school hours to do the work. It is, perhaps, one of the
hallmarks of professional employment, as opposed to employment in
non-professional capacities, that professionals are employed to provide a
particular service and have a contractual obligation to do so properly. A
worker in a car factory or shop may clock off at 5.30 pm or, perhaps, work late
on an overtime basis. An employed professional does not usually have an
overtime option. He is employed to provide a particular service to proper
professional standards. His contract may require his attendance in an office or
other place of work for particular hours but his contractual obligations are
not necessarily limited to work done within those hours. So, too, teachers’
duties are not necessarily confined to their obligation to be on school
premises during school hours and to take their classes during those hours.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">The professional obligations of a
teacher cannot, in my opinion, be<i> </i>confined to the imparting of academic
knowledge to the pupils.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">That passage gives a picture of the wide scope of
responsibilities of teachers such as the appellants, all of which must be
reflected in their overall salaries.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para22"></a><a name="para23">23.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>So too does the speech of Lord Templeman in <i>Miles </i><i><span style="font-size:12.5pt">v Wakefield </span></i><i>Metropolitan District
Council </i><span style="font-size:12.5pt">[1987]</span> AC 539 at 556F-H,
which was relied upon by the appellants. Lord Templeman did not refer to the
Act, although section 2 had been relied upon by the successful employers. He
said this:</a></p><a name="para23">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It is unusual for the holder of
an office to take industrial action and the consequences will depend on the
rights and obligations conferred and imposed on the office-holder by the terms
of his appointment. But if <span style="font-size:13.5pt">an </span>ambassador
and the embassy porter <span style="font-size:13.5pt">were </span>both on
strike then I would expect both to be liable to lose or both to be entitled to
claim their apportioned<span style="font-size:10.0pt"> </span>remuneration
attributable to the period of the strike. A judge and an usher <span style="font-size:13.5pt">on </span>strike should arguably be treated in the <span style="font-size:13.5pt">same manner. </span>The ambassador might be required
to <span style="font-size:13.5pt">decode </span>a declaration of <span style="font-size:13.5pt">war </span>on Sunday, and a judge might devote his
Christmas holidays to the elucidation of legal problems arising from industrial
action, so that it would be necessary to divide their annual salaries by 365 to
define a daily rate applicable to the period of strike, whereas the weekly,
daily or hourly wages of the porter and the usher provide <span style="font-size:13.5pt">a </span>different basis for apportionment, …”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para23"></a><a name="para24">24.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Section 2 of the Act must be read so that it provides in effect that
“all … salaries … shall, like interest on monies lent, be considered as
accruing from day to day, and shall be apportionable in respect of time
accordingly”. In <i>Sim </i>Scott J considered section 2 at pp 935G-936A, where
he rejected a submission that teachers’ salaries accrued minute by minute and
added:</a></p><a name="para24">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Under the contracts, the salaries
are based on a yearly scale but are paid by monthly payments. Each month a
contractual right to a salary payment vests in the teacher. By reason of
section 2 of the Apportionment Act 1870, the salaries are deemed to accrue day
by day. If a teacher’s contract were, in the middle of a month, to come to an
end, by death, dismissal or some other event, section 2 would entitle the
teacher, or his estate, to an apportioned part of the month’s salary payment.
So the salaries may be regarded as accruing day by day. But they do not accrue
minute by minute. And for as long as the contract is continuing, the only
payment that can be claimed by a teacher is a monthly payment and the only
obligation to make a payment of salary that rests on the education authority is
an obligation to make a monthly payment.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">This approach to section 2 appears to me to be correct,
although on the facts Scott J held that the employer was entitled to reduce the
amount paid by way of equitable set off. The approach is not however that set
out in the judgment of Elias LJ in the Court of Appeal, to which I return
below. The use of the word “considered” in section 2 seems to me to show that
the section is a deeming provision.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para24"></a><a name="para25">25.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellants’ case was summarised in para 32 of their written case in
this way. In the case of unvarying, annualised periodic payments (whether made
once a month, or otherwise), such as the salaries of the appellants, section 2
of the Act has the effect of deeming accrual at the rate of 1/365 each day; but
only because they are unvarying annualised periodic payments. The appellants do
not and did not suggest that a periodic payment made over a period different
from (and in particular a period of less than) a calendar year should accrue at
the rate of 1/365, or should be aggregated with other periodic payments so that
the total of such payments over a calendar year should be added up and divided
so as to accrue at the rate of 1/365. Thus the application of section 2 depends
upon the terms of the particular contract. In this case we are concerned only
with an annual contract.</a></p><a name="para25">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is I think helpful to consider the arguments advanced by the parties
and the reasoning of the Court of Appeal in order to understand both the
position in the Court of Appeal and the present position. It is striking that
the argument in the Court of Appeal proceeded on the express basis (which was
not challenged by the Court of Appeal at the hearing) that, if section 2
applied and section 7 did not, the effect was that Mr Monk’s salary had to be
apportioned at the rate of 1/365 per calendar day. By contrast the respondent
put forward 1/260. It was common ground in the Court of Appeal that section 2,
if applicable, would require pay to accrue by equal amounts daily: see per
Elias LJ at para 53.</a></p><a name="para26">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para26"></a><a name="para27">27.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It was submitted on behalf of the respondent that, if the Act applied,
the terms of the contract could not be reconciled with the principle of equal
daily accrual and amounted to an express stipulation within the meaning of
section 7 that the principle in section 2 should not apply. The respondent
adopted the reasoning of Jay J in <i>Amey </i>and its submissions were recorded
by Elias LJ in para 57 as follows:</a></p><a name="para27">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The undirected duties are
subsidiary and directed towards the directed duties. As a matter of common
sense it is obvious that pay is, as Jay J expressed it at para 42, ‘tied to the
measurable part of a teacher’s work’. This is further supported by the fact
that part time workers are paid as a proportion of the full-time teaching hours
that they work; that a teacher who agrees to teach an additional day is paid
1/195 of the annual salary; and that sick pay is calculated on the basis of

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>So in the Court of Appeal the appellants argued for 1/365 per calendar
day in reliance upon section 2 and, if section 2 did not apply, upon section 7,
whereas the respondent argued for 1/260 in reliance upon section 7. In this Court
the case for the appellants was the same, whereas the respondent relied upon
section 2 on the basis of the conclusion of the Court of Appeal that section 2
does not imply the principle of equal daily accrual but at a rate which is
appropriate in the context of that contract to the particular day in question:
per Elias LJ at para 59. It appears that he would have chosen 1/195 by analogy
with the pay of part time workers, but adopted the respondent’s figure of 1/260
on the basis that it related to the total number of annual working days. Both
these approaches assume that the working days are limited to days on which
directed duties were carried out.</a></p><a name="para28">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I have reached the conclusion that the appellants’ case is to be preferred
to that of the respondent. As I see it, the difficulty with 1/260 is that,
given that the work done by the teachers described above was not limited to
work during week days, it makes no sense to choose a calculation of 1/260 of
the annual salary, which assumes only week day working. I would therefore
reject the 1/260 figure. What then should the figure be? Although, as stated
above, a case might perhaps be made for some other figure, the only alternative
figure put forward during the argument was 1/365.</a></p><a name="para29">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It might be said that the difficulty with the figure of 365 is that it
cannot be justified arithmetically. However, this is where, as it seems to me,
the statutory formula in the Act comes in. On the basis of the statutory
formula, namely that salary “shall … be considered as accruing from day to day,
and shall be apportionable in respect of time accordingly”, the most sensible
approach in order to apportion the annual salary on a day to day basis is by
treating each day as 1/365 of the annual salary. As I see it, this achieves an
overall approach which is broadly fair. The reason why it is broadly fair is
that the monthly payments are made every month, including periods when the
teacher is on holiday, and the work carried out is spread throughout the year
as explained both by Scott J and by the appellants’ evidence in this case. In
particular, it is not limited to periods when the teacher is carrying out
directed work, but includes preparatory work and the like which involves
working in the evenings and weekends.</a></p><a name="para30">

</span>I recognise that it can be said that this can give rise to surprising
results but that is almost always true of deeming provisions. They are chosen
in order to have a simple rule which can be applied in every case. Moreover,
this approach seems to me largely to adopt the approach in the cases in which
the court construed the expression “day by day” to mean daily or each calendar
day: see eg <i>Taylor v East Midlands Offender Employment </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKEAT/2000/1287_99_2007.html">[2000] IRLR 760</a>,
EAT, per Maurice Kay J at para 5 and <i>Thames Water Utilities v Reynolds </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKEAT/1995/1090_94_2211.html">[1996] IRLR 186</a>, para 22, EAT. In the latter case HH Judge Clark said this by
reference to the expression “from day to day” in section 2:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Accordingly the real question is
what is meant by the expression ‘from day to day’ in section 2 of the Act. In
our view it can only be calendar days and not working days.”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In that case the EAT expressly agreed with the view of Evans-Lombe J in <i>In
re BCCI SA </i>[1994] IRLR 282. See also, to similar effect <i>Smith v Kent County
Council</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2004/412.html">[2004] EWHC 412 (QB)</a>, where Mackay J concluded that 1/365 was
appropriate, distinguishing <i>Sim v Rotherham </i>and <i>Miles v Wakefield
Metropolitan District Council </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1987/15.html">[1987] AC 539</a> on the facts. In <i>Amey </i>Jay
J said at para 17 that that line of authority had fallen into disfavour,
although he recognised that it had not been overruled by the Court of Appeal. He
expressed that view on the basis that in <i>Leisure Leagues UK Ltd v
Maconnachie </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKEAT/2002/940_01_1403.html">[2002] IRLR 600</a> the EAT had held that the concept of day to day
accrual in the 1870 Act must be, as he put it, envisaged by reference to the
number of working days in the year and not the number of calendar days because
the EAT based itself on the Working Time Regulations 1998 (SI 1998/1833). He
also noted, at para 19, that that decision had been followed by the EAT in <i>Yarrow
v Edwards Chartered Accountants </i>[2007] All ER (D) 118 (Aug), <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKEAT/2007/0116_07_0806.html">[2007] UKEAT 0116_07_0806</a>. However, Jay J
said at para 20 that those cases were only persuasive in the High Court and
that he was not convinced that the Act can be overridden simply because it
achieves a poor fit with modern employment law. I agree, although those
Regulations set a maximum average number of hours to be worked weekly (subject
to contrary agreement), entitlement to rest periods and paid annual leave, none
of which is incompatible with the terms and conditions of the employment in
question here. It is noteworthy that Jay J then set out the provisions of
sections 2 and 7 of the Act and held in para 23 that “the reference to accruing
from ‘day to day’ in section 2 must be to each calendar day”. As I read the
decision of Jay J, it was based upon section 7 of the Act and, as explained
below, I reach a different conclusion from him in respect of section 7.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para33">33.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>We were also referred to the decision of Blake J in <i>Cooper v Isle of
Wight College </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2007/2831.html">[2008] IRLR 124</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2007/2831.html">[2007] EWHC 2831 (QB)</a>. However, that
decision seems to me to be of little assistance in deciding how section 2 works
in a case like this. Blake J referred to the part of Lord Templeman’s speech in
<i>Miles v Wakefield Metropolitan District Council </i>quoted in para 23 above,
including the passage at the end of the quote where he gave the examples of the
ambassador and the judge who might be required to devote their Sundays or
holidays to work, so that it <span style="font-size:12.5pt">would </span>be
necessary to <span style="font-size:12.5pt">divide </span>their annual <span style="font-size:12.5pt">salaries by 365 </span>to define a daily rate

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In all these circumstances the cases seem to me to show that the correct
approach under section 2 to a case like this, where the contract is an annual
contract, is to hold that the salary must be apportioned on a calendar day
basis over 365 days, which yields a daily figure of 1/365.</a></p><a name="para34">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In reaching these conclusions I am conscious that I have in this respect
reached a different conclusion from the Court of Appeal.</a></p><a name="para35">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para35"></a><a name="para36">36.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Before considering the effect of section 7, it is convenient to consider
the approach of the Court of Appeal to sections 2 and 7 together because Elias
LJ does so in paras 33 to 38 as follows:</a></p><a name="para36">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“33.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a critical element in
the claimants’ case that the effect of section 2 is that pay does not merely
accrue daily but does so at an even rate. This is the justification for
treating the pay referable to the strike day at 1/365.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">34.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No doubt for most
periodic payments that will typically be the case. There will be no reason to
assume that the payment should accrue other than by regular and equal increments.
But I do not think that section 2 dictates this result. In my view there are
strong arguments which suggest that this is neither the purpose nor the effect
of the Act. It is concerned with providing a remedy for the unfairness which
results from the fact that the common law would recognise no rights in a party
who had provided service to the employer but not for the whole of the relevant
pay period. The Act ensured an entitlement to such portion of the payment as
was referable to the period of service. To achieve that objective it is not
necessary to provide that payment accrues at an equal daily rate. Moreover, to
construe section 2 as having that effect would create a new source of
unfairness, where the rigid application of a daily rate of 1/365 would create
an injustice in the context of the particular arrangement between the relevant
parties, which it is difficult to suppose Parliament intended. The present case
illustrates the sort of problem which could arise, if the College’s argument
about the unfairness and inappropriateness of deductions being made at a rigid
daily rate of 1/365 are accepted (see below).</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">35.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two further
features of the Act which support this analysis. The first is that in section 5
there is a definition of ‘dividend’ by reference to various forms of payments,
including payments ‘out of the revenue of trading or other public companies,
divisible between all or any of the members of such respective companies shall
be usually made or declared at any fixed times or otherwise’; and the provision
then goes on to provide expressly: ‘all such divisible revenue shall, for the
purposes of this Act, be deemed to have accrued by equal daily increment during
and within the period for, or in respect of which the payment of the same
revenue shall be declared or expressed to be made …’. If section 2
automatically envisaged that payments caught by the Act would be deemed to
accrue by equal daily increments, these words would not have been required.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">36.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second lies in the
way in which the exclusion principle in section 7 is drafted. That section
envisages that the parties might displace the Act by providing in sufficiently
clear terms that no apportionment shall take place. But if there is no such
exclusion and section 2 establishes a principle of equal daily accrual, that
principle will apply. Section 7 does not provide that the parties might agree
to exclude that principle, or might otherwise draft the contract in a manner
which is at odds with that principle. Yet Parliament would surely have allowed
this had it understood that the principle was imported by section 2. The
parties have assumed that it is possible to read section 7 as allowing for that
exclusion, but as I indicate below I am very doubtful whether it can.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">37.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If that is right, the
failure to allow departure from the principle of equal daily accrual can be
explained either on the basis that the principle is not part of the Act and
therefore does not need excluding; or it is part of the Act which Parliament
intends to be mandatory in all circumstances where the Act applies. However, if
there is a principle of equal daily accrual, and especially if the parties
cannot contract out of it, that would lead to curious and potentially unjust
consequences. Take a case outside the area of employment law. Assume that a
party takes a lease and agrees to pay the landlord at the end of 12 months at a
rent which increases after six months. Suppose that the landlord sells the
freehold after six months. He would be entitled under the Act to the rent for
that period. Under the terms of the lease, that would be a smaller sum than
could be claimed by his successor because the rent has increased. But if
section 2 imposes a principle of regular and equal daily accrual, the successor
would have to account for half the full rent paid over the 12 months to the
original landlord, even though the rent for the first half of the year was
smaller.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">38.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If, contrary to my view,
the principle of equal daily accrual is implicit in section 2, Parliament must
surely have intended to allow contracting out from that principle. However, I
confess that I can find no satisfactory way of construing section 7 so as to
achieve that result.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para36"></a><a name="para37">37.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As I understand Elias LJ’s reference to equal daily apportionment, he is
describing a process which leads to 1/365. For the reasons I have given I would
hold that in a case like this the express provision in section 2 that the
salaries “shall be considered as accruing from day to day and shall be
apportionable in respect of time accordingly” does indeed mean equal daily
apportionment. However, I agree with him that Parliament must surely have
intended to allow contracting out from the principle. In my opinion it did so
in section 7.</a></p><a name="para37">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para37"></a><a name="para38">38.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The question then arises what is meant in section 7 by an express
stipulation. On the face of it, it means that there must be an express
provision in the contract which has the effect of disapplying the statutory
formula so that “no apportionment shall take place”. As Elias LJ says in para
40, read literally, section 7 seems to suggest that the apportionment principle
will apply unless the contract in clear terms addresses it and says that it
should not. In my opinion the parties correctly so understood the Act.</a></p><a name="para38">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In paras 40 and 41 Elias LJ refers to two cases on the meaning of section
7 and its predecessor. In <i>In re Lysaght </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpCh/1897/143.html">[1898] 1 Ch 115</a> Lord Lindley MR
held that but for a clause in a will that certain shares “shall carry the dividend
accruing thereon at my death” the Act would have allowed residual legatees to
take the benefit of dividends on the shares up to the date of death. As Lord
Lindley put it, the clause amounted to “a stipulation, within the meaning of
section 7 …, that no apportionment shall take place”. In reaching that
conclusion (as Elias LJ put it in para 41) Lord Lindley referred <span style="font-size:12.5pt">to </span>the interpretation put <span style="font-size:12.5pt">on a predecessor clause </span>in similar <span style="font-size:12.5pt">terms </span>considered in <i>Tyrell </i>v <i>Clark </i>(1854)
<span style="font-size:12.5pt">2 Drew 86; <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1854/116.pdf">61 ER 651</a>. </span>In <span style="font-size:12.5pt">that </span>case the Vice
Chancellor <span style="font-size:11.5pt">(Sir </span><span style="font-size:

stipulation” and how those words should be construed. Elias LJ said this:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In my judgment these authorities
show that, where the language of the contract is plainly inconsistent with an
apportionment of income, no apportionment is permissible. But there is a
presumption that the Act will apply, and if the contract is ambiguous or lacks
clarity on that question, it cannot displace the operation of the Act.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para40">40.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Elias LJ concluded in para 42 that, assuming <span style="font-size:
12.5pt">that </span>section <span style="font-size:12.5pt">2 </span>requires <span style="font-size:12.5pt">pay to </span>accrue at an equal rate daily, and that
section 7 permits contracting out of that principle, it seemed to him that the
concept of an “express stipulation” would have to be similarly construed. There
would have to be a clear intention derived from the contract that the principle
should not apply. I would accept that only if it can fairly be said that in a
particular case, there is, in the words of section 7, an express stipulation in
the contract that no apportionment should take place.</a></p><a name="para40">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para40"></a><a name="para41">41.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As I see it, the amount of the daily rate provided for in section 2
which is to be “apportionable in respect of time accordingly” will depend upon
the terms of the particular contract. I agree with Elias LJ (in para 44) that,
absent a provision (I would say an express provision) to the contrary the
principle of equal daily accrual will be the obvious principle to adopt. For
the reasons given above, I am of the opinion that 1/365 is the appropriate rate
here. In any case the precise figure will depend upon the true construction of
the particular contract. I do not accept the view expressed on behalf of the
Court of Appeal that the arguments have been advanced on a false basis. In this
case there is no express (or indeed implied) stipulation excluding the
statutory apportionment so that section 7 has no application. A critical
feature of the instant case which leads to a figure of 1/365 is that the contracts
are annual contracts. If the contracts were not annual contracts the position
would be very different and would depend upon the terms of the particular
contract.</a></p><a name="para41">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para41"></a><a name="para42">42.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Elias LJ put the position in paras 59, 60 and 61 as follows:</a></p><a name="para42">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“59.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will be clear from my
discussion of the effect of the 1870 Act that I believe that the arguments have
been advanced on a false premise. It is a fundamental feature of the claimants’
case that section 2 implies the principle of equal daily accrual unless
excluded by a clear inconsistent clause. If that is the wrong analysis of
section 2, and there is no such principle which needs to be excluded, the question
of what pay would have been earned on the strike day has to be gleaned purely
from the construction of the contract, modified by the assumption that pay
accrues daily at a rate which is appropriate in the context of that contract to
the particular day in question.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">60.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Applying that modified
principle of construction, I do not think that the claimants can be right. The
natural interpretation of the contract (as modified by that assumption) would
not in my view be that pay accrues at an equal rate day by day, and I do not
accept that the fact that work may be carried out on any day of the year would
justify that conclusion. There is plainly a close link between the directed
hours and pay, and in my judgment Jay J was right [in <i>Amey</i>] to say the
undirected work is essentially ancillary to the directed work. There is little
point, and no value to the employer, in a teacher preparing for lessons which
are not given. The judge also held that pay is tied to the measurable part of
the teacher’s work. Although Mr Segal did not accept that analysis, it seems to
me justified by the way in which part time teachers are paid. They receive that
proportion of the full time directed hours which they perform. It is also
supported by the fact that if a teacher voluntarily agrees to work an extra
day, the amount paid is 1/195 of the annual salary. No doubt that extra day
will generate undirected working time, but this is taken into account by
treating it as a contributory part of the value provided by the teaching day.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">61.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taken to its logical
conclusion that would tend to justify the principle that the pay referable to a
strike day is 1/195 of the annual salary. But the College does not seek to
follow the logic that far, perhaps with good reason. Some of the undirected work,
such as writing references, preparing materials and so forth will not
necessarily be directly and inextricably linked to the directed time, in the
sense that a failure to work for a day will lead to a proportionate reduction
in the work done in the undirected hours. So relating the work to the total
number of annual working days, including days which are paid holidays, provides
a sensible and acceptable principle which possibly errs in the employee’s
favour.”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Finally I should refer to para 64 in these terms:</a></p><a name="para43">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“64.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Segal puts forward a
forceful argument that it is far from clear precisely how the contract
envisages that the pay will accrue. I accept that is so, but for reasons I have
given I think that the principle of equal daily accrual will be excluded if it
is clear that the contract is inconsistent with that principle, even if it is
not obvious precisely how the pay is deemed to accrue. For reasons I have
given, in my view the contract plainly does not envisage that pay will accrue
by equal amounts per day.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para43"></a><a name="para44">44.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I respectfully disagree with the approach in those paragraphs, essentially
for these reasons. The directed work is plainly important but it is only part
of the teacher’s responsibilities. While there is a relationship between the
directed work and undirected work, much of the undirected work is very
important in its own right and is carried out outside the hours of directed work:
see in particular paras 18, 19 and, especially 20, above. Moreover the role of
a teacher as described by Scott J is a multi-faceted one.</a></p><a name="para44">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para44"></a><a name="para45">45.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellants’ case may be summarised as follows. Mr Monk’s case is
typical of that of all the appellants. He was employed on an annual salary of
£38,421 payable to him monthly at the end of each month. He was paid that
salary to perform the duties referred to in his contract, as set out above,
notably in clause 1 and in Appendix 4 set out in the Red Book. There is no
suggestion in any of the documents referred to above that some of his duties
were paid and some unpaid. Section 2 of the Act provides that his salary must
be considered as accruing “from day to day” and “be apportionable in respect of
time accordingly”. There is nothing in the contract which stipulates for any
apportionment other than a day to day apportionment, which (as appears above)
the cases show means calendar day. In the context of an annual contract in
which payment is monthly and, given the wide variety of work carried out,
whether directed or undirected work, where there is no distinction between days
upon which work is carried out and days upon which work is not carried out, the
natural effect of the Act is that, as submitted on behalf of the appellants,
the apportioned part of his salary on the day he was on strike was the same as
any other day, namely 1/365 of his annual salary. In short, it was deemed or

</span>As to para 59 of Elias LJ’s judgment, quoted above, I would accept the
submission made on behalf of the appellants that section 2 of the Act implies
the principle of equal daily accrual unless excluded by a clear inconsistent clause.
I would accept the appellants’ arguments set out in para 45 above that they
were paid a salary to perform the duties referred to in their contracts and
there is no suggestion that some of those were paid and some unpaid. On that
basis, as para 59 puts it, I agree that the question of what pay would have
been earned on the strike day has to be gleaned purely from the construction of
the contract, modified by the assumption that pay accrues daily at a rate which
is appropriate in the context of that contract to the particular day in
question. However, I do not agree with the Court of Appeal that, as stated in
paras 60 and 61 of the judgment of Elias LJ, the natural construction of the
contract on that assumption would not be that pay accrues at an equal rate day
by day.&nbsp; It appears to me that it is wrong to say that, as Jay J put it in <i>Amey,
</i>there is a close relationship between the directed hours and pay. Indeed,
as Elias LJ says in para 61, some of the undirected work, such as writing
references, preparing materials and so forth will not necessarily be directly
and inextricably linked to the directed time, in the sense that a failure to
work for a day will lead to a proportionate reduction in the work done in the
undirected hours. This is clear, for example, from the many different
“Professional Duties” identified in Appendix 4 of the Red Book and quoted in
para 18 above under the heading of “Other Activities” and not “Teaching”. In short
they are not limited to the week days but cover many other days including
evenings and weekdays. Hence the conclusion that, in the context of an annual
salary, the provision in section 2 that the salary “shall … be considered as
accruing from [calendar] day to [calendar] day and shall be apportionable in
respect of time accordingly” points to an apportionment of 1/365.</a></p><a name="para46">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For these reasons I would hold that section 2 of the Act applied in this
case and was not excluded by section 7. As to the questions posed in para 8
above, I would hold that (a) section 2 of the Act applied to this case, (b)
that “accruing from day to day” means accruing calendar day by calendar day and
(c) that section 7 of the Act has the meaning discussed in paras 38 to 41 above
and does not apply on the facts of this case.</a></p><a name="para47">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The contract involved many different obligations and was not restricted
to direct work five days a week. Under section 2, the salary “shall be
considered as accruing from day to day, and shall be apportionable in respect
of time accordingly” and the cases show that an apportionment must be carried
out on a calendar day by calendar day basis. To my mind those cases are
correctly decided and are to be preferred to those which doubt that approach. Once
a calculation based on five days a week has been rejected, it follows that the
solution cannot be a deduction of 1/260 of the annual salary for one day’s
strike. Once the 1/260 approach is rejected, it seems to me that the natural
solution is to take 1/365. Indeed, it is hard to see what other approach could
fairly be adopted. It does seem to me that to take 1/365 is to respect (and
reflect) the statutory approach in the cases of calculating the value of one
calendar day in cases where the contracts provide for an annual salary paid
monthly. The rate would no doubt be different if the contracts were not annual
contracts.</a></p><a name="para48">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For these reasons I would allow the appeal and invite the parties to
agree an order. Failing agreement, written submissions on the form of order and
on costs must be filed within 21 days of the handing down of the judgment.</a></p><a name="para49">
