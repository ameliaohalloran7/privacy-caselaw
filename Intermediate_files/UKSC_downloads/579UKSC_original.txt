</span></a></span><a name="para1"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">This appeal raises a
well-formulated issue as to the construction of section 21 of the Limitation
Act 1980, and a rather more diffuse question as to the meaning and application
of section 32 of the Act, in both cases in relation to what is assumed to have
been (although this is hotly contested in the proceedings) an unlawful
distribution in specie by the Claimant company of its shareholding in a trading
subsidiary by the directors of the Claimant (including the two defendants), six
years and three days before the issue of the claim form in these proceedings.</span></a></p><a name="para1">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The Defendants sought summary
judgment dismissing the claim on the ground that it was statute-barred, and
succeeded at first instance, before HHJ Hodge QC, sitting as a judge of the
High Court. The Court of Appeal (Arden, Tomlinson and David Richards LJJ) held,
first, that time did not run against the Claimant company because of section
21(1)(b) of the Act and that, in any event, there was a triable issue as to
whether, within the meaning of section 32 of the Act, there had been deliberate
concealment of the facts involved in the breach of duty constituted by the
unlawful distribution.</span></a></p><a name="para2">

</span>Whatever the conclusion of this court as to the construction of sections
21 and 32, there could not now be summary judgment for the Defendant directors.
This is because the Claimant has since amended its claim to include the
allegation that the claimed unlawful distribution amounted to a fraudulent
breach of trust to which the Defendants were party, within the meaning of
section 21(1)(a). Nonetheless the issue as to the meaning of section 21(1)(b)
is of sufficient importance to have made it appropriate for this appeal (for
which permission had been sought prior to the amendment pleading fraud) to
proceed.</a></p><a name="para3">

holding company with a number of trading subsidiaries. The subsidiaries
operated in two business areas, the supply and construction of conservatories

Vital was approved by a unanimous resolution of the directors of the Claimant

distribution was effected on 12 October 2007, with the transfer of the only
issued share in Vital from the Claimant to BHUH being registered in the register
of members of Vital on that day. Although it is pleaded in the particulars of
claim that Vital was a subsidiary of the Claimant until 15 October 2007, it is
accepted by the Claimant for present purposes that the share in Vital was
distributed in specie on 12 October 2007.</span></p>

the directors of BHUH made a statutory declaration as to its solvency. Also on
15 October 2007, pursuant to reconstruction agreements made on that day under
section 110 of the Insolvency Act 1986, the liquidator of BHUH transferred the
share in Vital to a new company, Vital Holdings Limited (“VHL”) and the shares
in the Claimant to a new company, Burnden Group Holdings Limited (“BGHL”). The

the distribution in specie of the Claimant’s shareholding in Vital to BHUH was
unlawful, and it is claimed that the Defendants breached their duties to the

distribution was unlawful, at least when the matter was before the Court of
Appeal, was that the Claimant company did not have sufficient accumulated,
realised profits to enable the distribution of its shareholding in Vital to be
lawfully made. The detailed basis of that allegation has changed over time and
has, throughout, been firmly challenged by the Defendants. The detail is
irrelevant to the limitation issues before this court. It is simply to be
assumed that the distribution was unlawful, that the Defendants’ participation
in it amounted to a breach of their fiduciary duties to the Claimant and that,
because the distribution was made to a company, BHUH, in which they were
majority shareholders and directors, the distribution was one from which they
derived a substantial benefit.</span></a></p><a name="para9">

</span>It is common ground (and clear beyond argument) that, as directors of an
English company who are assumed to have participated in a misappropriation of
an asset of the company, the Defendants are to be regarded for all purposes
connected with section 21 as trustees. This is because they are entrusted with
the stewardship of the company’s property and owe fiduciary duties to the
company in respect of that stewardship: see <i>Paragon Finance plc v DB
Thakerar &amp; Co </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1998/1249.html">[1999] 1 All ER 400</a>; <i>JJ Harrison (Properties) Ltd v

beneficiary of the trust for all purposes connected with section 21.
Complications have arisen where, although a director, the Defendant’s breach of
duty did not involve the misapplication of company property: see for example <i>Gwembe
Valley Development Co Ltd v Koshy (No 3)</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2003/1048.html">[2004] 1 BCLC 131</a>, but those
difficulties (if indeed they survive the decision of the Court of Appeal in the
<i>First</i> <i>Subsea</i> case) do not arise on this appeal.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para12">12.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is also now common ground that, unless section 21(1) applies, the
Defendants have the benefit of the six-year period of limitation laid down by
section 21(3), because the relevant breach of duty arising from the
distribution of the shareholding in Vital occurred on 12 October 2007, and
these proceedings were issued more than six years later. At the time of the
hearing before the Court of Appeal there was no relevant allegation of fraud:
see para 32 of the judgment of David Richards LJ </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2016/557.html">[2017] 1 WLR 39</a>. Although such
an allegation has since been pleaded, this appeal has been argued upon the
basis that the only question to be decided is whether the Defendants’ ability
to rely upon a six year period of limitation under section 21(3) is denied to
them by reason of section 21(1)(b).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para13">13.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Section 21(1)(b) is about actions “to recover from the trustee trust
property or the proceeds of trust property …” A preliminary objection was taken
in the Court of Appeal by Mr David Chivers QC (who appears also on this appeal
for the Defendants) that a claim such as the present, for an account of profits
or alternatively equitable compensation, did not fall within section 21(1)(b)
at all. This was rejected by the Court of Appeal (at para 38), upon the basis
that a claim for equitable compensation, in a case where the trustee’s indirect
interest in the trust asset had been converted to the use of the trustee, was
an appropriate remedy to seek in an action falling within section 21(1)(b). That
analysis of David Richards LJ has not been challenged on this appeal. Rather,
Mr Chivers’ focus has been on the remaining part of section 21(1)(b), by way of
submissions that the relevant trust property (namely the shareholding in Vital)
was never in the possession of the Defendants, or previously received by them
and converted to their use. The gist of his submission, both here and below,
was that from start to finish the shareholding in Vital had been in the legal
and beneficial ownership and therefore possession of a succession of corporate
entities, namely the Claimant company, then BHUH, to which the shareholding was
unlawfully distributed, and later VHL, to which the shareholding was later
transferred as part of the corporate reconstruction which led to these
proceedings, and where it ultimately remained. Although the Defendants were
from time to time shareholders and directors in all those corporate entities,
the shareholding in Vital was never in their possession, nor previously
received by them and converted to their use. To hold otherwise would, he
submitted, involve the lifting of one or more corporate veils, or ignoring the
separate legal personality of the companies concerned, all of which are
prohibited, save in circumstances which do not apply to this case, by the
reasoning of this court in <i>Prest v Petrodel Resources Ltd </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2013/34.html">[2013] 2 AC 415</a>.</p>

</span>In the Court of Appeal, David Richards LJ acknowledged (at para 35) that
this submission responded well to a literal reading of section 21(1)(b) but
that such an interpretation would be a recipe for avoidance by trustees
because, in the modern world, it is commonplace for companies to be used to
hold assets, where the beneficial ownership is vested in the company but the
entire economic benefit is available for the shareholders. Relying upon and
approving the analysis of Mr Richard Field QC in <i>In re Pantone 485 Ltd;
Miller v Bain </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2001/705.html">[2002] 1 BCLC 266</a>, David Richards LJ concluded that, in order
to achieve its purpose, section 21(1)(b) had to be construed so as to include
within its terms a transfer (in breach of trust) to a company directly or
indirectly controlled by the defaulting trustee.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para15">15.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In this court, Mr Chivers made a detailed and thorough attack on that
analysis, which may be summarised as follows:</a></p><a name="para15">

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:26.0pt;

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">There was no need to be concerned
with anti-avoidance when construing section 21(1)(b). If trustees deliberately
inserted a company between them and the misappropriated assets this would be a
recognised ground for lifting the corporate veil: see the <i>Prest</i> case, at
paras 34-35. It would be an abuse of corporate legal personality.</span></p>

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In any event, the deliberate use
of a corporate vehicle to insulate trustees from liability, after six years,
for breach of trust would in most cases give rise to a claim in fraud within
section 21(1)(a).</span></p>

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">It was wrong in principle to
equate control of a company with possession of its assets save, perhaps, where
the company was a pure nominee. For that purpose, he relied upon the analysis
of possession for the purposes of section 8 of the Trustee Act 1888 (the
distant predecessor of section 21) by Lindley LJ in <i>Thorne v Heard</i>
</span></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpCh/1894/12.html">[1894] 1 Ch 599</a>, at 605-606. In practical terms, he submitted that majority
shareholders had much less than absolute control over a company’s property,
because of the requirement to have regard to the interests of other
stakeholders, such as minority shareholders and creditors.</p>

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">As to the <i>Pantone</i> case, he
submitted that the deputy judge’s analysis had been based upon the <i>Harrison</i>
case (cited above), in which Chadwick LJ’s conclusion was grounded on facts
which included the acquisition (in breach of duty) by a director of the company
by a purchase at an undervalue, followed by an on-sale of it to a third party. In
that type of case, Mr Chivers submitted, the company’s property had indeed been
“previously received” by the director/trustee before being converted to his use
by its on-sale.</span></p>

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In response to a question from the
court as to whether an unlawful distribution in specie could itself be said to
be a conversion of trust property Mr Chivers submitted that a distribution,
even if unlawful, affirmed rather than denied the company’s title to that which
was distributed.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:26.0pt;

</span></span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Finally, in response to the
question whether a director could not be said to have “previously received”
company property by virtue of his office as director, in advance of any
misapplication of it in breach of trust, Mr Chivers submitted that this would
render the requirement of previous receipt otiose, since it would apply in
every case.</span></p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para16">16.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>These carefully constructed submissions were of real force, to the
extent that they demonstrated that there was no need to have regard to
anti-avoidance in construing section 21(1)(b). The deliberate use of a corporate
vehicle to distance a defaulting trustee from the receipt or possession of
misappropriated trust property might justify lifting the corporate veil. In any
event it would in most cases justify a finding of fraud, within the meaning of
section 21(1)(a). Furthermore, the submission that control of a company
afforded by being a majority shareholder and director is not so absolute as to
confer <i>de facto</i> possession of its property is persuasive: see eg <i>Lonrho
Ltd v Shell Petroleum Co Ltd </i>[1980] 1 WLR 627. But taken as a whole, Mr
Chivers’ submissions do not lead to the conclusion that section 21(1)(b) is
inapplicable to the assumed facts with which this appeal is concerned, merely
because the misappropriated property has remained legally and beneficially
owned by corporate vehicles throughout, rather than becoming vested in law or
in equity in the defaulting directors.</a></p><a name="para16">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para16"></a><a name="para17">17.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The starting point in the construction of section 21(1)(b) is to pay due
regard to its purpose. This was laid down, in relation to its predecessor, in <i>In
re Timmis, Nixon v Smith </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpCh/1901/192.html">[1902] 1 Ch 176</a> at 186 by Kekewich J as follows:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The intention of the statute was
to give a trustee the benefit of the lapse of time when, although he had done
something legally or technically wrong, he had done nothing morally wrong or
dishonest, but it was not intended to protect him where, if he pleaded the
statute, he would come off with something he ought not to have, ie, money of
the trust received by him and converted to his own use.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">That this is the purpose of what is now section 21 was
confirmed by Chadwick LJ in the <i>Harrison </i>case at para 40. Mr Chivers did
not, when it was put to him, challenge it in any way.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para18">18.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is necessary to bear in mind that section 21 is primarily aimed at
express trustees, and applicable to company directors by what may fairly be
described as a process of analogy. An express trustee, such as a trustee of a
strict settlement, might or might not from time to time, or indeed at all, be
in possession or receipt of the trust property. The property might consist of
land in the possession of a tenant for life.</a></p><a name="para18">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para18"></a><a name="para19">19.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>By contrast, in the context of company property, directors are to be
treated as being in possession of the trust property from the outset. It is
precisely because, under the typical constitution of an English company, the
directors are the fiduciary stewards of the company’s property, that they are trustees
within the meaning of section 21 at all. Of course, if they have
misappropriated the property before action is brought by the company (the
beneficiary for this purpose) to recover it they may or may not by that time
still be in possession of it. But if their misappropriation of the company’s
property amounts to a conversion of it to their own use, they will still
necessarily have previously received it, by virtue of being the fiduciary
stewards of it as directors.</a></p><a name="para19">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para19"></a><a name="para20">20.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It may well be that, in relation to trustees who are company directors,
the requirement in section 21(1)(b) that the property be previously received by
them before its conversion adds little or nothing to the conditions for the
disapplication of any limitation period which would otherwise have operated in
their favour. But that requirement is not otiose in relation to trustees
generally, for the reason already given. Thus, for example, the trustee of a
strict settlement who had, without dishonesty, committed a breach of trust by
neglecting to exercise available powers to prevent dissipation of the trust
property by the tenant for life, would not be deprived of the benefit of the
trustee’s six year limitation period by virtue of section 21(1)(b). He would
neither be in possession of the trust property, nor would he ever have received
it nor, incidentally, would he have converted it to his own use.</a></p><a name="para20">

</span>There is nothing in Mr Chivers’ objection that to treat individual
directors as being in possession, or in previous receipt, of company property
by virtue of their office would unfairly assume a level of control over it
which they might in practice lack, for example by being in a minority on the
Board. Trustees of an express trust in whom the trust property is vested in law
are each treated as being in possession or receipt of the trust property,
notwithstanding that they hold title to it jointly with all the other trustees.</a></p><a name="para21">

</span>In the present case, (of course only on the assumed facts), the
Defendant directors converted the company’s shareholding in Vital when they
procured or participated in the unlawful distribution of it to BHUH. It was a
conversion because, if the distribution was unlawful, it was a taking of the
company’s property in defiance of the company’s rights of ownership of it. It
was a conversion of the shareholding to their own use because of the economic
benefit which they stood to derive from being the majority shareholders in the
company to which the distribution was made. By the time of that conversion the
Defendants had previously received the property because, as directors of the
Claimant company, they had been its fiduciary stewards from the outset.</a></p><a name="para22">

</span>For those reasons, although they differ to some extent from the Court of
Appeal’s analysis, I would dismiss this appeal so far as it relates to section
21.</a></p><a name="para23">

<p class="ParaHeading">Section 32</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para23"></a><a name="para24">24.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Section 32 of the Limitation Act 1980, as amended by section 6(6) of,
and paragraph 5 of Schedule 1 to, the Consumer Protection Act 1987, provides,
so far as relevant for present purposes, as follows:</a></p><a name="para24">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“32.- Postponement of limitation
period in case of fraud, concealment or mistake.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject to subsections
(3) and (4A) below, where in the case of any action for which a period of
limitation is prescribed by this Act, either -</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:144.0pt">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the action is based
upon the fraud of the Defendant; or</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:144.0pt">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any fact relevant to
the plaintiff’s right of action has been deliberately concealed from him by the
Defendant; or</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:144.0pt">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the action is for
relief from the consequences of a mistake;</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">the period of limitation shall
not begin to run until the plaintiff has discovered the fraud, concealment or
mistake (as the case may be) or could with reasonable diligence have discovered
it. References in this subsection to the Defendant include references to the
Defendant’s agent and to any person through whom the Defendant claims and his
agent.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the purposes of
subsection (1) above, deliberate commission of a breach of duty in
circumstances in which it is unlikely to be discovered for some time amounts to
deliberate concealment of the facts involved in that breach of duty. …”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para24"></a><a name="para25">25.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeal reversed the judge’s order by way of Defendants’
summary judgment in relation to section 32, mainly because they regarded the
issues as to its applicability as being too fact-sensitive to be suitable for
summary judgment: see per David Richards LJ at paras 51 and 55. On the way to
that conclusion David Richards LJ adopted an interpretation of section 32(2)
which has, on this appeal, been subjected to significant, albeit commendably
brief, criticism by Mr Chivers, both orally and in writing, centred around
issues as to the meaning of the phrase “some time” in subsection (2), and the
interpretation placed upon it by Lewison J in <i>JD Wetherspoon plc v Van de
Berg &amp; Co Ltd </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2007/1044.html">[2007] EWHC 1044 (Ch)</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2007/1044.html">[2007] PNLR 28</a>, at para 40.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para26">26.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The in-depth analysis of this difficult question would take the court
into a potential minefield of difficulties which surround section 32 and, in
this corporate context, would also involve a consideration of questions of
attribution. There cannot be summary judgment in favour of the Defendants in
this case, both because of the recent plea of fraud and because of this court’s
decision about the meaning of section 21. Whatever the correct interpretation
of section 32(2), there would still be fact-intensive issues calling for a
trial. In view of the relatively summary way in which this issue has been
addressed by counsel (about which I express no criticism at all), I have not
therefore considered it appropriate to reach any final view about it. It is
sufficient for present purposes for me to conclude that the appeal in relation
to section 32 should be dismissed because the issue is unsuitable for summary
judgment. I express no view one way or the other on the correctness or otherwise
of the interpretation of section 32(2) adopted <i>en passant</i> by the Court
of Appeal.</a></p><a name="para26">
