</span>The pleaded facts may be summarised as follows. On 2 December 2003 the
respondents, four police officers serving in the Metropolitan Police Service,
(“the officers”) took part in the arrest of a suspected terrorist, BA. BA
subsequently made allegations that the officers had seriously assaulted and
injured him during the arrest. The complaints were investigated by the

Crown Prosecution Service who concluded that there was no case to answer.
However, the Independent Police Complaints Commission decided in October 2004
that one charge relating to the use of excessive force should be brought
against the first respondent. That charge was dismissed by the disciplinary
panel in April 2005. Between 14 January 2005 and 2 February 2005 the
Independent Police Complaints Commission released the officers’ identities into
the public domain. This led to threats of serious violence to the officers and
their families on a website which supported BA.</a></p><a name="para2">

</span>On 18 October 2007 BA issued civil proceedings against the Commissioner
in which he alleged that the Commissioner was vicariously liable under section
88 of the Police Act 1996 for the serious assaults which he alleged the
officers had inflicted on him. His claim included claims for aggravated and
exemplary damages. The officers were not defendants in the action nor were
contribution proceedings brought against them by the Commissioner. The defence
of the claim on behalf of the Commissioner was undertaken by the Metropolitan
Police Directorate of Legal Services (“DLS”). A defence denying liability was
entered. On 10 January 2008 an offer of settlement was rejected by BA.</a></p><a name="para3">

</span>On 18 March 2008 the officers attended a conference with Mr Jeremy
Johnson of counsel, instructed by the DLS on behalf of the Commissioner. The
officers subsequently alleged that counsel and the DLS solicitor assured them
on that occasion that they were also acting for them and in their interests and
told them that BA’s claims would be vigorously defended. On 13 February 2009 an
application by the Commissioner that the officers be permitted to give evidence
from behind screens was dismissed at the pre-trial review. On 10 March 2009 BA
rejected a further offer of settlement because he wanted an apology or a
finding in open court. The officers attended a second conference with Mr
Johnson and the DLS on 11 March 2009. On this occasion the officers were
accompanied by a solicitor from Russell Jones and Walker who attended only in
relation to matters arising from a special measures application which had been
made in respect of the evidence to be given by the respondents. At that
conference the officers said that they would be reluctant to give evidence
without special measures being in place. They allege that Mr Johnson informed
them that he was no longer representing their interests but only the interests
of the Commissioner. The officers allege that Mr Johnson indicated that the
claim would be lost due to BA’s medical evidence and they complained to him
that they were unable to raise points on various aspects of the defence
including medical evidence, expert evidence, CCTV footage and notes of arrest.</a></p><a name="para4">

</span>The trial of BA’s claim commenced on 16 March 2009. The officers
declined to give evidence voluntarily without special measures being in place.
On the third day of the trial, 18 March 2009, the Commissioner settled the
claim on the basis of agreed damages of £60,000 and agreed costs of £240,000
with an admission of liability and an apology for “gratuitous violence” to
which BA had been subjected by the officers. Paragraph 82 of the Particulars of
Claim in the present proceedings alleges that the Commissioner’s office issued
a press release stating:</a></p><a name="para5">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The Commissioner has demanded an

</span>The particulars of claim then provided detailed particulars of the
alleged breaches of the duties. The officers do not allege that entering into
an agreement on the terms of the settlement between the Commissioner and BA was
in itself negligent. Their complaint is about the antecedent conduct of the
defence by the Commissioner. In particular it is alleged that the Commissioner
failed to conduct and prepare a competent defence to BA’s claim. (See Jay J at
para 23) Here complaint is made of the failure to proof or call as witnesses a
list of named persons or to ascertain the availability of covert recordings.
Complaint is made that evidence was lost, not located or not disclosed as a
result of a systems failure. Complaint is also made of failure to take account
of a list of miscellaneous evidential concerns raised by the respondents which,
it is said, were either ignored or not adequately addressed. More generally, it
is said that the Commissioner failed to keep the officers informed of the
progress of the litigation and the preparation of the defence and failed to
advise the officers within a reasonable time of the alleged conflict of
interests. Complaint is made of the failure to obtain expert medical evidence
to challenge the expert evidence called on behalf of BA and of a failure to
apply for an adjournment of the trial.</a></p><a name="para8">

</span>By notice dated 28 April 2014 the Commissioner applied to strike out the
claims pursuant to CPR Part 3.4(2) on the grounds that they disclosed no
reasonable grounds for the making of a claim, alternatively for summary
judgment pursuant to CPR Part 24 on the grounds that the claims had no real
prospect of success.</a></p><a name="para9">

</span>On 1 May 2015 Jay J struck out the claims and entered summary judgment
for the Commissioner. He considered that, in the absence of an express contract
of retainer with the DLS, no retainer existed. Furthermore, the officers had no
direct interest in the prior litigation and the possibility of consequential
impact on their reputations was insufficient to create such an interest to
which the Commissioner would be legally required to have regard or to promote
or safeguard. The focus of the claim founded on the more general duty of care
to protect the health, economic or reputational interests of the officers
shifted during the hearing before Jay J. The judge seems to have been under the
impression that the duty relied on by the officers was a duty to avoid
psychiatric injury and that the claims for reputational damage and economic
loss were entirely consequential on that head of damage. The judge considered that
the officers had no real prospect of proving at trial that it was reasonably
foreseeable that any breaches of duty by the Commissioner might cause
psychiatric injury. However, the judge also observed that this basis of claim
faced an insuperable difficulty under <i>Caparo Industries plc v Dickman</i>
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1990/2.html">[1990] 2 AC 605</a> in that, given that the officers were not parties to BA’s civil
proceedings, the Commissioner’s lawyers owed duties solely to the Commissioner
and the Commissioner was free to protect his own interests as he saw fit. He
stated:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The principled objection to this
claim is that the postulated duty of care cuts right across the rights and
obligations of the defendant itself, and those advising the defendant, in
circumstances where no implied retainer existed. It would not be fair, just and
reasonable to impose a concurrent conflicting duty of care in these
circumstances: …” (at para 36)</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The claim for misfeasance was struck out as inadequately
pleaded.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para11">11.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The officers appealed to the Court of Appeal, save in respect of the
claim in misfeasance. The Court of Appeal (Moore-Bick, Longmore and Patten LJJ)
dismissed the appeal in relation to the existence of a retainer and in relation
to the assumption of responsibility. In addition, it dismissed the appeal in relation
to psychiatric injury on the ground that such injury was not reasonably
foreseeable. However, it allowed the appeal on the remaining issue, holding
that it was arguable that the Commissioner owed a duty of care to the officers
to safeguard their economic and reputational interests and that this extended
to the conduct of litigation by the Commissioner. Moore-Bick LJ, with whom the
other members of the court agreed, accepted that the Commissioner’s primary
duty was to protect the interests of the Metropolitan Police Service, but he
did not consider that a duty of the kind alleged by the officers necessarily
cut across this. In his view it was in the interest of the Commissioner and the
officers for the defence to be conducted as effectively as possible and a duty
of care in that regard would not inevitably give rise to any conflict of
interest. Accordingly, he considered it arguable that the Commissioner owed to
the officers (1) a duty to defend the litigation as effectively as possible and
(2) a duty, when deciding whether to compromise the claim and if so on what
terms, to take reasonable care not to sacrifice their interests and
professional reputation without good reason and without giving them reasonable
warning of what he intended to do.</a></p><a name="para11">

</span>So far as breach of duty giving rise to actionable losses was concerned,
Moore-Bick LJ noted that there was no allegation that the Commissioner’s
decision to compromise the claim was negligent in all the circumstances.
However, the Commissioner’s forensic difficulties were alleged to have been a
consequence of failures on the part of the MPS to identify or make available
certain important pieces of evidence. In his view the essential elements of the
claim for breach of a duty of care in relation to the conduct of the proceedings
were present. The Court of Appeal came to a different conclusion, however, in
respect of the allegation that the Commissioner was in breach of duty by
failing to warn the officers in good time that he intended to pursue the
interest of the MPS, if necessary at their expense. Moore-Bick LJ agreed with
the judge in dismissing as fanciful the suggestion that, had they been warned,
the officers would have applied to be joined as defendants and would have
instructed solicitors to conduct their defence independently.</a></p><a name="para12">

</span>The Commissioner now appeals to the Supreme Court. The sole remaining
allegation in the proceedings is that the Commissioner owed a duty of care to
the officers to conduct the defence of the proceedings brought against her “as
effectively as possible” in order to protect the officers from economic or
reputational harm. There is no cross appeal by the officers in relation to the
alleged retainer, the alleged assumption of responsibility or the head of claim
alleging psychiatric injury. Nevertheless, the subject matter of those heads of
claim which have fallen by the wayside forms an important part of the context
in which the central issue now falls to be decided.</a></p><a name="para13">

<p class="ParaHeading">The implied duty of trust and confidence</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para13"></a><a name="para14">14.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Both before the Court of Appeal and before this court Mr Nicholas Bowen
QC on behalf of the officers has placed at the forefront of his submissions the
duty of trust and confidence which exists between an employer and his
employees. He submits that the duty of care for which he contends is simply a
manifestation of the long-established term of trust and confidence which is
implied into contracts of employment and that, accordingly, there is no scope
or need for the court to conduct an assessment of whether the ingredients
identified in <i>Caparo v Dickman</i> criteria are present and, in particular,
whether the imposition of such a duty would be fair, just and reasonable.</a></p><a name="para14">

</span>Police officers hold the public office of constable and are not
employees. They have no contract of employment and the terms on which they hold
their office are governed principally by the Police Regulations 2003 (SI
2003/527). Nevertheless, the relationship of Commissioner and officer is
closely analogous to that of employer and employee (<i>White v Chief Constable
of South Yorkshire Police</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1998/45.html">[1999] 2 AC 455</a>, per Lord Steyn at p 497E-F; per
Lord Hoffmann at p 505C). In <i>Mullaney v Chief Constable of West Midlands
Police</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2001/700.html">[2001] EWCA Civ 700</a> Clarke LJ, with whom Potter LJ and Bodey J
agreed, considered (at para 52) that the relationship is so closely analogous
as to make it just in principle to hold that a Chief Constable owes the same
duties to his officers as an employer does to his employees. At this point of
the discussion I am content to proceed on the basis that the Commissioner and
these officers should be treated as if they were employer and employee, while
recognising that, in the absence of any actual contract, any duty derived by
analogy with the standard terms implied in an employment contract must
necessarily sound as a duty of care, rather than be absolute.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para16">16.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The mutual obligation of employer and employee not, without reasonable
and proper cause, to engage in conduct likely to destroy or seriously damage
the relationship of trust and confidence required between employer and employee
is a standardised term implied by law into all contracts of employment rather
than a term implied from the particular provisions of a particular employment
contract (<i>Malik v Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1997/23.html">[1998] AC 20</a>, per Lord Steyn at p 45D). It was described by Lord Nicholls in <i>Malik</i>
at p 35A, as a portmanteau concept. In that case the House of Lords considered
it the source of a more specific implied obligation on the part of the employer
bank not to conduct its business in a dishonest and corrupt manner, the breach
of which gave rise to a cause of action for damage to the economic and
reputational interests of its employees. Similarly, in <i>Eastwood v Magnox
Electric plc</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/2004/35.html">[2004] UKHL 35</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2004/35.html">[2005] 1 AC 503</a> the House of Lords recognised
an obligation on an employer, in the conduct of his business and in the
treatment of his employees, to act responsibly and in good faith (per Lord
Nicholls at para 11). The implied term has been held to give rise to an
obligation on the part of an employer to act fairly when taking positive action
directed at the very continuance of the employment relationship (<i>Gogay v
Hertfordshire County Council</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2000/228.html">[2000] IRLR 703</a>; <i>McCabe v Cornwall County

function entrusted to an employer must be exercised in accordance with the
implied obligation of trust and confidence (<i>Braganza v BP Shipping Ltd</i>
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/17.html">[2015] UKSC 17</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/17.html">[2015] 1 WLR 1661</a>).</p>

</span>If the present case is approached on the basis of implied contractual
terms, the issue becomes whether, in unpacking this particular portmanteau
implied term of trust and confidence, it is possible to extract a duty of care
owed by an employer to its employees to conduct litigation in a manner which
protects them from economic or reputational harm. It is significant that,
despite the researches of counsel, we have not been referred to any decided
case in any jurisdiction which holds that an employer owes such a duty of care
to his employees. To derive such an obligation from the implied term of trust
and confidence would be to move substantially beyond the specific derivative
duties established to date.</a></p><a name="para17">

</span>Although in <i>Malik</i> the House of Lords derived from the mutual
implied contractual obligations of trust and confidence an implied obligation
owed by the bank to its employees not to conduct a dishonest or corrupt
business and held that damage to reputation resulting from breach sounded in
damages, this is at a considerable remove from a duty to exercise care in the
conduct of business so as to avoid economic or reputational damage to
employees. This point was, in fact, emphasised by Lord Nicholls in a cautionary
footnote:</a></p><a name="para18">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“…, [T]here are many circumstances
in which an employee’s reputation may suffer from his having been associated
with an unsuccessful business, or an unsuccessful department within a business.
In the ordinary way this will not found a claim of the nature made in the
present case, even if the business or department was run with gross
incompetence. A key feature in the present case is the assumed fact that the
business was dishonest or corrupt.” (at p 42C-D).</p>

</span>In <i>Scally v Southern Health and Social Services Board </i>[1992] 1 AC
294 doctors sued their employer claiming damages, inter alia, in breach of
contract and negligence, in respect of the failure of the employer to notify
them of their entitlement under their contracts of employment to purchase,
during a limited period of time, additional years of pension entitlement. The
House of Lords held that the claimants’ common law claims were to be determined
by reference to the contractual relationship and not in tort. The doctors’
claim succeeded but it is noteworthy that it did so on the narrow ground that
where a contract negotiated between an employer and a representative body
contains a term conferring on an employee a valuable benefit contingent upon
his acting to obtain it, of which he could not be expected to be otherwise
aware, there was an implied obligation on the employer to take reasonable steps
to publicise that term. It is significant that the House of Lords did not base
its decision on a more general duty of care owed by an employer to protect the
economic interests of employees.</a></p><a name="para19">

and confidence a standard obligation, implied by law as a term of all contracts
of employment, which requires an employer to take reasonable care for the
economic well-being of his employees. The claimant, a senior employee and
director of the defendant company, retired on grounds of ill health. He later
brought an action for damages for breach of contract alleging that in failing
to warn him of the effect which resigning from his employment would have on his
entitlements under its insurance scheme, the defendant company had acted in
breach of an implied term of the contract of employment requiring it to take
reasonable care for his economic well-being. Dyson LJ, with whom Thomas LJ and
Sir Andrew Morritt V-C agreed, rejected the proposed implied term. Having
observed (at para 42) that it was not for that court “to take a big leap to
introduce a major extension of the law in this area” when the House of Lords
had declined to do so in <i>Scally v Southern Health and Social Services Board </i>[1992]
1 AC 294<i> </i>and<i> Spring v Guardian Assurance plc </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1994/7.html">[1995] 2 AC 296</a>, he
developed (at para 43) the more fundamental objection that such an implied term
would impose an unfair and unreasonable burden on employers. While an employer
might assume responsibility under the <i>Hedley Byrne</i> principle, it was a quite
different matter to impose on an employer the duty to give his employee
financial advice or generally to safeguard his economic well-being.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para21">21.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, I have difficulty in understanding how this principal
argument on behalf of the officers can circumvent the requirement adverted to
by Lord Bridge in <i>Caparo v Dickman</i> that the imposition of the duty must
be fair, just and reasonable. In order to establish such a duty of care, the
officers rely here upon a class of implied terms which are implied in law as a
necessary incident of a particular class of contractual relationship. In <i>Crossley</i>
Dyson LJ observed at para 36:</a></p><a name="para21">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… [R]ather than focus on the
elusive concept of necessity, it is better to recognise that, to some extent at
least, the existence and scope of standardised implied terms raise questions of
reasonableness, fairness and the balancing of competing policy considerations.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaNoNumber"><a name="para21">This approach was commended by Lady Hale in <i>Geys v
Societe Generale, London Branch</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2012/63.html">[2013] 1 AC 523</a> at paras 55, 56. The argument
that such an implied term should extend to the conduct of litigation raises,
therefore, precisely the same question as to whether the proposed term is fair
and reasonable as arises if the claim is put in tort. Such an implied term,
implied by law as an incident of a standardised contract, could not, to my
mind, be wider in scope than the duty imposed by the law of tort. (<i>White v
Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police</i>,<i> </i>per Lord Griffiths at p
464C-G; per Lord Goff at p 483C-E; per Lord Steyn at p 498A-B; per Lord
Hoffmann at pp 505B-506B. See also the observations of Underhill LJ in <i>Yapp
v Foreign and Commonwealth Office</i> at para 120.) It is difficult to see why
such an implied term should extend further than a concurrent duty in
negligence. Accordingly, it seems to me that the battlefield on which the
conflicting contentions as to the existence of such a duty must be fought out
is the scope of the duty of care in tort.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para22">22.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the present case the courts below have proceeded on the basis that,
with the exception of the claim in respect of psychiatric injury which is no
longer pursued, harm was arguably foreseeable. Furthermore, it was clearly
arguable that by virtue of their relationship, akin to that of employer and
employee, the parties were in a sufficiently proximate relationship to give rise
to a duty of care. The argument therefore focussed on whether the imposition of
a duty of care was fair, just and reasonable as indicated in <i>Caparo</i>. In <i>Robinson
v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2018/4.html">[2018] UKSC 4</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2018/4.html">[2018] 2 WLR 595</a>
this court recently held, with regard to this aspect of <i>Caparo</i>, that it
is normally only in a novel type of case, where established principles do not
provide an answer, that the courts need to go beyond those principles in order
to decide whether a duty of care should be recognised. Since the police
generally owe a duty of care not to inflict physical injury by their actions
when such a duty arises under the ordinary principles of the law of negligence,
unless statute or other common law principle provides otherwise, there was no
requirement in that case to examine whether the recognition of the claimed duty
would be fair, just and reasonable. However, this ingredient will be of
critical importance in a situation where it is proposed that a duty of care
should be imposed in novel circumstances. Thus Lord Reed observed (at para 29):</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Properly understood, <i>Caparo</i>
thus achieves a balance between legal certainty and justice. In the ordinary
run of cases, courts consider what has been decided previously and follow the
precedents (unless it is necessary to consider whether the precedents should be
departed from). In cases where the question whether a duty of care arises has
not previously been decided, the courts will consider the closest analogies in
the existing law, with a view to maintaining the coherence of the law and the
avoidance of inappropriate distinctions. They will also weigh up the reasons
for and against imposing liability, in order to decide whether the existence of
a duty of care would be just and reasonable.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para23">23.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Contrary to the submission of Mr Bowen on behalf of the officers, the
present case is very clearly one in which it is sought to extend a duty of care
to a new situation. As Lord Reed explained in <i>Robinson</i>, in determining
whether such a duty should be recognised the law will proceed incrementally and
by analogy with previous decisions. He referred, in particular, to the
following passage in the judgment of Brennan J in <i>Sutherland Shire Council v
Heyman</i> (1985) 60 ALR 1, 43-44, which was approved by Lord Bridge in <i>Caparo</i>
at p 618:</a></p><a name="para23">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It is preferable, in my view,
that the law should develop novel categories of negligence incrementally and by
analogy with established categories, rather than by a massive extension of a
prima facie duty of care restrained only by indefinable considerations which
ought to negative, or to reduce or limit the scope of the duty or the class of
person to whom it is owed.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaNoNumber"><a name="para23">The theme was developed by Lord Bingham in <i>Customs and
Excise Comrs v Barclays Bank plc</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/28.html">[2007] 1 AC 181</a> where he observed at para
7:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… I incline to agree with the
view … that the incremental test is of little value as a test in itself, and is
only helpful when used in combination with a test or principle which identifies
the legally significant features of a situation. The closer the facts of the
case in issue to those of a case in which a duty of care has been held to
exist, the readier a court will be, on the approach of Brennan J adopted in <i>Caparo
Industries plc v Dickman</i>, to find that there has been an assumption of
responsibility or that the proximity and policy conditions of the threefold
test are satisfied. The converse is also true.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">In addition, the proposed duty will be tested against
considerations of legal policy and judgement will have to be exercised with
particular regard to both the achievement of justice in the particular case and
the coherent development of the law.</p>

</span>The law protects reputation in a variety of ways in different
circumstances. Causes of action such as libel, slander, malicious falsehood and
passing off are designed to protect reputation. Moreover, a variety of other
causes of action including breach of confidence, misuse of private information
and causes of action in relation to data protection and intellectual property
may often indirectly achieve this result. The common law does not usually
recognise a duty of care in the tort of negligence to protect reputational
interests. However, there are exceptions. In <i>Spring v Guardian Assurance plc</i>
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1994/7.html">[1995] 2 AC 296</a> a majority of the House of Lords held that an employer who gave
a reference in respect of a former employee owed that employee a duty to take
reasonable care in its preparation and would be liable to him in negligence for
a breach of duty which caused him economic loss. Lord Lowry, Lord Slynn and
Lord Woolf reached this conclusion on the basis of the three ingredients
identified by Lord Bridge in <i>Caparo</i>. Lord Goff (at p 316E-F) concluded
that a duty of care was owed to the former employee on a narrower ground. In
his view the source of the duty of care was the principle in <i>Hedley Byrne
&amp; Co Ltd v Heller &amp; Partners Ltd</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1963/4.html">[1964] AC 465</a> ie an assumption of
responsibility by the authors of the reference to the plaintiff in respect of
the reference, and reliance by the plaintiff upon the exercise by them of due
care and skill in respect of its preparation. This case was essentially
concerned with negligent mis-statement and it may be that assumption of
responsibility is the better rationalisation of the recognition of a duty in
these circumstances. (See <i>NRAM Ltd (formerly NRAM plc) v Steel</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2018/13.html">[2018] UKSC 13</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2018/13.html">[2018] 1 WLR 1190</a> per Lord Wilson at para 24 referring also to <i>Henderson

</span>This decision should be contrasted with <i>Calveley v Chief Constable of
the Merseyside Police</i> [1989] 1 AC 1228. Following their reinstatement,
police officers, against whom disciplinary proceedings had been taken, brought
actions in negligence against their Chief Constables on the basis that they
were vicariously liable for the investigating officers. The claimants alleged
that the investigating officers had failed to conduct the proceedings properly
or expeditiously and claimed, inter alia, damages in respect of loss of
overtime earnings during their suspension and damages for injury to reputation.
The House of Lords considered the submission that a duty of care was owed to
the claimants to be unsustainable. First, Lord Bridge explained (at p 1238B-G),
anxiety, vexation and injury to reputation did not constitute reasonably
foreseeable damage capable of sustaining an action in negligence within <i>Donoghue
v Stevenson </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1932/100.html">[1932] AC 562</a>. Secondly, it was not reasonably foreseeable that
the negligent conduct of a criminal investigation would cause injury to the
health of the suspect, whether in the form of depressive illness or otherwise.
Thirdly, while it is reasonably foreseeable that a suspect may suffer some economic
loss which might have been avoided had more careful investigation established
his innocence at an earlier stage, such a claim would encounter the formidable
obstacles in the path of liability in negligence for purely economic loss.
Fourthly, it would be contrary to public policy to prejudice the discharge by
police officers of their public duty of investigating crime by requiring them
to act under the shadow of a potential action for damages for negligence by the
suspect.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para26">26.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To my mind <i>Calveley</i> has an important bearing on the present case.
If a Chief Constable does not, in principle, owe a duty of care to protect the
economic and reputational interests of his officers in respect of the
prosecution of an investigation or disciplinary proceedings, it is difficult to
see why he should owe a duty to his officers as to the manner in which he
defends a claim brought against him by a third party. In the former situation
the Chief Constable has himself initiated the investigation or proceedings over
which he has at least a substantial measure of control and he is responsible
for making allegations against officers. In the latter situation his role is
essentially responsive to allegations made by third parties.</a></p><a name="para26">

</span>In these circumstances it is necessary to test the proposed duty of care
against relevant policy considerations and to consider the coherence of the
resulting state of the law if such a duty is recognised.</a></p><a name="para27">

<p class="ParaHeading">Conflicting interests</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para27"></a><a name="para28">28.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The fact that a duty of care may give rise to conflicting interests will
often be a weighty consideration against its imposition. In <i>D v East
Berkshire Community Health NHS Trust </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2005/23.html">[2005] 2 AC 373</a> a majority of the
House of Lords held that health care and childcare professionals investigating
allegations of child abuse did not owe a duty of care to the parents of the
children concerned. Lord Nicholls explained (at para 85) that conflict of
interest was a persuasive factor here. When considering whether a child has
been abused, a doctor should be able to act single-mindedly in the interests of
the child and he ought not to have at the back of his mind an awareness that if
his doubts about intentional injury or sexual abuse were to prove unfounded he
might be exposed to claims by a distressed parent.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“At that time [when a doctor is
carrying out his investigation] the doctor does not know whether there has been
abuse by the parent. But he knows that when he is considering this possibility
the interests of parent and child are diametrically opposed. The interests of
the child are that the doctor should report any suspicions he may have and that
he should carry out further investigation in consultation with other child care
professionals. The interests of the parent do not favour either of these steps.
This difference of interest in the outcome is an unsatisfactory basis for
imposing a duty of care on a doctor in favour of a parent.” (at para 88)</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Similarly, in <i>SXH v Crown Prosecution Service</i>
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2017/30.html">[2017] UKSC 30</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2017/30.html">[2017] 1 WLR 1401</a> Lord Toulson, with whom Lord Mance, Lord Reed
and Lord Hughes agreed, considered (at para 38) that the duty of the Crown
Prosecution Service (“CPS”) is to the public and not to the victim or the
suspect, who have separate interests, and that to recognise a duty of care
towards victims or suspects or both would put the CPS in positions of potential
conflict.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para29">29.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Yet, the fact that the recognition of a duty of care may potentially
subject an individual to conflicting duties is not, of itself, necessarily
conclusive against its recognition in all situations. Clearly, there will be
many situations in which an individual will owe potentially conflicting duties
to different persons. In <i>Gogay v Hertfordshire County Council</i> the
managers of a children’s home owed both a duty of care to the resident children
and an implied contractual duty of trust and confidence to its staff,
notwithstanding the fact that in the case of an actual conflict the interests
of the child should prevail. (See Hale LJ at para 59) Similarly, in <i>D v East
Berkshire</i> Lord Nicholls referred (at para 86) to the fact that a doctor
often owes duties to more than one person. He may owe duties, for example, to
his employer and to his patient. (See also <i>ABC v St George’s Healthcare NHS
Trust</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2017/336.html">[2017] EWCA Civ 336</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2017/336.html">[2017] PIQR P15</a>.) However, in <i>D</i> the House
concluded that the seriousness of child abuse as a social problem demanded that
health professionals, acting in good faith in what they believe are the best
interests of the child, should not be subject to potentially conflicting duties
when deciding whether a child may have been abused or in deciding what action
should be taken. It is necessary, therefore, to have regard to the competing
underlying policy considerations, when determining whether a duty of care may
be imposed notwithstanding that it may give rise to a conflict of interests.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para30">30.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The interests of an employer who is sued on the basis that he is
vicariously liable for the tortious conduct of his employees differ
fundamentally from the interests of those employees. The financial, commercial
and reputational standing of the employer may be at stake. It is the employer
who will incur the cost of defending the proceedings which, however successful
the defence may be, is most unlikely to be recovered in full, and who, if
unsuccessful, will bear the liability to the claimant. The employer must be
able to make his own investigation into the claim and to assess its strength
based on the conduct of his employee and the prospects of a successful defence.
In this regard, he will need to form his own view as to the reliability and
veracity of his employee and as to how the employee is likely to perform as a
witness. The interests of insurers may have to be taken into account. The
employer will have to decide what degree of importance he attaches to
successfully defending the claim and what financial and other resources should
be devoted to its defence. He may consider that, however strong the prospects
of a successful defence, he cannot justify the cost and effort of defending the
claim and that it should, therefore, be settled. The predominant interest of
the employee, by contrast, will be that his reputation should be vindicated.
The position will often be complicated further by the existence of inconsistent
views or interests between different employees or groups of employees. (See,
for example, <i>Mohidin v Comr of Police of the Metropolis</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2016/105.html">[2016] EWHC 105 (QB)</a> (Gilbart J) <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2016/105.html">[2016] 1 Costs LR 71</a>, para 14)</p>

</span>In cases where an employer is alleged to be vicariously liable for the
tortious conduct of his employee, the possibility of contribution proceedings
between employer and employee highlights this potential conflict of interests.
It is particularly relevant here that claims under the Civil Liability
(Contribution) Act 1978 may be brought up to two years after judgment in the
original claim or settlement of that claim (Limitation Act 1980, section 10).
That the possibility of bringing such a claim is not fanciful, at least in
cases where deliberate misconduct is alleged, is demonstrated by <i>Mohidin v
Comr of Police of the Metropolis</i> where such a claim succeeded.</a></p><a name="para31">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para31"></a><a name="para32">32.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>These stark differences between the interests of employer and employee
strongly suggest that it would not be fair, just or reasonable to impose on an
employer a duty of care to defend legal proceedings so as to protect the
economic or reputational interests of his employee. Nor do I consider it
realistic to suggest, as do the respondents in the present case, that this
potential for conflict can be overcome by the recognition of a duty of care up
to the time at which an actual conflict of interests arises, at which point
“timeous notification” by the Commissioner could result in the duty of care
ceasing to apply. Where an employer defends a claim against him founded on his
vicarious liability for his employees, the potential for conflict is too great
to permit such a compromise. Moreover, it would often be totally impracticable.
A civil claim and its defence, as they proceed, often develop in unexpected
ways. There could be no justification for imposing on an employer the burden of
keeping under review at each stage of the proceedings the question whether an
actual conflict has arisen. Furthermore, steps taken by the employee as a
result of such “timeous notification” of the emergence of an actual conflict
may well be disruptive of the litigation.</a></p><a name="para32">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para32"></a><a name="para33">33.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the present case, moreover, the Commissioner is not merely in a
position analogous to that of an employer. She also holds public office and has
responsibility for the Metropolitan Police Service. This adds a further
dimension to this appeal because in the conduct of the proceedings against her
she must be free to act as she considers appropriate in accordance with her
public duty. This duty is, to my mind, totally inconsistent with her owing a
duty of care to protect the reputational interests of her employees when
defending litigation based on vicarious liability for their alleged misconduct.
As we have seen, in <i>Calveley</i> the House concluded that it would be
contrary to public policy to prejudice the discharge by the police of their
public duty to investigate alleged misconduct by officers by imposing a
conflicting duty of care to protect the reputational interests of those
officers. In the same way in <i>SXH</i> this court considered (at para 38) that
to recognise a duty of care owed by the CPS to victims or suspects would not be
conducive to the best interests of the criminal justice system. These
considerations apply with equal force to the present case.</a></p><a name="para33">

</span>First, there is an important public policy that parties in dispute
should, in general, be able to avail themselves of the processes of litigation
in order to resolve their disputes, without fear of incurring liability to
third parties if they do so. This policy was expressed by Wilde CJ (with whom
Maule J, Cresswell J, Williams J, Parke B and Rolfe B agreed) in <i>De Medina v
Grove</i> (1847) 10 QB 172 at p 176:</a></p><a name="para35">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The law allows every person to
employ its process for the purpose of trying his rights, without subjecting him
to any liability, unless he acts maliciously and without probable cause.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaNoNumber"><a name="para35">This policy underlies a number of legal principles
including the general immunity which attaches to things said and done in court
by witnesses and litigants and the principle that a duty of care is not owed by
one litigant to an opposing litigant. (See, generally, <i>Willers v Joyce</i>
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2016/43.html">[2016] UKSC 43</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2016/43.html">[2016] 3 WLR 477</a> per Lord Mance at para 135.) An employer who
wishes to defend a claim based on vicarious liability for the alleged conduct
of his employees should be entitled to defend the claim in the way he sees fit,
notwithstanding that his employees will or may as a result be subjected to
public criticism during the trial process. He should be free to do so without
having constantly to look over his shoulder for fear that his conduct of the
defence may expose him to a claim by his employees. Decisions in the conduct of
the defence, such as which inquiries to undertake, which experts to instruct,
which witnesses to call or which resources to devote to resisting the claim,
are essentially matters for the employer as defendant and should be taken free
of anxiety as to possible future claims by the employees on the basis that the
case should have been run differently. The proposed duty would, to my mind,
inevitably inhibit the conduct of the defence. An employer would,
understandably, be less likely to make admissions in circumstances where they
are objectively justified or to make use of evidence which reflects
unfavourably on an employee, for fear of the subsequent repercussions. I have
no doubt that the imposition of the duty of care contended for in the present
case would, as the Commissioner submits, have a chilling effect on the defence
of civil proceedings.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para36">36.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Secondly, the recognition of a duty owed by an employer to his employees
to defend a claim effectively would be inconsistent with the important legal
policy which encourages the settlement of civil claims and seeks to promote out
of court settlement. The resulting risk of exposure to consequential claims
would, in many situations, operate as a powerful disincentive to settlement.</a></p><a name="para36">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para36"></a><a name="para37">37.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Thirdly, the duty contended for could result in delay or disruption of
civil proceedings. Disputes between employers and employees as to the
appropriate way in which the defence should be conducted could well paralyse
the defence. Resort to some form of dispute resolution procedure could be
expensive and time-consuming. In many instances the employer may well feel
compelled to make a contribution claim against his employees in order to
negative the imposition of a duty of care owed to them. Moreover, the existence
of such a duty may result in an employer needlessly prolonging proceedings
against him in an attempt to establish that he has taken care to protect the
interests of his employees. (See N McBride, PN 2017 (33) 3, 216 at p 219.)</a></p><a name="para37">

</span>Fourthly, the recognition of such a duty of care would be a fruitful
source of satellite litigation. While there are some situations in which
litigation about the conduct of prior litigation is unavoidable, it is
generally to be discouraged. The acknowledgement of a duty owed by employers to
their employees to protect their economic or reputational interests in the
conduct of litigation would be likely to result in a proliferation of
consequential claims which would often amount to a collateral challenge to the
outcome of earlier proceedings.</a></p><a name="para38">

<p class="ParaHeading">Legal professional privilege</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para38"></a><a name="para39">39.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is also necessary to say something about the issue of legal
professional privilege. At first instance, it was submitted on behalf of the
Commissioner that legal professional privilege was a further policy
consideration for not imposing a duty of care in these circumstances. It was
submitted that if such a duty of care existed an employer would in effect be compelled
to waive privilege in circumstances where he would otherwise be entitled to
assert privilege, because the correctness or reasonableness of his conduct of
the underlying litigation could not be properly examined without relevant legal
advice being properly exposed to judicial scrutiny. The response on behalf of
the officers was that the relationship between the parties gave rise to a joint
or common interest with the result that the Commissioner would, in any event,
be unable to rely on legal professional privilege against the officers to the
extent that common interest privilege applied.</a></p><a name="para39">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para39"></a><a name="para40">40.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In his judgment Jay J expressly stated that he did not rely on legal
professional privilege in coming to the conclusion that there was no arguable
duty of care. The Court of Appeal did not address this point in its judgments.</a></p><a name="para40">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para40"></a><a name="para41">41.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The judgments below have established that the legal advisers who
defended the claim brought by BA were instructed on behalf of the Commissioner
only and that neither those lawyers nor the Commissioner undertook
responsibility to the officers for the conduct of the litigation. The officers
attended conferences with counsel in the capacity of witnesses not clients. The
officers do not seek to appeal those conclusions. Accordingly, there can be no question
of legal professional privilege belonging jointly to the Commissioner and the
officers. However, the officers rely on common interest privilege and seek to
employ it as a sword in asserting an entitlement to disclosure of material in
the possession of the Commissioner which is privileged against disclosure to
others. Whether the officers have such an entitlement will depend on whether
such a claim is consistent with the underlying relationship of the Commissioner
and the officers. (See <i>Phipson on Evidence</i>, 19th ed (2017), para 24-11.)
In my view it is not.</a></p><a name="para41">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para41"></a><a name="para42">42.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If one sets to one side the decided cases which turn on contractual
access rights, the cases show that something more than a shared interest in the
outcome of litigation is required before common interest privilege can be used
as a sword in the manner proposed here. For example, in <i>Dennis &amp; Sons
Ltd v West Norfolk Farmers Manure and Chemical Co-operative Co Ltd</i> [1943]
Ch 220 Simonds J held that shareholders were entitled to disclosure of an
accountants’ report concerning the rights and duties of the board commissioned
by the directors, notwithstanding that by the time the report was received the
shareholders had commenced proceedings against the company in relation to the
conduct of the company’s affairs. The report had been commissioned by the
directors on behalf of all the shareholders and not for the purpose of
defending themselves against hostile litigation. The judge observed (at p 222)
that the general rule applied equally as between a company and its shareholders
and as between a trustee and his beneficiaries. A claim to privilege between
the company and its shareholders would have been inconsistent with the nature
of the relationship.</a></p><a name="para42">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para42"></a><a name="para43">43.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Similarly, in <i>CIA Barca de Panama SA v George Wimpey &amp; Co Ltd</i>
[1980] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 598, Barca and Wimpey each held half the shares in a joint
venture company, DLW, which had claims against Aramco. Wimpey settled the
claims without authority from Barca. In the resulting proceedings brought by
Barca against Wimpey the Court of Appeal held that Barca was entitled to
disclosure of privileged documents of Wimpey generated in the original
litigation as the Aramco claims had been made by Wimpey on behalf of itself and
Barca (per Stephenson LJ at p 614).</a></p><a name="para43">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para43"></a><a name="para44">44.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In <i>Commercial Union Assurance Co plc v Mander</i> [1996] 2 Lloyd’s
Rep 640, at 647-648, Moore-Bick J provided the following example:</a></p><a name="para44">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Although in many cases a
relationship between two parties which supports common interest privilege will
be one which also gives each of them a right to obtain disclosure of
confidential documents relating to the matter in which they are both
interested, one can readily think of situations in which that would not be so.
Take the example given by Donaldson LJ in <i>Buttes v Hammer (No 3)</i> of
tenants in a block of flats. One tenant, acting entirely for his own benefit,
obtains legal advice concerning a dispute with the landlord over a provision in
the lease which affects other tenants in a similar way. If he chooses to give a
copy of the document containing that advice in confidence to another tenant who
is willing to cooperate with him in pursuing a claim their common interest
would be sufficient for the document to remain privileged in the latter’s
hands. I do not, however, see any basis upon which the second tenant could have
insisted on seeing the advice if the first tenant did not wish to show it to
him, even though they had a common interest in the subject matter. Both as a
matter of principle and authority … it is not enough that the person seeking disclosure
of confidential documents can show that he has an interest in the subject
matter which would be sufficient to give rise to common interest privilege if
the documents had been disclosed to him; he must be able to establish a right
to obtain access to them by reason of a common interest in their subject matter
which existed at the time the advice was sought or the documents were
obtained.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para44"></a><a name="para45">45.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the present case the Commissioner and the officers are likely to have
had a shared interest in successfully defending the claim brought by BA against
the Commissioner, at least initially. It may well be that, had privileged
documents been disclosed in confidence by the Commissioner to the officers at
that stage, that shared interest would have enabled the officers to defeat an
application for disclosure by a third party on grounds of common interest
privilege. However, before the officers could compel disclosure of privileged
material in the hands of the Commissioner, considerably more would be required.
Although the relationship between the Commissioner and the officers is closely
analogous to that of employer and employees, there is nothing in the present
situation which resembles the relationship between a company and its
shareholders, or between a trustee and his beneficiaries, or between parties to
a joint venture agreement. Here the relationship between the Commissioner and
the officers does not require or justify such an entitlement of access to
legally privileged material.</a></p><a name="para45">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para45"></a><a name="para46">46.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Considered against this background, there is force in the Commissioner’s
submission as to the practical consequences in this regard of the recognition
of the duty of care for which the officers contend. Although employees would
normally have no entitlement to disclosure of privileged material in the
possession of their employer relating to the defence of the original
proceedings, the effective defence of proceedings by the employees against the
employer brought on the basis that the earlier proceedings were conducted in
breach of duty may well require waiver of privilege in order to demonstrate the
contrary. This has the potential to undermine the effective conduct of the
defence of the original claim against the employer in that the possibility of
such a claim in negligence and the likelihood of having to waive privilege may
well inhibit frank discussion between the employer and his legal advisers. This
is, therefore, a further consideration which weighs against the recognition of
the duty of care for which the officers contend.</a></p><a name="para46">

<p class="ParaHeading">Conclusion</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para46"></a><a name="para47">47.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For these reasons I would allow the appeal. The imposition of the
claimed duty would not be fair, just or reasonable.</a></p><a name="para47">
