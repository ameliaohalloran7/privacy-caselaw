</span>These appeals are brought by a Polish national, Roksana Mirga, and an
Austrian national, Wadi Samin, against decisions of the Court of Appeal
upholding determinations that they were not entitled to certain benefits,
namely income support and housing assistance respectively, pursuant to the
provisions of United Kingdom domestic law. The arguments have changed somewhat
over the course of the two sets of proceedings, but the essential issue raised
now is whether the provisions and the current implementation of the domestic
law in question infringe the rights of residence in the UK of citizens of European
Union member states.</a></p><a name="para1">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Shortly before this judgment was to be delivered, counsel for the
appellants informed us of an Opinion which had been delivered by Advocate
General Wathelet in <i>Jobcenter Berlin Neukölln v Alimanovic </i>(Case
C-67/14) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2015/C6714.html">[2016] 2 WLR 208</a>, which they contended assisted their arguments. We
decided to await the judgment of the Court of Justice in that case. Judgment
was given on 15 September 2015, and the parties have had the opportunity to make
written submissions as to its effect on these appeals.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It should perhaps be added that, after we received those further
submissions, the appellants’ counsel drew to our attention Advocate General
Cruz Villalón’s Opinion in <i>European Commission v United Kingdom </i>(Case
C-308/14), and suggested that we await the judgment of the Court of Justice in
that case, or alternatively that we refer these two cases to that court. In my
opinion, following the judgment in <i>Alimanovic</i>, any issue on which we
have to rule in these appeals is <i>acte éclaré</i>, and accordingly we should
now determine these two appeals.</a></p><a name="para3">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Ms Mirga was born in 1988 in Poland. In 1998, she came to this country
with her parents and three siblings, but they returned to Poland in 2002 after
being refused asylum. Two years later, in June 2004, on Poland’s accession to
the EU, the family returned to the UK. Sadly, her mother died four months
later, and her father, who had been working, gave up his job owing to
depression a few months afterwards. He received income support until late 2007,
when it was decided that he should not have been receiving it, on the ground
that he did not have the right of residence in the UK.</a></p><a name="para4">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Meanwhile, Ms Mirga finished her education in April 2005 and embarked on
registered work within the meaning of the Accession (Immigration and Worker
Registration) Regulations 2004 (SI 2004/1219) (“the A8 Regulations”). She
continued with that registered work until November 2005. In February 2006, she
became pregnant and started to do unregistered work, which she continued for
two months or so. In June 2006, she left home for rented accommodation, and did
a month’s further unregistered work around June 2006. In August 2006, she
claimed income support under the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 (SI
1987/1967) (“the Income Support Regulations”) on the grounds of her pregnancy.
Her baby son was born in October 2006.</a></p><a name="para5">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions refused Ms Mirga’s
application for income support, and his decision was upheld by the First-tier
Tribunal, whose decision was affirmed, albeit for different reasons, by Judge
Rowland in the Upper Tribunal. The Upper Tribunal decided that the Secretary of
State was entitled to refuse Ms Mirga’s application because she did not have a
right of residence in the UK under the A8 Regulations and therefore was excluded
from the ambit of income support by virtue of the Income Support Regulations.
The Upper Tribunal’s decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal in a judgment
given by Laws LJ, with which Tomlinson LJ and Sir David Keene agreed - </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/1952.html">[2012] EWCA Civ 1952</a>.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">The facts relating to Mr Samin</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr Samin was born in Iraq in 1960. After ten years military service, he
successfully sought asylum in Austria in 1992, together with his wife and
children, and he was accorded Austrian citizenship the following year. Sadly, he
became wholly estranged from his wife and children, and he came to the UK in
December 2005, since when he has lived in this country on his own. During the ten
months following his entry into the UK, he had some paid employment on
occasions, often part-time, but he has not worked since some time in 2006, and
has not been looking for work since 2007.</a></p><a name="para7">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr Samin is socially isolated and suffers from poor mental health,
principally from clinical depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Having
attempted to kill himself in the past, he remains a moderately high risk of
suicide in the medium term. He also suffers from diabetes, hypertension and
kidney stones, and he needs physiotherapy.</a></p><a name="para8">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>After occupying temporary accommodation, Mr Samin lived in a studio flat
in North London, which he had to vacate after four years in June 2010. He then
applied to Westminster City Council (“the Council”) for housing under the
homelessness provisions in Part VII of the Housing Act 1996 (“the Housing Act”).
After making inquiries, the Council decided that he was “a person from abroad
who is not eligible for housing assistance” within the meaning of section
185(1) of the Housing Act, because he did not have the right of residence in
the UK under the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 (SI
2006/1003) (“the EEA Regulations”). That decision was affirmed in the Central
London County Court by His Honour Judge Mitchell, whose decision was in turn
upheld by the Court of Appeal for reasons given by Hughes LJ, with which Etherton
and Tomlinson LJJ agreed - </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/1468.html">[2012] EWCA Civ 1468</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/1468.html">[2012] WLR(D) 336</a>.</p>

</span>Under article 18 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union
(“TFEU”), “any discrimination on grounds of nationality” is “prohibited” in so

“shall be a citizen of the Union”, and, in para 2(a), that citizens of the

</span>In 2004, ten countries, including Poland, acceded to the EU pursuant to
the Treaty on Accession 2003 (“the 2003 Accession Treaty”). By virtue of articles
10 and 24 of the Act of Accession forming the second part of the Treaty,
existing member states, including the UK, were accorded, by way of derogation,
certain transitional powers. Those powers included a right to derogate in
relation to the free movement of workers within the EU, which was then governed
by Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 (“the 1968 Regulation”), in relation to
nationals (known as “A8 nationals”) of eight of the ten new member states.
Those powers of derogation in relation to Polish nationals were contained in
paragraphs 1-14 of Part 2 of Annex 12 to the 2003 Accession Treaty. So long as
these provisions were in force, they enabled a host member state to exclude
Polish nationals from freedom of movement rights unless they had been working
in that state for “an uninterrupted period of 12 months” following accession.</a></p><a name="para14">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“(10)&nbsp;&nbsp; Persons exercising their
right of residence should not … become an unreasonable burden on the social
assistance system of the host member state during an initial period of
residence. Therefore, the right of residence for Union citizens and their

beneficiaries of the right of residence do not become an unreasonable burden on
the social assistance system of the host member state they should not be
expelled. Therefore, an expulsion measure should not be the automatic
consequence of recourse to the social assistance system. The host member state
should examine whether it is a case of temporary difficulties and take into
account the duration of residence, the personal circumstances and the amount of
aid granted in order to consider whether the beneficiary has become an
unreasonable burden on its social assistance system and to proceed to his
expulsion. In no case should an expulsion measure be adopted against workers,
self-employed persons or job-seekers as defined by the Court of Justice save on

have or ceases to have a right to reside. However regulation 19(4) states that
a person cannot be removed “as an automatic consequence of having recourse to
the social assistance system of the [UK]”.</a></p><a name="para30">

</span>Pursuant to the terms of the 2003 Accession Treaty, the European Union
(Accessions) Act 2003 was enacted, which, under section 2, permitted the
Secretary of State to make the A8 Regulations (which were revoked in May 2011).
Regulations 2 and 5 of the A8 Regulations provided that A8 nationals would only
have full access to the UK labour market if they had been in registered
employment under the Worker Registration Scheme for a continuous period of 12
months. The consequence was that, so long as the A8 Regulations were in force, A8
nationals could not become “qualifying persons” under the EEA Regulations
unless and until they had performed registered employment for a continuous
period of at least 12 months.</a></p><a name="para31">

</span>Entitlement to income support arises under section 124 of the Social
Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 and the Income Support Regulations.
In very summary terms, income support is available for certain people provided
that they are not engaged in relevant work or receiving relevant education, and
their income is below the “applicable amount”. The effect of regulation 21 of
the Income Support Regulations, however, is that a “person from abroad” is to
be treated as having an “applicable amount” of nil, and is therefore not
eligible for income support.</a></p><a name="para32">

</span>Regulation 21AA(1)-(3) of the Income Support Regulations states that certain
people will be treated as “persons from abroad” unless they are “habitually
resident” in the UK (and certain other places, including Ireland), and have the
right to be so under certain statutory provisions not germane to the present
appeals. Regulation 21AA(4) provides, however, that a person is not a “person
from abroad” if he is, inter alia, a “worker” (or “self-employed person”, or is
to be treated as a “worker” or “self-employed person”) within the meaning of
the 2004 Directive.</a></p><a name="para33">

housing assistance unless of a class prescribed by regulations, along with any
other person from abroad treated as ineligible by virtue of regulations.</a></p><a name="para34">

</span>Mr Coppel QC and Ms Rogers, on behalf of the Secretary of State, contend
that, at the time that Ms Mirga applied for income support, she was ineligible
for income support under the Income Support Regulations, because she was a
“person from abroad”. This was on the basis that she could not claim to be a
“worker” as she was an A8 national who had not done 12 months’ registered
employment (under the A8 Regulations), and thus could not be a “qualifying
person” for the purpose of the EEA Regulations. Even if the A8 Regulations did
not apply, Mr Coppel argues that Ms Mirga would still not have been a “worker”,
as the EEA Regulations would have required her to have worked for at least 12
months before she claimed income support. There is no question of Ms Mirga
having been a “jobseeker”, a “self-employed person”, or a “student” under the
EEA Regulations. Further, it seems clear that Ms Mirga could not claim to be a
“self-sufficient person” under the EEA Regulations, as she had no significant
means of support and no health insurance (but if she had had been a
“self-sufficient person” she would presumably not have needed income support
anyway).</a></p><a name="para36">

</span>With the support of the Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government, Mr Peacock contends for the Council that Mr Samin is not a “worker”
within the EEA Regulations because he is now permanently incapable of work, and
in any event he cannot claim to be a “worker” because he has not worked for 12
months in the UK. Accordingly, argues Mr Peacock, Mr Samin is not a “qualified
person” under the EEA Regulations, from which it follows that he is
“ineligible” for the purposes of the Housing Act. It is also said that Mr Samin
cannot claim to be “a self-sufficient person” within the EEA Regulations
because he has no assets and no health insurance.</a></p><a name="para37">

</span>The first argument raised by Mr Drabble QC, who appears with Ms
Leventhal on behalf of Ms Mirga, is that, in the light of her right to respect
for her private and family life, under article 8 of the European Convention on
Human Rights, she cannot be removed from the UK, and therefore her right of
residence in the UK, as accorded by article 21.1 of TFEU, cannot be limited or
cut back in the way that the Income Support Regulations seek to do, namely by
restricting her rights to income support because she has not achieved a
continuous 12 month period in registered employment. His alternative argument
is that, even if it would be permissible to refuse Ms Mirga income support on
that ground, it is only possible in practice if it would be proportionate to do
so, and in particular if the grant of income support to her would place an
unreasonable burden on the social assistance system of the UK, and there has
been no inquiry into that question.</a></p><a name="para38">

</span>The first argument raised on behalf of Mr Samin by Mr Drabble, appearing
with Mr Carter and Mr Cowan, is that the refusal of housing assistance to Mr
Samin constituted unlawful discrimination in breach of article 18 of the TFEU,
even though he may not have had a right of residence in the UK. The alternative
argument raised on behalf of Mr Samin reflects the alternative argument in Ms
Mirga’s case, namely that there should have been an investigation as to whether
it was proportionate to refuse Mr Samin housing assistance, in particular on
the ground that it represented an unreasonable burden of the UK social
assistance system.</a></p><a name="para39">

</span>Mr Drabble’s arguments were supported by Ms Demetriou QC, assisted by Mr

the court’s appreciation of their pro bono work in this case, and their

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr Drabble’s first contention on behalf of Ms Mirga is that, as she is a
“worker” (albeit one whose work was temporarily interrupted owing to her
pregnancy), article 21.1 of TFEU accords her the right to “reside freely”
within the EU, and therefore within the UK, and that the denial of income
support to her, at a time when she needed it in order to be able to live in the
UK, was an impermissible interference with that right, as she would, in
practice, be forced to return to Poland. That argument can be said to reflect
the fundamental importance of freedom of movement and freedom of establishment
to the single market concept, as well as the significance attached in articles
18 and 19 of TFEU to the avoidance of discrimination between citizens of a member
state and other EU nationals.</a></p><a name="para41">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para41"></a><a name="para42">42.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A similar argument cannot be run in relation to Mr Samin, because it is
now accepted that owing to his inability to work he cannot claim to be a
“worker”, even in the light of the extended definition in article 7.3 of the
2004 Directive and regulation 6 of the EEA Regulations. Accordingly, Mr
Drabble’s first line of argument on behalf of Mr Samin is that the Council’s
refusal to provide Mr Samin with housing assistance under Part VII of the
Housing Act constituted “discrimination on grounds of nationality” prohibited
by article 18 of TFEU, because such assistance would have been accorded to a
citizen of the UK, or a qualifying worker from another member state, who was
otherwise in the same position as Mr Samin.</a></p><a name="para42">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para42"></a><a name="para43">43.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It seems to me that these arguments face real difficulties. The right accorded
by article 21.1 of TFEU, which is relied on by Ms Mirga, although fundamental
and broad, is qualified by the words “subject to the limitations and conditions
laid down in the Treaties and in the measures adopted to give them effect”. In
the present case, the “measures” include the 2004 Directive, and presumably
include the 2003 Accession Treaty, which was adopted under article 49 of the
Treaty on European Union.</a></p><a name="para43">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para43"></a><a name="para44">44.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It appears clear from the terms of paragraph 10 of the preamble that it
was a significant aim of the 2004 Directive that EU nationals from one member
state should not be able to exercise their rights of residence in another
member state so as to become “an unreasonable burden on the social assistance
system”. It also seems clear that any right of residence after three months can
be “subject to conditions”. This is reflected in the terms of article 7.1, in
that it limits the right of residence after three months to those who are
workers, self-employed, students, or with sufficient resources and health
insurance “not to become a burden on the social assistance system of the host
member state”. Indeed, it is worth noting that article 14.1 even limits the
right of residence in the first three months. It further appears clear from
article 24, that EU nationals’ right of equal treatment in host member states
is “subject to … secondary law”, and in particular that they can be refused
social assistance “where appropriate”.</a></p><a name="para44">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para44"></a><a name="para45">45.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, when one turns to the 2003 Accession Treaty and the 2004
Directive, I consider that, because Ms Mirga has not done 12 months’ work in
this country, she cannot claim to be a “worker”, and, because she is not a
“jobseeker”, “self-employed”, a “student”, or “self-sufficient”, it would seem
to follow that she can be validly denied a right of residence in the UK, and
therefore can be excluded from social assistance. In those circumstances, it
must follow that article 21.1 TFEU cannot assist her.</a></p><a name="para45">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para45"></a><a name="para46">46.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The fact that Ms Mirga may have to cease living in the UK to seek assistance
in Poland does not appear to me to assist her argument. Although the refusal of
social assistance may cause her to leave the UK, there would be no question of
her being expelled from this country. I find it hard to read the 2004 Directive
as treating refusal of social assistance as constituting a species of
constructive expulsion even if it results in the person concerned leaving the
host member state. As I see it, the Directive distinguishes between the right
of residence and the act of expulsion. However, quite apart from this, the
Directive makes it clear that the right of residence is not to be invoked
simply to enable a national of one member state to obtain social assistance in
another member state. On the contrary: the right of residence is not intended
to be available too easily to those who need social assistance from the host
member state.</a></p><a name="para46">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr Samin’s first argument appears to me to face similar difficulties.
The article 18 right which he relies on does not constitute a broad or general
right not to be discriminated against. First, its ambit is limited to “the
scope of the Treaties”, which means that it only comes into play where there is
discrimination in connection with a right in the TFEU or another EU Treaty.
Secondly, the article 18 right is “without prejudice to any special provisions
contained [in the Treaties]”. That brings one back to the argument raised on
behalf of Ms Mirga.</a></p><a name="para47">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Contrary to the appellants’ argument, I do not consider that the

However, it is unnecessary to consider that possibility, because it seems to me
clear that the first point raised by each appellant must be rejected as <i>acte

</span>In <i>Brey</i>, the applicant was a German national residing in Austria,
who received a German pension and care allowance insufficient for his needs,
and who was refused a compensatory supplement from the Austrian government,
because he did not meet the necessary national residency requirements, which
excluded those who did not have sufficient resources not to be a burden on the
Austrian social security system. Shortly after that refusal, the Austrian
government issued the applicant with an EEA citizen registration certificate.
The question referred to the Court of Justice by the Austrian Oberster
Gerichtshof was “whether article 7(1)(b) of Directive 2004/38 should be
interpreted as meaning that, for the purposes of that provision, the concept of
‘social assistance’ covers a benefit such as the compensatory supplement” (para
26). The Chamber ruled, at para 80, that the 2004 Directive precluded national
legislation which</a></p><a name="para49">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“automatically - whatever the
circumstances - bars the grant of a benefit, such as the compensatory
supplement … to a national of another member state who is not economically
active, on the grounds that, despite having been issued with a certificate of
residence, he does not meet the necessary requirements for obtaining the legal
right to reside … since obtaining that right of residence is conditional on
that national having sufficient resources not to apply for the benefit.”</p>

Leipzig referred a number of questions to the Court of Justice, and the Grand
Chamber concluded that article 24 of the 2004 Directive and article 4 of
Regulation 883/2004 (which concerns “the coordination of social security
systems”, and includes a similar anti-discrimination provision to the 2004

</span>In para 60 of <i>Dano</i>, the Grand Chamber said that the right granted
by article 18 of TFEU was subject to the restrictions I have mentioned in paras
43 and 44 above, and the court referred in support to the decision in <i>Brey</i>,
and in particular paras 46ff. In para 46 of <i>Brey</i>, the Chamber had
referred to “the right of nationals of one member state to reside in the
territory of another members state without being … employed or self-employed”
as being “not unconditional”. It is also worth noting that the Grand Chamber
also referred to article 20 of TFEU and article 24 of the 2004 Directive in
terms which made it clear that the rights they grant should, in the instant
context, be treated similarly to the rights granted by article 18.</a></p><a name="para52">

</span>In para 61 of <i>Dano</i>, the Grand Chamber described the right under
article 18 of the TFEU as having been “given more specific expression in
article 24 of [the 2004 Directive]”. In para 63, citing <i>Brey</i>, para 61, the
court pointed out that if someone has recourse to “assistance schemes
established by the public authorities”, he may “during his period of residence,
become a burden on the public finances of the host member state which could
have consequences for the overall level of assistance which may be granted by
that state”. In para 69, it was made clear that “a Union citizen can claim
equal treatment with nationals of the host member state only if his residence
in the territory of the host member state complies with the conditions of [the
2004 Directive]”. In para 73, the court summarised the effect of article 7(1)
of the 2004 Directive, and said in the following paragraph that, if “persons
who do not have a right of residence under [the 2004 Directive] may claim
entitlement to social benefits under the same conditions as those applicable to
nationals [that] would run counter to an objective of the Directive”. In para
76, the purpose of article 7(1)(b) of the 2004 Directive was described as being
“to prevent economically inactive Union citizens from using the host members
state’s welfare system to fund their means of subsistence”. Finally, in para 80
the Grand Chamber said that a person’s “financial situation … should be
examined specifically … in order to determine whether he meets the condition of
having sufficient resources to qualify … under article 7.1(b)”.</a></p><a name="para53">

</span>As already mentioned, the authority of the decision in <i>Dano </i>has
been reinforced by the decision in <i>Alimanovic</i>, where, in paras 44 and 50
respectively, the Grand Chamber specifically referred to what was said in paras
63 and 69 of the judgment in <i>Dano </i>with approval. More broadly, as
explained more fully below, the Grand Chamber in <i>Alimanovic</i> confirmed
that a Union citizen can claim equal treatment with nationals of a country, at
least in relation to social assistance, only if he or she can satisfy the
conditions for lawful residence in that country. Thus, it was confirmed that
article 24.2 of the 2004 Directive was, in effect, a valid exception to the
principle of non-discrimination.</a></p><a name="para54">

</span><i>Dano </i>and <i>Alimanovic</i> clearly demonstrate that the
jurisprudence of the Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice is inconsistent with
Mr Drabble’s first argument on behalf of Ms Mirga and Mr Samin, at least in so
far as his argument is focussed on the 2004 Directive. It is fair to say that
those cases were not concerned with the 2003 Accession Treaty. However, the
House of Lords concluded in <i>Zalewska v Department for Social Development </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/67.html">[2008] 1 WLR 2602</a> that the A8 Regulations, which reflect the provisions of the 2003
Accession Treaty, were consistent with EU law, and nothing I have heard or read
in connection with this appeal casts doubt on that conclusion. In particular,
it appears to be consistent with the reasoning in <i>Brey</i>, <i>Dano </i>and <i>Alimanovic</i>.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The only possible remaining issue in relation to this first set of
arguments could be whether (i) in the case of Ms Mirga, the provisions of the
Income Support Regulations, when read together with the A8 Regulations and the
EEA Regulations, and (ii) in the case of Mr Samin, the provisions of the
Eligibility Regulations, when read together with the EEA Regulations, complied
with the requirements of the 2003 Accession Treaty and the 2004 Directive. As I
understood his contentions, Mr Drabble did not suggest any discrepancy in the
domestic regulations - unsurprisingly, as they were clearly intended to
implement the EU instruments.</a></p><a name="para56">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para56"></a><a name="para57">57.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, in my judgment, following the clear guidance from the Grand
Chamber in <i>Dano </i>and <i>Alimanovic</i>, the first arguments raised on
behalf of Ms Mirga and Mr Samin cannot be maintained. That leaves their
alternative arguments raised in the two appeals, based on proportionality.</a></p><a name="para57">

<p class="ParaHeading">Issue two: the appellants’ argument based on lack of
proportionality</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para57"></a><a name="para58">58.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr Drabble’s second argument in both appeals is that the determination
of the authorities and the courts and tribunals below in the case of both Ms
Mirga and Mr Samin was flawed because no consideration was given to the
proportionality of refusing each of them social assistance bearing in mind all
the circumstances of their respective cases, and in particular that the authority
or tribunal concerned failed to address the burden it would place on the system
if they were to be accorded the social assistance which they sought. In that
connection, Mr Drabble relied on the Court of Justice’s decisions in <i>St Prix
v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions</i> (Case C-507/12) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/eu/cases/EUECJ/2014/C50712.html">[2014] PTSR 1448</a>, <i>Baumbast v Secretary of State for the Home Department </i>(Case C-413/99)
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2002/C41399.html">[2003] ICR 1347</a> and <i>Brey.</i></p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para59">59.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><i>St Prix </i>was concerned with the question whether a person ceased
automatically to be a “worker” for the purpose of the 2004 Directive, and
therefore the EEA Regulations, if she temporarily ceased work owing to the fact
that she was pregnant. It provides no assistance to the appellants’ arguments
as advanced by Mr Drabble, except to emphasise the purposive approach to be
adopted to the interpretation of the 2004 Directive.</a></p><a name="para59">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para59"></a><a name="para60">60.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The effect of the decision of <i>Baumbast</i> is that the fact that an
applicant may fall short of the strict requirements of having
“self-sufficiency” status under what are now the 2004 Directive and the EEA
Regulations cannot always justify the host member state automatically rejecting
his or her right to reside on the ground that the requirements for that status
are not wholly complied with. In <i>Baumbast </i>the court was concerned, inter
alia, with the issue whether an applicant could exercise the right to reside in
the UK in circumstances where he was resting his case on the ground that he was
a “self-sufficient person”. It is clear from paras 88 and 89 of the judgment that
the applicant had sufficient resources to be self-sufficient in practice, and that
he had medical insurance. His only possible problem was that the insurance may
have fallen short of being “comprehensive” in one respect, namely that it was
not clear whether it covered “emergency treatment”. The court held that, on the
assumption that the insurance fell short in this connection, it would
nonetheless be disproportionate to deprive the applicant of his right to
reside.</a></p><a name="para60">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para60"></a><a name="para61">61.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In para 92, the court pointed out that there were strong factors in the
applicant’s favour, namely that he had sufficient resources, that he had worked
and resided in the UK for “several years”, that his family had also resided in
the UK for several years, that he and his family had never received any social
assistance, and that he and his family had comprehensive medical insurance in
Germany. In those circumstances, the court said in para 93 that it would be “a
disproportionate interference with the exercise” of the applicant’s right of
residence conferred by what is now article 21.1 of TFEU to refuse to let him
stay in the UK because of a small shortfall in the comprehensiveness of his
medical insurance.</a></p><a name="para61">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para61"></a><a name="para62">62.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I do not consider that the appellants derive any assistance from <i>Baumbast</i>.
Mr Baumbast’s case was predicated on the fact that he did not need any assistance
from the state. Even if the decision is relied on by analogy, it is of no help
to the appellants. The thrust of the court’s reasoning in that case was that,
where an applicant’s failure to meet the requirements of being “a self-sufficient
person” was very slight, his links with the host member state were particularly
strong, and his claim was particularly meritorious, it would be
disproportionate to reject his claim to enjoy the right of residence in that
host state. Even though the applicant had a very strong case in the sense that
he fell short of the self-sufficiency requirements in one very small respect,
the court decided that he could rely on disproportionality only after
considering the position in some detail.</a></p><a name="para62">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para62"></a><a name="para63">63.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr Drabble’s argument appears to derive greater assistance from some of
the reasoning of the Third Chamber in <i>Brey</i>, where the Third Chamber held
that the complementary supplement was “social assistance” within the meaning of
the 2004 Directive and also that it was open to member states to provide such assistance
to “economically inactive citizens of other member states in any
circumstances”. Crucially, argues Mr Drabble, the Austrian government’s refusal
of the complementary supplement to the applicant was held to be unlawful.</a></p><a name="para63">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para63"></a><a name="para64">64.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The central reasoning of the Third Chamber in <i>Brey </i>for present
purposes is in paras 75-78. In para 75, having considered a number of points,
the court concluded that “the mere fact that a national of a member state
receives social assistance is not sufficient to show that he constitutes an
unreasonable burden on the social assistance system of the host member state”. In
the following paragraph, the court stated that the fact that a non-national has
applied for the benefit in issue in that case was “not sufficient to preclude
[him] from receiving it, regardless of the duration of residence, the amount of
the benefit, and the period for which it is available”.</a></p><a name="para64">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para64"></a><a name="para65">65.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In para 77, the court made the point that domestic legislation, such as
the Austrian law in that case, could not provide that a national of another
member state, who was not a worker, self-employed or a student, should be
automatically barred from receiving a social benefit. In the next paragraph,
the court stated that “the competent authorities” should be able “when
examining the application of a Union citizen who is not economically active and
is in Mr Brey’s position” to “take into account” certain factors. They included
“the amount and regularity of [the applicant’s] income”, the fact that he had
received a certificate of residence, the period for which he would receive the
benefit, and “the extent of the burden [it] would place” on the social security
system (which as Advocate General Wathelet said in <i>Dano </i>at paras 111-112
of his Opinion, must be a collective assessment, which was confirmed by the
Grand Chamber in para 62 of <i>Alimanovic</i>). These factors were, the court
said in para 78 of the judgment in <i>Brey</i>, for the domestic court to
assess.</a></p><a name="para65">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para65"></a><a name="para66">66.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><i>Brey </i>was an unusual case, because the applicant had been issued
with a certificate of residence by the Austrian government, a factor which
appears to have played a significant part in the court’s thinking, as it was
recited in the re-formulated question (in para 32) and it is referred to
expressly and impliedly in the crucial para 78 of the judgment, and indeed in
the final ruling of the Third Chamber (see para 49 above). However, it is not
necessary to address that point further, as it appears to me that the reasoning
in <i>Brey </i>cannot assist the appellants on the instant appeals, in the
light of the subsequent reasoning of the Grand Chamber in the subsequent
decisions in <i>Dano </i>and <i>Alimanovic</i>.</a></p><a name="para66">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para66"></a><a name="para67">67.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The observations of the Grand Chamber in <i>Dano </i>discussed in para
53 above are in point. In <i>Alimanovic</i>, para 59, the Grand Chamber specifically
mentioned that the court in <i>Brey </i>had stated that “a member state [was
required] to take account of the individual situation of the person concerned
before it … finds that the residence of that person is placing an unreasonable
burden on its social assistance system”. However, the Grand Chamber went on to
say that “no such individual assessment is necessary in circumstances such as
those in issue in this case”. In para 60, the Grand Chamber explained that:</a></p><a name="para67">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Directive 2004/38, establishing a
gradual system as regards the retention of the status of ‘worker’ which seeks
to safeguard the right of residence and access to social assistance, itself
takes into consideration various factors characterising the individual
situation of each applicant for social assistance and, in particular, the
duration of the exercise of any economic activity.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The court then went on to explain that article 7 of the
2004 Directive, when read with other provisions, “guarantees a significant
level of legal certainty and transparency in the context of the award of social
assistance by way of basic provision, while complying with the principle of
proportionality”. (In this connection, the Grand Chamber took a different view
from that taken by Advocate General Wathelet in paras 105-111 of his Opinion,
upon which Mr Drabble had understandably relied.)</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para67"></a><a name="para68">68.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In my view, this makes good sense: it seems unrealistic to require “an
individual examination of each particular case”. I note that this was a
proposition which the Second Chamber rejected, albeit in a somewhat different
(and probably less striking) context, on the ground that “the management of the
regime concerned must remain technically and economically viable” - see <i>Dansk
Jurist-og Økonomforbund v Indenrigs-og Sundshedsministeriet</i> (Case C-546/11)
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2013/C54611.html">[2014] ICR 1</a>, para 70, which was cited with approval in the present context by
Advocate General Wahl in <i>Dano </i>at para 132 of his Opinion.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para69">69.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Where a national of another member state is not a worker, self-employed
or a student, and has no, or very limited, means of support and no medical
insurance (as is sadly the position of Ms Mirga and Mr Samin), it would
severely undermine the whole thrust and purpose of the 2004 Directive if
proportionality could be invoked to entitle that person to have the right of
residence and social assistance in another member state, save perhaps in
extreme circumstances. It would also place a substantial burden on a host
member state if it had to carry out a proportionality exercise in every case
where the right of residence (or indeed the right against discrimination) was
invoked.</a></p><a name="para69">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para69"></a><a name="para70">70.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Even if there is a category of exceptional cases where proportionality
could come into play, I do not consider that either Ms Mirga or Mr Samin could
possibly satisfy it. They were in a wholly different position from Mr Baumbast:
he was not seeking social assistance, he fell short of the self-sufficiency
criteria to a very small extent indeed, and he had worked in this country for
many years. By contrast Ms Mirga and Mr Samin were seeking social assistance,
neither of them had any significant means of support or any medical insurance,
and neither had worked for sustained periods in this country. The whole point
of their appeals was to enable them to receive social assistance, and at least
the main point of the self-sufficiency test is to assist applicants who would
be very unlikely to need social assistance.</a></p><a name="para70">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para70"></a><a name="para71">71.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Whatever sympathy one may naturally feel for Ms Mirga and Mr Samin,
their respective applications for income support and housing assistance
represent precisely what was said by the Grand Chamber in <i>Dano</i>, para 75
(supported by its later reasoning in <i>Alimanovic</i>)<i> </i>to be the aim of
the 2004 Directive to stop, namely “economically inactive Union citizens using
the host member state’s welfare system to fund their means of subsistence”.</a></p><a name="para71">
