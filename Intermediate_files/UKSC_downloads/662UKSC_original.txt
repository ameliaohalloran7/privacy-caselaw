</span>By this appeal Mr and Mrs Hancock seek to show that the redemption of
the loan notes, issued to them in connection with the sale of their shares in
their company, Blubeckers Ltd, fell outside the charge to capital gains tax
(“CGT”) by virtue of the exemption in section 115 of the Taxation of Chargeable
Gains Act 1992 (“TCGA”) for disposals of “qualifying corporate bonds” (“QCBs”).
QCBs are essentially sterling-only bonds (see TCGA, section 117). The
noteworthy feature for present purposes of the redemption process was that,
following the reorganisation, some of the loan notes issued as consideration
were converted into QCBs. TCGA confers “rollover relief” on the disposal of
securities as part of a reorganisation, ie it brings securities issued as
consideration into charge for CGT purposes but defers the tax until their
subsequent realisation. This is less favourable to the taxpayer than the
exemption in TCGA, section 115. The roll-over provisions constitute a carve-out
from the exemption in TCGA, section 115. They extend to certain conversions
involving QCBs. The appellants seek to fall outside that carve-out (and thus
within the exemption in TCGA, section 115). The Court of Appeal (Lewison,
Kitchin and Floyd LJJ) rejected the appellants’ claim: </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2017/198.html">[2017] 1 WLR 4717</a>. They
considered that, although the wording of the carve-out could be read literally
in favour of the taxpayers, that result would be contrary to Parliament’s
intention. Therefore, the appellants’ claim for relief failed. Instead, they
were entitled to rollover relief deferring tax to redemption.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">The legislative and factual framework in more detail</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2">2.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For CGT purposes, there must be a relevant disposal of a relevant asset
by persons chargeable to tax resulting in a gain which is chargeable for
capital gains tax purposes. In this case, the appellants undoubtedly made a
gain when they exchanged their shares in Blubeckers Ltd for redeemable loan
notes (with a provision for an earn-out under which further loan notes would,
as in the event happened, be issued, dependent on the performance of the
business). This transaction was a reorganisation under TCGA, section 126.
Rollover relief was available under TCGA, section 127.</a></p><a name="para2">

</span>The appellants structured the disposal of their Blubeckers shares in
three stages. Stage 1 was the exchange of Blubeckers shares for Lionheart notes,
which, being convertible into foreign currency, were not QCBs. At Stage 2, the
terms of some of those notes were varied so that they became QCBs. At Stage 3,
both sets of notes (QCBs and non-QCBs) were, together and without distinction,
converted into one series of secured discounted loan notes (“SLNs”), which were
QCBs. The SLNs were subsequently redeemed for cash. It is said to be the result
of the completion of Stages 2 and 3 that the appellants are not chargeable to
CGT. The exact nominal amount of loan notes converted into QCBs does not matter
in that, on the appellants’ argument, it was sufficient if the QCB element of
the conversion was the smallest denomination (say £1).</a></p><a name="para3">

</span>Rollover relief is available for reorganisations resulting in the issue
of securities such as shares. TCGA, section 132, as amended by section 88(2) of
the Finance Act 1997, by extending that relief to a conversion of securities,
following a reorganisation, in or out of a QCB, equates the relief for such a
conversion with that available for a reorganisation of share capital:</a></p><a name="para4">

</span>The purpose of TCGA, sections 127 to 131, referred to in the opening
line of section 132, is to provide that there is no disposal of shares at the
time of the reorganisation, and for further matters, such as the allocation of
the consideration between different classes of security, part disposals, unpaid
calls and indexation. The key points to note in these provisions, which it is
not necessary to set out, are (1) that a conversion as defined is to receive
the same relief as a reorganisation, ie rollover relief, even if it involves
QCBs whose disposal is otherwise outside the charge to CGT; and (2) that
emphasis is given to the aggregation of the securities into a single asset:
section 127 provides that both the original holding, “taken as a single asset”,
which the holder disposes of under the reorganisation, and the consideration
securities, also “taken as a single asset”, are treated as “the same asset”
with the same acquisition date as the original holding. We are not concerned
with sections 133 or 134.</a></p><a name="para5">

</span>To ensure that the conversion of, or into, QCBs on a reorganisation is
within the charge to CGT on the same basis as the issue of other securities on
a reorganisation, ie on the basis that the holder is entitled to rollover
relief, section 116(1) provides that the disposal will result in rollover
relief where sections 127 to 130 would apply, and (these are the critical words

where the new holding following conversion includes QCBs, Limb A cannot apply.
The question here is whether Limb B applies: the appellants contend that Limb B
also cannot apply because the (aggregate) original holding prior to conversion
included QCBs.</a></p><a name="para7">

</span>The Upper Tribunal, allowing an appeal from the First-tier Tribunal,
held that the conversion of securities at the third stage comprised separate
transactions in relation to each share converted. As the First-tier Tribunal
had pointed out, the relief under section 116 for QCBs had been intended to
promote the market in sterling bonds and so the interpretation favoured by the
appellants would go well beyond that objective. The Upper Tribunal also noted
that in TCGA, section 132 Parliament had defined “conversion” in relation to
transactions involving QCBs separately in relation to each security (see para 4
above). The Upper Tribunal also rejected HMRC’s argument based on <i>WT Ramsay
Ltd v Inland Revenue Comrs </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1981/1.html">[1982] AC 300</a>, but we are not concerned with

</span>The appellants appealed to the Court of Appeal. They repeated their
argument that Stage 3 constituted a single conversion of the loan notes
(including QCBs) into QCBs, and so neither limb of TCGA, section 116(1)(b)
applied. HMRC responded that Stage 3 was not one transaction but two: the first
transaction (the conversion of the non-QCBs into QCBs) fell within Limb A and
the second (the conversion of the QCBs into SLNs, which were also QCBs) was
outside section 116(1)(b), but (as appears from para 12 of Floyd LJ’s judgment)
the appellants accepted that the variation of the terms of these loan notes at
Stage 2 was a conversion which carried rollover relief so that, when those
bonds were redeemed, a charge to CGT on the held-over gain on these bonds was
triggered.</a></p><a name="para9">

</span>Seeking guidance as to the correct approach on statutory interpretation
Floyd LJ (at para 45 of his judgment) cited, among other authorities, a passage
from the judgment of Neuberger J in <i>Jenks v Dickinson</i> [1997] STC 853,
concerning QCBs and the predecessor of TCGA. That case raised the issue whether
a provision which extended the meaning of QCBs with retrospective effect
relieved the taxpayer of an intervening accrued tax charge on the sale of
shares into which the securities which had retrospectively become QCBs had been
converted. Neuberger J held that it did not. In the passage cited by Floyd LJ,
Neuberger J held that the taxpayer’s construction was:</a></p><a name="para10">

</a><p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt"><a name="para10">“contradictory to the evident purpose
of the relevant statutory provisions, viewed as a whole, viz that capital gains
made on [QCBs] should be exempt from tax, whereas capital gains made on shares
should be subject to tax. In the circumstances, principle, common sense, and
authority show that the court is ‘entitled, and indeed bound, to ... adopt some
other possible meaning’ if it exists (to quote Lord Reid: see [<i>Luke v Inland
Revenue Comrs</i>] </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1963/TC_40_630.html">[1963] AC 557</a>, 579).”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para11">11.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Floyd LJ pointed out that section 132 did not give as an example of a
(single) conversion a conversion of different classes of bonds (para 65). The
process of applying sections 127 to 131 as required by the opening words of
section 132 allowed for “necessary adaptations” (para 63), and so there could
be aggregation of securities for the purposes of some conversions but not
others.</a></p><a name="para11">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para11"></a><a name="para12">12.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The effect of the appellants’ argument would be that the non-QCBs would
escape the charge to CGT. This was contradictory to the evident purpose of the
statutory scheme. The conversion of the two classes of loan notes could and
should therefore be treated separately (para 68). The words “or include”
(providing the option of a single conversion) did not mean that there could be
such a conversion (para 69). The statutory fiction in section 127 had to be restricted
to avoid an unintended result (para 70). The additional words “or include” were
an “isolated drafting anomaly”: the appellants’ argument would produce an even
greater anomaly (para 71). The wording of section 116(3) and (4) which use the
word “constitute” was consistent with the conclusion that “mixed” conversions
were not within section 116(1)(b) (para 73).</a></p><a name="para12">

</span>Lewison LJ agreed. He gave additional reasons. He placed greater weight&nbsp;
on the purposive approach holding that “necessary” adaptations could include
adaptations necessary to give effect to the policy of the statutory scheme
(para 82). He too applied <i>Jenks </i>(para 84) and <i>Luke v Inland Revenue
Comrs</i> (para 88). This enabled him to disregard the words “or include” in
section 116 in the circumstances of this case.</a></p><a name="para13">

</span>Mr Michael Sherry, for the appellants, repeats the arguments on
interpretation that were considered by the Court of Appeal in their judgment.
He compares section 116 with section 135, which I have not mentioned above as
it deals with another form of reorganisation to which Parliament has also
directed that sections 127 to 131 should apply with necessary adaptations, so
that the fact that it may favour the single asset approach would not be
determinative in relation to section 116. A new factor on which he relies is
the absence of any statutory provision for apportioning consideration where, as
here, the QCBs and non-QCBs have been converted together without any allocation
of the price. But that is a matter of mechanics and no doubt the allocation
could be established by evidence.</a></p><a name="para15">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para15"></a><a name="para16">16.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr Sherry emphasises the principle against taxation without clear words
(“the clear words principle”), which can be found in the speech of Lord
Wilberforce in <i>Ramsay</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1981/1.html">[1982] AC 300</a>, 323:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“<span style="color:black">A
subject is only to be taxed upon clear words, not upon ‘intendment’ or upon the
‘equity’ of an Act. Any taxing Act of Parliament is to be construed in
accordance with this principle. What are ‘clear words’ is to be ascertained upon
normal principles: these do not confine the courts to literal interpretation.
There may, indeed should, be considered the context and scheme of the relevant
Act as a whole, and its purpose may, indeed should, be regarded: see <em>Inland
Revenue Comrs v Wesleyan and General Assurance Society</em> (1946) 30 TC 11, 16
per Lord Greene MR and: <em>Mangin v Inland Revenue Comr</em> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKPC/1970/1970_23.html">[1971] AC 739</a>,
746 per Lord Donovan. The relevant Act in these cases is the Finance Act 1965,
the purpose of which is to impose a tax on gains less allowable losses, arising
from disposals.</span>”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para17">17.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>So, submits Mr Sherry, it goes too far to treat the transaction in issue
as two conversions. There was here a single conversion and that was the legal
nature of what has happened. But the answer to his reliance on the passage set
out above from the speech of Lord Wilberforce in <i>Ramsay </i>is that the
clear words principle is not infringed if, fairly and properly construed, no
doubt remains as to the meaning of section 116(1)(b). Moreover, there is no
question of re-characterising the parties’ transaction. It is simply a matter
of deciding what is a conversion for the purposes of the statutory scheme.</a></p><a name="para17">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para17"></a><a name="para18">18.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr Michael Gibbon QC, for HMRC, submits that the Court of Appeal’s
interpretation is principled and uses a conventional approach. The statutory
scheme as so construed is fair to taxpayers generally and coherent.</a></p><a name="para18">

<p class="ParaHeading">Discussion</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para18"></a><a name="para19">19.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is common ground that, if the conversion at Stage 3 involved separate
conversions of the QCBs and the non-QCBs, the appeal must fail. The question
whether there was a single conversion or two separate conversions must be a
question of applying the provisions of TCGA to the facts. The answer is not
mandated in the appellants’ favour by the fact that they utilised a single
transaction.</a></p><a name="para19">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para19"></a><a name="para20">20.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Plainly, section 116(1)(b) contemplates the possibility of a single
transaction which involves a pre-conversion holding of both QCBs and non-QCBs,
and this, coupled with the fact that the Court of Appeal’s interpretation
renders the words “or include” appearing in section 116(1)(b) otiose are
powerful arguments in support of the appellants’ construction.</a></p><a name="para20">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para20"></a><a name="para21">21.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>However, the appellants’ interpretation result would be inexplicable in
terms of the policy expressed in these provisions, which is to enable all relevant
reorganisations to benefit from the same rollover relief. Taxpayers could avoid
those provisions with extreme ease if the appellants are right. There would be
nothing to prevent them from using the occasion of a minimal conversion (say £1
nominal QCB) following a reorganisation and obtaining relief from CGT which was
plainly contrary to and inconsistent with that which was intended to apply to a
conversion connected to a reorganisation.</a></p><a name="para21">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para21"></a><a name="para22">22.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In reality, by looking to the fiscal policy behind the scheme, both
Floyd and Lewison LJJ applied a purposive approach. I need not say more about
the purposive approach in general, save that Lewison LJ seemed to draw a
distinction between the policy of TCGA in its entirety and that part of the Act
which deals with corporate reorganisations (para 82). This is not easy to
follow as the policy of the Act does not materially add to the policy of the
relevant sections for present purposes.</a></p><a name="para22">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para22"></a><a name="para23">23.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Floyd and Lewison LJJ did not give any meaning to the words “or include”
in section 116(1)(b), but as I see it this was appropriate because in section
132(3), as the Upper Tribunal pointed out, it is clear that the intention of
Parliament was that each security converted into a QCB should be viewed as a
separate conversion (which amounts to the same thing as regarding the
conversion in this case as consisting of two conversions, one of QCBs and one
of non-QCBs). Moreover, it is not an objection that section 127 contemplates a
single asset (see para 5 above), because Parliament has required sections 127
to 131 to be applied with “necessary adaptations”. In those circumstances the
clear words principle is observed in the present case.</a></p><a name="para23">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para23"></a><a name="para24">24.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Floyd and Lewison LJJ also relied on the principle in <i>Luke v Inland
Revenue Comrs</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1963/TC_40_630.html">[1963] AC 557</a>. This enables the court, when interpreting a
statute, to adopt (my words) a strained interpretation in place of one which
would be contrary to the clear intention of Parliament. This principle in <i>Luke</i>
can apply even to a tax statute. The clear words principle relied on by Mr
Sherry does not, as Lord Wilberforce pointed out, confine the courts to a
literal interpretation. However, the circumstances in which the principle in <i>Luke</i>
can be applied must be limited, for example, to those where there is not simply
some inconsistency with evident Parliamentary intention but some clear
contradiction with it. Moreover, the intention of Parliament must be clearly
found on the wording of the legislation.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para25">25.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The particular issue in <i>Luke</i> illustrates the nature of this
principle: on the ordinary meaning of the Income Tax Act 1952, section 161,
enacted to prevent tax avoidance by employers meeting expenses for their
employees, a director became liable to be taxed as part of his remuneration on
the cost of repairs executed by his employer on a house which he had leased
from his employer at a fair rent when the repairs were those for which the
landlord would normally be responsible (and had agreed to be responsible). This
was clearly an unreasonable result, and the intention to produce such a result
could not be imputed to Parliament. The House by a majority of 3:2 held that
the expenditure was within an exemption for expenditure by a company on
additions to its own assets, although this provision had to be read in a
somewhat broad-brush way to produce that result. At p 578, Lord Reid called it
“any port in a storm”. The principle was used in that case to prevent the
unreasonable imposition of a tax charge. In this case it is invoked in like
circumstances in favour of HMRC to prevent the imputation to Parliament of an
intention to produce an irrational result. It has not been argued that it can
only apply in favour of the taxpayer and in <i>Jenks </i>(above, para 10)
Neuberger J applied it to the disbenefit of the taxpayer.</a></p><a name="para25">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para25"></a><a name="para26">26.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Nothing in this judgment detracts from the principle in <i>Luke</i> but
in my judgment, it is unnecessary to consider its application in this case
because, as explained in para 23 above, the construction of the relevant provisions
is clear without resort to it.</a></p><a name="para26">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para26"></a><a name="para27">27.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In summary, using Lewison LJ’s mixed but vivid metaphor ( </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2017/198.html">[2017] 1 WLR 4717</a>, para 89), on the true interpretation of TCGA section 116(1)(b), the
potential gain within the non-QCBs was frozen on conversion and did not disappear
in a puff of smoke.</p>
