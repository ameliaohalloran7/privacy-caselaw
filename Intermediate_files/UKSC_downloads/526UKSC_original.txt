<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This appeal arises out of the grounding of the OCEAN VICTORY (“the
vessel”) in the port of Kashima in Japan on 24 October 2006. She was a Capesize
bulk carrier, built in China in 2005. By a demise charterparty dated 8 June
2005, the vessel’s owners, Ocean Victory Maritime Inc (“OVM” or “the owners”),
chartered the vessel to Ocean Line Holdings Ltd (“OLH”), which is or was a
related company, on the widely used Barecon 89 as amended. On 2 August 2006,
OLH time chartered the vessel to China National Chartering Co Ltd (“Sinochart”)
and on 13 September 2006, Sinochart in turn sub-chartered her to Daiichi Chuo
Kisen Kaisha (“Daiichi” or “the charterers”)<b> </b>for a time charter trip.</a></p><a name="para1">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1"></a><a name="para2">2.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The demise charterparty and both time charterparties contained an
undertaking (on materially identical terms) to trade the vessel between safe
ports. On 12/13 September 2006, Daiichi (and thus Sinochart) gave the vessel
instructions to load at Saldanha Bay in South Africa and to discharge at

</span>The port of Kashima is entered from the sea through the northern end of
a specially constructed channel known as the Kashima Fairway, which runs almost
due north south, and is the only route into and out of the port. The Kashima Fairway
is bounded on one side (to the east) by the South Breakwater and on the other
(to the west) by the land.</a></p><a name="para3">

</span>On 24 October the vessel sought to leave the port during a storm.
However, she allided with the northern end of the South Breakwater and grounded.
Shortly thereafter another Capesize vessel, the ELIDA ACE, also grounded in the
Kashima Fairway while attempting to leave the port. Salvors were engaged but
the OCEAN VICTORY eventually broke in two. Her wreck was subsequently removed
in the course of a lengthy wreck removal operation.</a></p><a name="para4">

of the rights of OLH and OVM in respect of the grounding and total loss of the

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was there a breach
of the safe port undertaking? In particular the following specific questions
were agreed: (1) was the port unsafe within the meaning of the safe port
undertaking, so that the charterers were in breach; or (2) was there an
“abnormal occurrence” within the context of the safe port undertaking, which
was no breach of the undertaking?</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there was a breach
of the safe port undertaking, do the provisions for joint insurance in clause
12 of the Barecon 89 form preclude rights of subrogation of hull insurers and
the right of owners to recover in respect of losses covered by hull insurers
against the demise charterer for breach of an express safe port undertaking.</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there was a breach
of the safe port undertaking, is Daiichi entitled to limit its liability for
Gard’s losses or any (and, if so, which) of them as against Sinochart (and
Sinochart in turn against Gard) pursuant to section 185 and Schedule 7 article
2(1) of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995?</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">It was agreed that in the event that the appeal succeeds
(that is that the answer to issue 1(1) is “yes”), issues of time-bar and

</span>The events which led to the grounding and subsequent loss of the vessel
are summarised in paras 127 and 128 of the judge’s judgment as follows:</a></p><a name="para9">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“127.&nbsp; The danger facing OCEAN
VICTORY was one which was related to the prevailing characteristics of Kashima.
The danger flowed from two characteristics of the port, the vulnerability of
the Raw Materials Quay to long swell and the vulnerability of the Kashima Fairway
to northerly gales caused by a local depression. It may well be a rare event
for these two events to occur at the same time but nobody at the port could, I
consider, be surprised if they did. There is no meteorological reason why they
should not occur at the same time. Long waves were clearly a feature of the
port (as they must be of any port facing the Pacific) and low pressure systems
generating gale force winds cannot, in my judgment, be regarded as abnormal. I
do not consider that the juxtaposition of long waves and a low pressure system
generating gale force winds from the north amounts to an abnormal occurrence
unrelated to the characteristics of Kashima. Long waves may give rise to a need
for a vessel to leave the port. It may be a matter of chance whether at that
time there is also a low pressure system generating gale force winds from the
north but I am unable to accept that such winds are so rare that they cannot be
said to be a feature of the port. It is not without significance that the Guide
to Port Entry notes that during periods of northerly swell the entry channel is
fully exposed and that vessels at low speed generally have difficulty in
steering.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:32.55pt;margin-bottom:
26.0pt;margin-left:72.0pt">128.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It may be that the storm which affected the
port on 24 October 2006 was one of the most severe storms to have affected
Kashima in terms of severity, speed of deterioration and duration as suggested
by Mr Lynagh’s analysis of its characteristics. But the relevant
characteristics are those which give rise to the danger, namely the occurrence
of long waves and northerly gales. Neither long waves nor northerly gales can
be described as rare. Even if the concurrent occurrence of those events is a
rare event in the history of the port such an event flows from characteristics
or features of the port.”</p>

</span>In the Court of Appeal Longmore LJ (giving the judgment of the court)
noted in para 14 that it was common ground between the parties that, if the
damage sustained by the vessel at Kashima on 24 October 2006 was caused by an
“abnormal occurrence”, then the charterers would not have been in breach of the
safe port warranty. That common ground was based on the classic dictum of
Sellers LJ in <i>The Eastern City </i>[1958] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 127, 131 that:</a></p><a name="para10">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“A port will not be safe unless,
in the relevant period of time, the particular ship can reach it, use it and
return from it without, in the absence of some abnormal occurrence, being
exposed to danger which cannot be avoided by good navigation and seamanship ...”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Longmore LJ added in para 15 that what was in dispute between the
parties on the appeal in relation to this issue was (i) what, as a matter of
law, was the correct test for an abnormal occurrence; (ii) in particular, was
the judge correct to hold (in paras 110, 127-128, 132 and 134 of his judgment)
that the combination of two weather conditions on the casualty date (namely the
phenomenon of swell from “long waves”, which might have forced the vessel to
leave the berth, and a very severe northerly gale which meant that the vessel
could not safely exit the port) was not to be characterised as an abnormal
occurrence, notwithstanding that the coincidence of the two conditions was
“rare”, because both conditions were physical characteristics or attributes of
the port; and (iii) on the facts as found by, or undisputed before, the judge,
did the weather conditions on the casualty date amount to an abnormal
occurrence? It is important to note that it was not submitted that the relevant
test could or should be other than that described by Sellers LJ in <i>The
Eastern City.</i> In any event that test has stood the test of time. The
question is what is meant by “an abnormal occurrence”.</a></p><a name="para11">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para11"></a><a name="para12">12.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeal summarised the charterers’ case in para 44 of their
judgment as follows:</a></p><a name="para12">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no breach of
the safe port undertaking. By the safe port undertaking, the charterers did not
assume responsibility for loss from every foreseeable risk at the port to which
the ship was ordered. They assumed responsibility only for risks which were
sufficiently regular or sufficiently foreseeable to amount to an attribute or
feature of the port.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The prospective nature
of the undertaking was material to the test, because the right way to approach
this test was to imagine a charterer with full knowledge of the port giving the
order on the relevant day. He had to ask himself: ‘will the port be safe for
the ship to reach, use and depart from?’ If he could say ‘yes’, then, barring
some abnormal occurrence, there was no breach. So a charterer did not assume the
risk of loss from an unusual event which was not characteristic of the port at
the time when the ship should be there. The obligation to give indemnity for
loss from such unusual events lay properly and legally with the owner’s hull
insurers.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The phrase ‘abnormal
occurrence’ was not a term of art. An occurrence was just an event - something
that happened on a particular time at a particular place in a particular way.
‘Abnormal’ was something well removed from the normal. It was out of the
ordinary course and unexpected. It was something which the notional charterer
would not have in mind.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A rare event could not
be ‘an attribute’ of a port. It was, in the language of the cases, an ‘abnormal
occurrence’ and so outside the undertaking. The judge erred in law in holding
that a rare event was a feature of the port.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The judge erroneously
held that it did not matter if the event was rare or unexpected, provided it
arose from the combined occurrence of two or more characteristics or attributes
of the port.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(vi)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Words such as
‘characteristic’ or ‘attributes of the port’ were tools to help identify what
arose in the ordinary course. They were not intended to bring events well out
of the ordinary course into the scope of the charterers’ undertaking.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(vii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The judge went wrong by
breaking down the question into components instead of asking one unitary
question, namely: would it be an unexpected event for Capesize vessels calling
at Kashima to find it necessary to leave the berth due to danger from a long-wave
swell at the very time when it was dangerous to transit the Fairway? The
judge’s approach was to consider whether long waves and strong northerly winds
from low pressure storms affecting navigation in the Kashima Fairway were
respectively ‘attributes’ of the port. Having reached the conclusion that they
were ‘attributes’, he wrongly assumed that it did not matter how rare their
combination was.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(viii)&nbsp;&nbsp; On the facts, the
combination of the two weather events (namely long waves and strong northerly
winds from low pressure storms) had never apparently happened in the previous
35 years preceding the instruction to proceed to Kashima. Accordingly the
conditions on 24 October were an abnormal occurrence for which the charterers
were not liable.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para12"></a><a name="para13">13.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It was not in dispute that the question whether the port was unsafe must
be tested as at the moment that the charterers instructed the owners to proceed
to it. It was submitted on behalf of the charterers that the appropriate test
was whether a reasonable shipowner trading the ship for his own account and
knowing the relevant facts would decline to proceed to the nominated port. That
is essentially the test set out in the Court of Appeal’s summary of the charterers’
case in sub-para 44(ii) above.</a></p><a name="para13">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para13"></a><a name="para14">14.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To my mind the key points in this appeal are to be found in sub-paras 44(i),
(ii), (iii) and (iv). It is important to note that the test is not whether the
events which caused the loss were reasonably foreseeable. Reasonable
foreseeability is a well known test in some parts of the law of tort, notably
negligence and remoteness of damage. The courts could well have adopted such a
test but they have not done so. Instead they have asked whether the relevant
event was an abnormal occurrence.</a></p><a name="para14">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>What then is meant by “abnormal occurrence”? The question is whether it
has the meaning proposed by the charterers and set out in para 44(iii) quoted
above or the meaning proposed by Gard in para 66 of its case as follows:</a></p><a name="para15">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The phrase ‘abnormal occurrence’
in the Court of Appeal’s judgment took on its own momentum as a term of art or
something to be construed as if in a statute. It is not. The phrase is not
something that appears in the words of the charter. It is a qualification
derived from the authorities intended to assist the court, and the parties, to
work out whether the port was safe within the contractual clause. It is a
description for an occurrence which does not result from the set-up or
characteristics of the port; the set-up and characteristics of the port (tested
at the time the order is given) being the concern of the safe port undertaking.
In other words, ‘an abnormal occurrence’ is in contradistinction to an
occurrence which results from the set-up or characteristics of the port. The
result of the Court of Appeal’s approach is to widen the category of ‘abnormal
occurrences’,<span style="font-size:8.0pt"> </span>so as to include occurrences
which do result from the set-up of the port, and in turn to narrow the
circumstances in which a port will be regarded as ‘unsafe’ (despite the
obligation being a strict one).”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I would accept the charterers’ submission recorded in sub-para 44(iii)
that an ‘abnormal occurrence’ has its ordinary meaning. It is not a term of
art. As stated in that sub-paragraph,</a></p><a name="para16">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“[a]n occurrence was just an event

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>We were referred to a number of cases which seem to me to support that
conclusion. Sellers LJ’s famous dictum quoted above was taken from the judgment
of Morris LJ in <i>The Stork </i>[1955] 2 QB 68, 105, which was a time
charterparty case. See also <i>Reardon Smith Line Ltd v Australian Wheat Board
(The Houston City) </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKPC/1956/1956_1.html">[1956] AC 266</a>, which was a voyage charterparty case to
which essentially the same principles were applied. In <i>Kodros Shipping Corpn
v Empresa Cubana de Fletes (The Evia) (No 2) </i>[1983] 1 AC 736, which was
another time charterparty case, Lord Diplock said at p 749 that he regarded the
nature of the contractual promise by the charterer in what he called the safe
port clause as having been well settled for a quarter of a century at the very
least. He referred specifically to the expression “abnormal occurrence” used by
Sellers LJ in <i>The Eastern City </i>which he said reflected the previous
statement of Morris LJ in <i>The Stork</i>.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para18">18.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At p 749H, Lord Diplock referred to the distinction between damage
sustained by a particular vessel in a particular port on a particular occasion
caused by an “abnormal occurrence” and damage resulting from “some normal
characteristic of the particular port at the particular time of year”. He added
that there were dangers that judges of first instance sometimes omitted important
qualifications. He was referring (at p 750A-B) to what he called the heresy
that, in the previous decade or so, had been embraced by judges in the
commercial court culminating in that of Mustill J in <i>Transoceanic Petroleum
Carriers v Cook Industries Inc (The Mary Lou) </i>[1981] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 272,
277.</a></p><a name="para18">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para18"></a><a name="para19">19.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Diplock agreed with the judgment of Lord Roskill which had been
prepared with the assistance of Lord Brandon. The heresy to which Lord Diplock
referred was that identified by Lord Roskill at p 757. It arose in the
construction of what he described as these eight words in clause 2 of the
relevant time charterparty: “The vessel to be employed … between … safe ports
…” Those were essentially the same words as in the charterparties in the
instant case. The heresy identified by Lord Diplock was the conclusion of
Mustill J in <i>The Mary Lou </i>and, indeed, of Robert Goff J in <i>The Evia
(No 2)</i> that there was an absolute continuing contractual promise that at no
time during her chartered service would the ship find herself in any port which
was or had been unsafe for her: see Lord Roskill at p 756G.</a></p><a name="para19">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para19"></a><a name="para20">20.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On p 757 Lord Roskill gave his reasons for rejecting that approach as a
matter of construction of the charterparty. In particular, he said at p 757D
that a charterer will exercise his contractual right to require the shipowner
to carry out his contractual obligations by giving the shipowner orders to go
to a particular port or place of loading or discharge. He added that it was
clearly at the point of time when that order is given that the contractual
promise to the charterer regarding the safety of that intended port or place
must be fulfilled.</a></p><a name="para20">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para20"></a><a name="para21">21.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Roskill then said this at p 757E:</a></p><a name="para21">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The charterer’s contractual
promise must, I think, relate to the characteristics of the port or place in
question and in my view means that when the order is given that port or place
is prospectively safe for the ship to get to, stay at, so far as necessary, and
in due course, leave. But if those characteristics are such as to make that port
or place prospectively safe in this way, I cannot think that if, in spite of
them, some unexpected and abnormal event thereafter suddenly occurs which
creates conditions of unsafety where conditions of safety had previously
existed and as a result the ship is delayed, damaged or destroyed, that
contractual promise extends to making the charterer liable for any resulting
loss or damage, physical or financial. So to hold would make the charterer the
insurer of such unexpected and abnormal risks which in my view should properly
fall upon the ship’s insurers under the policies of insurance the effecting of
which is the owner’s responsibility under clause 3 unless, of course, the owner
chooses to be his own insurer in these respects.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para21"></a><a name="para22">22.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Having expressed those views as a matter of construction of the
charterparty, Lord Roskill analysed the cases and concluded that they strongly
supported the views he had expressed. The cases included <i>Ogden v Graham </i></a><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1861/1001.pdf">(1861)
1 B &amp; S 773</a> and <i>GW Grace and Co Ltd v General Steam Navigation Co Ltd
(The Sussex Oak) </i>[1950] 2 KB 383 in addition to <i>The Stork, The Houston
City</i> and <i>The Eastern City. </i>He noted in particular the dissenting
judgment of Sir Owen Dixon CJ in the High Court of Australia in <i>The Houston
City</i> which was accepted as correct by the Privy Council.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para23">23.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Roskill paid particular attention at p 760 to the reference to
“some abnormal occurrence” by Morris LJ in <i>The Stork</i>, which, as he put
it, was the foundation of the similar view of Sellers LJ in <i>The Eastern City</i>
as described above. Like Lord Diplock, Lord Roskill emphatically adopted that
approach as correct. As I read the remainder of his judgment, in which he
refers to a number of other cases, they are all to substantially the same
effect.</a></p><a name="para23">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para23"></a><a name="para24">24.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In all these circumstances, I would accept these three submissions made
on behalf of the charterers arising out of the cases referred to above and, in
particular <i>The Evia (No 2)</i> in the House of Lords. First, the date for
judging breach of the safe port promise is the date of nomination of the port.
A safe port promise is not a continuing warranty. Second, the promise is a
prediction about safety when the ship arrives in the future. These propositions
are not in dispute. As I see it, such a promise necessarily assumes normality;
given all of the characteristics, features, systems and states of affairs which
are normal at the port at the particular time when the vessel should arrive, the
question is whether the port is prospectively safe for this particular ship. If
the answer is “yes unless there is an abnormal occurrence”, the promise is
fulfilled. As Robert Goff J said at first instance in <i>The Evia (No 2)</i>
[1981] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 613, 621, “the formulation of a test whether the port is
unsafe must assume normality, and must therefore exclude danger caused by some
abnormal occurrence.”</a></p><a name="para24">

</span>I would further accept the third submission made on behalf of the
charterers that on the authorities to which I have referred, safe port disputes
should be reasonably straightforward. Was the danger alleged an abnormal
occurrence, that is something rare and unexpected, or was it something which
was normal for the particular port for the particular ship’s visit at the
particular time of the year?</a></p><a name="para25">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I would also accept the submission that this approach, that is the
approach in <i>The Eastern City </i>as elaborated by Lord Roskill and Lord
Diplock in <i>The Evia (No 2)</i>,<i> </i>provides a coherent allocation of
risk between the various interests as follows. The owners are responsible for
loss caused by a danger which is avoidable by ordinary good navigation and
seamanship by their master and crew. The charterers are responsible for loss
caused by a danger which was or should have been predictable as normal for the
particular ship at the particular time when the ship would be at the nominated
port and was not avoidable by ordinary good seamanship. The owners (and
ultimately their hull insurers) are responsible for loss caused by a danger due
to “an abnormal occurrence”. As Lord Roskill put it at p 757E quoted above,
charterers are not insurers of “unexpected and abnormal risks”. On the
contrary, the charterparty terms require owners to take out hull insurance (as
they will invariably do) which is their protection against rare and unexpected
events. On the charterers’ case on the facts, the characteristics of the port
were such that the ship was prospectively safe, but they unexpectedly combined
in a critical way such as to create an exceptional, and apparently
unprecedented danger. This was within the letter and spirit of Lord Roskill’s
description of an unexpected and abnormal risk.</a></p><a name="para26">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is to my mind important to note the emphasis in the cases upon the
meaning of the expression “abnormal occurrence”. I would accept the charterers’
submission in para 44(iii) of the Court of Appeal’s judgment that “abnormal” is
something well removed from the normal. It is out of the ordinary course and
unexpected. It is something which the notional charterer or owner would not
have in mind.</a></p><a name="para27">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para27"></a><a name="para28">28.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In short, I would accept the charterers’ submission that the first
question is whether a reasonable shipowner in the position of the particular
shipowner trading the ship for his own account and knowing the relevant facts
would proceed to the nominated port. If the answer is “yes unless there is an
abnormal occurrence”, the port is prospectively safe for the particular ship
and the promise is fulfilled. In a case where the vessel suffers loss or
damage, a second question arises, namely whether there was damage caused by an
abnormal occurrence as defined above.</a></p><a name="para28">

<p class="ParaHeading">Contrast between the approaches of the judge and of the

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This contrast can be seen in the judgment of the Court of Appeal. Having
summarised the essential facts at para 48, in para 49 the Court of Appeal
described the core of the judge’s reasoning at paras 127-129 of his judgment
thus:</a></p><a name="para29">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“On analysis his approach appears
to have been that, in deciding whether the casualty resulted from an abnormal
occurrence:-</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he did not need to
consider the evidence relating to how ‘rare’ the critical combination of the
two component dangers was, although, without analysing the evidence in any
detail, he was prepared to hold that ‘it may well be a rare event for these two
events to occur at the same time’;</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he did not need to
consider whether the critical combination was rare, because ‘[e]ven if the
concurrent occurrence of those events is a rare event in the history of the
port,’ what mattered was that:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:25.45pt;margin-bottom:
26.0pt;margin-left:144.0pt">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; separately the two component features of
the critical combination were characteristics or attributes of the port;</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:144.0pt">b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; looked at separately,
neither of the two component features could be said to occur ‘rarely’; long
waves and northerly gale winds were at least foreseeable in Kashima;</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:144.0pt">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there was no
meteorological reason why the two component features should not occur at the
same time; despite the fact that the storm which affected Kashima on 24 October
2006 may have been exceptional in terms of its rapid development, its duration
and its severity, there was a clear risk of gale force winds from the northerly
quadrant in the Kashima Fairway at the same time as long waves were affecting
the Raw Materials Quay;</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:25.45pt;margin-bottom:
26.0pt;margin-left:144.0pt">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; therefore, it was necessarily foreseeable
that at some stage the critical combination would occur and nobody could be
surprised if it did; and</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:25.45pt;margin-bottom:
26.0pt;margin-left:144.0pt">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the critical combination was accordingly
an event which ‘flow[ed] from the characteristics or features of the port’;</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:25.45pt;margin-bottom:
26.0pt;margin-left:108.0pt">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; accordingly, in those circumstances the
critical combination could not be said to be an ‘abnormal occurrence’; in the
language of Mustill J (as he then was) in <i>The</i> <i>Mary Lou </i>…, the
critical combination was not something which ‘could be said, if the whole history
of the port were regarded, to have been out of the ordinary’; again, adopting
Mustill J’s words, long waves and northerly gale winds were ‘events of the type
and magnitude in question [which were] sufficiently regular or at least
foreseeable to say that their occurrence is an attribute or characteristic of
the port’, so as not to amount to an abnormal occurrence; the critical
combination flowed from those characteristics and therefore could not be an
abnormal occurrence.”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In paras 50ff the Court of Appeal embarked upon a critique of the judge’s
approach. In para 50 they set out their conclusion that the judge’s approach
was flawed. They then referred in detail to the speeches of Lord Diplock and
Lord Roskill in <i>The Evia (No 2)</i>. In the speech of Lord Roskill they
highlighted in bold the passage at p 757E which I quoted at para 21 above. It
is to my mind important that that passage includes the proposition that where
the characteristics of a port make the port prospectively safe, Lord Roskill
did not think that</a></p><a name="para30">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“if … some unexpected and abnormal
event thereafter suddenly occurs which creates conditions of unsafety where
conditions of safety had previously existed and as a result the ship is
delayed, damaged or destroyed, that contractual promise extends to making the
charterer liable for any resulting loss or damage, physical or financial.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">He added that so to hold would make the charterer the
insurer of such “unexpected and abnormal risks” which should properly fall on
the ship’s insurers.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para30"></a><a name="para31">31.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Immediately after quoting an extensive passage from the speech of Lord
Roskill in <i>The Evia (No 2)</i>,<i> </i>most of which is quoted above, in
para 52 the Court of Appeal said that its import was clear. <span style="font-family:&quot;Times Roman&quot;,serif">They said that </span><span style="font-family:&quot;Times Roman&quot;,serif">charterers do not assume responsibility
for unexpected and abnormal events which occur suddenly and which create
conditions of unsafety after they have given the order to proceed to the
relevant port. They are the responsibility of the ship’s hull insurers (if
owners have insured) or of owners themselves. </span>The Court of Appeal
further noted in para 52 that the concept of safety is necessarily not an
absolute one. They did so by reference to the decision of the Court of Appeal
in <i>The Saga Cob </i>[1992] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 545, 551, where, in the context of
political risks, Parker LJ, giving the judgment of the court, said this:</a></p><a name="para31">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In the latter [the safe port
warranty case] one is considering whether the port should be regarded as unsafe
by owners, charterers, or masters of vessels. It is accepted that this does not
mean that it is unsafe unless shown to be absolutely safe. It will not, in
circumstances such as the present, be regarded as unsafe unless the ‘political’
risk is sufficient for a reasonable shipowner or master to decline to send or
sail his vessel there.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para31"></a><a name="para32">32.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the instant case the Court of Appeal, in my opinion correctly, held
(at para 53) that a similarly realistic approach should be adopted to the
determination of what it called the essentially factual question whether the
event giving rise to the particular casualty is to be characterised as an
“abnormal occurrence” or as resulting from some “normal” characteristic of the
particular port at the particular time of year. The Court of Appeal, emphasised
the word “normal” in the term “normal characteristic”, noting that it was used
by Lord Diplock when he observed in <i>The Evia (No 2)</i> at p 749 that:</a></p><a name="para32">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… it is not surprising that
disputes should arise as to whether damage sustained by a particular vessel in
a particular port on a particular occasion was caused by an ‘abnormal occurrence’
rather than resulting from some normal characteristic of the particular port at
the particular time of year.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Importantly in the instant case, the Court of Appeal
further observed (also at para 53) that, in what they described as an
illuminating passage, in<i> The Saga Cob </i>the Court of Appeal at pp 550-551 emphasised
that the fact that an event (in that case a guerrilla attack) was theoretically
foreseeable did not make it a “normal characteristic” of the port. They noted
that on the facts in <i>The Saga Cob</i> the event relied upon could not be
regarded as other than “an abnormal and unexpected event”. This approach
underlines the fact that foreseeability is not the test of the normality of an
event. The cases show that an abnormal occurrence or event is something that is
unexpected when the vessel arrives at and remains in the port: see eg <i>The
Evia (No 2) </i>per Lord Roskill quoted at paras 21 and 30 above.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para32"></a><a name="para33">33.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In para 54 the Court of Appeal placed reliance upon the approach of
Mustill J in <i>The Mary Lou </i>at p 278. They noted that in his description
of what constitutes an abnormal occurrence, Mustill J implicitly recognised the
need to approach the identification of an abnormal occurrence realistically and
having regard to whether the event had occurred sufficiently frequently so as
to become a characteristic of the port. At the end of the same paragraph,
having recognised the difficulty of finding an appropriate turn of phrase,
Mustill J said this:</a></p><a name="para33">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“It may be said that the loss is
not recoverable unless events of the type and magnitude are sufficiently
regular or at least foreseeable to say that the risk of their occurrence is an ‘attribute’
or ‘characteristic’ of the port. Or it may be said that ‘abnormal’ or ‘casual
events’ do not found a claim.”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeal identified a number of respects in which they
concluded that the judge went wrong. They summarised them in para 55 of their
judgment:</a></p><a name="para34">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“First of all he failed to
formulate the critical - and <i>unitary </i>- question which he had to answer:
namely, whether the simultaneous coincidence of the two critical features, viz
(a) such severe swell from long waves that it was dangerous for a vessel to
remain at her berth at the Raw Materials Quay (because of the risk of damage or
mooring break out) and (b) conditions in the Kashima Fairway being so severe
because of gale force winds from the northerly/north easterly quadrant), as to
make navigation of the Fairway dangerous or impossible for Capesize vessels,
was an abnormal occurrence or a normal characteristic of the port of Kashima?
Or put even more simply, was it an abnormal occurrence or a normal
characteristic of the port that a vessel might be in danger at her berth at the
Raw Materials Quay but unable at the same time safely to leave because of
navigation dangers in the Kashima Fairway arising from the combination of long
waves and gale force northerly winds which, in fact, occurred?”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para34"></a><a name="para35">35.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeal added <span style="font-family:&quot;Times Roman&quot;,serif">in
para 56 that, </span>instead of asking the unitary question directed at
establishing the correct characterisation of the critical combination (abnormal
occurrence or normal characteristic of the port), the judge merely addressed
the respective constituent elements of the combination (swell from long waves
making it dangerous for a vessel to remain at the Raw Materials Quay and gale
force winds from the northerly/north-easterly quadrant making navigation of the
Fairway dangerous or impossible for Capesize vessels) separately. He looked at
each component and decided that, viewed on its own, neither could be said to be
rare and both were attributes or characteristics of the port. The Court of
Appeal concluded that that was the wrong approach; what mattered was not the
nature of the individual component dangers that gave rise to the events on 24
October, but the nature of the event (namely the critical combination of the
two) which gave rise, on the judge’s findings, to the vessel effectively being
trapped in port.</a></p><a name="para35">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para35"></a><a name="para36">36.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeal further held in para 57 that the judge was also
wrong to hold that, even if the critical combination was rare, nonetheless it
was a characteristic of the port, for two reasons. The first (as stated in his
para 127) was because, although it might well be rare for these two events to
occur at the same time, nobody at the port could be surprised if they did, and
there was no meteorological reason why they should not occur at the same time.
The second (as stated in his para 128) was because, even if the concurrent
occurrence of those events was a rare event in the history of the port, such an
event flowed from the characteristics or features of the port.</a></p><a name="para36">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para36"></a><a name="para37">37.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeal concluded that both reasons were fallacious. In my
opinion they were correct so to hold. As to the first, the Court of Appeal
noted in para 58 that the conclusion that nobody at the port could be surprised
that both the above events occurred at the same time appears to have been based
on the idea that, provided an event is theoretically foreseeable as possibly
occurring at the relevant port, because of the port’s location, then that is
enough to qualify the event as a “characteristic of the port”.</a></p><a name="para37">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para37"></a><a name="para38">38.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeal correctly said at para 58 that the judge appears to
have derived that test from dicta in the judgment of Mustill J in <i>The Mary
Lou</i> at p 278, where (in the passage quoted at para 33 above) he referred to
long waves and northerly gale winds as being “at least foreseeable”. However
the Court of Appeal, in my opinion correctly, held that satisfaction of the
test of mere “foreseeability” was <i>per se </i>clearly not sufficient to turn
what the judge himself described as “a rare event in the history of the port”
into a normal characteristic or attribute of the port. They held that the error
made by the judge was to pick up on the words “at least foreseeable” in his
citation from Mustill J’s judgment, and to use minimum foreseeability, without
more, as some sort of litmus test for establishing whether an event was a
characteristic of a port, without having any regard to significant factors such
as the actual evidence relating to the past history of the port, the frequency
(if any) of the event, the degree of foreseeability of the critical combination
and the very severe nature of the storm on the casualty date. The Court of
Appeal further held that in doing so the judge departed from the orthodox and
practical approach of Mustill J in his judgment in <i>The Mary Lou </i>at p 278
and of Lords Diplock and Roskill in <i>The Evia (No 2), </i>to the question of
whether an event was abnormal. Such an approach necessarily includes an
examination of the past history of the port and of whether, in that evidential
context, the event was unexpected. I agree. The Court of Appeal also noted in
para 58 that he took the phrase “at least foreseeable” as used by Mustill J out
of context. I agree with the Court of Appeal that it is clear that, when the
passage is read in context, Mustill J was certainly not suggesting that mere,
theoretical, foreseeability on its own was sufficient. He was not setting up
some sort of alternate test which excluded considerations of questions such as
the frequency of past occurrences of the particular event, or the degree of
likelihood that the event was to occur in the future.</a></p><a name="para38">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para38"></a><a name="para39">39.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, the Court of Appeal noted at para 59 that, as the Court of
Appeal emphasised in <i>The Saga Cob</i> in the passage cited at para 32 above,
one has to look at the reality of the particular situation in the context of
all the evidence, to ascertain whether the particular event was sufficiently
likely to occur to have become an attribute of the port. Otherwise the consequences
of a mere foreseeability test lead to wholly unreal and impractical results.
The Court of Appeal focused on these examples in the instant case: does the
mere fact that it is “foreseeable” from the location of San Francisco that
earthquakes may occur in its vicinity, or from the location of Syracuse,
beneath Mount Etna, that there may be volcanic explosions in its vicinity,
predicate that any damage caused to vessels in those ports from such events,
were they to occur in the future, would flow from the “normal characteristics
or attributes” of those ports, and therefore necessarily involve a breach of
any safe port warranty? The answer given by the Court of Appeal was obviously
not; whether, in such circumstances, there would be a breach of the safe port
warranty, or the event would be a characterised as an abnormal occurrence,
would necessarily depend on an evidential evaluation of the particular event
giving rise to the damage and the relevant history of the port.</a></p><a name="para39">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para39"></a><a name="para40">40.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeal was particularly struck (at para 60) by the fact, as
they put it, that the judge provides no evidential basis for his apparent
factual conclusion that “nobody at the port could, I consider, be surprised” if
the crucial combination occurred, or for the conclusion reached earlier in para
110 of the judgment that “there must have been … a clear risk of gale force
winds from the northerly quadrant in the Kashima Fairway at the same time as
long waves were affecting the Raw Materials Quay”.</a></p><a name="para40">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para40"></a><a name="para41">41.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The final conclusion of the Court of Appeal’s on the first reason
advanced by the judge and referred to by the Court of Appeal in para 57 was set
out in para 61 of their judgment (which must be read in the context of para 60)
as follows:</a></p><a name="para41">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“61.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the light of the
evidence to the effect that no vessel in the port’s history had been
dangerously trapped at the Raw Materials Quay, with a risk of damage or mooring
break out, at the same time as the Kashima Channel was not navigable because of
gale force winds, it is difficult to see how he reached this conclusion. This
may be because he did not adequately focus evidentially on the particular
situation which he had to consider, namely one where a vessel was effectively
trapped, because the swell from long waves affecting vessels berthed at the Raw
Materials Quay was so severe that it was dangerous for a vessel to remain there
(as opposed to merely a situation where long waves caused swell and a vessel
decided to leave the Raw Materials Quay) and the Kashima Channel not being
navigable because of gale force winds. It may also be because he did not give
adequate weight to the evidence of Mr Lynagh (which he gives no cogent reason
for rejecting) that the storm which occurred on 24 October was exceptional in
terms of its rapid development, its duration and its severity (see para 48(ix)
above).”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para41"></a><a name="para42">42.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As to the second reason advanced by the judge, the Court of Appeal
responded in this way in para 62:</a></p><a name="para42">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“62.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second reason given
by the judge (‘Even if the concurrent occurrence of those events is a rare
event in the history of the port such an event flows from characteristics or
features of the port’) is, in our view, equally flawed. As we have already
stated in paras 55 and 56 above, what the judge had to decide was whether ‘the
concurrent occurrence of those events’ (ie the critical combination) was itself
a normal characteristic of the port or an abnormal occurrence. That was the
relevant event which the judge had to characterise. It simply did not follow,
logically or otherwise, from the fact that that event arose from (or, as the
judge said, ‘flow[ed] from’) the combination of two individual dangers, which
he had held were normal characteristics or attributes of the port, that the
‘concurrent occurrence of those events’ was also a normal characteristic or
attribute of the port.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para42"></a><a name="para43">43.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>By way of postscript, I note that on behalf of the owners significant
stress was placed upon the failure of the Kashima port authority to carry out a
risk assessment and put in place a proper safety system to deal with the risk
of the two types of weather conditions referred to by the judge occurring at
the same time. However, while it may be relevant in some cases, the question
remains whether the event (or in this case the combination of natural events)
which led to this casualty was an abnormal and unexpected occurrence or not.
For the reasons I have given I conclude that the Court of Appeal were entitled
to reach the decision which they did.</a></p><a name="para43">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para43"></a><a name="para44">44.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The ultimate conclusion of the Court of Appeal was set out in paras 63
and 64 as follows:</a></p><a name="para44">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“63.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In deciding whether the
critical combination was itself a normal characteristic of the port or an
abnormal occurrence, what the judge should have done was to evaluate the
evidence relating to the past frequency of such an event occurring and the
likelihood of it occurring again. He should have also, in our view, have taken
into account what appears to have been the unchallenged evidence of Mr Lynagh
referred to above relating to the exceptional nature of the storm that affected
Kashima on 24 October 2006 in terms of its rapid development, its duration and
its severity. Had he done so, then, on the basis of his own finding that ‘the
concurrent occurrence of those events was rare’, and on the basis of the
evidence which we have summarised above, there would, in our view, have been
only one conclusion which he could have reached - namely that the event which
occurred on 24 October 2006 was indeed an abnormal occurrence.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">64.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the above reasons we
conclude that the conditions which affected Kashima on 24 October 2006 were an
abnormal occurrence, that there was no breach by the charterers of the safe

</span>In my opinion, the Court of Appeal reached the correct conclusions for
the reasons they gave. I initially questioned whether the Court of Appeal
should have interfered with the decision of the judge at first instance.
However, in the light of the submissions made on both sides, I have concluded
that this was one of those rare cases in which the correct conclusion is that
the casualty was caused by an abnormal occurrence as that expression is
explained in the cases. I accept the reasoning of the Court of Appeal and
prefer their approach to that of the judge.</a></p><a name="para46">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I would accordingly dismiss the appeal on the safe port issue. I would
answer the questions raised on that issue by the parties and set out in para
8.1(1) and (2) as follows. The port was not unsafe within the meaning of the
safe port undertaking so that the charterers were not in breach of it. The
conditions at the port amounted to an abnormal occurrence as that expression is
understood in the cases.</a></p><a name="para47">

</span>Issue 2 summarised in para 8 above assumes (contrary to my view) that
there was a breach of the safe port undertaking and asks whether the provisions
for insurance in clause 12 of the Barecon 89 form preclude rights of
subrogation of hull insurers and the right of owners to recover in respect of
losses covered by hull insurers against the demise charterers for breach of the
express safe port undertaking. The judge held that the owners and hull insurers
were entitled to recover notwithstanding clause 12, whereas the Court of Appeal
held that they were not. Lord Sumption agrees with the judge whereas Lord
Toulson agrees with the Court of Appeal. I agree with the judge and Lord
Sumption, essentially for the reasons they give. Lord Sumption has set out
clauses 12 and 13, which I will not repeat.</a></p><a name="para48">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para48"></a><a name="para49">49.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I have been particularly struck by these considerations. I agree with
the judge (at para 185) that the demise charterparty must be given the meaning
which, having regard to the background known to both parties, it would
reasonably be understood to bear and that, in circumstances where, in clause
29, the demise charterparty contains a clear safe port warranty, one would
expect any exemption of the demise charterers from liability in damages for
breach of the safe port warranty to be clearly expressed.</a></p><a name="para49">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para49"></a><a name="para50">50.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In para 190 the judge observed that the charterers relied upon the <i>The
Evia (No 2)</i>, in which the question arose whether (as Lord Roskill put it at
p 766) the war risks clause cast upon the owners and their insurers all war
risks and thus freed the charterers from liability for them pursuant to the
safe port clause. It was held that the charterers were freed from any liability
that they might otherwise have. Lord Roskill identified the relevant question
as being whether the war risks clause was a complete code exhaustive of the
owners’ rights, which depended upon the construction of the time charterparty
as a whole.</a></p><a name="para50">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para50"></a><a name="para51">51.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As the judge noted at para 191, the charterers adopted that reasoning
here and said that it was applicable to the demise charterparty and, indeed,
that it was a stronger case because, not only did the demise charterers pay for
the cost of hull insurance, but they were also named as joint assureds and,
generally speaking, an insurer cannot exercise rights of subrogation to pursue
a claim in the name of one co-assured against another.</a></p><a name="para51">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para51"></a><a name="para52">52.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The judge rejected that submission in these terms:</a></p><a name="para52">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“192.&nbsp; Cases decided after <i>The</i>
<i>Evia </i>(<i>No 2</i>) have emphasised that the decision in that case
depended upon there being a clause which, on its true construction, provided an
exhaustive code of the rights and liabilities of the parties; see <i>The</i> <i>Concordia
Fjord </i>[1984] 1 Lloyd’s Reports 385 and <i>The</i> <i>Chemical Venture </i>[1993]
1 Lloyd’s Reports 508.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">193.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <i>The</i> <i>Concordia
Fjord </i>the arbitrator, Mr MacCrindle QC, said that he was ‘not aware of any
principle exempting the Charterers from liability for their breaches of
contract merely on the ground that they have directly or indirectly provided
the funds whereby the Owners insured themselves against such damages.’ Bingham
J agreed; see pp 387-388. Thus the mere fact that the charterer pays for the
hull insurance is not enough to exempt him from liability for breach of his
obligations under the charterparty. There has to be an intention to create an
exhaustive code which determines the parties’ rights and liabilities by
reference to a claim on the insurance policy.</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">194.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If clause 12 of the demise
charterparty were such a code it would apply, not just to a particular issue
such as war risks as was the case in <i>The</i> <i>Evia </i><i>(No 2)</i>, but
to all hull, war and P&amp;I risks. The charterparty contains a clear and
express safe port warranty. If clause 12 were to be construed as an exhaustive
code that clause would be rendered nugatory with regard to insured risks. It
would in effect exempt the demise charterer from liability for breach of the
safe port warranty in exchange for paying for the hull insurance. For that to
be the intention of the parties there would have to be clear words. Counsel for
Gard emphasised the rule of construction that clear words are necessary before
the court will hold that a contract has taken away rights or remedies which one
of the parties would otherwise have had; see <i>Gilbert-Ash (Northern) Ltd v
Modern Engineering (Bristol) Ltd </i>[1974] AC 689. This rule of construction
is usually expressed with regard to rights which a party would have at common
law but it must also apply to valuable rights given by other parts of a
contract. Counsel submitted that there are no such words in clause 12 of the
demise charterparty. The sentences of clause 12(a) and 12(c) on which
particular reliance is placed by Daiichi do not expressly remove the right to
damages for breach of the safe port warranty. They merely give the demise
charterer certain rights with regard to proceeds of the insurance policy for
which they have paid.”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I entirely agree with the judge. It follows from the fact that clause 12
contains no such express exclusion that any such exemption can only arise by
necessary implication. In short, there is nothing in clause 12 which provides
that the demise charterers have no liability for breach of clause 29 and I see
no basis for such a necessary implication, essentially for the reasons given by
the judge and by Lord Sumption. In particular, it seems to me to be striking
that, as the judge observed in para 195, clause 13, which contained an
alternative insurance and repairs clause which not only provided that hull
insurance would be paid for by the registered owner but also expressly stated
that the registered owners and/or insurers would not have any rights of
recovery or subrogation against the demise charterers in respect of insured
losses, was deleted from the printed form. Thus the demise charterers chose not
to be bound by clause 13.</a></p><a name="para53">

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;text-autospace:none">54.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>After a detailed analysis (between paras 196 and the first part of para
198), the judge said that he did not consider that clause 12 codified the
rights and liabilities of the parties with regard to insured risks. He noted
that it provides for the provision of insurance and who is to pay for it, for
the demise charterers to be responsible for insured repairs and to reimburse
themselves from the proceeds of the insurance policy, for the demise charterers
to be responsible for other repairs and for the claims on a total loss to be
paid to the mortgagee for distribution to the registered owners and demise
charterers in accordance with their respective interests. I agree with the
judge that this does not in the required sense codify the rights and
liabilities of the parties with regard to breach of the safe port warranty
where the casualty caused by the breach has given rise to a claim on the
insurance.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para53"></a><a name="para55">55.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is true that, as the judge put it in para 199, what clause 12 has,
which neither the clause in <i>The</i> <i>Evia </i><i>(No 2)</i> nor the clause
in <i>The</i> <i>Concordia Fjord </i>(as expressly noted by Mr MacCrindle QC)
had, is a provision that the owners and demise charterers were to be
co-assureds, thereby, on the face of it, bringing into play the principle that,
generally, an insurer cannot exercise rights of subrogation to pursue a claim
in the name of one co-assured against another.</a></p><a name="para55">

</span>After referring (in para 200) to the decision and reasoning of Rix LJ in
<i>Tyco Fire and Integrated Solutions (UK) Ltd v Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2008/286.html">[2008] 2 All ER (Comm) 584</a>, the judge concluded in para 201 as follows:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In the present case there was an
express safe port warranty by the demise charterers, there was no code of
rights and obligations in clause 12 with regard to insured losses caused by a
breach of the safe port warranty and there was no express ouster of the right
of subrogation in clause 12. Those features of the demise charterparty suggest
to me that, construing the charter as a whole, it was intended that the demise
charterer would be liable to the owner for breach of the safe port warranty,
notwithstanding that they were joint assured and could take the benefit of the
insurance in the manner set out in clause 12.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-36.0pt">I agree.</p>

</span>For these reasons and those given by Lord Sumption, I would have
answered the question or issue 2 summarised in para 8 above, namely whether the
provisions for insurance in clause 12 of the Barecon 89 form preclude rights of
subrogation of hull insurers and the right of owners to recover in respect of
losses covered by hull insurers against the demise charterers for breach of the
express safe port undertaking, in the negative. I am not persuaded by the
judgments of Lord Mance and Lord Toulson (with whom Lord Hodge agrees) to reach
a different conclusion.</a></p><a name="para57">

is entitled to limit its liability for Gard’s losses or any (and, if so, which)
of them as against Sinochart (and Sinochart in turn against Gard) pursuant to
section 185 and Schedule 7 article 2(1) of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995,

</span>Like the joint insurance issue, this issue does not arise in the light
of our decision on the safe port issue. However it raises a point of some
potential importance and was fully argued before us. Neither of the courts
below considered it because it was accepted that they were both bound by the
decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>The CMA Djakarta </i>[2004] 1 Lloyd’s Rep
460. In that case Longmore LJ gave the only substantive judgment, with which Waller
and Neuberger LJJ agreed.</a></p><a name="para59">

</span>As formulated on behalf of Daiichi, who were time charterers, the question
at issue is whether Daiichi (hereinafter “the charterers”) can limit their
liability for the loss of the vessel and consequential losses arising out of
the loss of the vessel. The answer to that question depends largely upon
whether <i>The</i> <i>CMA Djakarta </i>was correctly decided in the Court of
Appeal. The limitation issue is a short but important one. It concerns the
correct interpretation of the 1976 Convention.</a></p><a name="para60">

of Thomas J in <i>The Aegean Sea </i>[1998] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 39. By contrast, the

and will not repeat it here, save to note some key points. He referred to the
first relevant limitation statute, which was the Responsibility of Shipowners
Act 1733 and then to the Merchant Shipping Act 1854, the Merchant Shipping Acts

</span>As David Steel J put it, section 503 of the 1894 Act furnished a limit
to an owner’s liability in respect of certain categories of occurrence in these
terms:</a></p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“503.(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The owners of a

<p class="ParaNoNumber">David Steel J added that section 71 of the Merchant
Shipping Act 1906 provided that the expression “owner” would be “deemed to
include any charterer to whom the ship is demised”. He further noted that, even
prior to that Act, “owner” was construed as being inclusive of a demise

were the two Conventions for the Unification of Certain Rules relating to the
Limitation of Liability of Seagoing Vessels in 1924 and 1957 (“the 1924

</span>At first instance in <i>The CMA Djakarta </i>David Steel J noted at para
25 that the Convention introduced radical changes as regards to both the size
of the fund and the circumstances in which the entitlement to limit might be
lost. As he put it, in short, the Convention made available a significantly
enhanced fund at what he said was perceived to be the maximum insurable level,
but the entitlement to which could only be challenged in quite exceptional
circumstances: see <i>The Leerort </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2001/1055.html">[2001] 2 Lloyd's Rep 291</a>. He said in para
26 that it was notable that the Convention left largely untouched the range of
persons entitled to limit, although it expressed the category in somewhat
different terms.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para70">70.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>David Steel J identified the rival contentions of the parties succinctly
in paras 28 and 29. It was the charterers’ case, first that, as charterers, </a><a name="para28">they fell squarely within the category of persons enabled to limit
their liability as prescribed by article 1, and secondly that the entire claim
for damages arising out of the casualty fell equally squarely within the category
of qualifying claims under article 2. By contrast, it was the owners’ case </a><a name="para29"></a>that it was clear from the overall context, having regard to
the object and purpose of the Convention, that the entitlement to limit was
restricted to those persons identified in article 1(2) whose liability for the
qualifying claim arose <i>qua </i>owner and not otherwise. On the facts,
limitation was not available since it was common ground that no part of the
claim arose from the role of the appellant charterers <i>qua</i> owners. David
Steel J essentially accepted the submissions made on behalf of the charterers
and, in doing so, followed the decision and reasoning of Thomas J in <i>The
Aegean Sea.</i></p>

</span>Longmore LJ set out his general approach to the Convention in paras
9-11. He first identified what he concluded were errors made by David Steel and
Thomas JJ. In particular, he did not agree with them that, in order to succeed
in limiting their liability, it was necessary for charterers’ claims to arise
from their role <i>qua</i> owners. I agree that Longmore LJ’s conclusions in
that regard were correct for the reasons he gave and do not need to revisit

that, given that the Convention is in its own words incorporated into English

English law preconceptions. As he put it, the interpretation of international
conventions must not be controlled by domestic principles but by reference to
broad and general principles of construction. He cited a number of well-known

</span>He added in para 10 that, while it may be difficult to know what are
broad and acceptable principles, some principles are enshrined in articles 31
and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (1969), which was
ratified by the United Kingdom in 1971 and came into force in 1980. Those articles
provide:</a></p><a name="para73">

</span>Longmore LJ summarised his conclusions derived from articles 31 and 32
in this way. The duty of a court is to ascertain the ordinary meaning of the
words used, not just in their context but also in the light of the evident
object and purpose of the Convention. The court may then, in order to confirm
that ordinary meaning, have recourse to the <i>travaux préparatoires</i> and
the circumstances of the conclusion of the Convention. The 1957 Convention was
signed by the United Kingdom.</a></p><a name="para74">

</span>Like Longmore LJ in para 10, I would regard the existence and terms of a
previous international convention (even if not made between all the same
parties) as one of the circumstances which are part of a conclusion of a new
convention but recourse to such earlier convention can only be made once the
ordinary meaning has been ascertained. Such recourse may confirm that ordinary
meaning. It may also sometimes determine that meaning but only when the
ordinary meaning makes the convention ambiguous or obscure or when such
ordinary meaning leads to a manifestly absurd or unreasonable result.</a></p><a name="para75">

<p class="ParaHeading">Context, object and purpose</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para75"></a><a name="para76">76.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In para 11 Longmore LJ set out the object and purpose of the 1976 Convention
as agreed between the parties as follows (omitting the reference to the<i> Tojo
Maru</i>). First, the general purpose of owners, charterers, managers and
operators being able to limit their liability was to encourage the provision of
international trade by way of sea-carriage. Second, the main object and purpose
of the Convention was to provide for limits which were higher than those
previously available in return for making it more difficult to “break” the
limit. Under the 1894 Act an owner was entitled to limit his liability if he
showed that the casualty occurred without his “actual fault or privity”. Under the
1976 Convention (and the 1995 Act) the (now higher) limit is to apply unless it
can be shown that the loss resulted from the personal act or omission of the
party relying on the limit “committed with intent to cause such loss or
recklessly with the knowledge that such loss would probably result”. It is thus
particularly difficult to break the limit, but the amount available for
compensation is higher than it was previously. Longmore LJ added that it was
not possible to ascertain with certainty any object or purpose beyond that
common ground. He therefore turned to the ordinary meaning of the Convention,
beginning at the beginning.</a></p><a name="para76">

<p class="ParaHeading">Ordinary meaning</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para76"></a><a name="para77">77.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Leaving the position of salvors on one side, at para 13 Longmore LJ
noted in the context of article 1 that the word “shipowner” was defined as “the
owner, charterer, manager or operator of a seagoing ship”. He then rejected the
opinion of David Steel J and Thomas J that a charterer could only limit his
liability if he was acting in the management or operation of the vessel. In
particular he expressed the view that the mere fact that “charterer” is part of
the definition of the word “shipowner” cannot of itself mean that a charterer,
which was “an expression otherwise unqualified”, has to be acting as if he were
a shipowner (ie <i>qua </i>shipowner) before he can limit his liability. He
added:</a></p><a name="para77">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“To my mind the ordinary meaning
of the word ‘charterer’ connotes a charterer acting in his capacity as such,
not a charterer acting in some other capacity.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para77"></a><a name="para78">78.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Longmore LJ then said in para 13 that there were two difficulties in the
argument to the contrary. I do not think that it is necessary for me to discuss
them in any detail, since they were not relied upon on behalf of the charterers
here. In para 18, to my mind correctly, Longmore LJ said that he would not give
any gloss to the word “charterer” in article 1(2) and that he would give it
what seemed to him to be its ordinary meaning. I agree with that approach.</a></p><a name="para78">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para78"></a><a name="para79">79.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Longmore LJ noted at para 21 that the issue was not resolved by a
consideration of article 1 of the Convention because it was still necessary to
ascertain whether a claim for damage to the ship by reference to which a
charterer seeks to limit his liability is a claim which falls within article 2.
In paras 22-24 he considered loss or damage to the ship under article 2(1)(a),
which he correctly held extends the right to limit, inter alia, to claims in
respect of “loss of or damage to property occurring on board”, which is not
apposite to include loss of or damage to the ship itself since neither the loss
of a ship nor damage to a ship can be said to be loss or damage to property on
board. Property on board means something on the ship and not the ship itself.</a></p><a name="para79">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para79"></a><a name="para80">80.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The question then arises whether this is a claim in respect of loss of
or damage to property “occurring … in direct connexion with the operation of
the ship.” Longmore LJ held in para 23 that the most obvious reason for
including this category of claim is to cater for cases of collision with
another ship. Loss or damage to that other ship (or its cargo) is not “loss of
or damage to property … occurring on board” but is “loss of or damage to
property … occurring … in direct connexion with the operation of the ship”.</a></p><a name="para80">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para80"></a><a name="para81">81.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The critical part of his reasoning is to my mind in the next part of
para 23, where he said that that wording was not apt to cater for a case where
the very ship, by reference to the tonnage of which limitation is to be
calculated, is lost or damaged because the loss envisaged is loss to something
other than that ship herself. He added at para 24 that it was </a><a name="para24">not
without interest that in order to describe this category of claim the framers
had used the phrase “occurring … in direct connexion with the operation of the
ship”. That was, he said, virtually the same phrase as that used by David Steel
J to define what he meant by “<i>qua</i> owner”. If one were to postulate the
case of the vessel being in berth when the dangerous cargo exploded and damaged
parts of the harbour, the harbour authority could sue for that damage but one
would expect that the shipowners would be able to limit any liability for that
claim. In order to do so, however, they would have to assert that the loss or
damage occurred in direct connexion with the operation of the ship. The fact
that dangerous cargo had with their permission been loaded on the ship would,
one thinks, be enough for that purpose. But if it would be sufficient for that
purpose, it would be odd that a charterer pursuant to article 1 could not say
of his own act in permitting such cargo to be loaded that it was an act “in
direct connexion with the operation of the ship”.</a></p>

<p class="ParaHeading">Articles 9 to 11 of the Convention</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para82">82.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Longmore LJ treated these provisions as of some importance in reaching
his conclusion. In my opinion he was correct to do so. In para 25 he noted that
Thomas J set them out in detail in <i>The Aegean </i>Sea and summarised them
broadly in this way. Article 9(1) provides for the claims against (a) the
persons mentioned in article 1(2) (viz owner, charterer, manager or operator)
to be aggregated if they arose on distinct occasions; likewise for claims
against (b) the owner of a ship rendering salvage services and a salvor operating
from that ship and (c) a salvor not operating from a ship. Article 9(2) then
deals with passenger claims. Article 10 provides that liability can be limited
without the creation of a fund. Article 11 then provides for the constitution
of a limitation fund when that is, in fact, done; it provides for separate
funds for the “shipowner” category of those entitled to limit and the “salvor”
categories (and for passenger claims) by providing:</a></p><a name="para82">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“‘A fund constituted by one of the
persons mentioned in paragraph 1(a), (b) or (c) or paragraph 2 of article 9 or
his insurer shall be deemed constituted by all persons mentioned in paragraph
1(a), (b) or (c) or paragraph 2 respectively.’ Thus through the references to article
9(1)(a) all those persons designated as shipowners in article 1(2) of the
Convention are brought together as a single unit for the constitution of the
fund. Thomas J said this (p 49):</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">‘In my view the combined effect
of these articles is important. As there is provision for a fund for those
categorized as shipowners and that fund is to cover both charterers and owners,
it is difficult to see how charterers can claim the benefit of limitation
through that fund where a claim is brought against them by owners. Owners are
entitled to the benefit of limitation for a claim by charterers as that claim
is being brought by charterers not when performing a role in the operations of
the ship or when undertaking the responsibility of a shipowner, but in a
different capacity, usually through their interest in the cargo being carried.’</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">While I entirely agree with this
passage from <i>The Aegean Sea</i>, the considerations advanced by the judge to
my mind more effectively support a conclusion that the claims in respect of
which an owner or a charterer can limit do not include claims for loss or
damage to the ship relied on to calculate the limit rather than a conclusion
that a charterer can only limit in respect of operations he does <i>qua</i>
owner.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para82"></a><a name="para83">83.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Further, at para 26 Longmore LJ approved Thomas J’s view that, if</a><a name="para26"> he was wrong in his general conclusion that the charterers could
only limit when the loss (a total loss in that case) was caused by an act
normally performed by the shipowner, the claim for the loss of the vessel did
not fall within article 2(1)(a) because the loss of the ship was not “loss of
property … occurring … in direct connection with the operation of the ship”. This
in turn was because, as Thomas J put it at (p 51):</a></p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“it is the operation of the very
ship that must cause the loss of property; the ship cannot be the object of the
wrong.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para84">84.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Longmore LJ added that, similarly in <i>The CMA Djakarta, </i>which was
a case of extensive repair rather than total loss, David Steel J upheld the
shipowners’ argument that the vessel cannot be both the victim and the perpetrator
and that the “property” envisaged in the article must be the property of a
third party either on board the vessel (eg cargo) or external to the vessel,
for example an SBM. David Steel J said (at para 52):</a></p><a name="para84">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The property damaged cannot be
the very same thing as the operation of which caused the damage.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">I agree with both Thomas J and David Steel J in this
respect and conclude that the ordinary meaning of article 2(1)(a) does not
extend the right to limit to a claim for damage to the vessel by reference to
the tonnage of which limitation is to be calculated.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">Confirmation of the ordinary meaning of article 2(1)(a)</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para84"></a><a name="para85">85.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In para 27 Longmore LJ gave a further reason for his earlier conclusion
based on the ordinary meaning of article 2(1)(a), with which I also agree. I
agree that the effect of giving the words their ordinary meaning is not absurd
or unreasonable, nor is there ambiguity or obscurity. As Longmore LJ pointed
out, David Steel J considered the wording of the 1957 Convention and held that
his conclusion derived support from article 1 of that Convention, which drew an
express distinction between “the ship” and “other property”. Longmore LJ held
that it was, if anything, even clearer than the 1976 Convention on this point. He
held that that served to confirm the proposition since any intention to change
the previous agreement so that damage to the ship itself would be subject to
limitation would have been made much more explicitly. I agree, although I do
not regard this point as of any great significance.</a></p><a name="para85">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para85"></a><a name="para86">86.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I should add that, in my opinion, in agreement with David Steel J and
the Court of Appeal in <i>The CMA Djakarta</i>,<i> </i>there is nothing in the <i>travaux
préparatoires </i>which supports any other conclusion. Some reliance was placed
upon article 4(1)(iv) of the Liens and Mortgages Convention (1967), which
provides:</a></p><a name="para86">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The following claims shall be
secured by maritime liens on the vessel ... (iv) claims against the owner,
based on tort and not capable of being based on contract, in respect of loss of
or damage to property occurring, whether on land or on water, in direct
connection with the operation of the vessel ...”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">No-one suggested that “loss or damage to property” could
include loss of or damage to the very vessel on which the maritime lien was
secured. I would accept the submission made on behalf of Gard that, when
similar wording was exported to the 1976 Convention, the expression “loss of or
damage to property … in direct connection with the operation of the ship” was
not intended to include loss of or damage to the very vessel on the basis of
whose tonnage limitation was calculated.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">Conclusion on limitation</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For the reasons I have given, which are essentially the same as those of
the Court of Appeal in <i>The CMA Djakarta</i>, I would hold that, if there
were a breach of the safe port warranty, the charterers would not be entitled
to limit their liability under the Convention in accordance with the limitation

</span>On the safe port issue (question 1), I would hold that the port was not
unsafe within the meaning of the safe port undertaking so that the charterers
were not in breach of it. The conditions in the port amounted to an abnormal
occurrence as that expression is understood in the cases.</a></p><a name="para88">

</span>On the joint insurance issue, if (contrary to para 88 above) there were
a breach of the safe port undertaking, I would have answered question or issue
2 summarised in para 8 above, namely whether the provisions for insurance in
clause 12 of the Barecon 89 form preclude rights of subrogation of hull
insurers and the right of owners to recover in respect of losses covered by
hull insurers against the demise charterers for breach of the express safe port
undertaking, in the negative. However I recognise that this is a minority view.</a></p><a name="para89">

</span>I agree that there was no breach of the safe port warranty in this case,
for the reasons given by Lord Clarke, which substantially correspond to those
of the Court of Appeal.</a></p><a name="para92">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On that footing, it was strictly speaking unnecessary for the Court of
Appeal to decide whether, if there had been a breach, there would have been any
liability in damages. For the same reason, it is unnecessary for us to deal
with it. Nonetheless, I propose to do so, because the question is of some
general importance and I am not persuaded that the Court of Appeal answered it
correctly. They held that the demise charterers suffered no loss by the
destruction of the ship because, although there was a corresponding safe port
warranty in the demise charter of which they were (on this hypothesis) in
breach, they would have had no liability to pay damages representing the value
of the ship. This is said to be the result of clause 12 of the demise charter,
which provided for the demise charterers to procure insurance for the vessel at
their own expense against marine, war and protection and indemnity risks, for
the joint interests of themselves and the head owners. From this, and from the
provisions of clause 12 relating to the distribution of the insurance proceeds
upon a total loss, it is said to follow that the head owners were obliged to
look exclusively to the insurance proceeds and not to the demise charterer to
recover the value of their ship. Therefore the demise charterers had no
liability to pass on to the time charterers as damages for breach of the safe
port warranty, and the insurers, as their assignees, had no greater right. The
same would, on this analysis, have been true if the insurers had brought a
subrogated claim against the time charterers in the name of the demise
charterers. It is accepted that this argument applies only to that part of the
loss which represents the value of the ship. It does not apply to the claim for
SCOPIC expenses (essentially salvage), wreck removal costs or loss of hire,
which together accounted for rather more than a third of the claim.</a></p><a name="para93">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is necessary to draw attention at the outset to the limited basis on
which this issue comes before the court. There are three possible bases on
which a demise charterer might be in a position to claim damages from a
subcharterer for the loss of a ship of which he is the bailee but not the
owner:</a></p><a name="para94">

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on the basis that he
is himself liable to the head owner under the demise charter;</p>

</a><p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt"><a name="para94">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on the basis that as
a bailee he has a possessory title which entitles him to recover in his own
name, accounting to the head owner for any recovery exceeding his actual loss: <i>Waters
v Monarch Fire and Life Assurance Co</i> </a><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1856/131.pdf">(1856) 5 El &amp; Bl 870</a>; <i>The
Winkfield</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpPro/1901/52.html">[1902] P 42</a>; and</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under what has
sometimes been called the principle of transferred loss, which may permit a
contracting party to recover substantial damages for breach of contract where
the loss is foreseeably suffered by a third party and the latter has no direct
claim against the wrongdoer: <i>Linden Gardens Trust Ltd v Lenesta Sludge
Disposals Ltd</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1993/4.html">[1994] 1 AC 85</a>, <i>Alfred McAlpine Construction Ltd v
Panatown Ltd</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2000/43.html">[2001] 1 AC 518</a>. The recovery in such a case is held on trust
for the third party.</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">For reasons which it is unnecessary to explore, the
insurers have confined their case to basis (1). The claim was argued on that
basis in the courts below, and before us their counsel (Mark Howard QC)
confirmed that the appeal would be argued on that basis alone.</p>

</span>The demise charter was on the Barecon 89 form. The form was originally
drafted in 1974 by the Documentary Committee of the Baltic and International
Maritime Council, and revised in 1989. It is said to have become, in one or
other of its variants, the most commonly used form of bareboat charter
world-wide. Under clause 9 of the form, the demise charterers have the usual
obligation to maintain the vessel in good repair and efficient operating
condition and to take immediate steps to have any necessary repairs carried
out. The form as printed contains no trading limits other than clause 5, which
simply requires the vessel to be employed in conformity with the terms of its
insurances, including any insurance warranties, unless the agreement of the
insurers is obtained. The insurances are governed by either clause 12 or clause
13, one of which must be selected. Clause 12, which was selected in this case,
provides (so far as relevant):</a></p><a name="para95">

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The alternative insurance clause, clause 13, was intended
for short-term demise charters and envisaged that the demise charterer would
become entitled under existing insurance arrangements made by the head owner.
It accordingly provided for the vessel to be kept insured against marine and
war risks by the owner at their expense under a policy in joint names, and
against P &amp; I risks by the charterers at their expense. For present
purposes, however, the most significant difference between the two clauses
consists in the addition in clause 13(a) of an express provision dealing with
the relationship between the liability of insurers and that of demise
charterers. It provided:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The Owners and/or insurers shall
not have any right of recovery or subrogation against the Charterers on account

</span>In the present case, the Barecon 89 form was amended by deleting the
trading limits clause (clause 5) and adding at clause 29 a safe port warranty
in the following terms:</a></p><a name="para96">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The provisions which are said to exclude a right to recover the value of
the ship as damages for breach of clause 29 are clauses 12(a) and (c). Clause
12(a) requires insurance to be in place for the parties’ joint account. Clause
12(c) provides that “all insurance payments for such loss shall be paid to the
Mortgagee, if any, in the manner described in the Deed(s) of Covenant, who
shall distribute the moneys between themselves, the owners and the charterers
according to their respective interests.” The argument is that the clause as a
whole is a complete code governing financial liability for loss or damage to
the ship, and that the words quoted provide for the relief, and the only relief,
available as between the head owner and the demise charterer for a total loss.
To address this argument, I propose to deal first with the law relating to
rights as between co-insured. I shall then consider how, if at all, it applies
to this demise charter.</a></p><a name="para97">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para97"></a><a name="para98">98.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The starting point is the general rule that insurance recoveries are
ignored in the assessment of damages arising from a breach of duty: <i>Bradburn
v Great Western Railway Co</i> (1874) LR 10 Ex 1; <i>Parry v Cleaver</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1969/2.html">[1970] AC 1</a>. This can conveniently be called the collateral payments exception. It is
a departure from the general principle that collateral benefits are brought
into account, and is probably best regarded as being based on public policy.
Insurance recoveries are a benefit which the injured party has bought in
consideration of his premiums, which are intended to inure to his benefit
alone, not that of third party wrongdoers. Moreover, the courts have
traditionally been concerned to preserve the subrogation rights of insurers
against those who are legally responsible for the loss, which are an important
part of the economics of insurance. The effect of the collateral payments
exception is that as between the insured and the wrongdoer who has caused the loss,
they are not treated as making good the former’s loss or as discharging the
latter’s liability. The assumption underlying it is that as far as the
wrongdoer is concerned, insurance is <i>res inter alios acta</i>, ie, loosely
translated, none of his business. The rule thus stated falls to be modified in
a case where insurance manifestly is the wrongdoer’s business because, for
example, he is a co-insured and/or the insurance is taken out for his benefit.
The business context in which this has most commonly arisen is the co-insurance
of employer, contractor and subcontractors under standard forms of building
contract.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para99">99.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is well established, and common ground between the present parties,
that where it is agreed that the insurance shall inure to the benefit of both
parties to the contract, they cannot claim against each other in respect of an
insured loss. Co-insurance is the paradigm case. The principle first appears in
the United States, but was successively adopted in early editions of <i>MacGillivray
on Insurance Law</i>, by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Commonwealth
Construction Co Ltd v Imperial Oil Ltd</i> [1978] 1 SCR 317 and by the English
courts in a line of cases beginning with the decision of Lloyd J in <i>Petrofina
(UK) Ltd v Magnaload Ltd</i> [1984] QB 127. What is less clear is its juridical
basis. Lloyd J was inclined to think that it was based on the rule against
circuity of action, which is difficult to accept given that the insurer will
not be a party to any litigation between the co-insureds. The better view,
which was endorsed by the House of Lords in <i>Co-operative Retail Services Ltd
v Taylor Young Partnership Ltd</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2002/17.html">[2002] 1 WLR 1419</a>, paras 61-65 (Lord Hope),
is that it is an implied term of the contract of insurance and/or of the
underlying contract between the co-insureds pursuant to which their interests
were insured. The implication is necessary because if the co-insureds are both
insured against the relevant loss, the possibility of claims between them is
financially irrelevant. It would be absurd for the insurer to bring a
subrogated claim against a co-insured whom he would be liable to indemnify
against having to meet it. It should be noted that this reasoning is relevant
only to the position as between the co-insureds. In all of the English cases
before this one the question arose between the co-insureds and their insurer.
None of them raised the question how the principle about co-insurance affects
claims against a third party wrongdoer who is not himself a co-insured and is
not party to the arrangements between them. There is no necessity to exclude a
claim against him and indeed no reason why either of the co-insureds or their
insurer should wish to do so. It is impossible to identify any contract whose
business efficacy depends upon that result being achieved.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para100">100.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As between a co-insured (or his insurer) and a third party wrongdoer, a
different question arises which none of the existing English authorities
purports to answer. The question is this: when we say that one co-insured
cannot claim damages against another for an insured loss, is that because the
liability to pay damages is excluded by the terms of the contract, or is it
because as between the co-insureds the insurer’s payment makes good any loss
and thereby satisfies any liability to pay damages? The significance of this
question may be illustrated by a hypothetical case. Suppose that A and B are
engaged in some contractual venture, involving the use of A’s property. The
property is insured in their joint names. It is damaged in breach of some
contractual duty owed to A by B, but the cause of the damage is some act of B’s
agent, X. If the effect of the co-insurance is that B’s liability to pay
damages to A is excluded, then B never had a relevant liability and has
suffered no loss which he can claim over against X. But if its effect is that
payment by the insurer makes good A’s loss as between A and B and thereby
satisfies any liability of B, the result is different. The effect is to exclude
the collateral payments exception, so as between A and B the receipt of the
insurance proceeds must be taken into account. However, the fact that the
insurer’s payment has made good the loss as between A and B does not mean that
it has done so as between B and the stranger, X. As between B and X the
insurance is <i>res inter alios acta</i>. Indeed, its normal consequence is
that the claim will survive to be pursued by the subrogated insurers. Either
analysis will achieve the object of the implication, namely to prevent claims
between co-insureds. But they have radically different consequences for claims
against third parties. Which is the correct analysis must depend on the
particular terms of the particular contract. The answer will not necessarily be
the same in every case.</a></p><a name="para100">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I therefore return to the contractual arrangements between the head
owners and demise charterers of the “OCEAN VICTORY”. We have not seen the
actual policy. What matters, however, is not the actual policy but the policy
envisaged in clause 12 of the demise charter. The relevant insurance is the
insurance against marine risks which is required by clause 12(a). That is an
insurance on property. As far as the demise charterer is concerned, although it
is not a liability insurance, he is treated as having an insured interest in
the property as such, because his potential liability to the head owner as a
bailee and time charterer means that he <span class="legds2"><span lang="EN">“stands
in [a] legal or equitable relation to the adventure or to any insurable
property at risk therein, in consequence of which he may benefit by the safety
or due arrival of insurable property, or may be prejudiced by its loss, or by
damage thereto, or by the detention thereof, or <i>may incur liability in
respect thereof</i>”: see Marine Insurance Act 1906, section 5(2) (emphasis
supplied); cf Arnould, <i>Law of Marine Insurance and Average</i>, 18th ed
(2013), para 11.37-11.38. </span></span>If the ship is lost or damaged, the
measure of any liability of the demise charterer will be the same as the
measure of the owner’s loss, namely the diminution, partial or total, in the
value of the ship. There is no other basis on which he could be entitled to
insure on the same basis as the owner.</a></p><a name="para101">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para101"></a><a name="para102">102.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>When the “OCEAN VICTORY” was lost, the insurers were bound under clause
12(c) to pay its insured value to the head owner or, rather, to the mortgagee
for the account of the head owner. But the natural legal inference from (i) the
fact that the demise charterer is insured for his interest in the ship, (ii)
the implied prohibition of claims for damages between the co-insured for loss
of or damage to the ship, and (iii) the avoidance of double recovery, is that
the insurer’s payment to the head owner makes good the head owner’s loss not
just as between the insurer and the head owner but as between both of them and
the demise charterer. The demise charterer’s liability under the demise charter
for the loss of the ship has not been excluded. It has been satisfied. It
follows that the demise charterer may claim over against a time charterer who
is not party to the insurance or any of the contractual arrangements connected
with it.</a></p><a name="para102">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para102"></a><a name="para103">103.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This may be tested by asking what would happen if the insurer did not
pay, for some reason which did not involve a breach of duty by either co-insured,
for example because the insurer became insolvent after the casualty. The demise
charterer’s obligation to insure ceases upon the termination of the demise
charter: see clause 12(a). And the demise charter terminates upon the total
loss of the ship: see clause 12(d). The result is that there is no effective
insurance, no default of the demise charterer in there being no effective
insurance, and no basis on which the head owner can be supposed to look
exclusively to its proceeds to make good a loss arising from a breach of the
safe port warranty. The demise charterer would be bound to pay damages, not because
he was responsible for the lack of insurance but because he was liable for the
destruction of the ship in breach of his contract. This can only be because it
is the payment of the insurance proceeds which discharges the liability of the
demise charterer by making good the head owner’s loss. In the absence of
payment, there is no discharge and no bar to a claim between the co-insureds.</a></p><a name="para103">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para103"></a><a name="para104">104.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This does mean that if the insurer, being solvent, delays in paying the
claim, the head owner can require the demise charterer to pay the loss at once.
But I do not regard that as undermining what I consider to be the way that
clause 12 works. Quite apart from the consideration that the contract must be
construed on the assumption that the insurer will perform his obligations, an
obligation to pay damages upon a breach of contract is a routine consequence of
the chartered service. It is no more unthinkable in the case of the demise
charter than it is in the case of the time charter, where no question of co-insurance
arises.</a></p><a name="para104">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This analysis derives strong support from a number of other features of
this particular demise charter:</a></p><a name="para105">

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Barecon 89
form as printed, the demise charterer’s sole obligation in relation to the
physical condition of the ship was the maintenance and repairing obligation in
clause 9. Breach of that obligation would not give rise to an insured loss. The
only trading warranty was in clause 5. This did not give rise to an insured
loss either, because it did no more than prohibit the trading of the vessel to
places where she would not be insured. Under the unamended Barecon 89 form,
therefore, it is difficult to envisage circumstances in which an insured loss
could arise from a breach of contract by the demise charterers. The present
issue simply could not arise. The parties are therefore unlikely to have
intended to address it. The present issue arises only because the printed form
has been modified by adding in clause 29 a contractual obligation not to trade
the vessel to unsafe ports where she may suffer an insured loss. In adding
clause 29 to the printed form, the parties must have intended that in relation
to loss or damage arising from the unsafeness of ports, the liability of the
charterers and the insurers would coexist. If, as the Court of Appeal thought,
the liability of the charterers did not extend to damages, the parties must be
taken to have included an elaborate trading warranty which is almost entirely
redundant. Its only effect, on this view of the matter, was to entitle the head
owners to protest if they happened to learn in advance of the demise
charterer’s intention to visit an unsafe port. If the demise charterers persisted
(as they were in a position to do since they were in operational control of the
ship and employed the master and crew), and the ship was damaged or lost, there
would be no consequences in damages. This is not a realistic intention to
impute to commercial parties in the absence of express words to that effect.</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only words of
clause 12 which are said to have this effect are the words of clause 12(c)
which deal with the distribution of the insurance proceeds upon a total loss.
They seem to me to be irrelevant to the present issue. They deal with the
mechanics of payment of the insurance proceeds and not the substantive rights
of the parties. The proceeds are to be paid in the first instance to the
mortgagee bank, and thereafter to the head owner and demise charterer according
to their respective interests. This provision does not exclude a right to
damages for breach of contract. Its purpose appears to be (i) to protect the
position of the mortgagee, and (ii) to distinguish the position where there is
a partial loss (see the fourth paragraph of clause 12(a)) when the insurance
proceeds will go to the demise charterer by way of indemnity against the cost
of repairs.</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is right to add
that in relation to war risks clause 29 expressly provides that “all risks /
consequences” of breach are to be for charterers’ account, notwithstanding the
obligation under clause 12 to maintain war risks insurance.</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If clause 12(c)
contains the decisive language, as the time charterers have suggested, then it
becomes necessary to distinguish between insurance payments under the hull
policy in respect of the loss of the ship and insurance payments under the P &amp;
I insurance representing other elements of the claim such as SCOPIC and
wreck-raising expenses. The latter will be recoverable as damages in the
ordinary way, as well as under the express indemnities at clauses 17 and 18 of
the demise charter. Logically, it also requires a distinction to be made
between the insured value of the ship (in this case, $70m) and its market value
(in this case $88.5m), the difference being recoverable as damages, as the time
charterers accepted before Teare J. It is very difficult to see why, if the
principle underlying clause 12 was that the parties were to look exclusively to
the insurance proceeds for compensation for a breach of clause 29, they should
have intended this arbitrary distinction between different elements of the
loss.</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:36.0pt">(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, there are
the terms of clause 13(a), which expressly exclude any right to recover damages
in respect of insured loss of or damage to the ship. If that option is chosen,
the result for which the time charterers contend is achieved by the express
words of the contract. I recognise that clause 13 is designed for a very
different kind of chartered service. It is nonetheless a striking fact that
when the draftsman of this contract wished to deal with the overlap between the
liability of the insurers and that of the demise charterers, he did so in
express terms, using language which finds no equivalent in clause 12.</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:35.45pt">(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lord Clarke has
made some further observations at paras 49 to 57 of his judgment, with which I

</span>Clauses 12 and 13 are standard clauses of the “‘Barecon 89’ <i>Standard
Bareboat Charter”</i> issued by the Baltic and International Maritime Council
(“BIMCO”). It is relevant to consider how the scheme introduced by clause 12
(or, where used, clause 13) operates in circumstances where there is no clause
29. A demise charter involves a bailment on whatever terms may be agreed.
Clauses 9 and 12 impose on charterers strict responsibility for having all
necessary repairs done. But a demise dharterer may well cause total loss of the
demised vessel in circumstances constituting a breach of duty or of an express
or implied contract term. Printed clause 5, which was replaced in the present
charter by clauses 29 and 30, could itself involve such a breach. Its first and
third paragraphs include, for example, various obligations relating to lawful
trading and the carriage of suitable lawful merchandise.</a></p><a name="para109">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Clause 12 (or, where used, 13) contains a scheme designed to address the
possibility of the vessel requiring repairs or suffering a total loss. First,
and fundamentally, these clauses provide who is to take out marine, war risks
and protection and indemnity (“P&amp;I”) insurance. Clause 12 deals with
circumstances where the charterers are to do both, clause 13 with circumstances
in which owners are to maintain marine and war risks insurance while demise charterers
have to maintain P&amp;I insurance. Secondly, they provide for the nature of
the insurance which is to be maintained. Under clause 12 all the insurances are
to be “in such form as the owners shall in writing approve, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld”, whereas clause 13 provides for marine and war
risks insurance “under the form of policy … attached hereto”, while the P&amp;I
insurance to be arranged by charterers has again to be “in such form as the owners
shall in writing approve, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld”.
Under both clauses 12 and 13, the value of the vessel for marine and war risks
insurance purposes is to be that stated in box 27 (here USD 70m), while boxes
28 and 29 are to specify whether either or both parties may take out additional
insurance and if so for how much (each being, under the present charter, prohibited
from so doing).</a></p><a name="para110">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Thirdly, under clause 12 all the insurances are to be arranged to protect
“both the Owners and the Charterers and mortgagees (if any)”and to be “in the
joint names of the Owners and the Charterers as their interests may appear”.
Under clause 13, the marine and war risks insurances are likewise to be “in the
joint names of the Owners and the Charterers as their interests may appear”,
but there is also an express provision that:</a></p><a name="para111">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The Owners and/or insurers shall
not have any right of … subrogation against the Charterers on account of loss
of or any damage to the Vessel or her machinery or appurtenances covered by
such insurance, or on account of payments made to discharge claims against or
liabilities of the Vessel or the Owners covered by such insurance.”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Fourthly, both clauses 12 and 13 make the demise charterers responsible
for effecting any repairs, securing reimbursement from underwriters to the
extent of the insurance coverage, but remaining responsible for all repairs not
covered by the insurance and/or falling within any possible insurance franchise
or deductibles.</a></p><a name="para112">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Fifthly, both clauses 12 and 13 address the possibility of the vessel
becoming an actual, constructive, compromised or agreed total loss. Clause
12(c) provides that in this event the marine or war risks insurance payments
for such loss “shall be paid to the Mortgagee (if any), … who shall distribute
the moneys between themselves, the owners and the charterers according to their
respective interests”. Clause 13(h) provides that they “shall be paid to the Owners,
who shall distribute the moneys between themselves and the Charterers according
to their respective interests”.</a></p><a name="para113">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para113"></a><a name="para114">114.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The scheme of clause 12 (and 13) is clearly intended to be
comprehensive. Whatever the causes, both repairs and total losses fall to be
dealt with in accordance with its terms, rather than by litigation to establish
who might otherwise be responsible for undertaking them, for bearing the risk
of their occurrence or for making them good. This is reinforced by the
provisions for marine and war risks insurances to be taken out to protect the
interests of owners, charterers and any mortgagees, and to be in the joint
names of owners and charterers, as their interests may appear. It is well
established, as Lord Sumption and Lord Toulson both acknowledge, that, where it
is agreed that insurance shall inure to the benefit of both parties to a
venture, the parties cannot claim against each other in respect of an insured
loss. This principle is now best viewed as resting on the natural
interpretation of or implication from the contractual arrangements giving rise
to such co-insurance: <i>Co-operative Retail Services Ltd v Taylor Young
Partnership Ltd (“CRS”) </i>[2001] Lloyd’s Ins Law Rep 122 (CA), </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2002/17.html">[2002] 1 WLR 1419</a>, per Lord Bingham, para 7 (favouring the rationale suggested by Brooke LJ
in the Court of Appeal at para 72) and Lord Hope, paras 61 to 65. It is merely
reinforced where, as here, the principal co-insureds, owners and charterers,
are in the same group and ultimate beneficial ownership. Hull insurance covers
losses whether or not it is due to the fault of any party, and it is, rightly,
not suggested that the principle in <i>CRS </i>is subject to any exception
where the loss is due to fault: see also on this point <i>Mark Rowlands Ltd v
Berni Inns Ltd</i> [1986] QB 211, 232G-233B, per Kerr LJ.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para115">115.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Repairs were to be undertaken by charterers, regardless whether their
cost was fully covered by insurance. But the scheme of both clauses 12 and 13
was for marine and war risks insurances in agreed form to be taken out in a
fixed amount, and for no more unless otherwise specifically agreed. At the date
of her total loss the <i>OCEAN VICTORY </i>is said to have been worth some USD
15m more than the amount for which she was valued for insurance under the
demise charter. It is in my opinion implausible to suggest that, having
developed this careful scheme for specific protection of their respective
interests, it should have been intended that owners should as against charterers,
a company in the same group and beneficial ownership, be able to reopen the
scheme by claims of breach, exposing charterers to paying damages for the hull
loss based on a different alleged value to that which owners and charterers had
agreed between themselves. Just as parties must, for better or worse, accept a
valuation agreed under a marine insurance (Marine Insurance Act 1906, sections
27(1) and (2)), so here the parties to this charter must be taken to have
accepted the value they agreed for insurance purposes as conclusive as between
themselves.</a></p><a name="para115">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In this respect, the schemes of clauses 12 and 13 are in my opinion effectively
mirror images of each other. Clause 13 has an express exclusion of any right of
recovery or subrogation on the part of owners and/or insurers against charterers.
That is explicable in the context of a clause dealing with insurance taken out
by owners. BIMCO in their observations on the Barecon 89<i> </i>form explain
the optional clause 13 on the basis that “It has been felt that it may be
useful to cover also the possibility which is believed may arise from time to
time, that a vessel is bareboat chartered for a short period, say, four to six
months”. BIMCO give the example of passenger vessels. They continue: “It is
believed that it is normal practice that the Owners carry on with the
insurances for their own account”. BIMCO also confirm that:</a></p><a name="para116">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The main difference between
Clause 12 and Clause 13 is that in Clause 13 the responsibility for arranging
and keeping the marine and war risks insurances has been shifted back to the
Owners.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para116"></a><a name="para117">117.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There is no suggestion by BIMCO that the responsibilities for repairs
and total loss differ in any other respect as between clauses 12 and 13. There
is no reason to think that clauses 12 and 13 were devised as anything other
than two routes to the same substantive allocation of responsibilities for
repairs and total loss, irrespective of fault. I conclude that the express
exclusion of a right of recovery or subrogation in clause 13 was simply belt
and braces in the context of insurances taken out by owners, and that the
reason why no such express term appears in clause 12 was that it never occurred
that there could be such claims in the context of insurances arranged by charterers
to cover their own as well as owners’ interests. It is inconceivable that the
parties intended fundamentally to alter the incidence of risk by permitting or
excluding breach-based claims as between themselves in respect of a hull loss,
depending upon whether it happened to be convenient to continue to use hull
insurances taken out by owners or to rely on fresh insurances taken out by charterers.
The judge’s speculation (para 202) that the risk of insurers’ insolvency might
have motivated such a distinction is unconvincing, where not only is such risk
most unlikely to have been in the forefront of the parties’ minds, but the
decision which party should be responsible for hull insurances has no
connection with any such risk or with the question whether or not breach-based
liability should exist.</a></p><a name="para117">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para117"></a><a name="para118">118.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I do not consider that the substitution of printed clause 5 by typed
clause 29 can have been intended to, or did, alter this basic scheme. In many
respects clause 29 simply makes different provision for the same subject matter
as clause 5. Clause 29 overlaps with clause 5, in so far as it requires
employment in lawful trades. It specifies (not entirely felicitously, in so far
as it refers to Zimbabwe) certain trading limits. Clause 5 contemplates that
trading limits would be found in Box 19, but adds that the charterers must
furthermore employ the vessel in conformity with the terms of her insurances.
Both clause 29 and clause 5 address additional insurance premiums, which a
vessel’s trading might in some circumstances require to be paid. Clause 29 has
the provision for employment “only between good and safe berths, ports or areas
where vessel can safely lie always afloat” on which Gard relies. Owners could
no doubt object if they learned of intended or actual trading contrary to
clause 29, and a breach by charterers in this respect might have consequences
outside the scope of hull insurance and so outside the scheme of clauses 12 and
13. But it is, in my opinion, most unlikely that the “safe port” provision in
clause 29 can have been meant to give rise to a system of recourse for loss of
the hull, by way of damages for breach of contract, separate from and
potentially counteracting the no fault scheme of responsibility and insurance
recovery for a hull loss introduced by clause 12.</a></p><a name="para118">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para118"></a><a name="para119">119.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Teare J held that the owners, although indemnified by the insurers, had
a subrogated right to claim against the demise charterers damages for breach of
clause 29: judgment, paras 203-204. That makes no sense in the context of a
co-insurance such as this, as Mr Recorder Jackson QC pointed out in <i>Hopewell
Project Management Ltd v Ewbank Preece Ltd </i>[1998] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 448, 458,
in a passage approved by Lord Hope in <i>CRS </i>at para 65. It would mean
treating the present co-insurance as if it involved two separate and severable
insurances, leaving charterers exposed, without liability cover, to claims for
breach of charter or duty brought by owners in respect of loss of the hull.
That is obviously not what anyone contemplated by clause 12 or clause 13. It is
no answer that demise charterers might in turn have a back to back claim for
damages against sub-charterers. They might equally well not have, eg if they
were trading the vessel on their own account, so there was no sub-charter, or
the sub-charter was on different terms or the sub-charterer was not worth
powder and shot. I add, though no-one suggested this as a correct analysis,
that it is inconceivable that anyone contemplated that the co-insurance to be
arranged could give rise to successive payments of the same sum to different
parties, with the second of such payments going to reimburse insurers for the
first.</a></p><a name="para119">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In these circumstances, Gard suggests an alternative basis for its
claim, that liability exists in the first instance for any total loss
attributable to a breach of the safe port warranty, but is then discharged to
the extent of any recovery under the marine or war risks insurance taken out
under clause 12. This analysis has the twin results, that (i) owners could after
a total loss call upon charterers to pay the value of the vessel’s hull, even
though an insurance claim was on foot, but had not yet been paid, and (ii)
owners could look to charterers in damages for any amount by which the vessel’s
actual value at the date of loss exceeded her insured value, both before and
after insurers had paid the insured value. Both results are in my view
inconsistent with the scheme of clause 12 (or 13), or with any sensible
understanding of its evident purpose to cater comprehensively for
responsibility for repairs and total loss.</a></p><a name="para120">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para120"></a><a name="para121">121.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Still more fundamentally, in the context of the present claim by Gard as
assignees of demise charterers, there is no basis for treating payment of the
vessel’s value under her marine or war risks insurance as “discharging” pro
tanto any liability existing between owners and demise charterers. Both the
ordinary marine and the war risks insurances are property insurances on the
vessel’s hull. Payments made under them go to owners (or their mortgagees) and
charterers for their respective interests in the hull. They cannot be treated
as satisfying, at one and the same time, any liability (if there were any)
which charterers had to owners. The contrary analysis involves the proposition
that the parties were prepared to treat the hull insurance moneys as going in
the first instance to charterers, not to the owners or their mortgagees, and
then being passed up to owners. That is clearly not what happened or would ever
happen in fact, and it is only in a counter-factual world and by contradicting
the clear intent of clause 12 that it could be treated as if it had happened.</a></p><a name="para121">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para121"></a><a name="para122">122.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In my opinion, the reason why owners have no claim against charterers
for damages for loss of the hull is not that such a claim exists under clause
29 but is at some point discharged. It is that, under a co-insurance scheme
like the present, it is understood implicitly that there will be no such claim.
This understanding applies, in my opinion, whether or not the insurance moneys
have yet been paid. But, even if (contrary to my opinion) one were to treat
this understanding as biting only upon payment of the insurance moneys, it
still would not arise from or involve the proposition that some liability of
the charterers to owners was “discharged” in the sense of paid or satisfied by
the insurance moneys. The understanding would simply be that, upon payment of
the hull insurance proceeds to those interested in the hull for their
respective interests, no further liability would exist inter se. On that basis,
charterers would still be unable to show that they had or had discharged any
liability to owners, on the basis of which they could pursue a back-to-back
claim against sub-charterers. But, as I have made clear, in my opinion the
implied understanding arising from the co-insurance scheme is that there would
be no liability for the hull value in the event of a total loss, whether or not
the insured value had yet been disbursed.</a></p><a name="para122">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lord Sumption raises the question what would happen if an insurer became
insolvent after a loss. This is in my view a remote eventuality which cannot be
a guide to the meaning of clause 12 (or 13). It also raises different considerations
of risk and implications to any which require determination on this appeal. Two
views might be taken. One is that, under a scheme where both parties have
agreed to the particular form of policy, presumably by particular insurers, the
risk lies where it falls. It is to be noted that the risk could impact either
party in different circumstances. It could impact charterers, who undertake an
absolute responsibility for repairs, irrespective of fault, and would be unable
to recoup themselves from the hull insurance as contemplated by clause 12 or
13. It could impact owners and charterers for their respective interests, in
the event of a total loss occurring without fault. There is no reason to think
that the parties intended any different result in the event of a loss which
might be attributed to a breach of clause 29 or any other clause. But another
view might be that the risk lies by implication on the party responsible for
maintaining the insurance during the charter period, even though clauses 12 and
13 provide that the charter terminates as of the date of any total loss. The
former seems the more likely position, but it is unnecessary on this appeal to
decide which applies, since the point cannot assist to determine the present,
quite different issue as to the implications of the insurance scheme when it is
effective, which is no doubt what the parties, and BIMCO, had in mind when
using and devising it.</a></p><a name="para123">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para123"></a><a name="para124">124.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Finally, it is submitted that charterers must have some liability
towards owners under clause 29, because otherwise there can be no back-to-back
claim down the line under the equivalent clause in the sub-charter between demise
charterers and Sinochart, who in turn cannot pass on liability under the
equivalent clause in the sub-sub-charter between Sinochart and Daiichi, who
were and should be ultimately responsible. The difficulty with this submission
is that it has not been tested and I, for my part, regard it as entirely open.
Gard’s case before the Supreme Court has been put exclusively on the basis that
charterers had a liability to owners, which in turn enables charterers to claim
damages down the line. Mr Howard QC, who did not appear for Gard below, very
frankly acknowledged that it had occurred to him, when he came into the case,
that there could have been other bases on which the claim could have been
presented, but that it had been concluded that Gard was confined to the way in
which the case had been argued on its behalf below.</a></p><a name="para124">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Those other bases are (i) that the charterers’ possessory title gave
them a sufficient interest to be able to maintain a claim for the hull loss:
compare the principle in <i>The Winkfield </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpPro/1901/52.html">[1902] P 42</a>, whereby a bailee can
claim in tort in his own name, without showing that he has any liability to the
head owner, but accounting to the head owner for any loss exceeding his own
loss, and/or (ii) that there are circumstances in contract where a contracting
party can claim substantial damages for loss of or damage to property, when
another person has actually borne such loss or damage: <i>Dunlop v Lambert </i>(1839)
6 Cl &amp; F 600, <i>The Albazero</i> [1977] AC 774, 846G-847F. More recently,
this latter possibility has been more widely recognised, by giving special
treatment to contracts relating to property where loss due to a breach of the
contract will be suffered by a holder of the property other than the
contracting party: see <i>Linden Gardens Trust Ltd v Lenesta Sludge Disposals
Ltd and St Martins Property Corp Ltd v Sir Robert McAlpine Ltd (“St Martins”)</i>
<a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1993/4.html">[1994] 1 AC 85</a> where it was in the contemplation of the parties when the
contract was made that the property, the subject of the contract and the
breach, would be transferred to or occupied by a third party, who would in
consequence suffer the loss arising from its breach: see also <i>Darlington Borough
Council v Wiltshier Northern Ltd</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1994/6.html">[1995] 1 WLR 68</a> and the narrow ground of
decision expressed by Lord Browne-Wilkinson at p 114G-H in <i>St Martins</i>,
in which all members of the House joined. In such a situation, the claimant is
seen as suing on behalf of and for the benefit of the injured third party and
is bound to account accordingly: see <i>St Martins</i>, per Lord
Browne-Wilkinson at p 115A-B and <i>McAlpine Construction Ltd v Panatown Ltd
(“Panatown”)</i> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2000/43.html">[2001] 1 AC 518</a>, per Lord Clyde, at pp 530E-F and 532D-E. (An
even broader principle was also suggested by Lord Griffiths in <i>St Martins</i>,
at p 96F-97D and reviewed inconclusively by Lord Browne-Wilkinson at pp 111F-112F
as well as by the members of the House in <i>Panatown</i>, to the effect that a
contracting party might itself have an interest in performance enabling it to
claim damages without proving actual loss.)</p>

</span>In the absence of argument, it is not appropriate to reach any
conclusion as to whether or how far either of these principles might have
assisted Gard, had it been open to Gard to rely on them now. Suffice it to say
that, since their application has not been tested, I am not prepared to proceed
on the basis that charterers must be recognised as having had liability to owners,
in order to be able to claim down the line against Sinochart and so for
Sinochart against Daiichi. If the absence of such a liability is fatal to a
claim by charterers down the line, it must be because neither alternative basis
of claim identified in para 125 is available, and, if neither proved to be
available, that would, presumably, be because the law did not regard this
situation as one where considerations of justice comparable to those reflected
in the reasoning in those cases militated in favour of recognising a right on
the part of the charterers to claim down the line.</a></p><a name="para126">

</span>It is a curious feature of this appeal that permission to appeal on the
joint insurance issue was sought on the basis that the Baltic and International
Maritime Council (BIMCO) form of bareboat charter codenamed Barecon 89 is a
standard form of contract in common use and the effect of clause 12 is
therefore a matter of general importance, but the argument turned on the
relationship between that clause and clause 29, which is not part of the
standard form.</a></p><a name="para129">

</span>It is nevertheless sensible to begin by considering the effect of clause
12 in the unamended version of Barecon 89. It is important to understand its
basic structure. The standard terms, set out in Part II of the policy, contain
nothing about safe ports. Clause 5, headed “Trading Limits”, stipulates that
the vessel is to be employed in lawful trades for the carriage of suitable
lawful merchandise within trading limits which may be specified in the schedule
which forms Part I of the policy, and that the vessel is not to be employed
otherwise than in accordance with the terms of the insurance which is required
to be maintained.</a></p><a name="para130">

provides:</a></p><a name="para132">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The significant feature of bareboat chartering, or chartering by demise,
is that during the period of the charter (in the words of BIMCO’s explanatory
notes to Barecon 89) “the vessel comes in the full possession, at the absolute
disposal, and under the complete control of the bareboat charterers.” The notes
add that bareboat chartering is therefore entirely different from ordinary time
chartering when it comes to the allocation of costs, liabilities and
responsibilities.</a></p><a name="para133">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Clause 12 in the unamended form deals comprehensively with the risks of
loss or damage to the vessel and what is to happen in such an event. In
summary, the demise charterer is responsible for arranging and maintaining
insurance, in a form approved by the owner, in the names of both parties for an
agreed value; the charterer is responsible for effecting all insured repairs;
the charterer is responsible for repairs not covered by the insurance, for
example, due to deductibles under the terms of the insurance (or, for that
matter, due to use of the vessel outside the terms of the insurance); and in
the case of a total loss covered by the insurance, the clause provides for the processing
of the insurance moneys.</a></p><a name="para134">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para134"></a><a name="para135">135.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>BIMCO’s explanation for the optional alternative of clause 13 was that
sometimes a vessel is bareboat chartered for only a short period and it may
make sense for the owners to carry on with the insurances which they are likely
to have in place. Clause 13 therefore provides that the vessel is to be kept
insured by the owners against marine and war risks, and that the owners and
their insurers are to have no right of recovery or subrogation against the
charterers on account of loss or damage covered by such insurance. It would be
unnecessary to include equivalent words in clause 12. It cannot have been the
parties’ intention that the charterer’s exposure to liability should be greater
under clause 13, where cover against marine and war risks was to be maintained
at the owner’s expense than under clause 12, where it was to be maintained at
the charterer’s expense. Longmore LJ put the point pithily when he described
the exclusion of rights of recovery or subrogation in clause 13 as “a
confirmation rather than a negation of such exclusion in the more usually
adopted clause 12 for the longer term charters when it is the charterers who
pay the premium” (para 88).</a></p><a name="para135">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The critical question then arises as to the effect, in relation to the
operation of clause 12, of the substitution of clause 5 by clause 29, which
provides that the vessel is to be employed in lawful trades for the carriage of
lawful merchandises “only between good and safe berths, ports or areas where
the [vessel] can safely lie always afloat”, etc.</a></p><a name="para136">

</span>On the hypothesis that Kashima was not prospectively a safe port for the
OCEAN VICTORY when Daiichi gave instructions for her to discharge there,
Daiichi was thereby in breach of the safe port undertaking in the time
sub-charter between itself and Sinochart, which in turn was in breach of the
equivalent undertaking in the time charter between itself and the demise
charterer, OLH, which in turn was in breach of clause 29 of the demise charter
between itself and the owners, OVM. The consequence of that breach was that the
vessel was lost, but the demise charterer and the owners were co-insured (as
required by clause 12) and the insurers paid its insured value. One of the
insurers, Gard, claims to be entitled to recover that sum from the time
charterers as assignee of the rights of the demise charterer. The claim
therefore depends on the demise charterer being liable to the owners for that
sum by way of damages for breach of clause 29, and thus entitled to recover the
same sum from the time charterer as loss suffered by the demise charterer.</a></p><a name="para137">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Gard’s case is that the breach of clause 29 caused the loss of the
vessel; therefore the demise charterer was liable to the owners for the
vessel’s value, and the fact that the owners were paid that amount by the
insurers is res inter alios acta as between the demise charterer and the time
charterer.</a></p><a name="para138">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The critical question is whether the contractual scheme between the
owners and the demise charterer precluded any claim by the former against the
latter for the insured loss of the vessel. This is a matter of construction. It
has become a common practice in various industries for the parties to provide
for specified loss or damage to be covered by insurance for their mutual
benefit, whether caused by one party’s fault or not, thus avoiding potential
litigation between them. The question in each case is whether the parties are
to be taken to have intended to create an insurance fund which would be the
sole avenue for making good the relevant loss or damage, or whether the
existence of the fund co-exists with an independent right of action for breach
of a term of the contract which has caused that loss. Like all questions of
construction, it depends on the provisions of the particular contract: see, for
example, <i>Co-operative Retail Services Ltd v Taylor Young Partnership Ltd</i>
</a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/2002/17.html">[2002] 1 WLR 1419</a>.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In that case a building owner entered into a standard form of building
contract for the construction of office premises. Under its terms the
contractor was required to take out and maintain a policy in the names of the
owner, the contractor and specialist electrical subcontractors, Hall, for all
risks insurance covering loss or damage to the works from specified perils
including fire. Hall entered into a collateral contract with the owner
warranting that it had exercised and would exercise all reasonable care and
skill in the design and execution of the sub-contract works. A fire occurred
causing extensive damage. The owners sued their architects and mechanical and
engineering consultants, who brought third party proceedings against Hall. This
raised the question whether Hall was liable to the owners in respect of the
fire damage, alleged by the third party claimants to have been caused by Hall’s
negligence and breach of warranty. The House of Lords, upholding a decision by
the first instance judge and the Court of Appeal, held that it cannot have been
the parties’ intention that parties who were jointly insured under a
contractors’ all risks policy could make claims against one another in respect
of damage covered by the insurance, or that the insurers could make a
subrogated claim in the name of the owners against Hall, and that the court
would if necessary hold that there was an implied term to such effect (which I
infer in relation to Hall must logically have taken effect as an implied term
of the collateral contract between itself and the owners). In so holding the
House of Lords approved and applied the reasoning of Mr Recorder Jackson QC, as
he then was, in <i>Hopewell Project Management Ltd v Ewbank Preece Ltd</i>
[1998] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 448, 458, where he described it as nonsensical if those
parties who were jointly insured under a contractors’ all risks policy would
make claims against one another in respect of damage to the contract works. The
implied term presupposes, of course, that the party relying on it has not by
his own conduct prevented recovery of the loss under the policy - a point made
by Jackson J (as he had by then become) in <i>Board of Trustees of the Tate Gallery
v Duffy Construction Ltd</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/TCC/2007/361.html">[2007] BLR 216</a>.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the present case the Court of Appeal followed the same reasoning in
holding that the proper construction of clause 12 was that there was to be “an
insurance funded result in the event of loss or damage to the vessel by marine
risks” and that, if the demise charterers had been in breach of the safe port
clause, they would have been under no liability to the owners for the amount of
the insured loss because they had made provision for looking to the insurance
proceeds for compensation. It did not consider that the introduction of clause 29
was intended to alter the way in which clause 12 was to operate.</a></p><a name="para141">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para141"></a><a name="para142">142.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I agree with the Court of Appeal. The demise charter allowed for a
sub-demise with the owners’ consent, which was not to be unreasonably withheld.
The risk existed that the vessel might be directed to an unsafe port, not
necessarily by negligence on anyone’s part, so causing peril to the vessel, but
the risk of consequential damage to the vessel was catered for by the insurance
required to be maintained by the demise charterer in the joint names of itself
and the owners. The commercial purpose of maintaining joint insurance in such
circumstances is not only to provide a fund to make good the loss but to avoid
litigation between them, or the bringing of a subrogation claim in the name of
one against the other. I do not accept that by substituting clause 29 for
clause 5 the parties intended to subvert that purpose. If anything, the present
case is stronger in this regard than <i>Co-operative Retail Services Ltd v
Taylor Young Partnership Ltd</i>, because in that case Hall’s obligation to use
skill and care was in a separate contract from the contract between the owner
and the contractor which contained the provisions about insurance whereas in
the present case clauses 12 and 29 are part of a single contract. Gard’s
submission that clause 29 becomes pointless if clause 12 has the effect held by
the Court of Appeal is fallacious. It sets limits on the use of the vessel, breach
of which may give rise to loss, but clause 12 deals with the consequences of
loss or damage to the vessel, regardless of whether it resulted from negligence
or other fault of the demise charterer (or a sub-charterer).</a></p><a name="para142">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para142"></a><a name="para143">143.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr Mark Howard QC argued that this interpretation misapprehends the
purpose of clause 12, which in a case of loss caused by a breach of contract by
the charterer does no more than to ensure that the owner’s right to recover
damages is backed by an available fund. This in substance was the argument
advanced unsuccessfully against Hall in <i>Co-operative Retail Services Ltd v
Taylor Young Partnership Ltd</i>. Lord Hope (paras 39 and 40) distinguished
between a provision for insurance which curtails the means of recovering loss
whether or not it was caused by a contracting co-insured’s default, and a
provision which backs the other party’s other obligations with an insuring
obligation but leaves the other obligations enforceable against the other party
by other means. He agreed with the judge’s conclusion that the contractual
insurance arrangements meant that if a fire occurred, the owners were to look
to the joint insurance policy to provide the fund for the cost of restoring and
repairing the fire damage rather than, in the judge’s words, indulge in
litigation with each other.</a></p><a name="para143">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the present case, if one were to ask whether it would have accorded
with the parties’ intentions that on the morning after the loss the owners
would have been entitled to demand immediate payment from the demise
charterers, rather than make a claim on the insurers and wait for it to be
settled, my answer would be that they intended no such thing. The insurance
arrangements under clause 12 provided not only a fund but the avoidance of
commercially unnecessary and undesirable disputes between the co-insured.</a></p><a name="para144">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para144"></a><a name="para145">145.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It does not follow that the demise charterers (or their insurers in
their shoes) necessarily had no available remedy against the time charterers.
The court was told that at one stage the insurers intimated a claim analogous to
the claim which a bailee may bring under <i>The Winkfield</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpPro/1901/52.html">[1902] P 42</a>.
However, the matter was not pursued, and it would be inappropriate to express a
positive view about the likelihood of success of such a claim (or any
alternative), about which the court has heard no argument.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para146">146.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For those reasons I would have upheld the decision of the Court of
Appeal on the recoverability issue, if the demise charterers had been in breach
of the safe port clause. I have had the benefit of reading Lord Mance’s
additional reasons, with which I agree. Like him, I do not think it is
necessary to reach a final conclusion about the position in the case of an
