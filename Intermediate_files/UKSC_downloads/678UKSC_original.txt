</span>This appeal relates to personal independence payment, which is a
non-means tested allowance paid to certain people with long term health
problems or disability. The appeal’s focus is upon one of the markers used to
determine whether a claimant’s ability to live his or her daily life is
limited, by his or her physical or mental condition, to such an extent as to
generate an entitlement to personal independence payment (“PIP”). Various
“daily living activities” are examined as markers, and the one in question here
is “engaging with other people face to face”.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">The general scheme of the Welfare Reform Act 2012 and the Social
Security (Personal Independence Payment) Regulations 2013</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">2.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>PIP is dealt with in Part 4 of the Welfare Reform Act 2012 (“the Act”).
Section 77 introduces the allowance and establishes that a person may be
entitled to one or both of its two components, namely “the daily living
component” and “the mobility component”. This case is concerned with the daily
living component. Entitlement is dealt with in section 78, which also points
the way to other relevant provisions contained in Part 4 and in the regulations
made under it. The component can be paid at either the “standard rate” (which
is what is in question here) or, for those whose ability is more limited, the
higher “enhanced rate”.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">3.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>By section 78(1), there are two requirements which the claimant must
satisfy in order to be entitled to the daily living component at the standard
rate, namely the requirement in section 78(1)(a) (which I will refer to as “the
limited ability requirement”), and “the required period condition” in section
78(1)(b). So far as is material, the section reads:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“78.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Daily living component</i></p>

</span>Section 80 provides that the question “whether a person’s ability to
carry out daily living activities is limited by the person’s physical or mental
condition” (the limited ability requirement in section 78(1)(a)) is to be
determined in accordance with regulations, and that the regulations must
provide for that question to be determined, except in prescribed circumstances,
on the basis of an assessment (or repeated assessments) of the person. The
question of whether the person meets the required period condition for the
purposes of section 78(1)(b) is similarly to be determined in accordance with
regulations.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">5.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Social Security (Personal Independence Payment) Regulations 2013
(“the Regulations”) prescribe the activities which are “daily living
activities” for section 78 as those set out in column 1 of the table in Part 2
of Schedule 1 to the Regulations. The table lists ten activities. Column 2
focuses in some detail on the ability of the claimant (referred to throughout
the Regulations as “C”) to carry out each activity, on a scale ranging from
being able to carry out the activity unaided to being unable to do it. For
example, activity 1 in the list is “Preparing food”, and there are six levels
of ability in column 2 ranging from “a. Can prepare and cook a simple meal
unaided” to “f. Cannot prepare and cook food”. Each sub-paragraph in column 2
is called a “descriptor”.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">6.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In column 3, points are attributed, according to the level of ability
measured by the descriptors; the greater the difficulty experienced by the
claimant, the greater the number of points awarded. So, a claimant who can
prepare and cook a simple meal unaided has no points attributed, whereas, at
the other end of the scale, eight points are attributed where the claimant
cannot prepare and cook food. There are gradations between the two; for
example, a claimant who needs prompting to be able to prepare or cook a simple
meal has two points attributed, as does a claimant who needs to use an aid or
appliance to do so. The same ascending scale of difficulty, reflected in
increasing numbers of points, can be seen in relation to each of the activities
in the table.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">7.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Regulation 5 provides that the points attributed for each activity in
the table are added together and, if the total is at least eight but less than
12, the claimant has “limited ability to carry out daily living activities”,
and is entitled to PIP at the standard rate, whereas if the total is 12 points
or more, the claimant will be classed as having “severely limited ability” and
is entitled to the enhanced rate.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">8.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Regulation 4(2A) provides some more detail as to how the assessment of
ability is approached, providing that:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“C is to be assessed as satisfying
a descriptor only if C can do so -</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; safely;</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to an acceptable
standard;</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; repeatedly; and</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; within a reasonable
time period.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">Regulation 4(4) defines these concepts as follows:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘safely’ means in a
manner unlikely to cause harm to C or to another person, either during or after
completion of the activity;</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘repeatedly’ means as
often as the activity being assessed is reasonably required to be completed;
and</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘reasonable time period’
means no more than twice as long as the maximum period that a person without a
physical or mental condition which limits that person’s ability to carry out
the activity in question would normally take to complete that activity.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">9.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The assessment of the claimant is more than just a snapshot of ability,
given that the required period condition has to be satisfied, see section
78(1)(b). Section 81 dictates the shape of the regulations about this
condition, providing (so far as material) that they:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“must <span style="color:black">provide
for the question of whether a person meets ‘</span>the required period
condition’ … to be determined by reference to -</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whether, as respects
every time in the previous three months, it is likely that if the relevant
ability had been assessed at that time that ability would have been determined
to be limited … by the person's physical or mental condition; and</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whether, as respects
every time in the next nine months, it is likely that if the relevant ability
were to be assessed at that time that ability would be determined to be limited
… by the person’s physical or mental condition.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">10.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For present purposes, the “relevant ability” is, of course, the ability
to carry out daily living activities (section 81(2)). Section 81(3) deals with
the reckoning of the periods of three and nine months, providing that “the
previous three months” means the three months ending with “the prescribed date”
and “the next nine months” means the nine months beginning with the day after
that date. The Regulations make provision as required by section 81, including
establishing what the “prescribed date” is, and also dealing with further
issues to do with the “required period”. The detail does not matter for the
issue presently under consideration. What is important is to recognise that it
is not just the claimant’s situation on one day of assessment that is under
consideration, but his or her situation over a period of 12 months.
Furthermore, it is clear from the Regulations that some degree of fluctuation
in the claimant’s presentation is anticipated. Regulation 7, which is entitled
“Scoring: further provision”, sets out how to choose which descriptor applies
to a claimant in relation to each activity in the table. It involves looking to
see which descriptors are “satisfied on over 50% of the days of the required
period”, and from that information, working out which descriptor is to be
applied. Regulation 7(1)(a) (which deals with the most straightforward
situation) will serve as an example; it provides that “where one descriptor is
satisfied on over 50% of the days of the required period” that descriptor
applies to the claimant.</p>

</span>It is Activity 9 in the table in Part 2 of Schedule 1 to the Regulations
which gives rise to the issues in this appeal. In relation to this activity,

meant by “social support”, and how it differs from “prompting” in descriptor 9b

</span>There is no definition of “engaging with other people face to face” or
of “engage”. As can be seen, Part 1 provides, instead, a definition of “engage
socially”, a term which does not appear anywhere else in the Schedule. It is
thought that this is an error, arising when Activity 9, which was originally
entitled “engaging socially”, was refined following consultation on the
provisions. The settled position in the tribunals (endorsed by the Court of
Appeal in <i>Hickey v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2018/851.html">[2018] EWCA Civ 851</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2018/851.html">[2018] 4 WLR 71</a>, para 9) is that factors set out in relation to
“engaging socially” are nevertheless relevant to the consideration of a
person’s ability to engage with other people face to face, and there does not
appear to be any reason to disrupt that approach.</p>

</span>The respondent is a man in his forties. He made a claim for PIP relying,
inter alia, upon the effects that his mental health has upon his ability to
engage with other people. When his claim was refused because he had not been
awarded the required eight points, he appealed unsuccessfully to the First-tier
Tribunal (“FTT”). A central issue in the appeal was the number of points that
should be attributed to him under Activity 9. The FTT considered that the
decision maker had correctly found him to fall within descriptor 9b
(prompting), rather than 9c (social support). Explaining this, the FTT Judge
simply said:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Two points have been awarded in
respect of 9b. From the activities of daily living and our findings in fact
above we consider that this is the appropriate descriptor. The appellant did
not require social support as defined to be able to engage with other people
nor did engaging with other people cause him overwhelming psychological
distress or to exhibit behaviour which would result in a substantial risk of
harm to himself or another person. Two points are due as awarded.”</p>

</span>The respondent appealed to the Upper Tribunal, contending that he should
have been awarded four points under 9c, which would have qualified him to
receive PIP. The appeal was allowed on the basis that the FTT had given an
inadequate explanation of why 9b had been selected rather than 9c, and that it
had failed to make adequate findings of fact going to that issue. The Upper
Tribunal judge remitted the case to the FTT for rehearing, providing directions
as to how the tribunal should approach Activity 9. The essence of the
directions might be said to be as follows:</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">i)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>what is envisaged as “social support” is “emotional or moral support”
“and perhaps also physical support”, and “other interventions which could
include everything in the definition of prompting provided it can only be
accepted by the claimant if given by a qualified person”;</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">ii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>qualified people are those who are “trained or experienced in assisting
people to engage in social situations” and friends or family can come within
that category;</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">iii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>the qualified person needs to be “present or available” to provide the
support.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">17.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Secretary of State appealed to the Inner House of the Court of
Session. The Upper Tribunal’s decision to set aside the FTT’s determination and
to remit the matter for rehearing was not challenged, but the directions which
were to govern the FTT’s approach were. The grounds of appeal were that the
Upper Tribunal should have directed the FTT that the social support must be
contemporaneous with the social engagement being supported, and that social
support requires something more substantial than prompting.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">18.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Inner House refused the appeal. It rejected the argument that the
support had to be contemporaneous with the social engagement, considering that
there might be situations in which a qualified person could provide sufficient
support in anticipation of the claimant meeting people face to face, without
the supporter actually having to be present during the meeting. However,
although there was, in the Inner House’s view, no justification for a
requirement that the support must be given during or immediately before the
engagement, there did have to be “a ‘temporal or causal link’ of some sort
between the help given and the activity in respect of which the help is needed”
(para 51 of the Inner House’s opinion).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">19.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As to the nature of “social support”, the Secretary of State’s position
was encapsulated by the Inner House in this way (at para 53 of its opinion):</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“the exercise suggested is, in
effect, to treat ‘prompting’ and ‘social support’ as mutually exclusive, deduct
everything that amounts to ‘prompting’ and see what, if anything, you are left
with which, if sufficient in quantity, might amount to ‘social support’.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">This approach had found favour with a number of Upper
Tribunal judges (in CPIP/1861/2015 UKUT(AAC) (unreported) 12 April 2016;

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">20.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the view of the Inner House, however, the Secretary of State’s
approach failed to recognise the potential for overlap between the “prompting”
and the “social support” categories (para 54 ibid). It held that they are not
mutually exclusive categories. As the Inner House saw it, the critical
distinction between descriptor 9b prompting and descriptor 9c support lay not
in a difference in the nature of the help provided but in the fact that, with
social support, there is a necessity for the help to come from a person trained
or experienced in assisting people to engage in social situations (para 55).
Having given the example of psychological support given by someone trained in
psychology, which would clearly count as “social support”, it went on to say:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“But there may be cases where the
support is in the nature of encouragement or explanation but, because of the
claimant’s mental state, will only be effective if delivered by someone who is
trained or experienced in delivering that type of support to that individual.
In such a case there will not be a qualitative difference in the help given,
but the help can be regarded as ‘support’ because of the necessity for it to be
provided by someone trained or experienced in delivering it.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">21.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Inner House slightly modified the Upper Tribunal judge’s direction
to the FTT, setting out its own formulation, at para 56, as follows:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Encouragement or any other sort
of prompting can qualify as ‘social support’ if, to render it effective or to
increase its effectiveness, it requires to be delivered by someone trained or
experienced in assisting people to engage in social situations.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">22.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The case was remitted to the FTT for determination in accordance with
the guidance given in the Inner House’s opinion. The Secretary of State then
appealed to this court, challenging the Inner House’s interpretation of “social
support” (termed by the parties “the qualitative issue”), and its conclusion
that it need not be contemporaneous with the engagement being supported (“the
timing issue”).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">23.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The respondent, who made his claim for PIP in February 2015, meanwhile
continues to await the factual findings and ruling in the FTT that is necessary
to resolve whether or not he is entitled to any payment. He maintains that the
Inner House’s ruling is substantially correct.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">24.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mind was given permission to intervene and has provided helpful
submissions, both in writing and orally. It considers the respondent’s position
in relation to the timing issue to be correct, but invites the court not to
decide that issue, on the basis that it is unnecessary and undesirable to do so
in the circumstances of this case. It concentrates its submissions on the
qualitative issue, aligning itself with the respondent and the courts below.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">The Secretary of State’s argument: the qualitative issue</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">25.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Contrary to the position taken below, in this court the Secretary of
State accepts that “social support” for the purposes of descriptor 9c may
consist of “prompting”, but submits that the prompting involved in social
support is different by virtue of the fact that, in accordance with the
definition of “social support”, the support needed has to be support “from a
person trained or experienced in assisting people to engage in social
situations”. If “a person trained or experienced” were to be narrowly
construed, denoting someone who has such training or experience by virtue of
their professional training or occupational history, there would be no
difficulty in identifying situations within 9c, but the Secretary of State
adheres to the assurance given during the consultation process that a friend or
family member who knows the claimant well, and can offer support, can also be
included as a relevantly “experienced” person. So, the Secretary of State
submits, the key feature that distinguishes “social support” is that, as it is
put in the written case:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“the help needs to be given by
[the] trained or experienced person <i>by reason of their training or
experience</i>. Familiarity is not enough.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">26.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Secretary of State’s concern (as articulated in the written case) is
that the Inner House’s direction risks generating confusion:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“between the persons who require
support from a person because of their relevant experience (which might include
experience gained in the course of being friends or family), and those who
require support from a friend or family member solely because of that
relationship … It is very common for a person to only respond well to someone
they know and trust. However, the need for help from someone familiar or
trusted on its own does not turn prompting into social support.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">27.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There will be a qualitative difference, the Secretary of State says, in
the help given by a helper using his or her training or experience as opposed
to other help. The trained or experienced person will understand what is
lacking in the claimant’s social engagement and be able to overcome this, or
enable the claimant to do so, whereas an inexperienced person would not
necessarily be able to see what was lacking, anticipate a difficulty, or know
how to remedy it.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">Discussion: the qualitative issue</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">28.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The difference between the Secretary of State’s interpretation and that
of the Inner House (supported by the respondent and the intervener) is somewhat
nebulous, and appears as if it might, in fact, be limited. Rather than risk
confusing the issue by indulging in a comparison of the two positions, it might
be better to return directly to the text of Activity 9.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span style="color:black">29.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>It is well to bear in mind, when considering the ambit of the
various limbs of Activity 9, that “engaging with people face to face” is an
activity that can take many differing forms. As was pointed out in the course
of oral argument, face to face interactions will range from engagements such as
formal interviews and medical examinations to establishing and furthering close
personal <span style="color:black">relationships. Similarly, the sort of
assistance that enables the engagement to occur will take many differing forms.</span></p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">30.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The obvious starting point, in determining which of the Activity 9
descriptors applies, is to establish what help the particular person needs in
order to be able to engage with other people face to face, remembering that
this is not about the help the person is actually receiving, but about the help
that they need, although the one may of course inform the other. It is worth
stressing that the provisions are not concerned with support that the person
would like to have, or would appreciate as generally comforting; the particular
support has to be <i>needed</i> to enable the activity to take place.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">31.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Having assembled the facts in this way, one can start to consider
whether the help needed is of a type that falls within the ambit of “social
support” for the purposes of descriptor 9c. Early in the oral argument, the
Secretary of State sought to confine the scope of “social support” by adopting
a rather technical construction of the Activity 9 descriptors. The starting
point was that descriptor 9a concerns a person who “can engage with other
people unaided”. The submission flowing from this had the following elements:</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">i)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>it can be inferred that, in contrast to those within 9a who can manage
“unaided”, claimants falling within 9b and 9c all need to be “aided”;</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">ii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>“aided” is a term defined in Part 1 of the Schedule (see para 13 above),
and involves the use of an aid or appliance, or supervision, prompting or
assistance;</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">iii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>so 9b and 9c claimants will all require aid in one of these forms;</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">iv)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>and other forms of support are therefore irrelevant in considering what
is meant by “social support” in 9c.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">32.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There are difficulties with this proposed interpretation, but there is
nothing to be gained in elaborating them. It suffices to say that, in my view,
such a narrow and technical approach would introduce an unwarranted limitation
of the broad word “support” which has been used in descriptor 9c. This would be
inconsistent with the government’s objectives in introducing the new disability
benefit provisions, including PIP, which included simplifying matters, and
creating a benefit that was easier to understand, and reached those in need of
extra support to live independently and participate in everyday life. In
practice, support might take many forms, responding, no doubt, to the varied
needs of claimants, and the varied forms of face to face engagement. The
examples provided by Mind underline the wide variation in the help people
have/require in order to engage with other people. Prompting is one form of
support, as is now accepted, but there will be other forms, and they may well
not fall within the definition of “aided”. The “use of an aid or appliance”
might not often be relevant, “supervision” is about ensuring safety rather than
directed at Activity 9, and the only other form of aid included in the definition
is “assistance” which means “physical intervention … not includ[ing] speech”,
and might play a part, but is unlikely to sweep up all other available forms of
support. I would accordingly reject the argument that only support that falls
within the definition of “aid” is relevant, although acknowledging that a
consideration of the various forms of “prompting” and of the other sorts of aid
identified in the Regulations could assist in lending some colour to the
concept of “support”.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">33.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I return, therefore, to the central question of what differentiates the
claimant who needs social support and is entitled to four points under
descriptor 9c, from the claimant who is only entitled to two points, because he
or she only needs prompting in the form covered by descriptor 9b. It is
inherent in the scheme that, broadly speaking, descriptor 9c reflects a greater
degree of disability than descriptor 9b, so attracting increased points.
Responding to the greater degree of disability requires the attention not just
of “another person” (as in the case of “prompting” simpliciter), but of “a
person trained or experienced in assisting people to engage in social
situations”. That is what differentiates prompting for the purposes of 9b from
prompting which is social support for the purposes of 9c. And where the support
takes a form other than prompting, it will similarly only qualify for 9c if the
claimant needs it to come from a person so trained or experienced.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">34.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Secretary of State’s anxiety that the provision will be taken to
include the sort of confidence-boosting and reassurance that occurs in most
close relationships can be allayed by keeping the focus very firmly on the twin
requirements of necessity and relevant training or experience. Applied in the
family/friends setting, to qualify for points under 9c, the claimant has to <i>need</i>
support from someone who is not just familiar with him or her, but who is also
experienced in assisting engagement in social situations. It is the
training/experience of the helper upon which the claimant depends in order to
enable the face to face engagement with others to take place, not simply the
close and comforting relationship that may exist between the claimant and the
helper.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">35.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Having dispatched the idea that “prompting” can never constitute “social
support”, the words of descriptor 9c, taken with the definition of “social
support”, clearly define the ambit of the category and distinguish it from
descriptor 9b. There is no need to complicate them. As the Inner House observed
in para 55 of its opinion (see the passage quoted at para 20 above), the nature
of the support provided might not differ between 9b and 9c. What brings the
claimant into 9c rather than 9b is that, to be able to engage with others, he
or she needs that support to come from someone trained or experienced in
assisting people to engage in social situations. As the Inner House helpfully
put it, the support “will only be effective if delivered by someone who is
trained or experienced”.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">36.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I would express a word of caution about the Inner House’s statement (at
para 56) that help can qualify as “social support” if, “to render it effective <i>or
to increase its effectiveness</i>” (my italics), it requires to be delivered by
a trained or experienced person. It is useful to ask oneself what is required
to render help “effective” in enabling the social engagement to take place, as
I have observed in my preceding paragraph. But I cannot endorse the addition of
the italicised words. Descriptor 9c revolves around what the claimant “needs”,
and “need” is not a relative term. The claimant either needs or does not need
trained/experienced help in order to be able to engage with other people. If
only trained/experienced help will be effective in achieving the objective, the
claimant can be said to need it. If what could be called, for want of a better
shorthand, “lay” help would enable the claimant to engage, the claimant does
not fall within 9c, but might fall within 9b. And, of course, if not even
trained/experienced help would work, the claimant might fall within 9d.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">37.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There will, inevitably, be cases in which it is not immediately evident
whether descriptor 9c applies, and it is only after scrutinising the facts
particularly carefully that the decision maker will be able to reach a
determination. Although the provision is concerned with the help the claimant
needs, rather than with the help which he or she is actually getting in
practice, it seems likely that, in many family/friends cases, someone will
already be carrying out the supportive role in face to face engagements. Where
this is so, the assessment/decision making process will be assisted by looking
at the elements of the support that they actually provide, how they have come
to know what to do, whether or not the sort of help that they provide could be
provided by any well-meaning friend or family member, and what additional help
(if any) is required. Exploring these issues will no doubt be a sensitive task.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">38.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mind points out that people often struggle to convey the relevant
information or they put it in terms which are misunderstood. Claimants are
likely to be handling their applications for PIP themselves, or with assistance
only from family and friends. Here, for example, the respondent and his partner
attended the hearing before the FTT, both gave evidence, and the partner acted
as the respondent’s representative<a name="_Hlk11925168">. </a>During the
application process, whether it be upon the first request for payment or in the
tribunal system upon appeal, it may be necessary to probe what is being said in
support of the claim so as to establish the elements of the help that is
required to enable the face to face engagement to take place and the
characteristics of the person who will need to provide it in order for it to be
effective. By way of example, if a claimant says, “I need to have someone I
trust with me when I meet people face to face”, a number of questions are
likely to be required to follow this up, and to determine whether the claimant
comes within descriptor 9b or 9c. Everything will depend on the facts of the particular
case, but they might include questions (sensitively put, of course) such as
“why is that?”, “who would you trust in that role?”, “what sort of things could
they do to help you engage?”, “how would they know what to do?”, “what would
happen if that person was not there?”</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">The Secretary of State’s argument: the timing issue</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">39.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Secretary of State submits that social support needs to be
contemporaneous with the face to face engagement being supported, and that it
does not include help provided in advance of it. The contrary interpretation
would, submits the Secretary of State, leave matters so open that it would
inevitably generate inconsistencies and arbitrariness in decision making. The
reasons given in support of the narrow approach include:</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">i)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The assessment is “a calibration of the claimant’s functional
limitations at the date of the claim with the application of the qualifying
periods”; it is an assessment of actual disability during the activity.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">ii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Descriptor 9c uses the present tense: “needs”. This suggests presence
during the activity, for example to do the reminding, encouraging or explaining
involved in “prompting”.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">iii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Supporting the face to face engagement requires that the supporter
perceives the full context of the engagement and has the ability to react to
what is done by the person with whom the claimant is seeking to engage.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">iv)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Descriptor 9c is concerned with an intensity of need on the part of the
claimant (as reflected in the need for a trained/experienced supporter) which
is such as to make it unrealistic to contemplate sufficient support being given
without the supporter actually being present during the engagement.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">v)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Social support would be in an anomalous position if it could occur in
advance of the engagement, whereas other descriptors require support to be
contemporaneous. The Secretary of State invites comparison with, for example,
communication support (relevant to Activity 7) which it is submitted would, by
its nature, have to be provided at the time of the communication.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">vi)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It would be very difficult to apply the provision if support in advance
would qualify. How would the moral, social and emotional support which is an
ordinary incident of family relationships and friendships, be distinguished
from assistance that would qualify for 9c?</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">vii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As for psychological support, the Secretary of State would say that it
is not within the scope of social support at all, but if it were, the problem
would be to know how far back one should go, and whether to include counselling
sessions the day before the engagement, or a week before, or a year before.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading"><a name="_Hlk11939621">Discussion: the timing issue</a></p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">40.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It might be helpful to consider the timing issue having in mind some
examples of the practical ways in which a person can be helped to engage face
to face with others. Given that no findings of fact have yet been made in
relation to the respondent’s circumstances, it is desirable to avoid focusing
particularly on him, but in the course of his counsel’s submissions, examples
were given of the sort of support that an experienced family member might give.
Preparation might occur prior to the engagement which enables it to occur
without, for example, overwhelming psychological distress. One technique that
can be deployed is to look together, in advance of the meeting, at the “worst
case scenario”. During the meeting, with knowledge of the claimant, the
supporter can watch out for things that are known to trigger his or her
anxiety, and redirect the conversation. Where memory is a problem, the
supporter can remind the claimant of things they have forgotten. Private signs
of reassurance can be given where required. And, where required, the supporter
might recognise the need to remove the person from the meeting.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">41.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is important to remember that each claimant is an individual with
individual needs, and that different techniques might help in different cases,
or at different times in the life of the same person. It seems to me that the
Secretary of State’s insistence on it being necessary for the supporter to be
present with the claimant during the face to face engagement would stand in the
way of other means of support which work for the particular claimant, and would
also be likely to impede attempts to improve the claimant’s abilities to handle
matters without support at all, or with diminished support. It is not difficult
to contemplate a situation in which the trained or experienced supporter is
aiming to make progress so that a claimant, who initially cannot manage without
the supporter physically present during the face to face engagement, learns in
stages to manage with the supporter at the door of the room, next door, leaving
the building for a short period during the meeting, bringing the claimant to
the meeting and collecting him after it, and so on. Discussion before (and
possibly after) engagements, and also practical exercises, might be deployed,
in order to equip the claimant to deal with encounters without the physical
presence of the supporter. At some point in the progress, the claimant will
cease to qualify under 9c, but, looking at things entirely practically, rather
than legalistically, it would be hard to say that, in all cases, from the moment
in the continuum when the supporter is no longer in the room with the claimant,
he no longer needs social support to be able to engage with people.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">42.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is also relevant to consider the sensitivity of some of the face to
face engagements that a claimant may need to undertake. Social support by
physical presence with a claimant during a medical examination, or what was
called during the hearing “a romantic engagement”, might be counter-productive,
whereas social support which did not involve actual presence might enable the
claimant to engage when that would not otherwise have been possible. For
example, it is easy to contemplate that the claimant and the experienced
supporter might have a discussion in advance of a medical examination, going
through every element of the procedure and exploring how the claimant might
respond to it, the claimant might then allow him or herself to be accompanied
to the door of the consultation room and given into the care of the doctor or
nurse, and the necessary continuing reassurance might come from the knowledge
that the supporter was nearby in the waiting room.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">43.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is undesirable to construe the provision in a way that runs counter
to these sorts of considerations, unless that is dictated by the provision
itself, or by something in its legal context. There is nothing in the wording
of descriptor 9c, or the definition of “social support”, to require actual
presence of the supporter during the engagement, nor yet to require that the
support is timed to coincide with the engagement, rather than being provided in
advance, or indeed afterwards. The use of the present tense (“needs”) does not
carry the Secretary of State this far. It does dictate that the claimant
actually needs the support “as respects every time” over the course of the 12
months made relevant by the required period condition (see para 9 above). The
need has to be a continuing one, not one that has been addressed or otherwise
ceased, and I would certainly agree with the Inner House when they said (para
49) that descriptor 9c (and for that matter descriptor 9b) would not apply to a
case:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“where, as a result of a
successful psychiatric or psychological intervention in the past, the person
being assessed was now able to engage with other people satisfactorily and
without further help. He would not be able to say, on the strength of that
previous intervention, that he continued to fall within Activity 9, descriptor
c.”</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">But the requirement that there should be a current need
at all relevant times does not, of itself, exclude the possibility of
assistance given outside the confines of the engagement itself. This is perhaps
most easily demonstrated by an example: if social support includes, say, advice
and discussion prior to a face to face engagement, it could perfectly properly
be said of a claimant, who can only engage if that sort of help is provided,
that he “needs social support”. The Secretary of State’s interpretation would
only be made out if “social support” is confined to that which is provided on
the spot, and there is nothing in the definition of it to confine it in that
way.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">44.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the absence of express wording dictating contemporaneity, the
Secretary of State’s argument must depend upon inferences drawn from elsewhere
in the Regulations and/or from the likely circumstances of claimants.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">45.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Comparisons with other daily living activities where presence <i>is </i>required
during the activity are unhelpful, in my view, because all the various
activities are different in nature, and the ways of overcoming difficulties in
carrying them out will inevitably be different. Nor am I persuaded by the
submissions based upon the intensity of the claimant’s need and the supposed
need for the supporter to perceive and react to the engagement as it unfolds.
Sometimes these factors will dictate that the supporter can only provide
effective help if actually present, but I see no reason to assume that this
will always be the case, and no reason to limit the scope of descriptor 9c so
as to exclude cases where support is required from a person trained or
experienced in assisting people to engage in social situations but which do not
fall within this model.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">46.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In short, I do not consider that descriptor 9c is limited to cases where
a claimant needs social support actually during the face to face engagement.
Given that social support is likely to take many different forms, depending on
the individual needs of the claimant, it is undesirable to attempt to
prescribe, in the abstract, which other forms of support will be sufficient. It
will be a question of fact and degree, and is something that will have to be
worked out on a case by case basis, by those with expertise in making
assessments and decisions in relation to claims, keeping the wording of the
provision firmly in mind. I am hopeful that it will prove possible to do this
without the Secretary of State’s fears of inconsistent and arbitrary decisions
being realised.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">47.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Before concluding, I should say something about the Inner House’s
acceptance that what was required was a “‘temporal or causal link’ of some sort
between the help given and the activity in respect of which the help is needed”
(para 51). This is not a formulation that should, in my view, be adopted. A
detailed explanation of why not is unlikely to be of assistance, and one
illustration of the problem will perhaps suffice. The formulation contemplates
two separate ways in which the requisite link could exist, expressed as
alternatives, namely a link by virtue of timing (“temporal … link”) and a link
by virtue of being instrumental in securing the engagement (“causal … link”).
It is difficult to envisage how support which is linked in time to a face to
face engagement but has no causal link to what occurs could have any relevance.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">48.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Sometimes, explaining and elaborating upon a provision confuses rather
than assists, and this might be one of those situations. The answer is more
likely to be found, in any given case, by close attention to the words of
descriptor 9c, as defined in the Regulations, and to the required period
condition. This exercise, paying close attention in particular to the
requirement that the claimant “needs” the support (see para 43 above), should
serve to confine the scope of descriptor 9c within appropriate time boundaries.</p>

<p class="ParaHeading">Conclusion</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm">49.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I would allow the appeal in the limited sense that I would interpret the
relevant legal provisions slightly differently from the Inner House, as I have
explained above.</p>
