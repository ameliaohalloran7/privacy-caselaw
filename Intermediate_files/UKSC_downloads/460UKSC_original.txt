<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The issue in this case concerns the true meaning and ambit of the
additional right of appeal specific to asylum claims which was given by section
83 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (“NIAA 2002”). That
section has now been repealed by section 15(3) of the Immigration Act 2014 and
replaced by a wider right of appeal. It remains, however, in force for the
present appellant, and perhaps for some others. The Court of Appeal gave permission,
before the Immigration Act 2014 had been passed, for the present appeal to be
brought to this court: </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2014/50.html">[2014] 1 WLR 2766</a>.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2">2.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The principal right of appeal against immigration decisions made by the
Home Secretary was, in NIAA 2002, given by section 82. Stripped of
inessentials, a right of appeal to an immigration judge was given by that
section in respect of a variety of listed immigration decisions. Importantly
for present purposes, those included the principal decisions which will lead to
removal from this country, such as a decision to remove, or a refusal to vary
leave to remain which will leave the claimant without it. A claim for asylum,
that is to say a claim to be a refugee entitled to the benefit of the Refugee
Convention, was not amongst the list of immigration decisions and did not
therefore attract the section 82 right of appeal.</a></p><a name="para2">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2"></a><a name="para3">3.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>However, if an appeal under section 82 existed because there was also an
immigration decision of one of the kinds listed, the claimant was expressly
entitled by section 84(1)(g) to raise the argument that his removal would put this
country in breach of its obligations under the Refugee Convention. By this
somewhat circuitous but effective route a right of appeal against refusal of
asylum in practice existed under the NIAA 2002, as under previous legislation,
if there was an immigration decision to appeal under section 82. Generally,
there was. But it might happen that there was not if, for example, when the
asylum claim was refused by the Home Secretary, leave to remain was granted. In
that event, the continued presence of the claimant would be lawful and there
would be no occasion for an appeal under section 82, under which the question
of refugee status could be determined. The issue of refugee status is
significant, because some legal consequences flow from it if it is held to exist.
It was not that uncommon for those whose asylum claims failed nevertheless to
be granted limited leave to remain; a simple example was unaccompanied minors
who were and are very often granted leave to remain until they reach the age of
majority, in order to avoid removing children who have no sufficient family or
other support: see <i>TN (Afghanistan) v Secretary of State for the Home
Department </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/40.html">[2015] UKSC 40</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/40.html">[2015] 1 WLR 3083</a><i>.</i></p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Section 83, however, provided a specific right of appeal against a
refusal of an asylum claim, in specified circumstances. It said:</a></p><a name="para4">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“83.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appeal: asylum claim</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This section applies
where a person has made an asylum claim and -</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his claim has been
rejected by the Secretary of State, but</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he has been granted
leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom for a period exceeding one year
(or for periods exceeding one year in aggregate).</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The person may appeal to
the Tribunal against the rejection of his asylum claim.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para4"></a><a name="para5">5.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellant is a citizen of Uganda. On 27 September 2010 he was
granted limited leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a student until 30
April 2012. Before that time had expired, he applied for a variation of his
leave to remain on the grounds that he should be accepted as a refugee. The
basis of that claim was that his brother was suspected of being involved in
terrorist activities directed against the Ugandan Government, and he claimed
that by reason of his relationship and the suspicion that he might be involved
with his brother, he faced a real risk of persecution if he were to be
returned. On 7 February 2012 the Secretary of State rejected the claim and
refused to vary the limited leave to remain, but she did not curtail it. Thus
the appellant had, at the time that his asylum claim was refused, about 11
weeks or so left of his limited student leave to remain.</a></p><a name="para5">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para5"></a><a name="para6">6.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal, where his claim to
refugee status was refused on the merits without any question of jurisdiction
being raised and apparently on the unspoken assumption that the appeal was
brought under section 82. When, however, he pursued his case to the Upper
Tribunal, contending that the First-tier decision was perverse, the
jurisdiction point was taken before Upper Tribunal Judge Clive Lane. He held
that there had never been any right of appeal, and for that reason declined to
investigate the case further. On further appeal, the Court of Appeal came to
the same conclusion.</a></p><a name="para6">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para6"></a><a name="para7">7.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The question is a shortly-stated one of statutory construction. The
rival arguments were developed on both sides with exemplary elegance and
concision. As often happens, the brevity with which the issue can be identified
does not reflect the intrinsic difficulty of resolving it.</a></p><a name="para7">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para7"></a><a name="para8">8.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellant’s case runs as follows.</a></p><a name="para8">

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">i)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Section 83 gives a general right of appeal to those whose claim to
refugee status has been refused.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">ii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The limitation upon that right of appeal constituted by subsection (1)(b)
should be broadly rather than narrowly construed, since refugee status is a
matter of significance and engages this country’s international obligations to
permit a properly qualified claimant to exercise the rights secured by the
Convention. Nor should a construction be adopted which restricts the
appellant’s right of access to the tribunal.</p>

</span>The natural meaning of section 83 is that any grant(s) of leave to
remain totalling more than 12 months bring the claimant within the section and
afford him the right of appeal. It matters not whether the grant of leave to
remain came before or after the refusal of the asylum claim. Indeed, a grant or
grants which had expired before the asylum claim was made would also do so.</p>

</span>The alternative construction advanced by the Secretary of State and
upheld by the Court of Appeal, namely that subsection (1)(b) applies only to
grant(s) of leave to remain made <b>after</b> the refusal of the asylum claim
would be tantamount to making the right of appeal hinge on the leave to remain
decision rather than, as it is clearly designed to do, on the decision to
refuse asylum.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Secretary of State supports the conclusion of both the Upper
Tribunal and the Court of Appeal that the true construction of section 83
requires the grant(s) of leave to remain to be either contemporaneous with or
to post-date the refusal of the asylum claim. That, she contends, is also
consistent with the purpose of the statute which she asserts is to provide an
appeal to those who have no section 82 appeal and will not have such in the
reasonably near future. She also suggests that the wider structure of the NIAA
supports this construction, in particular sections 78, 94 and 83A, which are
considered below.</a></p><a name="para9">

</span>As the submissions were developed in oral argument it became apparent
that there are four possible constructions of section 83:</a></p><a name="para10">

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(i)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>any grant(s) of leave to remain totalling more than 12 months bring the
claimant within the section, whenever they occurred and whether or not they had
expired before the asylum claim was made and determined; this was the
appellant’s primary case;</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(ii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>grant(s) of leave to remain totalling more than 12 months bring the
claimant within the section providing such leave is still current at the time
of the determination of the asylum claim; this was the appellant’s alternative
position;</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(iii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>grant(s) of leave to remain bring the claimant within the section
providing that such leave totalled more than 12 months counting from the date
of refusal or later grant, and whether the grant(s) were made before or after
refusal; this was the alternative contention of the Secretary of State if her
principal one ((iv) below) failed;</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="text-indent:0cm">(iv)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>grant(s) of leave to remain totalling more than 12 months bring the
claimant within the section if but only if they (and all of them if more than
one) are either contemporaneous with or post-date the determination of the
asylum claim; this was the Secretary of State’s primary case and was adopted by
the Upper Tribunal and the Court of Appeal.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At one time in the past the Secretary of State contended in cases
concerning section 83 that the wording used demanded that there be a nexus
between the refusal of the asylum claim and the grant of more than 12 months’
limited leave. In other words, it was contended that the one must be logically
connected to the other. That contention was rejected by Beatson J, as he then
was, at first instance in <i>AS (Somalia) v Secretary of State for the Home
Department </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2011/627.html">[2011] EWHC 627 (Admin)</a>. In that case, AS had arrived as an
unaccompanied minor. He had made two asylum claims. The first had been rejected
in November 2006 but he had been granted limited leave to remain for approximately
four months until he was 18. Subsequently, he applied to extend that leave, and
in addition made a second claim to be adjudged a refugee. The second asylum
claim was never determined but the claimant was, three years after it was made,
granted indefinite leave to remain. Thus there was no more than 12 months’
leave associated with the first refusal of asylum, and no refusal of asylum
associated with the much later grant of indefinite leave. The judge held that
AS was within section 83 and on appeal the Secretary of State abandoned the
argument to the contrary. The Court of Appeal <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2011/1319.html">[2011] EWCA Civ 1319</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2011/1345.html">[2012] INLR</a> 332 (per Sullivan LJ) rightly recorded at para 17 that this was plainly
correct. The fact that section 83 brings within its provisions the case of
multiple grants of leave totalling 12 months shows that there does not have to
be a nexus between the refusal of asylum and the grant(s). In the present case,
Mr Eadie QC for the Secretary of State correctly disclaimed the argument for
“nexus”. To the extent that the Upper Tribunal in the present case, giving
judgment without sight of <i>AS (Somalia)</i>, founded in part on the need for
nexus, it was wrong.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para12">12.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It was common ground before us that there are three differences to
record between section 82 appeals and those under section 83. They were
succinctly summarised by Elias LJ at para 14 in the Court of Appeal as follows:</a></p><a name="para12">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“First, the Secretary of State may
certify a claim [under section 82] as clearly unfounded under section 94, and
where she does this it precludes any in-country right of appeal. This does not
apply to an asylum rejection under section 83. Second, section 96 allows the
Secretary of State to prevent repetitious appeals if the grounds advanced ought
to have been made in response to an earlier decision. Again, this power can
only be exercised with respect to section 82 appeals and does not apply to
section 83 appeals. Third, by section 78, where an appeal is lodged under
section 82, the appellant may not be removed until it is determined. That benefit
does not extend to appeals under section 83.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para12"></a><a name="para13">13.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is convenient also to note the adjacent section 83A, which was added
into NIAA 2002 by section 1 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act
2006. Section 83A provides for the related case of a person who was originally
granted asylum as a refugee but has subsequently been held to have ceased to be
such, for example because conditions have changed in his home country. Section
83A reads as follows:</a></p><a name="para13">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This section applies
where -</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a person has made an
asylum claim, </p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he was granted limited
leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom as a refugee within the meaning
of the Refugee Convention,</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a decision is made that
he is not a refugee, and</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:108.0pt">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; following the decision
specified in para (c) he has limited leave to enter or remain in the United
Kingdom otherwise than as a refugee.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para13"></a><a name="para14">14.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is true that section 83 can, as a matter of language, be read in a
number of different ways. It is, however, not the most natural reading of it to
construe subsection (1)(b) as if it read “he has been granted <b>at any time,
now or in the past</b>, leave to enter or remain …”, as construction (i) would
entail. Nor to my mind is it the most natural reading of the words that
subsection (1)(b) must be taken as if it said “he has <b>subsequently</b> been
granted leave to enter or remain …”, as construction (iv) would require. Section
83 appears to focus on the time when the asylum claim has been rejected, for it
is concerned with appeals against this decision, and then to ask whether, when
a claimant wishes to appeal, the condition in subsection (1)(b) is met.</a></p><a name="para14">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para14"></a><a name="para15">15.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This characteristic of section 83 suggests that it is concerned with
grants of leave to remain which are operative after the refusal of asylum, but
not with those which have existed in the past but which are spent before any
question of asylum arises. On its face, however, the section (1)(b) condition of
having been granted more than 12 months leave might be met by a grant or grants
which came before the refusal of asylum, as well as by ones which came
afterwards.</a></p><a name="para15">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para15"></a><a name="para16">16.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The principal difficulty in the way of the appellant’s foundation
argument for his alternative submissions arises from the form and content of
section 83. That section does not, as is suggested, first create a general
right of appeal against refusal of asylum, and then make that right subject to
a limitation contained in subsection (1)(b). Subsection (1)(b) is not a
limitation of the right of appeal. Rather, it is a condition for the right of
appeal arising. It is a key to admission, not a partial barrier to entry. It
cannot sensibly be read as if it said that there exists a right of appeal
“unless there has been a grant or grants of limited leave to appeal totalling 12
months or less”. In particular it clearly does not apply where there is no
grant of leave at all.</a></p><a name="para16">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para16"></a><a name="para17">17.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellant’s second difficulty is that his primary case would mean
that a past and expired grant of limited leave opened the door to this appeal
against refusal of asylum when there is no conceivable reason why it should. On
construction (i) a claimant would be within section 83 if, 20 years ago, he had
been a student in the UK, enjoying a grant of limited leave to remain for
something over a year, had then left this country and had returned only
recently, on whatever basis (or none) but without more than 12 months leave to
remain, whereupon he had made an asylum claim. There would be no possible
reason why his historical experience of lawful residence for over 12 months should
have any bearing at all on whether he had a separate right of appeal under
section 83, as distinct from having only the same right that most asylum
claimants have, namely to raise his refugee claim in a section 82 appeal. Mr
Biggs realistically did not advance the argument which has been ventilated at
earlier stages in this or other cases, namely that the history of previous
lawful residence is meant to bring such a claimant within section 83 on the
grounds that it demonstrates some connection with the UK and a consequent claim
on a preferential procedure. There appears no conceivable reason why Parliament
should have meant to provide a claimant in this position with a separate
section 83 right of appeal. An expired grant of leave fell to be considered in <i>R
(Omondi) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2009/827.html">[2009] EWHC 827 (Admin)</a> and Judge Ockelton, sitting as a deputy judge of the High Court, drawing
on marked experience of immigration practicalities, reached the same
conclusion.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para18">18.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Construction (ii) suffers from the same difficulty, albeit less acutely.
There appears to be no sensible reason why historic grant(s) of leave to remain
totalling more than 12 months should import the right to appeal under section
83 if they are largely spent by the time of the refusal of asylum, and thus, as
at that time, the 12-month condition is not met.</a></p><a name="para18">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para18"></a><a name="para19">19.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Conversely, the difficulty with construction (iv) is that it would treat
differently two people whose cases are materially the same. A claimant whose
asylum claim was rejected but who, a week or so later, was granted 18 months’
leave to remain, would be within section 83 and have its right of appeal
against the asylum decision. A second claimant, who had been granted two years’
leave to remain six months before his asylum claim was rejected, would not. But
as at the refusal of asylum their positions in relation to leave to remain
would be effectively identical. There appears no reason why Parliament should
have intended this result.</a></p><a name="para19">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para19"></a><a name="para20">20.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr Biggs suggested another case in which, if construction (iv) were
correct, section 83 would, undesirably, cease to afford a right of appeal. That
is the case of indefinite leave to remain granted before the refusal of asylum.
In such a case, on construction (iv) there would never be an opportunity to
take the refusal of asylum to appeal and to establish refugee status. How
likely that case is may possibly be open to enquiry, but it would indeed fail
construction (iv). On the other hand, a grant of indefinite leave to remain
made after the refusal of asylum would bring the section 83 right of appeal,
because plainly indefinite leave is for a period exceeding one year. There is
no obvious reason for the difference between the two cases.</a></p><a name="para20">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para20"></a><a name="para21">21.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The purpose of section 83 is tolerably clear. It is to provide an
additional - and more targeted - right of appeal beyond the ordinary one
created by section 82. It is to provide a vehicle for the determination by the
tribunal of refugee status, when that status is asserted but rejected by the
Secretary of State, in those cases where no such vehicle otherwise exists, nor
will exist within a reasonable time. In the straightforward case of an asylum
claim which is rejected and no other basis for remaining in the UK exists,
there will follow a removal decision which generates a right of appeal under
section 82, and on that appeal the claimant will succeed if he shows that he is
entitled to refugee status. In the case of a person, such as an unaccompanied
minor, whose asylum claim is refused, but who is granted a short period of
leave to remain, there will in the relatively near future either be a further
grant of leave to remain or there will be a refusal of it and a decision to
remove. At that foreseeably proximate stage, there will, unless leave is
extended, again arise a right of appeal under section 82 in which refugee
status, if established, will guarantee success. Section 83 is designed to
create an extra right of appeal for those who have a longer period of leave to
remain and who would otherwise have no section 82 vehicle which they could use.
As Upper Tribunal Judge Clive Lane concisely put it in the Upper Tribunal,
section 83 is aimed at this class of applicant, so that he should not be
deprived of his right to challenge the refusal of his asylum claim where that
refusal is not accompanied by a decision to remove him. In <i>FA (Iraq) v
Secretary of State for the Home Department</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2010/696.html">[2010] EWCA Civ 696</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2010/696.html">[2010] 1 WLR 2545</a>, paras 13 and 30 both Longmore and Pill LJJ expressed the same idea
when they observed that section 83 was aimed at people in whose cases the
Secretary of State would not be reconsidering the immigration position in the
near future. In <i>TN (Afghanistan) </i>at para 32<i>, </i>Lord Toulson
referred to the additional consideration that where conditions in the home
country may be fluctuating rapidly, it makes good sense for tribunals not to
become clogged with cases which are due to be reviewed before long in any
event.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para22">22.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Once that is understood, it is clear that the construction which most
nearly serves the purpose of the statute is construction (iii). That focuses on
identifying those claimants in whose cases there will not be a section 82
vehicle for an appeal on refugee status for longer than the 12-month period
which Parliament has set as the relevant one. Thus the claimant may avail
himself of section 83 if he has limited leave totalling more than 12 months
counting from the date of refusal or, if later, the date of grant (or, a
fortiori, if he has been granted indefinite leave). That is so whether or not
his leave started before the refusal, and whether his leave is the result of a
single grant or of more than one. If, however, when he seeks to appeal, any
current leave has 12 months or less to run from the date of refusal of the
asylum claim, or from a later grant, then he is left to his section 82 appeal
in due course.</a></p><a name="para22">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para22"></a><a name="para23">23.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Conversely, neither construction (i) nor (ii) serves the purpose of the
provision at all. Both would bring within section 83 those who do not need it,
because there will, within a relatively short time, be a further decision of
the kind which, if it involves an end to leave to remain, will bring with it a
right to appeal under section 82, whilst if it extends leave to more than 12
months from refusal the claimant can take advantage of section 83. Construction
(iv) would serve this statutory purpose, but would, as explained above, leave
out some whose case falls within that purpose.</a></p><a name="para23">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para23"></a><a name="para24">24.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Likewise, once this purpose is understood, the statutory structure under
which sections 78 and 94 do not apply to appeals under section 83 falls into
place. There is no need for the suspensive rule of section 78 because the
claimant is lawfully in the UK. There is no adverse decision, under which he
becomes unlawfully present, which calls for suspension. Nor, for the same
reason, is there the same need for certification of claims as unfounded. True,
the view might have been taken that a manifestly unfounded asylum claim could
be certifiable to avoid time and expense on an appeal to the tribunal, but
there would not be the same prolongation of unlawful residence which appears to
be the basis of the power to certify, and it makes perfectly good sense for the
determination of the asylum appeal to be left to the tribunal, even if it has
no merit. On the other hand, as the Secretary of State contended, these
provisions would be necessary if section 83 brought within its terms a person
whose grant(s) of leave to remain were historic and either spent or soon to be
spent, for he would indeed be (or about to be) unlawfully present in this
country. To that extent, the structure of the Act outside the precise terms of
section 83 provides some further support for saying that constructions (i) and
(ii) are not correct.</a></p><a name="para24">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para24"></a><a name="para25">25.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The fact that the provisions of section 96 for prevention of repetitious
appeals do not apply to an appeal within section 83 is no indication to the
contrary. As was pointed out in both the Administrative Court and the Court of
Appeal in <i>AS (Somalia), </i>where one of the claimants had previously made
an unsuccessful asylum claim, the making of an unmeritorious second claim by a
claimant who is lawfully here, whilst it is to be discouraged, is not to be
equated with the kind of desperate application which is likely to be made by
those who are under threat of removal, and it does not stand in the same need
of active measures to prevent it. Moreover, since a tribunal considering a
second asylum claim will, in accordance with <i>Devaseelan v Secretary of State
for the Home Department </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKIAT/2002/00702.html">[2002] UKIAT 702</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKIAT/2002/00702.html">[2003] Imm AR 1</a>, begin by
assuming the correctness of the first decision and thus look for fresh or
different considerations not previously assessed, an undeserving second claim need
not detain the appellate system for an unacceptable time. That was Mr
Ockelton’s view in <i>Abiyat (rights of appeal) Iran </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKUT/IAC/2011/00314_ukut_iac_2011_ha_others_iran.html">[2011] UKUT 00314 (IAC)</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2011/1345.html">[2012] INLR</a> 131, a view endorsed by Sullivan LJ in <i>AS (Somalia) </i>at
para 40.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para26">26.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Next, the absence of any need for a “nexus” between refusal of asylum
and the grant(s) of leave to remain (as confirmed in <i>AS (Somalia)</i>) tends
somewhat to support construction (iii) and to counter construction (iv). That
is because it demonstrates that it is the existence of leave of the prescribed
length, at the relevant time, rather than the date on which it was granted,
which matters.</a></p><a name="para26">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para26"></a><a name="para27">27.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeal in the present case also drew attention to the
conjunctive “but” which links subparagraph (a) to subparagraph (b),
distinguishing it from the “and” which might have been used. The Secretary of
State supported this argument, contending that the use of “but” indicated a
requirement that the grant(s) of leave must come at the same time or after the
refusal of asylum, and thus supported construction (iv). Whilst it is true that
“and” would not be so open to this argument, as a matter of syntax “but” does
not necessarily mean “subsequent to”; it may simply be used to mean “however”,
or “although” and thus to be neutral on the timing of the grant(s).</a></p><a name="para27">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para27"></a><a name="para28">28.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Nor, to my mind, do the terms of section 83A provide support to the
Secretary of State’s argument for construction (iv). First, it is not in any
event safe to use a subsequently drafted section to construe a statutory
provision which was written some years earlier. That is different from
considering adjacent sections produced by the same author contemporaneously. Second,
the use of the word “following” in subparagraph (d) does not necessarily
connote a subsequent grant. Section 83A requires that following the refusal,
the claimant shall be the beneficiary of leave to remain. It focuses, as does
section 83, on what his position is as at the refusal of leave and thereafter,
but not on when the grant was made. The use in subparagraph (d) of the words
“has leave”, rather than “is granted leave” tends to confirm this and to point
away from insistence on subsequent grant.</a></p><a name="para28">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para28"></a><a name="para29">29.

</span>These several additional reasons all support what is both a natural
reading of section 83 and most consistent with its purpose, namely that the
proper construction is (iii), as explained in para 22 above. Since the remaining
period of leave which the present appellant enjoyed was well short of the period
of more than 12 months from refusal of his asylum claim required by section 83,
he did not fall within the section. It follows that the appeal must be
dismissed, although not quite for the reasons given by the Court of Appeal. It,
like the Upper Tribunal in <i>Win (section 83 - order of events)</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKUT/IAC/2012/00365_ukut_iac_2012_kzw_myanmar.html">[2012] UKUT 365 (IAC)</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKUT/IAC/2012/00365_ukut_iac_2012_kzw_myanmar.html">[2013] Imm AR 154</a> went further than it should have done by
adopting construction (iv); it is not clear that construction (iii) was put
before either court, and the appellants in both cases failed to meet the test
whichever was adopted.</p>
