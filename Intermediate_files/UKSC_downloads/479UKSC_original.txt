<p class="NewSpeech">LORD HODGE: (<span style="text-transform:none">with whom
Lord Mance, Lord Sumption and Lord Toulson agree)</span></p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1">1.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This appeal is concerned with the interpretation of a solicitors’
professional indemnity insurance policy (“the Policy”) written by AIG Europe
Ltd (“AIG”). It raises a legal question of general public importance both
because it concerns a term of an insurance policy, which is, or is similar to,
terms in all professional indemnity insurance policies for solicitors in
England and Wales, and also because it is important to the business model by
which many solicitors have funded litigation since state-funded legal aid for
civil cases was significantly reduced.</a></p><a name="para1">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para1"></a><a name="para2">2.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As described more fully below, the respondent, Impact Funding Solutions
Ltd (“Impact”) entered into an arrangement with solicitors, Barrington Support
Services Ltd (“Barrington”), by which Impact, by entering into loan agreements with
Barrington’s clients, provided funds to Barrington to hold on behalf of its
clients and to use to make disbursements in the conduct of its clients’
litigation in pursuit of damages for industrial deafness. Barrington failed to
perform its professional duties towards its clients in the conduct of
litigation, both through its failure adequately and timeously to investigate
the merits of their claims and also through the misapplication of funds
provided by Impact, and so breached its duty of care to them. Barrington
thereby put itself in breach of a warranty in its contract with Impact that it
would perform its professional duties towards its clients. Barrington’s clients
were not able to repay their loans. Impact sought to recover from Barrington
the losses which it suffered on those loans by seeking damages for the breach
of the warranty. In an admirable judgment dated 30 May 2013, His Honour Judge
Waksman QC awarded Impact damages of £581,353.80, which represented the
principal elements of the loans which would not have been made if Barrington
had not breached its contract with Impact. On Barrington’s insolvency, Impact
seeks in this action to recover those losses from Barrington’s professional
indemnity insurers, AIG, under the Third Parties (Rights against Insurers) Act
1930.</a></p><a name="para2">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para2"></a><a name="para3">3.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In another impressive judgment dated 13 December 2013 His Honour Judge
Waksman QC analysed the nature of the arrangements between Impact and
Barrington and, construing the words of the Policy, held that Impact’s claim
against AIG for an indemnity failed. Impact appealed to the Court of Appeal. In
a judgment dated 3 February 2015 the Court of Appeal, </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2015/31.html">[2015] 4 All ER 319</a>; <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2015/31.html">[2016] Bus LR 91</a> allowed the appeal. The Court of Appeal, by standing back from the
detail and asking itself what was the essential purpose of the exclusion clause
in question, concluded that the loans which Impact gave to cover disbursements
in intended litigation were inherently part of the solicitors’ professional
practice and that the liabilities which Barrington incurred under its
warranties to Impact were liabilities professionally incurred which came within
the cover of the Policy. AIG appeals to this court.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para4">4.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Impact supports the conclusion which the Court of Appeal reached. It
refers to the wide terms of the cover (para 8 below) and submits that the
subsequent exclusions (para 10 below) should be construed strictly. In
particular, the fact that Barrington obtained a commercial benefit from its
agreement with Impact did not mean that Impact was providing services to
Barrington within the terms of the exclusion. I do not accept that this is the
correct way to read the exclusion clause in this insurance contract and set out
my reasons below.</a></p><a name="para4">

<p class="ParaHeading">Questions of construction</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para4"></a><a name="para5">5.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In determining the appeal, the court has, first, to construe the
relevant terms of the Policy against its factual matrix and, secondly, to construe
the relevant terms of the disbursements funding master agreement (“DFMA”)
between Impact and Barrington once again against its factual matrix.</a></p><a name="para5">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para5"></a><a name="para6">6.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This approach to construction is well established. The court looks to
the meaning of the relevant words in their documentary, factual and commercial
context: <i>Rainy Sky SA v Kookmin Bank </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2011/50.html">[2011] 1 WLR 2900</a>, para 21 per Lord
Clarke of Stone-cum-Ebony; <i>Arnold v Britton </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/36.html">[2015] AC 1619</a>, para 15 per
Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury. As I see no ambiguity in the way that the Policy
defined its cover and as the exclusion clause reflected what The Law Society of
England and Wales as the regulator of the solicitors’ profession had authorised
as a limitation of professional indemnity cover, I see no role in this case for
the doctrine of interpretation contra proferentem. As Lindley LJ stated in <i>Cornish
v Accident Insurance Co Ltd </i><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpKQB/1889/136.html">(1889) 23 QBD 453</a>, 456:</p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“… in a case of real doubt, the
policy ought to be construed most strongly against the insurers; they frame the
policy and insert the exceptions. But this principle ought only to be applied
for the purpose of removing a doubt, not for the purpose of creating a doubt,
or magnifying an ambiguity, when the circumstances of the case raise no real
difficulty.”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para7">7.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The extent of AIG’s liability is a matter of contract and is ascertained
by reading together the statement of cover and the exclusions in the Policy. An
exclusion clause must be read in the context of the contract of insurance as a
whole. It must be construed in a manner which is consistent with and not
repugnant to the purpose of the insurance contract. There may be circumstances
in which in order to achieve that end, the court may construe the exclusions in
an insurance contract narrowly. The judgment of Carnwath LJ in <i>Tektrol Ltd (formerly
Atto Power Controls Ltd) v International Insurance Co of Hanover Ltd </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2005/845.html">[2006] 1 All ER (Comm) 780</a>, to which counsel for Impact referred, is an example of
that approach. But the general doctrine, to which counsel also referred, that
exemption clauses should be construed narrowly, has no application to the relevant
exclusion in this Policy. An exemption clause, to which that doctrine applies,
excludes or limits a legal liability which arises by operation of law, such as
liability for negligence or liability in contract arising by implication of

</span>Lord Brightman in <i>Swain v The Law Society </i>[1983] 1 AC 598, 618
described the context of the statutory scheme of compulsory insurance:</a></p><a name="para16">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“In exercising its power under
section 37 The Law Society is performing a public duty, a duty which is
designed to benefit, not only solicitor-principals and their staff, but also
solicitors’ clients. The scheme is not only for the protection of the premium-paying
solicitor against the financial consequences of his own mistakes, the mistakes
of his partners and the mistakes of his staff, but also, and far more
importantly, to secure that the solicitor is financially able to compensate his
client. Indeed, I think it is clear that the principal purpose of section 37
was to confer on The Law Society the power to safeguard the lay public and not
professional practitioners, since the latter can look after themselves.”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Thomas J took the same view in <i>Kumar v AGF Insurance Ltd </i>[1999] 1
WLR 1747, 1752A-C, where he said that one must approach the construction of
this sort of professional indemnity policy against the regulatory background
which aimed to make sure that protection was provided to the clients of
solicitors. As a general rule, solicitors, when performing work on behalf of
their clients, owe no duty of care to third parties whose interests are
affected by that work: <i>White v Jones </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1995/5.html">[1995] 2 AC 207</a>, 256C-D per Lord
Goff of Chieveley. It is, nonetheless, well known and not disputed in this case
that the professional indemnity policy protected not only clients of the
solicitors but also those third parties to whom solicitors have been held to
owe duties of care in their performance of legal services and to whom they have
incurred liability in negligence, such as those who have acted in reliance on
negligent misstatements or beneficiaries disappointed as a result of negligence
in the preparation or execution of a will. In addition, as Lord Toulson points
out (para 42), solicitors’ professional liability may include undertakings
given to third parties in the course of acting for their clients.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A reader of the Policy ascertains the boundaries of AIG’s liability by
construing the broad statement of cover (para 8 above) and also the broad
exclusions (para 10 above) in the context of the regulatory background. The exclusion
in para 10 above requires the reader to look to the category of the claim and,
in this case, ask whether the claim or loss arises out of, is based upon, or is
attributable to a breach by Barrington of a term or terms of a contract or
arrangement for the supply of services to it in the course of its provision of
legal services. Prima facie, if Impact’s cause of action was a breach of a term
of a contract or arrangement by which Impact supplied such services to
Barrington, the clause would exclude cover, notwithstanding that Impact’s loss
could be said to have arisen from Barrington’s failure to perform legal
services for its clients. Two questions therefore arise: the first is whether
the contract between Impact and Barrington was of such a nature; the second is
whether it is necessary to imply a restriction into the relevant exclusion
clause limiting its effect in order to make it consistent with the purpose of
the Policy.</a></p><a name="para18">

<p class="ParaHeading">The Disbursements Funding Master Agreement</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para18"></a><a name="para19">19.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Barrington entered into two successive DFMAs with Impact, dated 8 June
2007 and 10 March 2008. The relevant terms of the two agreements were in
substance the same. Like Judge Waksman and the Court of Appeal, I refer in my
discussion below to the 2008 DFMA.</a></p><a name="para19">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para19"></a><a name="para20">20.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In order to understand the provisions of the DFMA it is necessary to
present that contract in its commercial context. It formed part of a scheme by
which clients who did not qualify for legal aid and who could not otherwise
afford to litigate were provided with access to legal services to pursue claims
without exposing them to financial risk. Normally a client who has not got
legal aid has to pay (a) fees to the instructed solicitor for legal services,
(b) that solicitor’s disbursements, and (c) in the event that the claim fails,
the other side’s recoverable legal costs. A significant proportion of (a) and
(b) may be recovered from the other side if the claim succeeds. But the failure
of the claim is a serious financial risk. Under the scheme, the instructed
solicitor’s fees were covered by a conditional fee agreement (“CFA”), which was
authorised initially by section 58 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990,
by which the client paid for the lawyer’s work only if the case was won and the
client received compensation. The client, by taking out a legal expenses
insurance policy, obtained indemnity against the other side’s legal costs, his
or her own solicitor’s disbursements and the premium paid on the policy in the
event that the claim failed. While the claim was being pursued, the solicitor
would have to disburse funds, for example to obtain GP records and medical
reports. Unless otherwise funded, the solicitor had either to obtain funds in
advance from the client or spend his or her own funds and later obtain
reimbursement from the client. Impact provided funding for such disbursements
through the DFMA.</a></p><a name="para20">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para20"></a><a name="para21">21.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Judge Waksman described how the funding scheme operated in paras 5 to 18
of his judgment dated 13 December 2013. I can therefore summarise the
arrangements briefly. Claims management companies identified potential
claimants. A company, which was associated with Impact, operated a data
management and administration system called Veracity. Claims management
companies put details of potential claims onto Veracity and solicitors,
including Barrington, would access Veracity to assess particular claims and
either accept or reject a claim. Before accepting a claim, solicitors ought to
have verified the information provided through Veracity and investigated the
merits of the claim so as to enable them to enter into a CFA and to enable
legal expenses insurance to be obtained.</a></p><a name="para21">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para21"></a><a name="para22">22.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If the solicitors provisionally accepted a claim, Veracity required them
to indicate whether they required Impact to provide a loan to the client to
cover disbursements and the premium on the legal expenses insurance. The
solicitors provided the relevant details so that Veracity could calculate the
amount of the loan. Veracity then automatically generated a draft loan
agreement and sent an email to the relevant claims management company
instructing them to progress the matter. The claims management company, as the
solicitors’ agent, took a package of documents for the lay client to sign. The
pack included an engagement letter, the CFA release forms, data protection
documentation, the loan agreement with Impact and the proposal for the legal
expenses insurance. Once executed, the documents would be sent to the
solicitors who would forward the executed loan agreement to Impact. Once the
solicitors confirmed that they accepted the claim, the legal expenses insurers
were notified that the claim should be put on cover. On obtaining the insurers’
confirmation, the solicitors would draw down Impact’s loan to pay disbursements
and to pay the balance into the solicitors’ client account to fund future
disbursements. The legal expenses insurance policies required (a) that the
claim had to be assessed as having a reasonable prospect of success, which in one
policy was stated as 55%, and (b) that there remained in force a valid CFA.</a></p><a name="para22">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para22"></a><a name="para23">23.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This arrangement was reflected in the first recital of the DFMA which
stated:</a></p><a name="para23">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Impact] facilitates the
presentation of PI claims to solicitors through its online claims introduction
and tracking service, Veracity and provides funding for disbursements under
Credit Agreements in respect of those PI Claims”.</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para23"></a><a name="para24">24.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In clause 2.1 Impact offered credit facilities to clients selected by
Barrington in its discretion, up to a specified aggregate sum, but, being a
framework agreement, did not commit Impact to advance any sums. If Impact
advanced sums to a client, Barrington was obliged by clause 2.2 to pay an
administration fee to Impact on Impact’s execution of each credit agreement and
also a quarterly monitoring fee. The “Administration Fee” was defined in the
DFMA (clause 1) as:</a></p><a name="para24">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“a fee in respect of each Credit
Agreement in the sum as notified by [Impact] to the Firm from time to time and
payable by the Firm, together with Value Added Tax (if applicable) by way of
remuneration for the services of [Impact].”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para24"></a><a name="para25">25.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The DFMA contained undertakings by each party about how each would
behave during the currency of the agreement. Impact founds its claim against
Barrington on clauses 6.1 and 13.1 of the DFMA. In clause 6.1 each party
undertook that:</a></p><a name="para25">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“it shall comply with all
applicable laws, regulations and codes of practice from time to time in force …
and each party indemnifies the other against all loss, damages, claims, costs
and expenses … which the other party may suffer or incur as a result of any
breach by it of this undertaking.”</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para25"></a><a name="para26">26.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In clause 13.1 Barrington represented and warranted to Impact that:</a></p><a name="para26">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“the services provided or to be
provided by the Firm to the Customer shall be provided to the Customer in
accordance with their agreement with the Customer as set out in the relevant
Conditional Fee Agreement.”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Judge Waksman held that Barrington, by failing to give advice and
properly to assess the merits of the compensation claims, breached those
provisions of the DFMA. That finding has not been challenged.</a></p><a name="para27">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para27"></a><a name="para28">28.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Barrington also undertook personal liability to repay the loans which
Impact made to its clients. In clause 7.1 Barrington undertook to pay to Impact
the sums due by the client under the credit agreement out of the client’s
damages under the claim or (in the event of the claim failing) out of the legal
expenses insurance. More onerously, in clause 7.2 Barrington undertook to pay
to Impact all sums due by the customer under the credit agreement (ie the client)
if the customer breached the credit agreement, if circumstances arose that
entitled Impact to terminate the credit agreement or if the credit agreement
was unenforceable as a result of an act or omission by Barrington.</a></p><a name="para28">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para28"></a><a name="para29">29.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The provision of loans to Barrington’s clients as envisaged by the DFMA
was undoubtedly the provision of financial services to the clients. But were
the DFMA and the resulting loans to clients also a service which Impact
provided to Barrington? In my view they were, for the following four reasons.
First, Barrington contracted as a principal with Impact and not as agent for
its clients. A contract between two principals might have provided for a
service to be given to a third party alone. But that is not what happened in
this contract. This is because, secondly, Barrington clearly obtained a benefit
from the funding of its disbursements. Solicitors are personally responsible
for paying the persons whom they instruct to do work or provide services in
relation to a particular case, whether or not they receive funds from their
clients. But for that funding from Impact, Barrington would have had to obtain
funds from its clients, who might not have been able to afford to pay, thus
making pursuit of the claim impossible, unless Barrington itself funded the
disbursements in the hope of recovering its outlays through success in the
claim. Impact’s loans were available to fund not only the disbursements but
also the premiums on the legal expenses insurance, thereby enabling the
litigation to be fully funded. Thirdly, this was not an incidental or
collateral benefit to Barrington derived from a service provided to its clients
but was part of a wider arrangement which I have described in paras 20-22
above, by which solicitors were able to take up claims, which their clients
could not otherwise fund, and earn fees and success fees if the claim
succeeded. Fourthly, it was a service for which Barrington paid the
administration fee under clause 2 of the DFMA, undertook the onerous obligation
to repay Impact if a client breached the credit agreement (clause 7.2), and
entered into the obligation under clause 6.1 and gave the warranty in clause
13.1, on which Impact won its claim for damages against Barrington.</a></p><a name="para29">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para29"></a><a name="para30">30.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I therefore conclude that the DFMA was a contract for the supply of
services to Barrington. Impact contracted to supply those services to
Barrington in the course of Barrington’s provision of legal services. Impact’s
claim against Barrington arose out of the latter’s breach of that contract.
Prima facie, therefore, the exclusion which I have set out in para 10 above
applies to defeat Impact’s claim against AIG, unless there is a basis for
implying a restriction into that exclusion. I turn then to that question.</a></p><a name="para30">

<p class="ParaHeading">Can one imply a restriction on the exclusion?</p>

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para30"></a><a name="para31">31.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I see no basis for implying additional words into the exclusion in order
to limit its scope. In <i>Marks and Spencer plc v BNP Paribas Securities
Services Trust Co (Jersey) Ltd </i></a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/72.html">[2016] AC 742</a> this court confirmed that a
term would be implied into a detailed contract only if, on an objective
assessment of the terms of the contract, the term to be implied was necessary
to give the contract business efficacy or was so obvious that it went without
saying (paras 15-31 per Lord Neuberger). This court also held that the express
terms of the contract must be interpreted before one can consider any question
of implication (para 28).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para32">32.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In my view, it cannot be said that the Policy would lack commercial or
practical coherence if a term restricting the scope of the exclusion were not
implied. In the present case it is fairly said that the breach of duty in the
warranty on which Impact relies is a breach of duty by Barrington to its
clients. But Impact’s claim is not a claim which is derived from the clients’
claims. Defences which Barrington might be able to plead against its clients
cannot be advanced against Impact. For example, if a client were careless in
informing Barrington of the circumstances of the injury on which his or her
claim was based, and Barrington also was negligent in failing properly to
investigate and prosecute the claim, which then failed, the client’s claim
might be met with a defence of contributory negligence. No such defence would
arise out of those circumstances in relation to a claim by Impact against
Barrington. Thus Impact’s entitlement under the warranty would not be the same
as the client’s claim in all cases and might be larger in some cases. In short,
Impact’s cause of action under the DFMA is an independent cause of action.
Excluding such a claim creates no incoherence in the Policy, as it is the
combination of the opening clause and the exclusions that delimits AIG’s
contractual liability. Indeed, it would be consistent with the purpose of the
Policy suggested by the context, which I discussed in paras 16 and 17 above, if
such a claim were excluded from that liability.</a></p><a name="para32">

</span>Under the Third Parties (Rights against Insurers) Act 1930, Impact is
entitled to enforce any right of indemnity which Barrington had against AIG in
respect of the judgment which Impact obtained against Barrington. Impact’s
argument that Barrington was entitled to such indemnity under its professional
liability policy, which AIG underwrote, is founded on two propositions. First,
it is argued that the clause relied on by AIG to deny liability is an exclusion
clause, which must be narrowly construed in accordance with ordinary principles
of contract law. Secondly, it is argued that the exclusion is well capable of
being interpreted in a way which does not exclude cover under the policy. Both
points are important. The first raises a point of general importance about the
proper approach to the interpretation of a professional liability policy which
is of a familiar kind. The second is important because the particular clause is
a standard form of wording in solicitors’ professional liability policies. I
take the points in turn.</a></p><a name="para34">

</span>The fact that a provision in a contract is expressed as an exception
does not necessarily mean that it should be approached with a pre-disposition
to construe it narrowly. Like any other provision in a contract, words of
exception or exemption must be read in the context of the contract as a whole
and with due regard for its purpose. As a matter of general principle, it is
well established that that if one party, otherwise liable, wishes to exclude or
limit his liability to the other party, he must do so in clear words; and that
the contract should be given the meaning it would convey to a reasonable person
having all the background knowledge which is reasonably available to the person
or class of persons to whom the document is addressed. (See, among many
authorities, <i>Dairy Containers Ltd v Tasman Orient Line CV</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKPC/2004/22.html">[2005] 1 WLR 215</a>, para 12, per Lord Bingham.) This applies not only where the words of
exception remove a remedy for breach, but where they seek to prevent a
liability from arising by removing, through a subsidiary provision, part of the
benefit which it appears to have been the purpose of the contract to provide. The
vice of a clause of that kind is that it can have a propensity to mislead,
unless its language is sufficiently plain. All that said, words of exception
may be simply a way of delineating the scope of the primary obligation.</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission gave a homely
illustration in their joint report on Exemption Clauses, 1975, Law Com No 69,
para 143:</a></p><a name="para36">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“If a decorator agrees to paint
the outside woodwork of a house except the garage doors, no-one can seriously
regard the words of exception as anything but a convenient way of defining the
obligation; it would surely make no difference if the promise were to paint the
outside woodwork with a clear proviso that the contractor was not obliged to
paint the garage doors, or if there were a definition clause brought to the promisee’s
attention saying that ‘outside woodwork’ did not include the garage doors. Such
provisions do not … deprive the promisee of a right of a kind which social
policy requires that he should enjoy, nor do they … give the promisor the
advantage of appearing to promise more than he is in fact promising.”</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This approach was reflected in the Law Commissions’ Bill which passed
into law as the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977. Section 3 brought under
statutory control, in cases where one party deals with the other as a consumer
or on the other’s standard terms of business, a term which excludes or
restricts the other’s liability for breach, or a term which entitles the other
“to render a contractual performance substantially different from that which
was reasonably expected of him”. The Act does not apply to insurance contracts
(Schedule 1, paragraph 1), but it is nonetheless instructive to note the types
of “exemption clause” which the Law Commissions saw as potentially suspect in
consumer contracts.</a></p><a name="para37">

</span>That brings me to the contract in the present case. The policy schedule
and the policy wording are both headed in large letters “Solicitors
Professional Liability”. Lord Hodge has set out its material terms, but it is
convenient to repeat the key parts. Under the heading “Cover” appear the words:</a></p><a name="para39">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“The Insurer will pay on behalf of
any Insured all Loss resulting from any Claim for any civil liability of the
Insured which arises from the performance or failure to perform Legal Services”
(which are themselves broadly defined).</p>

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Under the heading “Exclusions” a number of heads of claims or loss are
excluded: bodily/psychological injury; directors’ and officers’ liability;
employment breaches and discrimination; fines and penalties; fraud or
dishonesty; partnership disputes; prior claims; property damage; trade debts;
and war/terrorism. We are concerned with the clause 6.6, which in the minimum
terms is headed “Debts and Trading Liabilities”. These are defined to include
any claim or loss arising out of:</a></p><a name="para40">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“breach by any Insured of the
terms of any contract or arrangement for the supply to, or use by, any Insured

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There are two points to highlight about the nature and purpose of the
policy. One is that the relevant terms replicate the minimum terms of the cover
which Barrington was required to maintain under the Solicitors’ Indemnity
Insurance Rules 2009. As the House of Lords recognised in <i>Swain v The Law
Society</i> [1983] 1 AC 598, 610, the paramount purpose of The Law Society
being given statutory power to require solicitors to maintain insurance cover
against professional liability was “the protection of that section of the
public that makes use of the services of solicitors” (Lord Diplock). The
second, and related point, is that the policy describes itself as a
professional liability policy. These matters are important when considering its
scope.</a></p><a name="para41">

</a><p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para41"></a><a name="para42">42.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>What sort of liabilities are commonly understood as professional
liabilities of solicitors or, in Lord Diplock’s language, what is the sector of
the public that makes use of their services? First, and most obviously, there
are the liabilities which solicitors may incur to their clients as a result of
their professional retainer. Secondly, in connection with acting for their
clients, they may give undertakings to third parties. “As officers of the court
solicitors are expected to abide by undertakings given by them professionally,
and if they do not do so they may be called upon summarily to make good their
defaults” (<i>John Fox v Bannister, King &amp; Rigbeys (Note)</i> [1988] 1 QB
925, 928, per Nicholls LJ). That is plainly a form of professional liability.
Exceptionally, there are also other cases where a solicitor has been held
liable to a “quasi-client”, as in <i>White v Jones</i> (the disappointed
beneficiary under a will) </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1995/5.html">[1995] 2 AC 207</a>. There is a detailed treatment of the
scope of solicitors’ professional liability to third parties in Jackson &amp;
Powell on <i>Professional</i> <i>Liability</i>, 2011, 7th ed, paras 11-043
&amp; ff. It is a developing topic and the boundaries are not entirely clear.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><a name="para43">43.
<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In laying down the minimum terms of professional liability cover
required to be maintained by solicitors, it would have been possible for the
drafting committee to have attempted to structure them by defining in positive
terms the scope of a solicitor’s professional liability for which indemnity
cover was required, but it opted to delineate the liability against which
solicitors should be required to maintain cover for public protection by a
process of elimination, which involved combining an insuring clause far broader
than any ordinary understanding of a solicitor’s professional liability with a
list of exclusions. It is important to recognise that list for what it is,
namely an attempt to identify the types of liability against which solicitors
are not required by law to be covered by way of professional liability
insurance.</a></p><a name="para43">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I would reject the first stage of Impact’s argument about the way in
which this policy and the list of exceptions are to be approached. It treats
the minimum terms set by the Law Society as requiring, through the opening
clause, a far broader scope of cover than would have been necessary for the
protection of clients and third parties to whom they may undertake professional
responsibilities, subject only to exceptions which (it is argued) are to be
construed as narrowly as possible. That involves a misapprehension of the true
nature and purpose of the minimum terms.</a></p><a name="para44">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This brings me to the second point, which is the meaning of the language
of clause 6.6. The Court of Appeal approached the clause by saying that it was
necessary to stand back from it and consider its essential purpose. I do not
disagree, but I would make two further comments. First, the “essential purpose”
of the clause has to be seen in the context of the essential purpose of the
policy, as to which I have expressed my view. Secondly, there is substance in
AIG’s complaint that the court omitted to grapple with the language of the
clause.</a></p><a name="para45">

<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I agree with Lord Hodge that the DFMA was a contract for the provision
of services to Barrington, for the reasons given by him and by Judge Waksman QC
in his impressive judgment. I would add that this conclusion to my mind accords
well with the essential purpose of clause 6.6. Barrington and Impact made a
commercial agreement as principals for their mutual benefit, as well as for the
benefit of Barrington’s clients. Impact was not a client or quasi-client of
Barrington, and the promise by Barrington which led to the judgment obtained by
Impact was part of the commercial bargain struck by them. It did not resemble a
solicitor’s professional undertaking as ordinarily understood, and it falls
aptly within the description of a “trading liability” which the minimum terms
were not intended to cover.</a></p><a name="para46">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The issue in this appeal is a
narrow issue of construction of an exclusion clause in a solicitor’s
professional indemnity policy. The facts have been set out by Lord Hodge. As he
explains, the arrangements between the funder (“Impact”) and the solicitors
(“Barrington”) were governed by two Disbursement Funding Master Agreements
(“DFMAs”). The DFMAs were in effect framework agreements providing the
machinery for the making of loans to clients of Barrington to meet
disbursements in litigation to be funded by CFAs. In breach of its duties to
its clients, and consequently also to Impact under the DFMAs, Barrington failed
to exercise proper care in selecting cases, with the result that the
disbursements were irrecoverable, either from the defendants or the ATE or LEI
insurers. Barrington is now in liquidation. Having obtained judgment against it
for £581,353.80, Impact has brought proceedings against Barrington’s insurers,
AIG Europe Ltd (“AIG”) under the Third Parties (Rights Against Insurers) Act
1930.</span></a></p><a name="para48">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">The short question is whether the
DFMAs fell within the expression “any contract or arrangement for the supply
to, or use by, any insured of goods or services in the course of (Barrington’s)
Practice” under the exclusion clauses in the AIG policy. It is common ground
that Barrington’s liability to repay the loans made by Impact by way of
disbursements fell in principle within the general cover provided by clause 1
of that policy. The question is whether that liability is excluded by
sub-clause 6 of clause 6 of the Minimum Terms applicable to the policy:</span></a></p><a name="para49">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The insurance must not

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:26.0pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">There is a similar exclusion clause in the policy

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">In the High Court, His Honour
Judge Waksman QC, held that the exclusion applied. He accepted that Impact did
not provide “financial services” to Barrington:</span></a></p><a name="para50">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“A loan might properly be
described as a kind of financial service. But it cannot be said that by the
Funding Agreement Impact made, or agreed to make, loans to Barrington, for the
borrowers were the lay clients even if Barrington agreed to guarantee repayment
by them. Nor can it be said that the loan moneys were for the use of Barrington
in any real sense. The fact that Barrington was the conduit for the moneys and
distributed them for the purpose of paying disbursements and insurance premiums
on behalf of the clients does not mean that the moneys were for its use in any
beneficial sense.” (para 49)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:26.0pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">However, he thought that the “overall facility”
provided to the firm could properly be described as a “service” within the
meaning of the clause:</span></p>

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“Impact was making available to
Barrington a valuable facility at Barrington’s option, namely claims whose
disbursement element (including the all-important ATE insurance) was
fully-funded leaving the solicitors to provide their services under the CFA.
The fact that the funding is made by way of loans to the clients does not
affect the fact that the overall facility is provided to Barrington and it is
properly described as a ‘service’ and one which, if used, enables it to trade
by bringing in more cases.” (para 54)</p>

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Longmore LJ (with the agreement of
the other members of the Court of Appeal) took a different view. He held that
the purpose of the exclusion was more limited:</span></a></p><a name="para51">

<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left:72.0pt">“To my mind the essential purpose
of the exclusion is to prevent insurers from being liable for what one might
call liabilities of a solicitor in respect of those aspects of his practice
which affect him or her personally as opposed to liabilities arising from his
professional obligations to his or her clients. Thus if a solicitor incurs
liability to the supplier of, for example, a photocopier, insurers do not cover
that liability nor would they cover obligations to a company providing cleaning
services for the solicitor’s offices. If the office premises are leased by the
partnership or held subject to a mortgage to a bank, the obligations under such
lease or mortgage (or any guarantee of such lease or mortgage) would not be covered
either. It is these sort of personal obligations (which may nevertheless be
part of a solicitor’s practice as a solicitor) which are not intended to be
covered. These obligations are to be distinguished from the obligations which
are incurred in connection with the solicitor’s duty to his clients which are
intended to be covered.” (para 19)</p>

<p class="ParaNoNumber">The obligations arising out of the loans made to cover
disbursements in intended litigation were “essentially part and parcel of the
obligations assumed by a solicitor in respect of his professional duties to his
client rather than obligations personal to the solicitor” (para 21), and not
therefore within the scope of the exclusion.</p>

Longmore LJ was wrong to depart from the reasoning of the trial judge. He asked
himself the wrong question. The key question was whether Barrington received
services under the DFMAs, not the nature of their obligations to Impact or to
their clients. He adopted an intuitive approach to what he thought to be the
purpose of the agreement, rather than interpreting and applying the words of
the agreement itself. Mr Cannon points to the following valuable benefits, or
“services”, received by Barrington each time a loan was made to a client:</span></a></p><a name="para52">

party suppliers (ie to persons who were owed money in respect of disbursements
which had already been incurred) (clause 3.1);</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:26.0pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">He emphasises that a solicitor is liable to pay
disbursements whether or not he is put in funds by his client. Part of the

that an exclusion clause is to be construed “strictly” (citing Lewison <i>Interpretation

exclusion clauses, <i>Tektrol Ltd (formerly Atto Power Controls Ltd) v International

Longmore LJ was right to treat the exclusion as directed to liabilities arising
out of contracts in respect of goods or services utilised by Barrington “in the
course of its practice”, that is for the purpose of carrying out legal work for
its client. Typical examples would be contracts for supply of photocopiers or
office cleaning services. The mere fact that Barrington derived a commercial
benefit from the DFMA was not enough to bring it within the exclusion. Of the
three categories identified by Mr Cannon, the first two were funds provided to
the clients not beneficially to Barrington. As Judge Waksman rightly held, this
was not affected by the fact that Barrington was the “conduit” for the money
(para 49). The third, Barrington’s ability to take on the cases, was an incidental
benefit of the DFMAs but not their purpose, and too general to come within the
words of the exclusion.</p>

having “stood back” from the detail of the contract (para 19) he never returned
to the actual words of the exclusion clause. On the other hand, those words
seen in context do in my view support a narrower approach than that taken by

which goods are supplied or used. It is not enough that they are of benefit to
the firm. That view is reinforced by the contrast with the much wider words in

the incidental benefits to Barrington of enabling it to take on cases and so
earn fees, and of protecting it against potential default by its clients. To
that extent perhaps it can be seen, in the judge’s words, as a “facility” for
Barrington, which can loosely be described as a “service”. But that was not the
essential purpose of the contract, nor was it a service comparable in any way
to the supply of goods or services for use in the practice.</span></a></p><a name="para56">

</span><span style="font-size:13.0pt">There is a helpful parallel with <i>Tektrol</i>,<i>
</i>relied on by Mr Dutton, in which the Court of Appeal had to interpret an
exclusion clause referring to “erasure loss distortion or corruption of
information on computer systems … caused deliberately by … malicious persons”.
It was held that the words did not cover loss of a software code as a result of
the theft of the only computer on which it was stored. Although the word “loss”
taken on its own might have been wide enough to cover that event, the context,
and the other words with which it was associated, showed that it was limited to
loss due to interference by electronic means (“noscitur a sociis”: see paras
28-29, per Sir Martin Nourse). In the same way in this clause the juxtaposition
of “goods” and “services”, taken with the references to “supply” and “use” in
the practice, suggests something more specific than a general facility or
benefit such as that identified by the judge.</span></a></p><a name="para57">

</span><i>Whether the liabilities incurred by Barrington to Impact were
different</i> <i>in kind from those incurred to the clients.</i> While the two
are inevitably related, they are in principle separate causes of action. In any
event this issue throw no light on the issue in the appeal which is concerned
with the purpose of the contract, rather than the characterisation of the
liabilities which may arise under it.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:35.45pt;text-indent:0cm">ii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><i>The administration fee.</i> Under clause 2.2, on the signing of a
credit agreement with a client, Barrington was required to pay an
“administration fee” to Impact. This was defined as a fee “by way of remuneration
for the services of (Impact)” (clause 1.1). It was faintly suggested that this
might throw some light on whether the contract was for supply of a service
under the exclusion. This point was not raised in argument below, and the judge
made no findings on it. We were told by Mr Dutton that the administration fee
was, as appears from the context, no more than a fee connected with the
particular service of drawing up of the credit agreements. In any event, it
throws no light on the purpose of the contract as a whole, or whether the
benefits enjoyed under it fell within the words of the exclusion.</p>

</span><i>Comparisons with the treatment of goods and services under VAT law. </i>The
Court of Appeal invited submissions on whether any useful guidance could be
drawn from cases concerning services to third parties under VAT law, (see now
in <i>Airtours Holidays Transport Ltd v Commissioners for Her Majesty’s Revenue
and Customs</i> </a><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2016/21.html">[2016] 4 WLR 87</a>). That seems to me to introduce a further
complication without any countervailing illumination. Longmore LJ was right to
conclude that, given the very different legal context, no assistance could be
gained from that source.</p>
